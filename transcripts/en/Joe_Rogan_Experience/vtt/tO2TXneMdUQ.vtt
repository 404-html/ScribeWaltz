5
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.043
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

7
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>this is the original spot.</v>

8
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>And in the original spot,</v>

9
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.873
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>now known as desk quad.</v>

11
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.080
<v Speaker 1>East east has cats and for some reason Brian has decided that squad west is a</v>

12
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>primate based.</v>

13
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.740
<v Speaker 1>It's all the monkeys and scary thing to.</v>

14
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

15
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>the studio itself definitely has a different feel.</v>

17
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

18
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>with the Werewolf when you walk into the place that's this extraordinary</v>

19
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

20
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.441
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

21
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>It is awesome.</v>

22
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>The coolest thing I've ever bought in my life.</v>

23
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Powerful Pat Mcgee,</v>

24
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>guy from a pat mcgee special effects.</v>

25
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>He makes them.</v>

26
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>You can order one.</v>

27
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I didn't going to order one.</v>

28
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Before you got married,</v>

29
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.250
<v Speaker 1>your house would have at least seven</v>

30
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>different when you live with the chicken man.</v>

31
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>They start moving your shit around and putting pictures of your kids on the</v>

32
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:52.771
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>

33
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>And I used to have champs up all over my house.</v>

34
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.230
<v Speaker 1>If you went over to my house when I was a single mom,</v>

35
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.113
<v Speaker 1>not going to do.</v>

36
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I used to have pictures of champs everywhere in sculptures to weird sculptures</v>

37
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:03.644
<v Speaker 1>or weird shit.</v>

38
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Like literally you would walk around his whole entire house and there'd be a</v>

39
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>monkey or a chimp every five steps or be a different picture.</v>

40
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Really eating a tiger or when chimps.</v>

41
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.681
<v Speaker 1>Eaton Tigers.</v>

42
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>But I got them like how long chasing after.</v>

43
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>How long were you rocking that though?</v>

44
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.481
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

45
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I've been obsessed with chimpanzees since I was a baby.</v>

46
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>So even like a teenager style you were doing?</v>

47
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

48
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I've always been obsessed with apes.</v>

49
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>You just asked with them.</v>

50
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I find them fucking fascinating.</v>

51
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

52
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 1>my production company's name is talking monkey incorporate.</v>

53
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

54
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

55
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I got that was in like 1988 and that was a line I stole from a movie with um,</v>

56
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>the fuck was that dude's name.</v>

57
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name.</v>

58
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

59
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Harman Mark Harmon thing.</v>

60
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>That was his.</v>

61
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>He had a funny movie,</v>

62
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>like a summertime moving carmen.</v>

63
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

64
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>It was like summer school or some shit like that.</v>

65
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>And I'm teaching summer school and he said to guy,</v>

66
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>if you lose one more brain cell,</v>

67
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>you'd be a talking monkey.</v>

68
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.010
<v Speaker 1>And I remember that all the sudden put in my head the idea of a talking Michael,</v>

69
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>like how stupid would a person have to be if we really did evolve?</v>

70
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>How far back would we have to go until we became a talking monkey,</v>

71
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.703
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

73
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>And so that became.</v>

74
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

75
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>

76
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>That was my initial obsession,</v>

77
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>but that's why I named my company talking monkey in corporate.</v>

78
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I can see how an obsession with monkeys.</v>

79
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.260
<v Speaker 1>They're so fascinating,</v>

80
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

81
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>If they didn't exist,</v>

82
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>we would be tripping the fuck out if we.</v>

83
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Speaker 1>If someone showed you have newer no chimpanzees and all of a sudden we found</v>

84
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee somewhere would be like,</v>

85
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>

86
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.341
<v Speaker 1>Look at them.</v>

87
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:41.941
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at you.</v>

88
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:42.774
<v Speaker 1>They're thinking,</v>

89
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.321
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

90
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>they using tools.</v>

91
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck.</v>

92
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:46.471
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

93
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>This is like a window back in time.</v>

94
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>This is like the fucking sensory deprivation tank and altered states.</v>

95
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>We can see our past.</v>

96
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

97
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:55.650
<v Speaker 1>you literally can see your past.</v>

98
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean somehow or another.</v>

99
00:02:57.271 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that evolution scientifically,</v>

100
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.971
<v Speaker 2>behaviorally.</v>

101
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:01.260
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't.</v>

102
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 2>When I talk like this.</v>

103
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>People said,</v>

104
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.981
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

105
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 2>you really don't understand how evolution works.</v>

106
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.651
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

107
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that,</v>

108
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 2>but I think you can reasonably extrapolate that if people exist,</v>

109
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 2>and then there was some early people,</v>

110
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 2>there was like no homo,</v>

111
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.783
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

112
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.990
<v Speaker 2>It was like a bunch of different homos,</v>

113
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Homo ostrow,</v>

114
00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Paleo,</v>

115
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.960
<v Speaker 2>osteopathic,</v>

116
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>this thing Australia pivot that was a,</v>

117
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 2>that one tube or direct ancestors that they believe.</v>

118
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like somehow or another we had to be like more primitive.</v>

119
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like we just started out like,</v>

120
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 2>like close to a human now.</v>

121
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 2>There were some steps along the way you fuck.</v>

122
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.391
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

123
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's not unreasonable to look at chimpanzees and say,</v>

124
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 2>even though that's not our step along the way,</v>

125
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 2>it's from a different branch of the same tree,</v>

126
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 2>the same prime a tree.</v>

127
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I think you can reasonably extrapolate that there's something very similar to</v>

128
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 2>the way they are that we probably were,</v>

129
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 2>at least we can put it together.</v>

131
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Then in a rang of tanks and Bonobos,</v>

132
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 2>we can mix them all together and try to figure out what the fuck we were like.</v>

133
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.760
<v Speaker 2>There's different models that have come along before humans can see class and</v>

134
00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 2>there was an easy class and then there's the s class.</v>

135
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.883
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

136
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

137
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.761
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

138
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Commercials for this podcast.</v>

139
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like doing any commercials.</v>

140
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>This is like a podcast that came out of nowhere.</v>

141
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even see this coming.</v>

142
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.493
<v Speaker 2>Tommy buns.</v>

143
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 2>We put it together last minute,</v>

144
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>so no commercials.</v>

145
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Suck it,</v>

146
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.051

<v Speaker 2>Please move on and let's just get going.</v>

148
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Brian Red Band,</v>

149
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.250
<v Speaker 2>work in the Mick Rock,</v>

150
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 2>rocking the discs,</v>

151
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.473
<v Speaker 2>turning the tape</v>

152
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.483
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

153
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

154
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

155
00:04:40.521 --> 00:04:41.354
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Buns.</v>

156
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Now this podcast,</v>

157
00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:45.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe the first podcast series ever plays.</v>

158
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Will you get the full podcast?</v>

159
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Seriously?</v>

160
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.080
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to edit that because we don't have a commercial in it.</v>

161
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.471
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

162
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:51.980
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

163
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.050
<v Speaker 2>So people don't know is that um,</v>

164
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm financially irresponsible and uh,</v>

165
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

166
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that good at advertising shit.</v>

167
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

168
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.290
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of times when we do our podcast,</v>

169
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:06.470
<v Speaker 2>the advertisements may take as long as 20 minutes because somewhere in the</v>

170
00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:07.304
<v Speaker 2>advertisements,</v>

171
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:05:07.581 --> 00:05:07.881
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

173
00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:10.820
<v Speaker 2>callum might bring up some crazy fucking book that he read and all the sudden</v>

174
00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:15.350
<v Speaker 2>we're on this wild journey or Duncan trussell blows your mind with a certain</v>

175
00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:20.270
<v Speaker 2>thought in the middle of a commercial talking about something and now you're off</v>

176
00:05:20.271 --> 00:05:21.170
<v Speaker 2>on a tangent path.</v>

177
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.890
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of that shit never makes it to Sirius satellite radio.</v>

178
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I even think isn't the show like an hour long to like they just edit it down to</v>

179
00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:29.744
<v Speaker 2>an hour.</v>

180
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

181
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.460
<v Speaker 2>But it's awesome that they put us on there.</v>

182
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

183
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to be on there because it's opie and anthony or my friends and there's</v>

184
00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:36.471
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

185
00:05:36.471 --> 00:05:37.190
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

186
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.480
<v Speaker 2>it's a good group of humans,</v>

187
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.970
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

188
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.711
<v Speaker 2>They're good guys.</v>

189
00:05:39.711 --> 00:05:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Jim Norton is a great guy.</v>

190
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I love being associated with those guys.</v>

191
00:05:43.011 --> 00:05:43.430
<v Speaker 2>You know those,</v>

192
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.150
<v Speaker 2>those guys.</v>

193
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm down for them.</v>

194
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.353
<v Speaker 2>Everybody said my friend.</v>

195
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.181
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a good crew,</v>

196
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:47.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

197
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.231
<v Speaker 2>They're great guys,</v>

198
00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:48.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

199
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.771
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

200
00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Anthony's beautiful human being ops,</v>

201
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.550
<v Speaker 2>a fucking awesome guy.</v>

202
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

203
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Jim Norton is like one of my favorite humans ever,</v>

204
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

205
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 2>so it's like all of them together.</v>

206
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 2>We have some great conversations,</v>

207
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 2>they're not dumb guys by any stretch of the imagination even though I disagree</v>

209
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 2>with some of them ideologically,</v>

210
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes I disagree with Anthony.</v>

211
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 2>He's real strong like right wing Republican,</v>

212
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 2>but he's also,</v>

213
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 2>I believe in a lot of things that he believes in.</v>

214
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit that I believe in,</v>

215
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>especially like the gun control issue,</v>

216
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.150
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

217
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a bit extreme,</v>

218
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

219
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

220
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.210
<v Speaker 2>he's a crazy gun nut and he has guns.</v>

221
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.150
<v Speaker 2>But I honestly believe that when you see the shooting victims and all,</v>

222
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 2>all these different things,</v>

223
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 2>this is not a gun issue.</v>

224
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a mental health issue.</v>

225
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 2>It's the ability to do that.</v>

226
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 2>That should be so alien from our society.</v>

227
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 2>And I liken it to a group of close friends.</v>

228
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.643
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

229
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 2>And this is obviously an exaggeration.</v>

230
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to do when you're talking about giant society of people that</v>

231
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 2>are never going to get to meet each other.</v>

232
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 2>But in a group of close friends like us,</v>

233
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.243
<v Speaker 2>the people in this room,</v>

234
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

235
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 2>let's pretend that we were all on a desert island.</v>

236
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.610
<v Speaker 2>What are the odds that one of us would become a suicide bomber?</v>

237
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 2>Came pretty fucking small,</v>

238
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

239
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.810
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fucking small planes.</v>

240
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Does someone become a suicide bomber?</v>

241
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 2>How does someone become a guide?</v>

242
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Would drop a bomb off at a marathon finishing line.</v>

243
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 2>How does someone do that?</v>

244
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.380
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

245
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.690
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

246
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

247
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck happens to that guy that lets you do that?</v>

248
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Because the reality is that there's a lot of shit that can kill people in this</v>

249
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

250
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 2>including cars and everyone has cars.</v>

251
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 2>And if you want it to kill far more people than this guy did at the marathon,</v>

252
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 2>you could run over people in your car.</v>

253
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 2>The reason he did it this way is because he wanted to not be accountable for it.</v>

254
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 2>He thought he could get away with it.</v>

255
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

256
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.211
<v Speaker 2>If this is the,</v>

257
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:41.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

258
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 2>if you buy the official story,</v>

259
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll Alex Jones.</v>

260
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Have you bought the official story?</v>

261
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen?</v>

262
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>

263
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

264
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:52.220
<v Speaker 2>you look at this guy like who they're claiming this guy is,</v>

265
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>

266
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:52.931
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

267
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 2>the older brother,</v>

268
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 2>they think he might've committed three murders as well.</v>

269
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Three murderers out there.</v>

270
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:59.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

271
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:00.560
<v Speaker 2>There was one night,</v>

272
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 2>three people were murdered and one of them was a close friend and training</v>

273
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:09.251
<v Speaker 2>partner of this guy and the body's cash was left there and the bodies were</v>

274
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:10.910
<v Speaker 2>covered with marijuana.</v>

275
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

276
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 2>And this guy was very religious apparently,</v>

277
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:15.074
<v Speaker 2>and become,</v>

278
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 2>he'd become more and more religious in the past few years now again,</v>

279
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 2>settled down tinfoil people.</v>

280
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.371
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

281
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:24.020
<v Speaker 2>if you buy the official story,</v>

282
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck this dude was,</v>

283
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

284
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

285
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm just reading what I'm getting out of.</v>

286
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:29.961
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

287
00:08:29.961 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 2>essentially almost all news sources seem to be agreeing with,</v>

288
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 2>with these stories that this guy was like super religious.</v>

289
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:37.891
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

290
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 2>he went,</v>

291
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.580
<v Speaker 2>he got kind of radicalized that a couple of years ago.</v>

292
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 2>He went back to to rush us for six months.</v>

293
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Say That's when he,</v>

294
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Speaker 2>he came back and radicalize,</v>

295
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:47.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

296
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 2>that's again,</v>

297
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.610
<v Speaker 2>that's the official story.</v>

298
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 2>Jones will tell you it was a false flag event.</v>

299
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Tommy,</v>

300
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing it or trying to take away your guns were supposedly he</v>

301
00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 2>listened to Alex Jones.</v>

302
00:08:58.561 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 2>He was a fan of infohort</v>

303
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 2>when maybe he was a fan of infant wars.</v>

304
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 2>The way I'm a fan of Sean Hannity,</v>

305
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 2>like I'll listen just because it's fucking hilarity.</v>

306
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 2>It's funny to watch people twist the narrative like that.</v>

307
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:15.580
<v Speaker 2>It's funny to watch people that are just so blatantly right wing that they'll</v>

308
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 2>never admit anyone on the left has any idea.</v>

309
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.580
<v Speaker 2>It's always any even compliment is said with a smirk that soon to follow some</v>

310
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 2>disparaging remark about who they are.</v>

311
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 2>It's never like Obama's a brilliant man or even if it's even if it's an idea</v>

312
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:35.140
<v Speaker 2>that they were behind it,</v>

313
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 2>there's still a spin on it,</v>

314
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 2>so it's a.</v>

315
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking game.</v>

316
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 2>They're in a team and they strategize to get that team to win and they do it</v>

317
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:44.101
<v Speaker 2>within the rules,</v>

318
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 2>but they know they're full of shit.</v>

319
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Like as they're doing it,</v>

320
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 2>you can hear their voice.</v>

321
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 2>They know they're full of Shit,</v>

322
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 2>but the game is so screwy.</v>

323
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those games that doesn't make any sense like baseball.</v>

324
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck do they dress like that?</v>

325
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Look how you're dressed.</v>

326
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Look at what those stupid fucking tights and what is that outfit?</v>

327
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:03.211
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

328
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Those signs,</v>

329
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.280
<v Speaker 2>they've always dressed like that.</v>

330
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Goddammit.</v>

331
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.623
<v Speaker 2>They're stuck.</v>

332
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 2>They're stuck with a stupid outfit back from when people didn't have newspapers.</v>

333
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.080
<v Speaker 2>That's when they made that dumb ass outfit.</v>

334
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 2>That outfit's retarded.</v>

335
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.111
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

336
00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

337
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

338
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid as fuck.</v>

339
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 2>It puts me in the tiers to watch that game</v>

340
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.471
<v Speaker 2>while it's fun.</v>

341
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:23.304
<v Speaker 2>Game to play.</v>

342
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.163
<v Speaker 2>But sure,</v>

343
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 2>the butt getting stuck in that old shit like that.</v>

344
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason why politicians are,</v>

345
00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:31.950
<v Speaker 2>are able to get away with the way they communicate.</v>

346
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:32.491
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

347
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:37.491
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine being a person who is into politics like really into it and</v>

348
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

349
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

350
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.480
<v Speaker 2>not be cynical and be like,</v>

351
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:44.490
<v Speaker 2>it's so disheartening to follow politics.</v>

352
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:44.971
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

353
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:45.660
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

354
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 2>it absolutely kills the soul.</v>

355
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>

356
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

357
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I recognize it as.</v>

358
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I would kinda come an older man.</v>

359
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I recognize it for what it is.</v>

360
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 2>It's an act.</v>

361
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

362
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

363
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.930
<v Speaker 2>and you know why I know because I do an act two,</v>

364
00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 2>I know what an act is like.</v>

365
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 2>I know when I'm doing standup,</v>

366
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:01.764
<v Speaker 2>when I stand up,</v>

367
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

368
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:03.541
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

369
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 2>if I want to do my best,</v>

370
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 2>what I do is I ad libbed quite a bit,</v>

371
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 2>but I also have some key components that I have broken down into pretty specific</v>

372
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:13.884
<v Speaker 2>ways of saying it,</v>

373
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

374
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the best way that it has the most response,</v>

375
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.030
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to tell jokes.</v>

376
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.240
<v Speaker 2>When you hear a person give a speech and they have that weird sorta artificial</v>

377
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:26.790
<v Speaker 2>quality to the way they're talking,</v>

378
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 2>we should reject that.</v>

379
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.573
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

380
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree.</v>

381
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't let them do that.</v>

382
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

383
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Speaker 2>We should be like,</v>

384
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.380
<v Speaker 2>just talk.</v>

385
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Talk like a normal person.</v>

386
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

387
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.500
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing about the budget,</v>

388
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

389
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:43.140
<v Speaker 2>and have the budget yet an important priority of this administration.</v>

390
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.620
<v Speaker 2>It's something we think about every day.</v>

391
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

392
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.550
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you?</v>

393
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.630
<v Speaker 2>What you guy was talking to you like that?</v>

394
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:52.380

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.830
<v Speaker 4>asshole.</v>

398
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.700
<v Speaker 4>You know who else does that,</v>

399
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 4>that exact speech.</v>

400
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 4>Do that,</v>

401
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 4>that type of language comes from corporate world.</v>

402
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.503
<v Speaker 4>If you were like,</v>

403
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 4>if you talked to a guy and you're like,</v>

404
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 4>I had a bad experience at your offices,</v>

405
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.823
<v Speaker 4>he'd be like,</v>

406
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

407
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 4>every time a customer comes into one of our establishments,</v>

408
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:11.171
<v Speaker 4>they want that.</v>

409
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 4>We want them to have opportunity.</v>

410
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 4>We want them to have choices and what you'd be like,</v>

411
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

412
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.333
<v Speaker 4>That's corporate.</v>

413
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.940
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not how humans stop.</v>

414
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:21.581
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

415
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 4>But you can hear the training video.</v>

416
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 4>You get that sometimes when you go now when they go,</v>

417
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 4>do you want to sign up for the um,</v>

418
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 4>the special extra warranty?</v>

419
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 4>You Go,</v>

420
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:30.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

421
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>

422
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:31.721
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

423
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:32.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

424
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.390
<v Speaker 4>when I had my computer a couple of years ago,</v>

425
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.000
<v Speaker 4>I knocked a bottle of coke over.</v>

426
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.110
<v Speaker 4>I love coke.</v>

427
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 4>And it left the thing.</v>

428
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 4>And because of the warranty,</v>

429
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 4>they took care of it and you're like,</v>

430
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:45.630
<v Speaker 4>that's a training speech.</v>

431
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 4>They tell you to make a personal story up and you're like,</v>

432
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:51.030
<v Speaker 4>I know you're saying that to me right now.</v>

433
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 4>So know that feelings when someone's lying to you,</v>

434
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 4>that when you're looking at them,</v>

435
00:12:56.861 --> 00:13:00.450
<v Speaker 4>when they're just straight bullshitting you and they won't even look in the eye</v>

<v Speaker 4>and I took this money that I got from this investment into in mines and I bought</v>

582
00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:12.730
<v Speaker 4>this company that takes hot air balloons up in the air,</v>

583
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.670

589
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.810
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just story after story.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And I'm like.</v>

592
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.490
<v Speaker 4>And then I start Kinda like I don't know what to believe.</v>

593
00:16:24.491 --> 00:16:28.420
<v Speaker 4>And then part of it's fun to believe and I start to think for a second I'll stop</v>

594
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:28.870
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>

595

<v Speaker 4>are you an improvisational like genius or you like a,</v>

596
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.700
<v Speaker 4>like a brilliant Improv guy right now.</v>

597
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.780
<v Speaker 4>Is that what's going on?</v>

598
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.270
<v Speaker 4>Am I getting like played or something?</v>

599
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.110
<v Speaker 4>Pumped.</v>

600
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.880
<v Speaker 4>And then.</v>

601
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.690
<v Speaker 4>But then there's something you see in the eyes where you're like,</v>

602
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:41.351
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

603
00:16:41.351 --> 00:16:41.581
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

604
00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:43.060
<v Speaker 4>I really think there's,</v>

605
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:43.690
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

606
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:44.230
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm,</v>

607
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:49.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to somebody who has a form of mental illness and I'm not,</v>

608
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:50.650
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

609
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.401
<v Speaker 4>it's not the type.</v>

610
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:52.360
<v Speaker 4>What makes you go like,</v>

611
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.650
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

612
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.040
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

613
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.470
<v Speaker 4>like maybe more scare or maybe like sillier.</v>

614
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.550
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not you.</v>

615
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.910
<v Speaker 4>He has all the intelligence and you can talk about like what should we eat now</v>

616
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:06.030
<v Speaker 4>and you have a normal conversation about that and then it goes off into like 10</v>

617
00:17:06.071 --> 00:17:07.150
<v Speaker 4>different storylines.</v>

618
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.220
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like it's his fault.</v>

619
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

620
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.300
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

621
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.140
<v Speaker 4>It's not at that point.</v>

622
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.441
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

623
00:17:11.441 --> 00:17:12.274
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

624
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how your brain works,</v>

625
00:17:13.831 --> 00:17:14.310
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

626
00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.143
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

627
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:15.931
<v Speaker 2>what don't I,</v>

628
00:17:15.931 --> 00:17:16.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing.</v>

629
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.420
<v Speaker 2>I always guess when people act like,</v>

630
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.650
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck did you do that?</v>

631
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Like I have to like stop myself sometimes and go,</v>

632
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how his brain works.</v>

633
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.770
<v Speaker 2>My brain would process the same scenario in a different way,</v>

634
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.890
<v Speaker 2>but maybe his brain would handle some shit.</v>

635
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.341
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

636
00:17:32.341 --> 00:17:33.900
<v Speaker 2>that I can handle very well.</v>

637
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

638
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:34.951
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

639
00:17:34.951 --> 00:17:35.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you think,</v>

640
00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.940
<v Speaker 2>but I know when I see someone who's just not,</v>

641
00:17:38.941 --> 00:17:39.530
<v Speaker 2>we're not.</v>

642
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a missing connection there.</v>

643
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like this guy's like,</v>

644
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.550
<v Speaker 2>he's missing a whole piece.</v>

645
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on here?</v>

646
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you can see it from the moment,</v>

647
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.361
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

648
00:17:48.361 --> 00:17:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some who.</v>

649
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

650
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.940
<v Speaker 1>At the moment you're like,</v>

651
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's scarier when you have long,</v>

652
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:56.360
<v Speaker 1>normal conversations before that.</v>

653
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Then you're like,</v>

654
00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

655
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Like has this been there the whole time?</v>

656
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

658
00:18:00.891 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to people and then like 20 minutes into the conversation you realize</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's dangerous.</v>

688
00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Those are just silly people for the most part.</v>

689
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.390
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucked up.</v>

690
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that with almost with a super negative people,</v>

691
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.260
<v Speaker 1>the people that it's not good for you to be around.</v>

692
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>You pick up on additional vibes from,</v>

693
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

694
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.320
<v Speaker 1>like just being around them.</v>

695
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

696
00:18:58.531 --> 00:18:59.191
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what it is,</v>

697
00:18:59.191 --> 00:18:59.371
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

698
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:00.204
<v Speaker 1>It's the smell.</v>

699
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they give off heat,</v>

700
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.120
<v Speaker 1>but if they leave,</v>

701
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.450
<v Speaker 1>like if you're just meeting them and they leave the room and like,</v>

702
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:09.150
<v Speaker 1>let's say you just brought somebody in right when they leave,</v>

703
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.110
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

704
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.930
<v Speaker 1>feel bums off with.</v>

705
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:11.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

706
00:19:11.091 --> 00:19:11.341
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

707
00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:12.180
<v Speaker 1>something's off with that guy.</v>

708
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

709
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.010
<v Speaker 1>She said their eyes for me because I always look in the eyes for a second.</v>

710
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 1>You can see like the worriness or that friendliness sometimes.</v>

711
00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

712
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Or sometimes they just smell crazy.</v>

713
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I remember Brian Cowen had this chick wants and he brought her over and I mean,</v>

714
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:34.320
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not bullshitting within three seconds of meeting her,</v>

715
00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:35.370

00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:52.741
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

739
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:53.071
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:55.230
<v Speaker 1>that girl is fucking crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You knew fast.</v>

746
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I locked eyes with her and it wasn't a nervousness.</v>

747
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.210
<v Speaker 1>People get nervous if they see people that have been on television sometimes.</v>

748
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

749
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.130
<v Speaker 1>but that goes away pretty quick.</v>

750
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Once you start talking,</v>

751
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 1>usually they're weirded out,</v>

752
00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:12.750
<v Speaker 1>but you can see what the weirded out was.</v>

753
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.510
<v Speaker 1>This was like black.</v>

754
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.970
<v Speaker 1>This was a like,</v>

755
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 1>like a crazy person just like.</v>

756
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:19.591
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

757
00:20:19.591 --> 00:20:20.210
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

758
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Callen?</v>

759
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Like she wasn't bad looking.</v>

760
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 1>She's very attractive young lady,</v>

761
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:28.820
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately there was something wrong with her mind and years later Brian</v>

762
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:35.150
<v Speaker 1>was going into a bar and he ran into her and she was a streetwalker wow.</v>

763
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Couple of years later,</v>

764
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:38.821
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

765
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:43.440
<v Speaker 1>it turned out she was cranked out on math and while he was,</v>

766
00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

767
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.150
<v Speaker 1>mildly sweater,</v>

768
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 1>she's doing meth and it them awhile to figure it out,</v>

769
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 1>like exactly what the fuck was wrong with her.</v>

770
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:51.490
<v Speaker 1>And he tried to fix her.</v>

771
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.211
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

772
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:54.070
<v Speaker 1>He was doing that and then he gave up on that.</v>

773
00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:58.370
<v Speaker 1>And then he runs into her and he's going to a bar and she's a streetwalker move.</v>

774
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.720
<v Speaker 5>He probably cut out the part where he slept with her again.</v>

775
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.053
<v Speaker 6>This one</v>

776
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 6>he did one last time recently.</v>

777
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.853
<v Speaker 6>These scabs.</v>

778
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.920
<v Speaker 6>When's your last checkup?</v>

779
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to use a condom or not you.</v>

780
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.580
<v Speaker 1>You're special to me.</v>

781
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.480
<v Speaker 1>You always use condoms?</v>

782
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>

870
00:23:34.461 --> 00:23:36.080
<v Speaker 5>when we were talking about driving on the highway,</v>

871
00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:40.040
<v Speaker 5>that's actually a condition like highway hypnotism where you just get hypnotized</v>

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 7>What do you think those didn't they just.</v>

1019
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.130
<v Speaker 7>We had this discussion on your show a year and a half ago,</v>

1020
00:28:23.131 --> 00:28:27.300
<v Speaker 7>but in the bronx they found a rat that was just amazing.</v>

1021
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:28.470
<v Speaker 7>Like it broke all records.</v>

1022
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:31.410
<v Speaker 7>The length of it is a type,</v>

1023
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.120
<v Speaker 7>I think it's called the Zambian.</v>

1024
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.660
<v Speaker 7>Are you being something wrapped?</v>

1025
00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:35.880
<v Speaker 7>So I'm from America.</v>

1026
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:36.600
<v Speaker 7>It's a pet.</v>

1027
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:36.821
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1028
00:28:36.821 --> 00:28:37.610
<v Speaker 7>how about.</v>

1029
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:40.050
<v Speaker 7>And they've let so many people have let these things go.</v>

1030
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.660
<v Speaker 7>And like how Florida has the python problem,</v>

1031
00:28:42.661 --> 00:28:44.070
<v Speaker 7>they have this rat problem.</v>

1032
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.600
<v Speaker 7>It's an invasive species.</v>

1033
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:46.920
<v Speaker 8>We let go of one of those.</v>

1034
00:28:46.921 --> 00:28:49.110
<v Speaker 8>Pythons in college were part of that.</v>

1035
00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:50.840
<v Speaker 8>Laura,</v>

1036

1045
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:07.680
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

1046
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.860
<v Speaker 8>and it's just in our house and as well.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Wait a minute,</v>

1058
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.690
<v Speaker 8>Body cheese had a python.</v>

<v Speaker 8>We briefed his brakes on but he didn't go and then two weeks later we go and we</v>

1066
00:29:35.091 --> 00:29:35.361

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 8>Let her show you.</v>

1075
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 8>Not totally responsible for it.</v>

1076
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:51.640
<v Speaker 8>Somebody else let the snake out.</v>

1077
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1078
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.773
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

1079
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 8>Did you ever Diaz as.</v>

1080
00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:55.180
<v Speaker 8>Did you ever see a banana?</v>

1081
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.650
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

1082
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:56.021
<v Speaker 8>How do you know?</v>

1083
00:29:56.021 --> 00:29:57.160
<v Speaker 8>They didn't just steal a snake.</v>

1084
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.460
<v Speaker 8>A [inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

1085
00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 8>She was like,</v>

1086
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.550
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if it's been in there or not.</v>

1087
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 8>The fucking lid was open.</v>

1088
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:02.321
<v Speaker 8>They looked for it.</v>

1089
00:30:02.321 --> 00:30:03.010
<v Speaker 8>That I don't know.</v>

1090
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.860
<v Speaker 8>It probably in the last assholes are allowed to buy snakes.</v>

1091
00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.160
<v Speaker 8>Any asshole like this anywhere.</v>

1092
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.420
<v Speaker 8>Responsible Savannah monitors.</v>

1093
00:30:10.421 --> 00:30:11.470
<v Speaker 8>I was into reptiles.</v>

1094
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:12.300
<v Speaker 8>Big Ticket.</v>

1095
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.400
<v Speaker 8>You got a pit bull and I think that they should give you by a pit bull.</v>

1096
00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:16.600
<v Speaker 8>You need to take a ged.</v>

1097
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.470
<v Speaker 8>That's a particular shift with they when they should definitely,</v>

1098
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:26.870
<v Speaker 8>definitely make you answer questions and they're dangerous animals.</v>

1099
00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:29.440
<v Speaker 8>I'll go a step further and saddle think single women in their 30,</v>

1100
00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:30.730
<v Speaker 8>she'd be allowed to adopt dogs.</v>

1101
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:31.660
<v Speaker 8>Why do you say that?</v>

1102
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 8>Because they have fucked up their life now.</v>

1103
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:35.410
<v Speaker 8>Let's stop it there.</v>

1104
00:30:35.411 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 8>Let's cut it off there and not let them to.</v>

1105
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.453
<v Speaker 8>Have you ever seen up.</v>

1106
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.760
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

1107
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.061
<v Speaker 8>this is.</v>

1108
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:41.540
<v Speaker 8>I'm taking a stretch and I know what I'm saying.</v>

1109
00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:42.730
<v Speaker 8>So I'm seeing a woman in the thirties,</v>

1110
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:44.021
<v Speaker 8>mid thirties,</v>

1111
00:30:44.021 --> 00:30:44.960
<v Speaker 8>like 35 when the.</v>

1112
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.461
<v Speaker 8>When they go,</v>

1113
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:46.294
<v Speaker 8>that's it.</v>

1114
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.010
<v Speaker 8>I'm comfortable with being single.</v>

1115
00:30:48.011 --> 00:30:51.460
<v Speaker 8>Now I'm going to get a rescue dog and then you go hiking and that dog goes after</v>

1116
00:30:51.461 --> 00:30:52.760
<v Speaker 8>your kids because they don't.</v>

1117
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 8>Are you sure that they're really comfortable with being single and it's probably</v>

1118
00:30:57.311 --> 00:30:58.810
<v Speaker 8>hard to find a good dude man.</v>

1119
00:30:59.080 --> 00:30:59.310
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1120
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.970
<v Speaker 8>but you never had those women that get the big dogs and they're like,</v>

1121
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.270
<v Speaker 8>it's a rescue dog.</v>

1122
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.500
<v Speaker 8>This is my new project.</v>

1123
00:31:05.501 --> 00:31:06.550
<v Speaker 8>They want some love.</v>

1124
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:06.890
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1125
00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:07.930
<v Speaker 8>And exactly.</v>

1126
00:31:07.931 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 8>And then they don't fucking discipline it and they just let it go from fucking</v>

1127
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:12.124
<v Speaker 8>bananas,</v>

1128
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:13.780
<v Speaker 8>psycho fucking dog.</v>

1129
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.540
<v Speaker 8>The</v>

1130
00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.620
<v Speaker 2>dogs get really protective of their owners and if they sense that their owner</v>

1131
00:31:18.621 --> 00:31:19.640
<v Speaker 2>might not be like,</v>

1132
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:20.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1133
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.383
<v Speaker 2>very dominant.</v>

1134
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1135
00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.580
<v Speaker 2>If it's maybe it doesn't have deep voice,</v>

1136
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.260
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1137
00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.050
<v Speaker 2>The dog might be extra protective.</v>

1138
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Was your pit bull dangerous?</v>

1139
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I had a pit bull encounters or one dog killed one of my other dogs.</v>

1143
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1144
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I came home in the middle of my living room,</v>

1145
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.980
<v Speaker 2>one of my females that killed my other female.</v>

1146
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1147
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:41.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:31:41.511 --> 00:31:43.280
<v Speaker 2>You can have two female dogs together.</v>

1149
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Female dogs apparently will always fight over dominance.</v>

1150
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Whereas a male and a female,</v>

1151
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.310
<v Speaker 2>they accept like who's who's the boss?</v>

1152
00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Usually the male just lets the female,</v>

1153
00:31:54.721 --> 00:31:55.280
<v Speaker 2>like fap,</v>

1154
00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.210
<v Speaker 2>she's leave me alone.</v>

1155
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Like female staffers,</v>

1156
00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.630
<v Speaker 2>jaws in the mail like sort of gives up.</v>

1157
00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.930
<v Speaker 2>But the females never give up.</v>

1158
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.490
<v Speaker 2>They never give up the position.</v>

1159
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.990
<v Speaker 2>They'll fight to the death.</v>

1160
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:10.040
<v Speaker 2>They fight and then they give up and they figure out like who wins and who</v>

1161
00:32:10.041 --> 00:32:10.640
<v Speaker 2>loses.</v>

1162
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.473
<v Speaker 2>But then the challenge,</v>

1163
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:12.381
<v Speaker 2>the one who lost,</v>

1164
00:32:12.381 --> 00:32:16.270
<v Speaker 2>wants to go back out again and they did it a couple of times and I thought I'd</v>

1165
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:17.450
<v Speaker 2>gotten them over it.</v>

1166
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:18.590
<v Speaker 2>I separated,</v>

1167
00:32:18.591 --> 00:32:18.891
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1168
00:32:18.891 --> 00:32:21.260
<v Speaker 2>and I did all sorts of different things and then I started letting them be</v>

1169
00:32:21.261 --> 00:32:24.680
<v Speaker 2>together again because I thought they would had gotten over it because I felt</v>

1170
00:32:24.681 --> 00:32:27.560
<v Speaker 2>like maybe it was just some like animosity,</v>

1171
00:32:27.561 --> 00:32:29.210
<v Speaker 2>like it was too fresh on each other's mind.</v>

1172
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:30.320
<v Speaker 2>They had gotten into a fight,</v>

1173
00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's so normal for that breed to get into fights,</v>

1174
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:34.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1175
00:32:34.371 --> 00:32:36.260
<v Speaker 2>they're beautiful dogs with humans.</v>

1176
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:37.700
<v Speaker 2>They're beautiful dogs with humans.</v>

1177
00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Speaker 2>But with people with rather,</v>

1178
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:42.080
<v Speaker 2>they have just this incredible killed drive.</v>

1179
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like nothing I've ever seen.</v>

1180
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Speaker 2>My dog killed two cats.</v>

1181
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1182
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 2>he killed squirrels.</v>

1183
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.750
<v Speaker 2>He killed anything dumb enough to get in his yard and he would kill lizards all</v>

1184
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1185
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Like we had these lizards that would run around and he,</v>

1186
00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 2>that was his video game.</v>

1187
00:32:56.481 --> 00:32:58.850
<v Speaker 2>He would just run around with his paws on the wall,</v>

1188
00:32:58.851 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 2>trying to get these lizards just running around the perimeter of my house trying</v>

1189
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:02.894
<v Speaker 2>to get lizards.</v>

1190
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:03.651
<v Speaker 2>In hindsight,</v>

1191
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:04.550
<v Speaker 2>I look back and I'm like,</v>

1192
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:05.870
<v Speaker 2>what a crazy animal to have.</v>

1193
00:33:05.871 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 2>You've got a monster.</v>

1194
00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:07.920
<v Speaker 2>You got to monster.</v>

1195
00:33:07.921 --> 00:33:09.110
<v Speaker 2>It loves to attack things.</v>

1196
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.441
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1197
00:33:09.441 --> 00:33:11.360
<v Speaker 2>but he was a very particular type of dog.</v>

1198
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:11.670
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1199
00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:12.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1200
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.610
<v Speaker 2>a hog dog.</v>

1201
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:15.100
<v Speaker 2>The origin from the Argentinian?</v>

1202
00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1203
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:15.740
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1204
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.573
<v Speaker 2>He was a pit bull.</v>

1205
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1206
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.493
<v Speaker 2>he was from Hawaii.</v>

1207
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.420
<v Speaker 2>It was from Hawaii and they're there.</v>

1208
00:33:20.421 --> 00:33:24.590
<v Speaker 2>They breed them to be super animal aggressive because they're breeding them for</v>

1209
00:33:24.591 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 2>hog hunting and so they all,</v>

1210
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.050
<v Speaker 2>they have longer ears and the ears pick up more of a scent and they're larger</v>

1211
00:33:30.051 --> 00:33:30.740
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>

1212
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.573
<v Speaker 2>He was crazy.</v>

1213
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.750
<v Speaker 2>He was beautiful dog though.</v>

1214
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.660
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome with people with people who the greatest thing ever.</v>

1215
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:36.523
<v Speaker 2>He was awesome.</v>

1216
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 2>He was just amazing buddy.</v>

1217
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.410
<v Speaker 2>He was like super smart.</v>

1218
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.840
<v Speaker 2>He always wanted to hang with you.</v>

1219
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.350
<v Speaker 2>You always be down to wrestle.</v>

1220
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Like I never felt in danger to do Jujitsu with him.</v>

1221
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I take us back,</v>

1222
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1223
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I'd go tell him to put the choker and they'd be like,</v>

1224
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.560
<v Speaker 2>he lady who to kiss me a buddha.</v>

1225
00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Have you do like,</v>

1226
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I would be like choking him and he would kiss me.</v>

1227
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.610
<v Speaker 2>He was a sweet,</v>

1228
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:56.391
<v Speaker 2>sweet,</v>

1229
00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:57.620
<v Speaker 2>sweet dog with people,</v>

1230
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.030
<v Speaker 2>but with animals to another who's not to be trusted,</v>

1231
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.180
<v Speaker 2>who was not to be trusted.</v>

1232
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:03.230
<v Speaker 2>It was the craziest thing.</v>

1233
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:03.920
<v Speaker 2>It didn't.</v>

1234
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.200
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have anything to do with socializing.</v>

1235
00:34:06.201 --> 00:34:09.470
<v Speaker 2>I socialize them with other dogs like right away he started fighting with other</v>

1236
00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:09.810
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>

1237
00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:10.191
<v Speaker 2>What time?</v>

1238
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:10.851
<v Speaker 2>He was a baby.</v>

1239
00:34:10.851 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Speaker 2>They got,</v>

1240
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

1241
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.290
<v Speaker 2>People yelled at me at a dog park when he was a baby.</v>

1242
00:34:14.291 --> 00:34:15.350
<v Speaker 2>It was like four months old.</v>

1243
00:34:15.351 --> 00:34:17.000
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to bite other dogs.</v>

1244
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:22.490
<v Speaker 2>He was just gangster like from the womb and I was a fool to try to control this</v>

1245
00:34:22.491 --> 00:34:23.510
<v Speaker 2>animal is in pet,</v>

1246
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:24.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1247
00:34:24.071 --> 00:34:25.100
<v Speaker 2>like my dog now.</v>

1248
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:25.761
<v Speaker 2>The big one,</v>

1249
00:34:25.761 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Johnny.</v>

1250
00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:28.580
<v Speaker 2>He's the sweetest dog ever.</v>

1251
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.990
<v Speaker 2>He's a sweetie.</v>

1252
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Like my other dog.</v>

1253
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a much smaller dog that she believed.</v>

1254
00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:34.310
<v Speaker 2>New bulldog mix.</v>

1255
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 2>That dog tells him what's up.</v>

1256
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:36.861
<v Speaker 2>And Johnny goes,</v>

1257
00:34:36.861 --> 00:34:37.201
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1258
00:34:37.201 --> 00:34:37.581
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

1259
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:38.840
<v Speaker 2>He's just like relaxed.</v>

1260
00:34:38.841 --> 00:34:39.231
<v Speaker 2>We lag.</v>

1261
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Just lets it all go by.</v>

1262
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:41.743
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1263
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:42.650
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's it?</v>

1264
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:43.371
<v Speaker 2>They're born with it though,</v>

1265
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:45.400
<v Speaker 2>is just like people how their bread is buttered.</v>

1266
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Bread.</v>

1267
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:45.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1268
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:48.500
<v Speaker 2>They encourage a certain type of animal aggression,</v>

1269
00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.850
<v Speaker 2>aggression towards animals.</v>

1270
00:34:49.851 --> 00:34:50.510
<v Speaker 2>They encourage it.</v>

1271
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 2>They encouraged fighting and it's been that way for thousands of years and it's</v>

1272
00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:59.380
<v Speaker 2>the cruel aspect of the dog fighting though is what makes amazing dogs because</v>

1273
00:35:00.201 --> 00:35:02.750
<v Speaker 2>the ones that survived through that horrible ordeal,</v>

1274
00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:07.580
<v Speaker 2>that genetics that were passed on because the dog that quit and the dogs that</v>

1275
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:11.120
<v Speaker 2>are cowed and backed away from a fight were killed.</v>

1276
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.290
<v Speaker 2>They were all killed.</v>

1277
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.140
<v Speaker 2>That sounds horrible to us because we love our dogs.</v>

1278
00:35:15.141 --> 00:35:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1279
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.350
<v Speaker 2>But they weren't looking at dogs like that.</v>

1280
00:35:18.351 --> 00:35:21.230
<v Speaker 2>They were looking at dogs as a way to make money and the way to make money.</v>

1281
00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1282
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:26.510
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about like this probably went on from maybe the turn of the</v>

1283
00:35:26.511 --> 00:35:27.200
<v Speaker 2>century on.</v>

1284
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably something that's been going on even before that.</v>

1285
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:31.520
<v Speaker 2>If you could really get into the history of it,</v>

1286
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:32.510
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>

1287
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.940
<v Speaker 2>They bred dogs specifically for fighting.</v>

1288
00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.980
<v Speaker 2>They bred them specifically for that.</v>

1289
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Had them on chains.</v>

1290
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.970
<v Speaker 2>They would put them.</v>

1291
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a dude that I know that was a famous pool player used to keep 35 pit</v>

1292
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:43.180
<v Speaker 2>bulls.</v>

1293
00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.490
<v Speaker 2>It was this pro pool player,</v>

1294
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 2>35 pit bulls at his house.</v>

1295
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:46.980
<v Speaker 2>They weren't as pets.</v>

1296
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.420
<v Speaker 2>They were fighting dogs.</v>

1297
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Crazy man.</v>

1298
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:50.041
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

1299
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1300
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.241
<v Speaker 2>craziness,</v>

1301
00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:51.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1302
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 2>I think big boi from outkast used to do that too.</v>

1303
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1304
00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a big part of the culture.</v>

1305
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.410
<v Speaker 2>He bred those dogs and he read the,</v>

1306
00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:58.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1307
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:01.170
<v Speaker 2>the bully ones that are stocky.</v>

1308
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:01.810
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1309
00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.250
<v Speaker 2>he never went to his website and looked at him.</v>

1310
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:05.103
<v Speaker 2>They're expensive.</v>

1311
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1312
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:06.810
<v Speaker 2>big boys website.</v>

1313
00:36:06.811 --> 00:36:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1314
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:07.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1315
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Well it's purple ribbon in the,</v>

1316
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.860
<v Speaker 2>in the world of fighting dogs.</v>

1317
00:36:10.861 --> 00:36:12.990
<v Speaker 2>This is where it gets really squirrely because it's not like I'm trying to</v>

1318
00:36:12.991 --> 00:36:14.160
<v Speaker 2>glorify this world,</v>

1319
00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:14.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1320
00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:15.320
<v Speaker 2>and get,</v>

1321
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.010
<v Speaker 2>give it morals or anything like that.</v>

1322
00:36:17.011 --> 00:36:19.170
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is in the fighting dog world,</v>

1323
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.300
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to sell the puppies.</v>

1324
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.090
<v Speaker 2>They're called puppy peddlers and they're looked down upon.</v>

1325
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.720
<v Speaker 2>You're only supposed to let your dog breed with,</v>

1326
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.500
<v Speaker 2>with really respectable breed.</v>

1327
00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:32.220
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to make some crazy killer dog and men will loan out their dog</v>

1328
00:36:32.221 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 2>and like you see like the lineage written down like you know,</v>

1329
00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:36.750
<v Speaker 2>rough riders,</v>

1330
00:36:36.751 --> 00:36:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Bronco and subtle stables,</v>

1331
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Sheila e dot,</v>

1332
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:42.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1333
00:36:42.151 --> 00:36:43.710
<v Speaker 2>and that's the dog's precedent.</v>

1334
00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:46.240
<v Speaker 2>And they all know the championship bloodlines.</v>

1335
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.870
<v Speaker 2>That's totally illegal to have dog fighting.</v>

1336
00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:51.150
<v Speaker 2>But the shit has been documented.</v>

1337
00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like very thoroughly.</v>

1338
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.450
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing with chicken fighting.</v>

1339
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Like they have champion chickens.</v>

1340
00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Like I know a dude who raises chickens and he fights them,</v>

1341
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1342
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:01.830
<v Speaker 2>there's this old Mexican dude,</v>

1343
00:37:01.831 --> 00:37:02.790
<v Speaker 2>he's cool as fuck,</v>

1344
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:03.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1345
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:03.750
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1346
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 2>but that's his culture man.</v>

1347
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:10.320
<v Speaker 2>He grew up fighting chickens and this guy knows like championship bloodlines and</v>

1348
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:12.930
<v Speaker 2>they breed the right chickens with the right hands.</v>

1349
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Like it's been a part of human history forever,</v>

1350
00:37:16.891 --> 00:37:17.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1351
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.310
<v Speaker 2>it's like in the shadows and the darkness of our,</v>

1352
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:21.121
<v Speaker 2>of our world.</v>

1353
00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:23.540
<v Speaker 2>And we don't want to admit that in 2000,</v>

1354
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.151
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>

1355
00:37:24.151 --> 00:37:25.200
<v Speaker 2>nine or whenever,</v>

1356
00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:25.440
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1357
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.273
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1358
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:27.890
<v Speaker 2>when he got busted me.</v>

1359
00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:28.140
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1360
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:28.380
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1361
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.190
<v Speaker 2>what year was that?</v>

1362
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.791
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand nine.</v>

1363
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe eight or nine.</v>

1364
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1365
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.230
<v Speaker 2>It was some time in jail.</v>

1366
00:37:34.231 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1367
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:39.150
<v Speaker 2>We never want to think that a guy who's capable of such great heights is being</v>

1368
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:43.950
<v Speaker 2>like this massively successful football player could also be capable of such an</v>

1369
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.873
<v Speaker 2>insane crew.</v>

1370
00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:45.830
<v Speaker 4>So insane.</v>

1371
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:46.431
<v Speaker 4>I got to tell you,</v>

1372
00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:47.660
<v Speaker 4>I love dogs.</v>

1373
00:37:47.661 --> 00:37:48.020
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1374
00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:48.201
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1375
00:37:48.201 --> 00:37:48.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1376
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:53.060
<v Speaker 4>you guys all did me a huge salad doing the fundraiser for the dog last week and</v>

1377
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.200
<v Speaker 4>I love dogs,</v>

1378
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.880
<v Speaker 4>but I still,</v>

1379
00:37:55.881 --> 00:38:00.020
<v Speaker 4>I also have a problem with people who don't let somebody like him.</v>

1380
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1381
00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:06.540
<v Speaker 4>serve his time and then get another shot at like earning a living again because</v>

1382
00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:07.551
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people were suit,</v>

1383
00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:10.010
<v Speaker 4>like rightfully recruited critical of what he did.</v>

1384
00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:11.030
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1385
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.140
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1386
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.250
<v Speaker 4>he lost his name.</v>

1387
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:17.270
<v Speaker 4>He lost hundreds of millions of dollars probably.</v>

1388
00:38:17.271 --> 00:38:18.104
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1389
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:19.063
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1390
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:23.180
<v Speaker 4>His contract was like about the biggest at the time he had crazy endorsements.</v>

1391
00:38:23.181 --> 00:38:24.320
<v Speaker 4>He went to prison,</v>

1392
00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:26.630
<v Speaker 4>which is what the punishment was.</v>

1393
00:38:26.631 --> 00:38:27.140
<v Speaker 4>He did it.</v>

1394
00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.500
<v Speaker 4>He went to prison and he did his time and then a lot of people were really upset</v>

1395
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.870
<v Speaker 4>that he even has a chance to make a living.</v>

1396
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.081
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1397
00:38:33.081 --> 00:38:33.810
<v Speaker 4>But it's like he,</v>

1398
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:34.390
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1399
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.730
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1400
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.310
<v Speaker 4>he paid the price,</v>

1401
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1402
00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.440
<v Speaker 2>One denial is his fucking talent.</v>

1403
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:39.521
<v Speaker 2>The NFL is like,</v>

1404
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:39.970
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1405
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:40.810
<v Speaker 2>come on back.</v>

1406
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Come on back.</v>

1407
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.070
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

1408
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Because if they don't do it,</v>

1409
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:43.960
<v Speaker 2>someone else going to do it.</v>

1410
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1411
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

1412
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

1413
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to grab that guy.</v>

1414
00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:46.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1415
00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.220
<v Speaker 2>it really wouldn't be any other way to play football.</v>

1416
00:38:49.221 --> 00:38:50.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's kind of A.</v>

1417
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's the nfl and there's basically.</v>

1418
00:38:52.271 --> 00:38:52.720
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1419
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.171
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1420
00:38:53.171 --> 00:38:53.551
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

1421
00:38:53.551 --> 00:38:54.280
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>

1422
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.820
<v Speaker 2>the b league is not really a League for football.</v>

1423
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.393
<v Speaker 2>The idea that</v>

1424
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:01.750
<v Speaker 8>Rina.</v>

1425
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:02.250
<v Speaker 8>Rina.</v>

1426
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.083
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1427
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.640
<v Speaker 8>I played that for for a day.</v>

1428
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.813
<v Speaker 8>I</v>

1429
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.920
<v Speaker 8>don't know if they drug test.</v>

1430
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.310
<v Speaker 8>It's just fucking brutal.</v>

1431
00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.000
<v Speaker 8>It's brutal.</v>

1432
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.230
<v Speaker 8>It's like being in the yard.</v>

1433
00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.700
<v Speaker 8>Canadian football has some good.</v>

1434
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:15.960
<v Speaker 8>Had some good athletes for sure.</v>

1435
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.780
<v Speaker 8>Good players,</v>

1436
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.590
<v Speaker 8>but NFL is definitely the top of mine and he was a bad motherfucker.</v>

1437
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.990
<v Speaker 8>Doug flutie Canada</v>

1438
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.630
<v Speaker 2>first and play up there for awhile before he came down to America.</v>

1439
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.980
<v Speaker 2>He was the hero when I was in highschool.</v>

1440
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Doug flutie was like,</v>

1441
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.260
<v Speaker 2>I think I was in high school and he was in college.</v>

1442
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.420
<v Speaker 2>It was the hero.</v>

1443
00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.140
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>

1444
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.290
<v Speaker 2>And then there was the USFL was very famous in Boston.</v>

<v Speaker 1>which is basically guaranteed.</v>

1880
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:30.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1881
00:50:30.321 --> 00:50:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I got a couple of investors that got it.</v>

1882
00:50:31.571 --> 00:50:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I got to,</v>

1883
00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:32.813
<v Speaker 1>I got an Italian,</v>

1884
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:33.530
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1885
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:37.190
<v Speaker 1>one in Czech Republic and we were talking about what movie to go see.</v>

1886
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:37.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1887
00:50:37.341 --> 00:50:38.420
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did we get here?</v>

1888
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1889
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:39.551
<v Speaker 1>that's where you kind of did.</v>

1890
00:50:39.551 --> 00:50:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I just did,</v>

1891
00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:40.893
<v Speaker 1>did that</v>

1892
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:43.380
<v Speaker 6>almost exactly like that.</v>

1893
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:44.530
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to.</v>

1894
00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:45.363
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

1895
00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:47.070
<v Speaker 6>my dad doesn't want to be on TV.</v>

1896
00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:48.060
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

1897
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.170
<v Speaker 6>I don't know where he's going with this,</v>

1898
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.550
<v Speaker 6>but it's exactly.</v>

1899
00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.100
<v Speaker 6>It's funny on TV at all.</v>

1900
00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:55.980
<v Speaker 6>My Dad will be on TV.</v>

1901
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.810
<v Speaker 6>You're saying that your dad would enjoy it as a fascinating guy.</v>

1902
00:51:00.811 --> 00:51:01.231
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1903
00:51:01.231 --> 00:51:03.160
<v Speaker 6>my dad's a very nice guy.</v>

1904
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.520
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1905
00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1906
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.530
<v Speaker 1>he would be very polite and friendly with everybody,</v>

1907
00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:07.251
<v Speaker 1>but my dad,</v>

1908
00:51:07.251 --> 00:51:08.084
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

1909
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.160
<v Speaker 6>Let's do it.</v>

1910
00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:09.993
<v Speaker 6>Dad Show what?</v>

1911
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:13.280
<v Speaker 6>Pick it back up my nose.</v>

1912
00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:14.350
<v Speaker 6>There's no way he would never do it.</v>

1913
00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:15.040
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1914
00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.560
<v Speaker 6>It's zero desire to be famous and we cast it out for you.</v>

1915
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:19.510
<v Speaker 6>Give me like a black guy,</v>

1916
00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:21.093
<v Speaker 6>black guy.</v>

1917
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.890
<v Speaker 6>Black Guy was only a couple of years older than me.</v>

1918
00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:28.053
<v Speaker 6>Four years old.</v>

1919
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:36.300
<v Speaker 6>Like Bernard Hopkins plays my dad and no one even mentioned it the whole time</v>

1920
00:51:36.301 --> 00:51:36.571
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

1921
00:51:36.571 --> 00:51:41.010
<v Speaker 6>And Bernard Hopkins refuses to admit it's him playing it on the show.</v>

1922
00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:41.270
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

1923
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:42.011
<v Speaker 6>And afterwards,</v>

1924
00:51:42.011 --> 00:51:43.150
<v Speaker 6>in every interview is,</v>

1925
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.550
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.</v>

1926
00:51:45.551 --> 00:51:46.540
<v Speaker 6>That's not me,</v>

1927
00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:47.613
<v Speaker 6>but it is him.</v>

1928
00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.140
<v Speaker 6>Take Bernard Hopkins will go fishing with him.</v>

1929
00:51:50.141 --> 00:51:51.450
<v Speaker 6>I can't have to listen to it.</v>

1930
00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.570
<v Speaker 6>You have good stories.</v>

1931
00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.130
<v Speaker 6>Listen and tells me,</v>

1932
00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:55.030
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1933
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm listening to this.</v>

1934
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:58.870
<v Speaker 6>My Dad has to bring back childhood memories,</v>

1935
00:51:58.871 --> 00:52:01.380
<v Speaker 6>but like it's like when joe was a kid and he first learned how to ride a bike</v>

1936
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:03.343
<v Speaker 6>like Joe.</v>

1937
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.380
<v Speaker 6>You remember when I took Joe to the holiday and you remember that Joe and making</v>

1938
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:12.290
<v Speaker 6>some motherfuckers lying in his bed playing with chimpanzee doll.</v>

1939
00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:14.470
<v Speaker 6>Bernard Hopkins owns the right to the,</v>

1940
00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:15.281
<v Speaker 6>to the title.</v>

1941

<v Speaker 6>I am the machine.</v>

1942
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.720
<v Speaker 6>How do I know that's a.</v>

1943
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.630
<v Speaker 6>maybe that might be an API,</v>

1944
00:52:19.631 --> 00:52:20.464
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1945
00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.600
<v Speaker 6>Get outta here.</v>

1946
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.550
<v Speaker 6>You tarnish your reputation and doubly later brother,</v>

1947
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:31.543
<v Speaker 6>we'll see in a bit.</v>

1948
00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.150
<v Speaker 6>Bert Kreischer will be joining us tonight.</v>

1949
00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.060
<v Speaker 6>These sold out ice house,</v>

1950
00:52:36.061 --> 00:52:39.700
<v Speaker 6>kind of a club show along with his man that I'm talking to right now,</v>

1951
00:52:39.701 --> 00:52:40.810
<v Speaker 6>Tom Segura.</v>

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.460
<v Speaker 6>So exactly what.</v>

1953
00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.560
<v Speaker 6>And I wasn't thinking of him at all,</v>

1954
00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.180
<v Speaker 6>but it was perfect.</v>

1955
00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:48.721
<v Speaker 1>It was perfect.</v>

1956
00:52:48.721 --> 00:52:49.410
<v Speaker 1>You sort of,</v>

1957

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1958
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.340
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>

1959
00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:50.551
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1960
00:52:50.551 --> 00:52:50.881
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't.</v>

1961
00:52:50.881 --> 00:52:51.790
<v Speaker 1>He's not a crazy person,</v>

1962
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.983
<v Speaker 1>but does,</v>

1963
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:53.311
<v Speaker 1>he?</v>

1964
00:52:53.311 --> 00:52:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Does make me think what we were talking about,</v>

1965
00:52:55.171 --> 00:52:57.540
<v Speaker 1>which is like a lot of times I go.</v>

1966

1967
00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.230

1968
00:53:01.231 --> 00:53:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1969
00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:02.370

1970
00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:03.390
<v Speaker 1>how did he get there?</v>

1971
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:05.760
<v Speaker 1>You know which being you do when you're sitting around?</v>

1972
00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:06.840
<v Speaker 1>He's not even high though.</v>

1973
00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:07.860
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even get high.</v>

1974
00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.180
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1975
00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So he's got no God damn excuse you just showed up and I just didn't know where</v>

1976
00:53:12.021 --> 00:53:13.290

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:21.091
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

<v Speaker 5>did he freak out at all?</v>

2022
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.660
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2023
00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:35.131
<v Speaker 5>not at all.</v>

2024
00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:35.731
<v Speaker 5>He was just like,</v>

2025
00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:37.320
<v Speaker 5>almost like a happy drunk,</v>

2026
00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:40.770
<v Speaker 5>but where he was just kind of giggling and laughing.</v>

2027
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.060
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever tell him what happened?</v>

2028
00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:42.510
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2029
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:43.350
<v Speaker 5>Never be probably,</v>

2030
00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.040
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2031
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.050
<v Speaker 5>but you should tell him because he would enjoy it.</v>

2032
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:47.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2033
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:47.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2034
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:49.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe it'd be one of those things that he discovered late in life,</v>

2035
00:54:49.921 --> 00:54:50.431
<v Speaker 5>like wow,</v>

2036
00:54:50.431 --> 00:54:52.530
<v Speaker 5>their slates makes life so much more enjoyable,</v>

2037
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:55.380
<v Speaker 5>but you'd have to get it to them in that form though.</v>

2038
00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:55.920
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2039
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.010
<v Speaker 5>That's the coolest forums that the edible forms the best form.</v>

2040
00:54:59.160 --> 00:54:59.993
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

2041
00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 5>I like it the most.</v>

2042
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

2043
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.270
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

2044
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:04.560
<v Speaker 5>As long as it's mild,</v>

2045
00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.360
<v Speaker 5>as long as it's not like super strong,</v>

2046
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:08.040
<v Speaker 5>the effects are like really pleasant.</v>

2047
00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:11.100
<v Speaker 5>Superstrong can bring strong is not good.</v>

2048
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:12.980
<v Speaker 5>That's a terrible feeling of.</v>

2049
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:16.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to relax and get through this day.</v>

2050
00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:18.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to be contemplating the fate of the fucking galaxy youth.</v>

2051
00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:21.720
<v Speaker 5>Do you like in a super strong to psychedelic?</v>

2052
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:22.610
<v Speaker 5>Is that what happens?</v>

2053
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.000
<v Speaker 5>It is very much so.</v>

2054
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.781
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

2055
00:55:24.781 --> 00:55:27.090
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of the ancient Hindu writings,</v>

2056
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:29.250
<v Speaker 5>a lot of what they talked about,</v>

2057
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 5>really extreme psychedelic experiences that they,</v>

2058
00:55:32.761 --> 00:55:32.971
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2059
00:55:32.971 --> 00:55:33.900
<v Speaker 5>they talked about it.</v>

2060
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.880
<v Speaker 5>We're all from eating hash.</v>

2061
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:36.743
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2062
00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:37.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2063
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.670
<v Speaker 5>Eating cannabis can,</v>

2064
00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 5>if you eat enough of it,</v>

2065
00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:44.220
<v Speaker 5>you can have an experience that is every bit as strong as mushrooms.</v>

2066
00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:44.701
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2067
00:55:44.701 --> 00:55:45.001
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2068
00:55:45.001 --> 00:55:45.811
<v Speaker 5>You just have to eat.</v>

2069
00:55:45.811 --> 00:55:46.644
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it.</v>

2070
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:47.450
<v Speaker 5>I've had.</v>

2071
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:49.710
<v Speaker 5>I've been moved to tears a few times.</v>

2072
00:55:49.711 --> 00:55:51.870
<v Speaker 5>I've had experiences in the tank.</v>

2073
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.650
<v Speaker 5>Eating,</v>

2074
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:56.280
<v Speaker 5>eating pot are like a fucking,</v>

2075
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:58.080
<v Speaker 5>like a ride to the movie,</v>

2076
00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.580
<v Speaker 5>like experience that you wouldn't believe if if you.</v>

2077
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.990
<v Speaker 5>If you didn't see it with your own synapses,</v>

2078
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:05.550
<v Speaker 5>if you weren't going through it,</v>

2079
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.110
<v Speaker 5>it seems impossible.</v>

2080
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:08.670
<v Speaker 5>It's all just eating pot,</v>

2081
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.530
<v Speaker 5>eating pot and getting into a tank.</v>

2082
00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:13.010
<v Speaker 5>The tank filled with water and the show,</v>

2083
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.500
<v Speaker 5>but you have to eat that.</v>

2084
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.450
<v Speaker 5>You got to get to that critical level where you feel like you eat too much.</v>

2085
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:20.400
<v Speaker 5>That's where you gotta get you gotTa.</v>

2086
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:21.360
<v Speaker 5>Get to that feeling where you're like,</v>

2087
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.511
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2088
00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:22.350
<v Speaker 5>I fucked up.</v>

2089
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:23.470
<v Speaker 5>I fucked up,</v>

2090
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 5>and that's when</v>

2091
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.010
<v Speaker 1>you can close your eyes and see nobody.</v>

2092
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2093
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Like how much are you talking about?</v>

2094
00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2095
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 1>you see it in the dark.</v>

2096
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:29.861
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2097
00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:30.700
<v Speaker 1>that's when you see it,</v>

2098
00:56:30.701 --> 00:56:31.421
<v Speaker 1>like you don't see it.</v>

2099
00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:32.290
<v Speaker 1>If you open your eyes,</v>

2100
00:56:32.291 --> 00:56:33.101
<v Speaker 1>if you open your eyes,</v>

2101
00:56:33.101 --> 00:56:34.090
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to hallucinate.</v>

2102
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:38.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's going to misinterpret visual cues and real information,</v>

2103
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 1>but what it will do is supercharge your imagination to the point where it can't</v>

2104
00:56:42.881 --> 00:56:44.050
<v Speaker 1>deal with a blank slate.</v>

2105
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

2106
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:46.960
<v Speaker 1>when you eat the pot,</v>

2107
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:47.891
<v Speaker 1>you close,</v>

2108
00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:51.310
<v Speaker 1>you either close your eyes like I've had this habit on planes before where I ate</v>

2109
00:56:51.311 --> 00:56:53.470
<v Speaker 1>a cookie before I got to the airport,</v>

2110
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:54.910
<v Speaker 1>and then while I'm on the plane,</v>

2111
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:56.260
<v Speaker 1>you're tripping your balls off.</v>

2112
00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:00.050
<v Speaker 1>When you close your eyes and the darkness of your closed eyes,</v>

2113
00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.650
<v Speaker 1>that's when your imagination starts firing.</v>

2114
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 1>When you start seeing wild,</v>

2115
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:08.500
<v Speaker 1>crazy neon colors like fucking,</v>

2116
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:09.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2117
00:57:09.161 --> 00:57:09.530
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

2118
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:10.810
<v Speaker 1>you start seeing like,</v>

2119
00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:13.330
<v Speaker 1>like computer cartoon,</v>

2120
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:16.060
<v Speaker 1>fractal shows.</v>

2121
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:17.320
<v Speaker 1>It becomes very,</v>

2122
00:57:17.321 --> 00:57:22.150
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre and that's just closing your eyes on a plane inside the tank.</v>

2123
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:23.350
<v Speaker 1>It can really like.</v>

2124
00:57:23.351 --> 00:57:26.110
<v Speaker 1>It almost like opens up another realm of experience.</v>

2125
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Kids.</v>

2126
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Very strange because in the absence of light,</v>

2127
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:30.791
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2128
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:34.990
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff flying through your brain sort of manifests itself as visual</v>

2129
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:35.824
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

2130
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:40.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't just get the feeling like life's slipping away.</v>

2131
00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:40.880
<v Speaker 1>You get,</v>

2132
00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.730
<v Speaker 1>you get that feeling when your eyes are open,</v>

2133
00:57:42.731 --> 00:57:44.050
<v Speaker 1>but everything looks normal.</v>

2134
00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:44.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2135
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:48.280
<v Speaker 1>everything looks a little faker and everything looks kind of two dimensional,</v>

2136
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:49.750
<v Speaker 1>a little closer that it should be,</v>

2137
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.100
<v Speaker 1>but it still looks normal,</v>

2138
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:52.960
<v Speaker 1>but when you close your eyes,</v>

2139
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 1>then you get the fucking color show.</v>

2140
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Just madness and craziness in front of you.</v>

2141
00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:58.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2142
00:57:58.871 --> 00:58:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I've had an absolute freak out.</v>

2143
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:02.261
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2144
00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Blowing my mind experiences eating it.</v>

2145
00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:04.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2146
00:58:04.631 --> 00:58:05.500
<v Speaker 1>You just have to eat it.</v>

2147
00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:07.040
<v Speaker 1>How much do you have?</v>

2148
00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.490
<v Speaker 1>What's the most you've consumed like?</v>

2149
00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:09.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2150
00:58:09.581 --> 00:58:10.181
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to say.</v>

2151
00:58:10.181 --> 00:58:11.920
<v Speaker 1>There was a friend who made pills.</v>

2152
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 1>He made a thc pills and I forget how he did it.</v>

2153
00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I forget what his process was of extracting the thc and putting it into pill</v>

2154
00:58:21.671 --> 00:58:22.300
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

2155
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.400
<v Speaker 1>but he told us very specifically,</v>

2156
00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.690
<v Speaker 1>only take one.</v>

2157
00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:26.651
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2158
00:58:26.651 --> 00:58:27.880
<v Speaker 1>do not take more than one.</v>

2159
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I only took one.</v>

2160
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I listened to any bravo took to eddie.</v>

2161
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Bravo was one of those silly bitches,</v>

2162
00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.090
<v Speaker 1>like I can't even get to high.</v>

2163
00:58:37.091 --> 00:58:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to high.</v>

2164
00:58:39.031 --> 00:58:43.270
<v Speaker 1>You could and it was unbelievably strong.</v>

2165
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.051
<v Speaker 1>Just one.</v>

2166
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:44.561
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2167
00:58:44.561 --> 00:58:45.490
<v Speaker 1>where is this?</v>

2168
00:58:45.491 --> 00:58:50.491
<v Speaker 1>Do travel in everyday this do it is going to cover raising town every day and</v>

2169
00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:54.400
<v Speaker 1>that's something that a lot of people are overlooking about this whole medical</v>

2170
00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:55.360
<v Speaker 1>marijuana movement.</v>

2171
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's focusing on smoking pot.</v>

2172
00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 1>We don't want people smoking pot.</v>

2173
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2174
00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:04.510
<v Speaker 1>the eating pot is five times stronger,</v>

2175
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:09.550
<v Speaker 1>five times more psychoactive when you eat it and you're getting guys just</v>

2176
00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:11.140
<v Speaker 1>loading up these cookies,</v>

2177
00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:12.730
<v Speaker 1>loading up these candies,</v>

2178
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:15.550
<v Speaker 1>and you can eat three or four of them before you even know what the fuck's going</v>

2179
00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:19.640
<v Speaker 1>on and then an hour and 20 minutes later you're on your deathbed.</v>

2180
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking fuck out.</v>

2181
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

2182
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.993
<v Speaker 5>Yoshi,</v>

2183
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:23.850
<v Speaker 5>Yoshi,</v>

2184
00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:24.950
<v Speaker 5>like banana bread.</v>

2185
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 5>Joey ideas actually had a funny story from a long time ago when listerine strips</v>

2186
00:59:28.551 --> 00:59:29.690
<v Speaker 5>first came out for that pot,</v>

2187
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:33.310
<v Speaker 5>listerine strips and they used to have like the little containers just like I'm</v>

2188
00:59:33.311 --> 00:59:37.280
<v Speaker 5>in it and he had a whole one in and his friends,</v>

2189
00:59:37.281 --> 00:59:37.491
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

2190
00:59:37.491 --> 00:59:38.324
<v Speaker 5>I have one.</v>

2191
00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.900
<v Speaker 5>And he takes it out and they had all melted together and there were like nine</v>

2192
00:59:41.901 --> 00:59:44.470
<v Speaker 5>strips melted together and is it says like,</v>

2193
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.631
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2194
00:59:44.631 --> 00:59:45.350
<v Speaker 5>I guess that's it.</v>

2195
00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:45.740
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2196
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.670
<v Speaker 5>And then I gave it to,</v>

2197
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:53.710
<v Speaker 5>I guess the guy called the ambulance like 10 times the amount of those strong,</v>

2198
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:58.670
<v Speaker 5>super strong to take one half of those breast trips.</v>

2199
00:59:58.671 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard to find them now.</v>

2200
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.250
<v Speaker 5>They don't have them anymore,</v>

2201
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:04.430
<v Speaker 5>but I used to take one half of one and that's all.</v>

2202
01:00:04.431 --> 01:00:05.030
<v Speaker 5>It took.</v>

2203
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 5>One half of one you gave me that one time.</v>

2204
01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:11.150
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

2205
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.460
<v Speaker 5>That was when we were headed to the east coast.</v>

2206
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.010
<v Speaker 5>We were on a red eye and I remember,</v>

2207
01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:16.401
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2208
01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:16.591
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2209
01:00:16.591 --> 01:00:17.950
<v Speaker 5>we both landed and you were like,</v>

2210
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.300
<v Speaker 5>that is the highest I've ever been in my lab.</v>

2211
01:00:20.301 --> 01:00:21.240
<v Speaker 5>I go right there on that plane.</v>

2212
01:00:21.241 --> 01:00:22.820
<v Speaker 5>And you go right there on the plane?</v>

2213
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:23.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2214
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:23.481
<v Speaker 4>I go.</v>

2215
01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:24.060
<v Speaker 4>What was that like?</v>

2216
01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:24.840
<v Speaker 4>Was that with.</v>

2217
01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.910
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't an adventure.</v>

2218
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.481
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2219
01:00:26.481 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

2220
01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.610
<v Speaker 4>And I also remember that I buzzed by no means not high anymore.</v>

2221
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:36.410
<v Speaker 4>When I said that and I felt like leg 11 hours later,</v>

2222
01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:37.950
<v Speaker 4>I was like still kind of feeling it right?</v>

2223
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.290
<v Speaker 4>Like yeah dude,</v>

2224
01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:41.360
<v Speaker 4>that shit kicked my ass.</v>

2225
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.500
<v Speaker 4>It was unbelievable.</v>

2226
01:00:42.501 --> 01:00:43.550
<v Speaker 4>That was only a half.</v>

2227
01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.680
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine taking more than that.</v>

2228
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:49.670
<v Speaker 4>I actually started after that I realized that I'm like,</v>

2229
01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:54.700
<v Speaker 4>for me to not have that feeling a quarter of a strip was,</v>

2230
01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:55.940
<v Speaker 4>was better.</v>

2231
01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:56.421
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2232
01:00:56.421 --> 01:00:58.640
<v Speaker 4>Like I could function on a quarter.</v>

2233
01:00:59.090 --> 01:00:59.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2234
01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.390
<v Speaker 4>not on the half men.</v>

2235
01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:04.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't like eating anywhere.</v>

2236
01:01:04.451 --> 01:01:08.260
<v Speaker 5>I had one the other day and I didn't think I felt it the whole night.</v>

2237
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:09.940
<v Speaker 5>Like I took around 8:00,</v>

2238
01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.470
<v Speaker 5>around 11 or 12.</v>

2239
01:01:11.471 --> 01:01:11.711
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2240
01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:11.891
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

2241
01:01:11.891 --> 01:01:13.480
<v Speaker 5>I guess so that was just a shitty edible.</v>

2242
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.240
<v Speaker 5>Then I couldn't go to bed and it started like my heart started going crazy.</v>

2243
01:01:16.241 --> 01:01:16.481
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2244
01:01:16.481 --> 01:01:16.731
<v Speaker 5>all right.</v>

2245
01:01:16.731 --> 01:01:20.230
<v Speaker 5>Now starting right now it's like one in the morning and how long did it take to</v>

2246
01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:21.064
<v Speaker 5>kick in?</v>

2247
01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.020
<v Speaker 5>Four or five hours on a blockage somewhere,</v>

2248
01:01:26.021 --> 01:01:26.381
<v Speaker 5>son.</v>

2249
01:01:26.381 --> 01:01:27.250
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't even make sense.</v>

2250
01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:29.200
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't make sense.</v>

2251
01:01:29.201 --> 01:01:30.580
<v Speaker 5>You just defied logic.</v>

2252
01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.690
<v Speaker 5>You defied science.</v>

2253
01:01:31.691 --> 01:01:32.530
<v Speaker 5>You broke medicine,</v>

2254
01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:35.400
<v Speaker 5>but I couldn't go to sleep though for like hours.</v>

2255
01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.100
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2256
01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.640
<v Speaker 5>Maybe just took you a while to realize you were high or were you like caffeine,</v>

2257
01:01:39.641 --> 01:01:41.830
<v Speaker 5>dap and maybe it was having a hard time getting in there?</v>

2258
01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:41.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2259
01:01:41.981 --> 01:01:44.680
<v Speaker 5>I think I must have had too much other food in my stomach.</v>

2260
01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:48.400
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it just took a while to digest it or that's another possibility if you ate</v>

2261
01:01:48.401 --> 01:01:49.091
<v Speaker 5>something heavy,</v>

2262
01:01:49.091 --> 01:01:49.361
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2263
01:01:49.361 --> 01:01:50.410
<v Speaker 5>If that's behind it.</v>

2264
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:51.101
<v Speaker 5>Is that happened?</v>

2265
01:01:51.101 --> 01:01:51.934
<v Speaker 5>Is it working with that?</v>

2266
01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:52.690
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

2267
01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:53.231
<v Speaker 5>Totally right.</v>

2268
01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:53.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:54.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2270
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:54.970
<v Speaker 5>It was like busy.</v>

2271
01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:57.220
<v Speaker 5>Is your body has to do is break it down and just get to it,</v>

2272
01:01:57.370 --> 01:02:00.910
<v Speaker 5>which totally unscientific when it comes to understanding of the digestive</v>

2273
01:02:00.911 --> 01:02:01.360
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

2274
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.210
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2275
01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:02.940
<v Speaker 5>The juices.</v>

2276
01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 5>Break it down the brain juice.</v>

2277
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:06.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2278
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:07.583
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2279
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:09.070
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we were right about that,</v>

2280
01:02:09.071 --> 01:02:09.730
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

2281
01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:10.240
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

2282
01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.790
<v Speaker 5>I think if anybody should be concerned about experiences,</v>

2283
01:02:12.791 --> 01:02:15.790
<v Speaker 5>it's the eating it because I don't want anybody to have bad trips,</v>

2284
01:02:15.791 --> 01:02:16.100
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2285
01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:16.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2286
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:17.230
<v Speaker 5>it's bad trips.</v>

2287
01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.920
<v Speaker 5>Steer people away from weed and you don't get anything</v>

2288
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>out of those bad edible trips either because they usually come when you don't</v>

2289
01:02:23.701 --> 01:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>expect them.</v>

2290
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Like they come when you're trying to go to a movie,</v>

2291
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>have a plot cookie with your friends,</v>

2292
01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>go to a movie and Giggle and the POC cook who fucking.</v>

2293
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Everybody just wants to go home,</v>

2294
01:02:34.411 --> 01:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>you just got to get out of there.</v>

2295
01:02:35.731 --> 01:02:36.564
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to leave.</v>

2296
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Panic is never a good time and that's what it is.</v>

2297
01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>You are in like you have super anxiety.</v>

2298
01:02:42.521 --> 01:02:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

2299
01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>At least I do.</v>

2300
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:44.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's not like,</v>

2301
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>that's not fun man.</v>

2302
01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't go.</v>

2303
01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>That was really cool to add panicked for my life for a few hours,</v>

2304
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2305
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>just from sitting there when I was in full panic mode.</v>

2306
01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:52.681
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2307
01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:57.681
<v Speaker 1>From taking this one one a pill when Eddie Bravo had taken to.</v>

2308
01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I was in full panic mode and I was talking to this dude and the dude I was</v>

2309
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:06.861
<v Speaker 1>talking to was say a very high level Jujitsu guy who also apparently was a</v>

2310
01:03:06.931 --> 01:03:11.430
<v Speaker 1>rapist and a while I was talking to him so high.</v>

2311
01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm just so hard,</v>

2312
01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:14.490
<v Speaker 1>really shouldn't be talking to anybody,</v>

2313
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 1>but why I'm talking to this guy.</v>

2314
01:03:15.961 --> 01:03:16.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2315
01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:16.531
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2316
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:18.690
<v Speaker 1>this guy is a fucking killer.</v>

2317
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Like he's got this.</v>

2318
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Just feel about them.</v>

2319
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Like he feels super dangerous,</v>

2320
01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2321
01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.360
<v Speaker 1>He's a like a really high level Jujitsu guy,</v>

2322
01:03:27.361 --> 01:03:28.350
<v Speaker 1>but he also feels like,</v>

2323
01:03:28.351 --> 01:03:28.651
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2324
01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:30.900
<v Speaker 1>like if you were alone in the woods with this guy,</v>

2325
01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:31.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2326
01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:33.150
<v Speaker 1>and you'd gone for a few days without food,</v>

2327
01:03:33.151 --> 01:03:34.670
<v Speaker 1>he might fucking eat you.</v>

2328
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.220
<v Speaker 1>And then later after that had happened,</v>

2329
01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.720
<v Speaker 1>he turned out that he was a rapist.</v>

2330
01:03:39.721 --> 01:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>He got arrested,</v>

2331
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.431
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't.</v>

2332
01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:43.740
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get arrested by the way he fleet.</v>

2333
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.780
<v Speaker 1>And the way they caught him was he started doing Jujitsu again.</v>

2334
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:53.640
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't stop doing Jujitsu and they started doing Jujitsu at a new gym and</v>

2335
01:03:53.641 --> 01:03:57.960
<v Speaker 1>he didn't realize how obvious it is that he's like a super high level guy.</v>

2336
01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not that many high level guys know when you get.</v>

2337
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are quite a few,</v>

2338
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.930
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it,</v>

2339
01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:03.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2340
01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe there's hundreds,</v>

2341
01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:08.310
<v Speaker 1>but the people in the Jujitsu world are pretty much aware of a guy that's that</v>

2342
01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:11.100
<v Speaker 1>high level and this guy was just tapping everybody,</v>

2343
01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:12.480
<v Speaker 1>including their best black belts.</v>

2344
01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.411
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's like,</v>

2345
01:04:13.411 --> 01:04:13.651
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2346
01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:14.484
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

2347
01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:15.493
<v Speaker 1>Who is this dude?</v>

2348
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.901
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

2349
01:04:15.901 --> 01:04:16.734
<v Speaker 1>he's from Brazil,</v>

2350
01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.380
<v Speaker 1>and so someone's got a picture of him or something.</v>

2351
01:04:19.381 --> 01:04:19.681
<v Speaker 1>And they went,</v>

2352
01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:20.071
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2353
01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:20.904
<v Speaker 1>that's that guy.</v>

2354
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>And he's wanted for rape.</v>

2355
01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't.</v>

2356
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:26.250
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't go on the Lam and not do Jujitsu.</v>

2357
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.001
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

2358
01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:27.630
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2359
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe they would've gotten them anyway.</v>

2361
01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:31.323
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2362
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:32.161
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>

2363
01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I got to have his Jujitsu and raping people.</v>

2364
01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Grape juice.</v>

2365
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I got to be able to do both of those things to be a happy guy.</v>

2366
01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2367
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.760
<v Speaker 1>He gave off this weird dangerous energy,</v>

2368
01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:42.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2369
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:47.420
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're that cranked out on the wrong side of the pot.</v>

2370
01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Rainbow,</v>

2371

2374
01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.620
<v Speaker 1>monsters and dragons in the night.</v>

2375
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the things.</v>

2376
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:57.390
<v Speaker 1>If you're having that,</v>

2377
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:58.990
<v Speaker 1>that type of a experience,</v>

2378
01:04:58.991 --> 01:04:59.824
<v Speaker 1>that trip,</v>

2379

<v Speaker 1>you've eaten too much and you happened to be in a not cool environment,</v>

2380
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.050
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in an already dangerous situation.</v>

2389
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Imagine eating a cookie and go to Karachi in the middle of Pakistan watching</v>

2390
01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>people pull up with mopeds and gun people down.</v>

2399
01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>He was telling us about Karachi and how insane it is.</v>

2400
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>That looks insane.</v>

2401
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Like millions of people on this one.</v>

2402
01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Giant city,</v>

2403
01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:39.531
<v Speaker 1>I think it's $20,</v>

2404
01:05:39.531 --> 01:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

2405
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy.</v>

2406
01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:42.470
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people and crimes.</v>

2407
01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Just running a muck.</v>

2408
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Who says they hate their neighbors so much and they are hated so much too.</v>

2409
01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:50.291
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

2410
01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:50.890
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

2411
01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>The way he described it to me,</v>

2412
01:05:52.061 --> 01:05:52.894
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

2413
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>it literally is like the scariest place on earth.</v>

2414
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't believe it exists.</v>

2415
01:05:57.851 --> 01:06:02.851
<v Speaker 1>It's like the apocalypse in a city and it's there right now and nobody's talking</v>

2416
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:03.540
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2417
01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

2418
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

2419
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Nobody even thinks about it.</v>

2420
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:07.210
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about dangerous places,</v>

2421
01:06:07.211 --> 01:06:08.440
<v Speaker 1>people talk about like Detroit.</v>

2422
01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Detroit is not nearly as dangerous as karate.</v>

2423
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:13.383
<v Speaker 1>Have you had Malan?</v>

2448
01:06:39.931 --> 01:06:41.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's very successful,</v>

2449
01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.360
<v Speaker 4>like he does very well.</v>

2450
01:06:42.361 --> 01:06:42.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2451
01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:43.290
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2452
01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:44.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean he just did an hour special.</v>

2453
01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:45.460
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

2454
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.360
<v Speaker 4>he's acting in like all kinds of like he's,</v>

2455
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.520
<v Speaker 4>he does really well and he's like,</v>

2456
01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:51.420
<v Speaker 4>he's a super really,</v>

2457
01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:55.320
<v Speaker 4>like the thing that I was obsessed with when I had him on was that he didn't</v>

2458
01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:56.190
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2459
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:59.220
<v Speaker 4>he grew up there and he didn't,</v>

2460
01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.083
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2461
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:05.700
<v Speaker 4>he didn't like watch standup growing up and he came into college at 19 and he's</v>

2462
01:07:06.811 --> 01:07:08.280
<v Speaker 4>so good at it that I'm like,</v>

2463
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:08.701
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2464
01:07:08.701 --> 01:07:12.570
<v Speaker 4>but I just don't understand how you're good at it because like how is your sense</v>

2465
01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:14.580
<v Speaker 4>of humor developed?</v>

2466
01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.220
<v Speaker 4>You started at like basically 19,</v>

2467
01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:22.280
<v Speaker 4>like being exposed to this at all and he's like exceptionally good at it.</v>

2468
01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:23.640
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>

2469
01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:28.230
<v Speaker 4>you see like he just has such a command of doing standup,</v>

2470
01:07:28.231 --> 01:07:29.040
<v Speaker 4>like everything,</v>

2471
01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.630
<v Speaker 4>like really insightful,</v>

2472
01:07:30.631 --> 01:07:31.464
<v Speaker 4>smart,</v>

2473
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.333
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

2474
01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.690
<v Speaker 4>really good writer performer.</v>

2475
01:07:33.691 --> 01:07:38.691
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny and I just fascinated at his whole background,</v>

2476
01:07:38.941 --> 01:07:39.760
<v Speaker 4>his whole story.</v>

2477
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:39.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2478
01:07:39.911 --> 01:07:44.080
<v Speaker 1>That is interesting because there are cultures that do not have standup comedy,</v>

2479
01:07:44.081 --> 01:07:44.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2480
01:07:44.411 --> 01:07:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean yeah,</v>

2481
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:45.790
<v Speaker 1>he definitely didn't have it.</v>

2482
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:50.791
<v Speaker 1>They all have some sort of public gathering before someone gets to talk.</v>

2483
01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.120
<v Speaker 1>But for entertainment,</v>

2484
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:54.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many places have it</v>

2485
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 4>just breaking out in some parts of the world now?</v>

2486
01:07:56.830 --> 01:08:00.100
<v Speaker 4>Like I know in a lot of Spanish speaking countries,</v>

2487
01:08:00.101 --> 01:08:02.900
<v Speaker 4>you know there are clubs now and you know,</v>

2488
01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:04.360
<v Speaker 4>a stand up show,</v>

2489
01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:05.980
<v Speaker 4>a unit for television,</v>

2490
01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:06.580
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>

2491
01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:10.930
<v Speaker 4>they don't have the like basically 8,000 year history of that we have,</v>

2492
01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:15.590
<v Speaker 4>are they coming from the catskills and it being like a thing that has different</v>

2493
01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.424
<v Speaker 4>genres.</v>

2494
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.761
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2495
01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:17.020
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2496
01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:17.380
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2497
01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.610
<v Speaker 2>it's newer in boys invented here.</v>

2498
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:21.350
<v Speaker 2>It's totally ultimately invented here.</v>

2499
01:08:21.351 --> 01:08:26.090
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of confusion or a lot of questionings as far as who invented</v>

2500
01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:26.181
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2501
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:26.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2502
01:08:26.361 --> 01:08:27.410
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck invented it?</v>

2503
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Is there anyone who is known as the godfather of stand up?</v>

2504
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.900
<v Speaker 2>That's a good,</v>

2505
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.370
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question because stand up sort of became standup with lenny bruce</v>

2506
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:38.840
<v Speaker 2>just before that.</v>

2507
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:43.130
<v Speaker 2>It was like a lot of guys that would share jokes and they would,</v>

2508
01:08:43.131 --> 01:08:43.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2509
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:47.420
<v Speaker 2>they would do the same sketch for 20 years and you know,</v>

2510
01:08:47.421 --> 01:08:47.581
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2511
01:08:47.581 --> 01:08:48.020
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2512
01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:52.040
<v Speaker 2>they would go perform in the cat skills and they would all steal each other's</v>

2513
01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:53.030
<v Speaker 2>material and shit.</v>

2514
01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

2515
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:57.680
<v Speaker 2>people in show business almost like you would think of a contract studio person</v>

2516
01:08:57.681 --> 01:08:59.690
<v Speaker 2>from like the 19 forties and fifties,</v>

2517
01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:00.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2518
01:09:00.141 --> 01:09:02.810
<v Speaker 2>you think of those people that have contracts with the studio and did all those</v>

2519
01:09:02.811 --> 01:09:03.644
<v Speaker 2>studio movies.</v>

2520
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:04.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2521
01:09:04.251 --> 01:09:05.300
<v Speaker 2>these guys kind of were,</v>

2522
01:09:05.301 --> 01:09:05.780
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2523
01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.380
<v Speaker 2>there were like,</v>

2524
01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:07.970
<v Speaker 2>it was a different kind of comedy.</v>

2525
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:11.540
<v Speaker 2>And then Lenny Bruce came along and all of a sudden he starts talking about real</v>

2526
01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:12.340
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2527
01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2528
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:13.351
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden you start,</v>

2529
01:09:13.351 --> 01:09:13.701
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2530
01:09:13.701 --> 01:09:14.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2531
01:09:14.071 --> 01:09:17.780
<v Speaker 2>like breaking down our use of language and why do we have to say this?</v>

2532
01:09:17.781 --> 01:09:20.490
<v Speaker 2>And who's talking about real scenarios in the home and,</v>

2533
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:21.081
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

2534
01:09:21.081 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2535
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:22.740
<v Speaker 2>like that was,</v>

2536
01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2537
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:25.490
<v Speaker 2>like if you go over my house,</v>

2538
01:09:25.491 --> 01:09:28.290
<v Speaker 2>there's all these lenny bruce posters everywhere and it's not like I listened to</v>

2539
01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Lenny Bruce a lot.</v>

2540
01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:31.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've certainly have.</v>

2541
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it even holds up to this day because it really doesn't.</v>

2542
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.800
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to laugh at Lenny Bruce's stuff.</v>

2543
01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:40.220
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to put yourself into that mindset of the people that lived during the</v>

2544
01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:41.710
<v Speaker 2>19 fifties in the 19 sixties.</v>

2545
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:42.980
<v Speaker 2>But if you could,</v>

2546
01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.600
<v Speaker 2>if you could go back in time and you would be below in a way,</v>

2547
01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure of it.</v>

2548
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:54.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure his point of view was probably so incredibly unique at the time and his</v>

2549
01:09:55.131 --> 01:09:55.964
<v Speaker 2>insight,</v>

2550
01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:56.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2551
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:57.530
<v Speaker 2>his jokes,</v>

2552
01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:00.590
<v Speaker 2>some of his jokes today are great jokes.</v>

2553
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.980
<v Speaker 2>He had this joke about homosexuality being illegal.</v>

2554
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:07.700
<v Speaker 2>So what they do is they arrest you and they put you in jail with a bunch of men</v>

2555
01:10:07.701 --> 01:10:08.600
<v Speaker 2>who want to have sex with you.</v>

2556
01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2557
01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2558
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.600
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2559
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a good job.</v>

2560
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2561
01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2562
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:13.250
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2563
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:17.540
<v Speaker 2>it's funny in 2013 and he probably told that in the fifties it's crazy,</v>

2564
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 2>but people were like,</v>

2565
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.890
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2566
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:20.090
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard anything like,</v>

2567
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:21.440
<v Speaker 2>did he just say,</v>

2568
01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:22.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2569
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:22.843
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2570
01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2571
01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Lenny Bruce went to jail for it.</v>

2572
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.310
<v Speaker 2>He went to jail for using bad words.</v>

2573
01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2574
01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.780
<v Speaker 2>people don't understand that.</v>

2575
01:10:29.781 --> 01:10:32.840
<v Speaker 2>That is in this past century.</v>

2576
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:37.790
<v Speaker 2>People have been locked into cages for saying naughty words,</v>

2577
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:38.840
<v Speaker 2>not even threatening.</v>

2578
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Not like saying I'm going to blow up this plane and not,</v>

2579
01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.330
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2580
01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:42.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2581
01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:43.490
<v Speaker 2>words like that,</v>

2582
01:10:43.491 --> 01:10:48.430
<v Speaker 2>but a word like fuck or shit or tickets or something like that document.</v>

2583
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:49.580
<v Speaker 2>You're going to jail now.</v>

2584
01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.750
<v Speaker 2>They drained his money,</v>

2585
01:10:50.751 --> 01:10:51.740
<v Speaker 2>ruined his career.</v>

2586
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2587
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2588

<v Speaker 1>We're going to turn this thing around and landed in the desert.</v>

2677
01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2678
01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.100
<v Speaker 1>This a fucking criminal monster off of our to us whole.</v>

2679
01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.070
<v Speaker 1>What were you thinking about?</v>

2680
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Just thinking about finger girls in high school,</v>

2681
01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:55.390
<v Speaker 1>what was that all about?</v>

2682
01:12:57.410 --> 01:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Just having a flashback to the excitement.</v>

2683
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.140
<v Speaker 1>The first time we touched a moist vagina,</v>

2684
01:13:02.141 --> 01:13:02.821
<v Speaker 1>like holy Shit.</v>

2685
01:13:02.821 --> 01:13:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean girls that would grab your Dick and some girls.</v>

2686
01:13:06.521 --> 01:13:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you have those girls that like everyone would pass around?</v>

2687
01:13:09.521 --> 01:13:10.301
<v Speaker 1>Like during movies,</v>

2688
01:13:10.301 --> 01:13:12.140
<v Speaker 1>like when you had the projectors out and they like,</v>

2689
01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.140
<v Speaker 1>oh we got to some girls.</v>

2690
01:13:14.141 --> 01:13:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2691
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:16.570
<v Speaker 1>There was some girls that would just let it do its finger on.</v>

2692
01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2693
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>

2694
01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.540
<v Speaker 1>You need your posting things balanced.</v>

2695
01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:21.820
<v Speaker 1>This</v>

2696
01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:22.653
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>

2697
01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2698
01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.620
<v Speaker 2>and it's not necessarily a good thing that those girls are so needy that they're</v>

2699
01:13:26.621 --> 01:13:27.454
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

2700
01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.710
<v Speaker 2>But there's a cause and effect and it's not her fault.</v>

2701
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:30.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2702
01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.180
<v Speaker 2>that's what people have to realize whenever girls do like really overreaching</v>

2703
01:13:34.181 --> 01:13:35.200
<v Speaker 2>things to get attention,</v>

2704
01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:36.880
<v Speaker 2>it's because they didn't get enough attention.</v>

2705
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.361
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2706
01:13:37.361 --> 01:13:38.141
<v Speaker 2>it's really that simple.</v>

2707
01:13:38.141 --> 01:13:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Or they have the wrong kind of attention there.</v>

2708
01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.070
<v Speaker 2>They got fucked up and it's not their fault man.</v>

2709
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:42.731
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2710
01:13:42.731 --> 01:13:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2711
01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.980
<v Speaker 2>that's something that takes a long time to figure it out.</v>

2712
01:13:44.981 --> 01:13:47.170
<v Speaker 2>You don't realize that from what I mean,</v>

2713
01:13:47.171 --> 01:13:49.600
<v Speaker 2>people just sort of judge people by what they see.</v>

2714
01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:52.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the more interesting things about having children as you start</v>

2715
01:13:52.631 --> 01:13:55.480
<v Speaker 2>judging people by how they became that thing.</v>

2716
01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:56.960
<v Speaker 2>How did you get to be this,</v>

2724
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:10.850

01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:21.310
<v Speaker 2>That's what a person is.</v>

2733
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Nothing but potential and that is the number one thing that we don't pay</v>

2734
01:14:26.291 --> 01:14:29.590
<v Speaker 2>attention to and it's the number one thing that's fucking up this world is that</v>

2735
01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 2>people are raised by people that don't have any idea how to raise the most</v>

2736
01:14:34.031 --> 01:14:36.280
<v Speaker 2>complex thing ever.</v>

2737
01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.030
<v Speaker 2>A developing human being.</v>

2738
01:14:38.031 --> 01:14:39.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the most complex thing we know of.</v>

2739
01:14:39.491 --> 01:14:44.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a thing that literally can create an atomic bomb that can blow up the</v>

2740
01:14:44.021 --> 01:14:44.854
<v Speaker 2>fucking world.</v>

2741
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:45.700
<v Speaker 2>That's how.</v>

2742
01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:49.930
<v Speaker 2>That's how powerful the human mind is and you're leaving it to assholes.</v>

2743
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:54.400
<v Speaker 2>You're leaving it to a bunch of people that have no idea how to raise a person</v>

2744
01:14:54.401 --> 01:14:56.450
<v Speaker 2>correctly and weren't raised correctly themselves,</v>

2745
01:14:56.451 --> 01:14:59.410
<v Speaker 2>so I have all sorts of baggage that they're carrying into this,</v>

2746
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.980
<v Speaker 2>this relationship between mother and daughter and father and son and the,</v>

2747
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2748
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:10.200
<v Speaker 2>most people have no idea how the fuck they got into the place that we're at</v>

2749
01:15:10.631 --> 01:15:11.230
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

2750
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:12.940
<v Speaker 2>They live their life on momentum.</v>

2751
01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:13.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2752
01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.260
<v Speaker 2>and raising a human when you're stuck and momentum and screaming at people at</v>

2753
01:15:17.261 --> 01:15:21.630
<v Speaker 2>traffic and calling your wife a current and kicking your dog and now you've got</v>

2754
01:15:21.631 --> 01:15:22.210
<v Speaker 2>a baby.</v>

2755
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:22.870
<v Speaker 2>You okay,</v>

2756
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:23.980
<v Speaker 2>this guy has a baby.</v>

2757
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.940
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2758
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:29.890
<v Speaker 2>now what happens now this baby's fucked and he's being raised by a shithead and</v>

2759
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.950
<v Speaker 2>that's most of what's going on in the world.</v>

2760
01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Most of the problems is a lack of compassion and a lack of compassion from birth</v>

2761
01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:44.500
<v Speaker 2>to adulthood and it's so common and it's not being addressed.</v>

2762
01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Nobody talks about it.</v>

2763
01:15:45.401 --> 01:15:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to talk about oil.</v>

2764
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to auto.</v>

2765
01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:49.150
<v Speaker 2>What do we do when we run out of oil?</v>

2766
01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:53.740
<v Speaker 2>What will we do when peak oil becomes a problem in this country when we step up</v>

2767
01:15:53.741 --> 01:15:54.370
<v Speaker 2>and learn,</v>

2768
01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 2>but nobody looks at the number one commodity that humans have to offer.</v>

2769
01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:02.940
<v Speaker 2>That's humans are best commodity as humans and the more potential that you can</v>

2770
01:16:03.971 --> 01:16:05.920
<v Speaker 2>have in that commodity,</v>

2771
01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:09.070
<v Speaker 2>the more the better the world would be for everybody.</v>

2772
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.160
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is that the people that have billions of dollars are a bunch of</v>

2773
01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:17.161
<v Speaker 2>cons and they want to hold onto that money with their greasy old moisturizing</v>

2774
01:16:18.461 --> 01:16:22.990
<v Speaker 2>cream fucking leather hands because they've had it their whole life and they've</v>

2775
01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:25.540
<v Speaker 2>been in this position of privilege and they understand what it takes to make</v>

2776
01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:26.710
<v Speaker 2>$16,000,000,000.</v>

2777
01:16:26.850 --> 01:16:27.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2778
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:28.060
<v Speaker 2>when people.</v>

2779
01:16:28.061 --> 01:16:29.140
<v Speaker 2>I had a payoff,</v>

2780
01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:29.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2781
01:16:29.491 --> 01:16:30.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lobbyist.</v>

2782
01:16:30.471 --> 01:16:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I had a bride,</v>

2783
01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:33.400
<v Speaker 2>him just fucking boat,</v>

2784
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2785
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:37.210
<v Speaker 2>but that's the,</v>

2786
01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2787
01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.460
<v Speaker 2>the extreme form of,</v>

2788
01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:39.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2789
01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:40.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2790
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2791
01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:44.590
<v Speaker 2>the wrong parts of the competitive aspects of capitalism.</v>

2792
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Do you see Uc Riverside?</v>

2793
01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:46.961
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2794
01:16:46.961 --> 01:16:47.530
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

2795
01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2796
01:16:48.581 --> 01:16:49.050
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2797
01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:49.861
<v Speaker 2>It's a documentary.</v>

2798
01:16:49.861 --> 01:16:50.950
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking.</v>

2799
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:52.140
<v Speaker 2>You're not the first person to say,</v>

2800
01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.013
<v Speaker 2>what is it about?</v>

2801
01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.430
<v Speaker 4>It's about the guy who,</v>

2802
01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:56.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2803
01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:56.930
<v Speaker 4>he started.</v>

2804
01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.740
<v Speaker 4>It's the world's biggest time shareholder company.</v>

2805
01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:01.610
<v Speaker 4>Westgate,</v>

2806
01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:02.241
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called,</v>

2807
01:17:02.241 --> 01:17:02.751
<v Speaker 4>or it was called,</v>

2808
01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.310
<v Speaker 4>something like that I think is westgate.</v>

2809
01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.031
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

2810
01:17:05.031 --> 01:17:10.031
<v Speaker 4>a few years ago he went about building the home in the United States.</v>

2811
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:12.303
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

2812
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.750
<v Speaker 4>It was 90,000 square feet I think.</v>

2813
01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2814
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.610
<v Speaker 4>Ninety thousand square feet and it was modeled after Versailles,</v>

2815
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 4>the palace and France.</v>

2816
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:27.100
<v Speaker 4>And he just so happened to be doing this and a documentary crew was filming him,</v>

2817
01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:28.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2818
01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.240
<v Speaker 4>for this purpose.</v>

2819
01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:32.690
<v Speaker 4>And it happened in [inaudible] eight when the market crashed,</v>

2820
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.890
<v Speaker 4>they had a lion.</v>

2821
01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.140
<v Speaker 4>This is phenomenal.</v>

2822
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:45.260
<v Speaker 9>Forty three year old mother of 8:00.</v>

2823
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:47.290
<v Speaker 9>Choose most beautiful girl in the world.</v>

2824
01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.290
<v Speaker 9>It took me a while to fall in love with him.</v>

2825
01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.600
<v Speaker 9>We have a great relationship.</v>

2826
01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:54.760
<v Speaker 9>There's 30 years between us,</v>

2827
01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:57.970
<v Speaker 9>but he doesn't need at least there is that option.</v>

2828
01:17:57.971 --> 01:17:58.804
<v Speaker 9>If he does,</v>

2829
01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.280
<v Speaker 9>I don't know if 10 years from now</v>

2830
01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:06.130
<v Speaker 9>we never sought out to build the biggest house in America.</v>

2831
01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:07.630
<v Speaker 9>It just kinda happened.</v>

2832
01:18:07.631 --> 01:18:09.040
<v Speaker 9>It's bigger than the White House.</v>

2833
01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:10.130
<v Speaker 9>Two tennis courts,</v>

2834
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:12.310
<v Speaker 9>full size baseball field,</v>

2835
01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.030
<v Speaker 9>kitchen,</v>

2836
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.900
<v Speaker 9>antique furniture,</v>

2837
01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:14.980
<v Speaker 9>thousand square feet.</v>

2838
01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:15.731
<v Speaker 9>I'm like,</v>

2839
01:18:15.731 --> 01:18:16.470
<v Speaker 9>God,</v>

2840
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.800
<v Speaker 9>no.</v>

2841
01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.680
<v Speaker 9>This is my room.</v>

2842
01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:19.000
<v Speaker 9>That's my closet.</v>

2843
01:18:20.650 --> 01:18:22.630
<v Speaker 4>Nothing's really normal about this life</v>

2844
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:28.080
<v Speaker 9>in line to do a billion dollars in sales for the year.</v>

2845
01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:29.430
<v Speaker 9>We're on top of the world</v>

2846
01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.060
<v Speaker 9>and it came to a screeching halt.</v>

2847
01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.180
<v Speaker 9>The market fell over 700 points.</v>

2848
01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.550
<v Speaker 9>I would say it's touch and go right now we don't talk about</v>

2849
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:41.650
<v Speaker 4>financial problems.</v>

2850
01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:45.970
<v Speaker 4>I guess I'll have to watch the movie to find out what's going on in my life.</v>

2851
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:49.280
<v Speaker 9>Everything changes.</v>

2852
01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.190
<v Speaker 9>This is almost like a riches to rags story.</v>

2853
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:54.050
<v Speaker 9>She knows we need to cut back,</v>

2854
01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.880
<v Speaker 9>but she's still compulsive.</v>

2855
01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.290
<v Speaker 9>All they could afford a watch.</v>

2856
01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:01.124
<v Speaker 9>I would tell you</v>

2857
01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.890
<v Speaker 9>our problem is vegas.</v>

2858
01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:10.250
<v Speaker 9>Our lenders are made it very clear that you will have more money than he knows</v>

2859
01:19:10.251 --> 01:19:11.180
<v Speaker 9>what to do with human.</v>

2860
01:19:11.181 --> 01:19:12.260
<v Speaker 9>Go back to building this house.</v>

2861
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:15.020
<v Speaker 9>If the turns over this building over my dead body,</v>

2862
01:19:17.410 --> 01:19:21.500
<v Speaker 9>you can buy the palace that timeshare mogul David Siegel already wants to sell.</v>

2863
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:22.363
<v Speaker 9>Just think of the brace side.</v>

2864
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:23.623
<v Speaker 9>You may not have.</v>

<v Speaker 9>The</v>

2866
01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:31.550
<v Speaker 9>American dream is raising way up above what you started with and that is what</v>

2867
01:19:31.551 --> 01:19:35.630
<v Speaker 9>she has done when you're down is when you found out who your true friends are.</v>

2868
01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:37.460
<v Speaker 9>You get strength from your marriage.</v>

2869
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:40.673
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2870
01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:42.520
<v Speaker 9>I'm in this fantasy world,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like there's no driver.</v>

2899
01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:27.054

2906
01:20:31.141 --> 01:20:31.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2907
01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:32.540
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2908
01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.680
<v Speaker 4>Flow like that.</v>

2909
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:37.160
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty removed from society where she's,</v>

2910
01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:39.200
<v Speaker 4>she's living in such a fantasy world.</v>

2911
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:40.820
<v Speaker 4>How much money to homeboy lose?</v>

2912
01:20:41.630 --> 01:20:43.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean nine figures for sure.</v>

2913
01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.373
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

2914
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:46.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2915
01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.800
<v Speaker 4>But he's been a $100,000,000,</v>

2916
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:50.360
<v Speaker 4>so over 100 million for sure.</v>

2917
01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:50.570
<v Speaker 4>Of,</v>

2918
01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:51.470
<v Speaker 4>of personal lap.</v>

2919
01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:54.350
<v Speaker 4>And think about that nine figure.</v>

2920
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.903
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2921
01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:57.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2922
01:20:57.141 --> 01:20:59.450
<v Speaker 4>He lost a substantial amount of money.</v>

2923
01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2924
01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.170
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>

2925
01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:02.420
<v Speaker 4>because of properties basically.</v>

2926
01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:07.450
<v Speaker 4>Basically what happened was his business is a luxury business but it's a luxury</v>

2927
01:21:08.811 --> 01:21:09.740
<v Speaker 4>for the middle class.</v>

2928
01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:13.370
<v Speaker 4>So timeshares or something where it's like if you have a good job,</v>

2929
01:21:13.371 --> 01:21:15.260
<v Speaker 4>like you know you can more than pay your bills.</v>

2930
01:21:15.261 --> 01:21:16.880
<v Speaker 4>You can afford to do something.</v>

2931
01:21:16.881 --> 01:21:19.040
<v Speaker 4>Like let's go to Disney world this year,</v>

2932
01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:20.060
<v Speaker 4>let's go to Vegas.</v>

2933
01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:24.770
<v Speaker 4>But they sell you on whether you can afford to do this and it's people who have</v>

2934
01:21:24.771 --> 01:21:25.300
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2935
01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:25.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2936
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:26.421
<v Speaker 4>extra money,</v>

2937
01:21:26.421 --> 01:21:28.120
<v Speaker 4>some disposable income but not like.</v>

2938
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:29.420
<v Speaker 4>So what does it mean?</v>

2939
01:21:29.421 --> 01:21:30.770
<v Speaker 4>What does it mean when you have a timeshare?</v>

2940
01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:33.300
<v Speaker 4>Was I mean like you have this month and I have that money.</v>

2941
01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:34.430
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly like that.</v>

2942
01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:36.910
<v Speaker 4>It's like you get to come to this awesome timeshare,</v>

2943
01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:39.200
<v Speaker 4>whichever way you like Vegas,</v>

2944
01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:44.120
<v Speaker 4>you have the timeshare in Vegas and two weeks out of every year maybe you get to</v>

2945
01:21:44.121 --> 01:21:46.490
<v Speaker 4>pick your month if you pay more or sometime during the year,</v>

2946
01:21:46.491 --> 01:21:47.450
<v Speaker 4>less savory July.</v>

2947
01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.100
<v Speaker 4>You get your vegas place,</v>

2948
01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:51.770
<v Speaker 4>it's yours and it's fully furnished and it's awesome.</v>

2949
01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.180
<v Speaker 4>But other people have the keys to it.</v>

2950
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:54.110
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2951
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.361
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2952
01:21:54.361 --> 01:21:54.830
<v Speaker 4>So it's not.</v>

2953
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:55.770
<v Speaker 4>Who are the other people though?</v>

2954
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:58.700
<v Speaker 4>People who like you signed up for the service.</v>

2955
01:21:58.930 --> 01:21:59.051
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2956
01:21:59.051 --> 01:22:00.370
<v Speaker 4>like your friends know.</v>

2957
01:22:00.670 --> 01:22:00.820
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2958
01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:01.660
<v Speaker 4>it's total strangers.</v>

2959
01:22:01.661 --> 01:22:02.220
<v Speaker 4>See?</v>

2960
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2961
01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:04.000
<v Speaker 4>but there is a property.</v>

2962
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:09.350
<v Speaker 4>There's a property manager that's on site for you and then you have to go</v>

2963
01:22:09.551 --> 01:22:14.551
<v Speaker 4>through him that you're basically tell them if you're paying to go back to the</v>

2964
01:22:14.831 --> 01:22:15.680
<v Speaker 4>same place,</v>

2965
01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:16.390
<v Speaker 4>then ambulance,</v>

2966
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:17.223
<v Speaker 4>this is my shit,</v>

2967
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:18.400
<v Speaker 4>but you know it's not,</v>

2968
01:22:18.401 --> 01:22:19.230
<v Speaker 4>but it's not really.</v>

2969
01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:22.510
<v Speaker 4>You don't keep a TV there and you don't keep stereotype.</v>

2970
01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:22.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2971
01:22:22.841 --> 01:22:23.440
<v Speaker 4>it's probably,</v>

2972
01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure furnished with all that stuff,</v>

2973
01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.420
<v Speaker 4>but what happened was probably for a lot of people more comfortable than going</v>

2974
01:22:28.421 --> 01:22:29.530
<v Speaker 4>on a hotel definitely.</v>

2975
01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.480
<v Speaker 4>And probably better.</v>

2976
01:22:30.481 --> 01:22:31.530
<v Speaker 4>Like if you can eat my felonies,</v>

2977
01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:31.990
<v Speaker 4>do it all.</v>

2978
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:35.590
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing is that go to a supermarket and shop like you're at home and</v>

2979
01:22:35.591 --> 01:22:36.360
<v Speaker 4>you can get a,</v>

2980
01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.960
<v Speaker 4>a way higher end place than you would if you were renting the equivalent at a</v>

2981
01:22:40.961 --> 01:22:41.794
<v Speaker 4>hotel.</v>

2982
01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:44.020
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get like a three bedroom suite,</v>

2983
01:22:44.021 --> 01:22:45.640
<v Speaker 4>like you're going to get at your timeshare.</v>

2984
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:48.490
<v Speaker 4>But how much do you have to pay here?</v>

2985
01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2986
01:22:49.090 --> 01:22:49.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2987
01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.350
<v Speaker 4>There's not that much.</v>

2988
01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:50.801
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2989
01:22:50.801 --> 01:22:52.090
<v Speaker 4>it's probably,</v>

2990
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.800
<v Speaker 4>it's like the one I went to a,</v>

2991
01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:59.230
<v Speaker 4>I actually got suckered into doing one of those timeshare when I was 18.</v>

2992
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.790
<v Speaker 4>My stupid roommate,</v>

2993
01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:01.661
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

2994
01:23:01.661 --> 01:23:01.871
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2995
01:23:01.871 --> 01:23:02.830
<v Speaker 4>I want a vacation.</v>

2996
01:23:02.831 --> 01:23:03.280
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

2997
01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.550
<v Speaker 4>oh Brian.</v>

2998
01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 4>And then we went</v>

2999
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.850
<v Speaker 5>to Florida.</v>

3000
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:07.181
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3001
01:23:07.181 --> 01:23:08.860
<v Speaker 5>well we have to do is find a way to Florida.</v>

3002
01:23:08.861 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 5>And then we have five days in the Bahamas.</v>

3003
01:23:10.961 --> 01:23:11.291
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3004
01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:11.591
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

3005
01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:12.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3006
01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:16.030
<v Speaker 5>So we get there and we had to like fly and spend her own money to fly to Florida</v>

3007
01:23:16.031 --> 01:23:18.250
<v Speaker 5>or we could have drove there and then we get there.</v>

3008
01:23:18.251 --> 01:23:22.090
<v Speaker 5>And then like the first day we checked in to this hotel,</v>

3009
01:23:22.091 --> 01:23:22.751
<v Speaker 5>it was all paid for.</v>

3010
01:23:22.751 --> 01:23:22.991
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3011
01:23:22.991 --> 01:23:23.824
<v Speaker 5>this is sweet.</v>

3012
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:24.560
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3013
01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.080
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

3014
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:25.301
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

3015
01:23:25.301 --> 01:23:27.070
<v Speaker 5>well we got to go to this condo thing.</v>

3016
01:23:27.071 --> 01:23:29.870
<v Speaker 5>We have to just do this little thing for a couple of parameters seminar.</v>

3017
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:31.260
<v Speaker 5>And he didn't tell him.</v>

3018
01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 5>He totally did not tell him that we had to do this every day.</v>

3019
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.860
<v Speaker 5>Like for two hours a day,</v>

3020
01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:37.750
<v Speaker 5>except for like the last two days.</v>

3021
01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:38.980
<v Speaker 5>How many days were you there for?</v>

3022
01:23:38.981 --> 01:23:40.060
<v Speaker 5>I think five days.</v>

3023
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:43.720
<v Speaker 5>And so every day they just went to a new level of trying to.</v>

3024
01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.400
<v Speaker 5>And everyday I would say the same thing.</v>

3025
01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:45.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3026
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm 18.</v>

3027
01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:47.771
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3028
01:23:47.771 --> 01:23:49.690
<v Speaker 5>do you really think I can do this?</v>

3029
01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:50.680
<v Speaker 5>I Howard,</v>

3030
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:52.580
<v Speaker 5>how'd you even give me here everyday?</v>

3031
01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.830
<v Speaker 5>What were they saying to you?</v>

3032
01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.190
<v Speaker 5>They would show us the condos,</v>

3033
01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:56.410
<v Speaker 5>which they were all amazing,</v>

3034
01:23:56.411 --> 01:23:59.920
<v Speaker 5>but they would walk us around and then like the next day would go to a different</v>

3035
01:23:59.921 --> 01:24:00.490
<v Speaker 5>part of,</v>

3036
01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:01.840
<v Speaker 5>at the time it was Florida,</v>

3037
01:24:01.841 --> 01:24:02.680
<v Speaker 5>like this is what happened.</v>

3038
01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.660
<v Speaker 5>It's like last two days was in Bahamas.</v>

3039
01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.800
<v Speaker 5>He didn't tell me that either.</v>

3040
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 5>He's just like five days in Bahamas.</v>

3041
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:07.960
<v Speaker 5>But what was,</v>

3042
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.800
<v Speaker 5>it was in Pompano,</v>

3043
01:24:08.801 --> 01:24:09.880
<v Speaker 5>Florida the whole time.</v>

3044
01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:11.200
<v Speaker 5>So he just went to all these different,</v>

3045
01:24:11.201 --> 01:24:11.650
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3046
01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:12.280
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

3047
01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.080
<v Speaker 5>these condo places in Pompano.</v>

3048
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:14.900
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

3049
01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.750
<v Speaker 5>this is this so-and-so place.</v>

3050
01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:19.030
<v Speaker 5>And I know that was in the Bahamas now,</v>

3051
01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:20.620
<v Speaker 5>not the first three days.</v>

3052
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:21.780
<v Speaker 5>The last few days</v>

3053
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:26.410
<v Speaker 5>they take a boat cruise thing over to the Bahamas.</v>

3054
01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:27.880
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3055
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.930
<v Speaker 5>like three hours to Obama's on a boat in three hours.</v>

3056
01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:32.201
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3057
01:24:32.201 --> 01:24:33.100
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

3058
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:33.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3059
01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.200
<v Speaker 5>And so then,</v>

3060
01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:39.130
<v Speaker 5>but what sucked is like every day they tried to get you to sign this contract.</v>

3061
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.030
<v Speaker 5>And it was like fucking,</v>

3062
01:24:40.031 --> 01:24:40.721
<v Speaker 5>like hardcore,</v>

3063
01:24:40.721 --> 01:24:41.410
<v Speaker 5>like they were like,</v>

3064
01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:41.770
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3065
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:43.350
<v Speaker 5>you need to sit down here and talk to,</v>

3066
01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:43.950
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

3067
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:44.210
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3068
01:24:44.210 --> 01:24:46.910
<v Speaker 5>look at those young guys who were the guys that,</v>

3069
01:24:46.911 --> 01:24:47.261
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3070
01:24:47.261 --> 01:24:48.100
<v Speaker 5>these were older,</v>

3071
01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:48.963
<v Speaker 5>older guy,</v>

3072
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3073
01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:50.590
<v Speaker 5>what were they saying to you?</v>

3074
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:51.490
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>

3075
01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:53.680
<v Speaker 5>do you understand you're at the perfect age.</v>

3076
01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:55.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure your credit,</v>

3077
01:24:55.091 --> 01:24:55.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:58.440
<v Speaker 5>this will be a good investment in your life because you can like,</v>

3079
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3080
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:59.501
<v Speaker 5>rent this out,</v>

3081
01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:02.530
<v Speaker 5>sub rented out and you will always have this really cool place,</v>

3082
01:25:02.531 --> 01:25:02.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3083
01:25:02.781 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 5>in the pompanos or whatever they're telling you that if you don't use it for the</v>

3084
01:25:06.821 --> 01:25:07.660
<v Speaker 5>weeks that you get it,</v>

3085
01:25:07.661 --> 01:25:08.171
<v Speaker 5>you can rent,</v>

3086
01:25:08.171 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 5>you can rent it out to other people and making profit from it so easily it's</v>

3087
01:25:11.171 --> 01:25:12.100
<v Speaker 5>going to cost you this,</v>

3088
01:25:12.101 --> 01:25:12.790
<v Speaker 5>but you could rent it.</v>

3089
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:13.210
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3090
01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:13.780
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3091
01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.560
<v Speaker 5>And I wanted to,</v>

3092
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.700
<v Speaker 5>I want to say it was probably something like he paid once,</v>

3093
01:25:18.701 --> 01:25:20.020
<v Speaker 5>like a huge chunk of money.</v>

3094
01:25:20.021 --> 01:25:21.910
<v Speaker 5>Like I want to say it was like something ridiculous,</v>

3095
01:25:21.911 --> 01:25:26.620
<v Speaker 5>like $10,000 and then every year you pay like a maintenance fee or something</v>

3096
01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:26.861
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

3097
01:25:26.861 --> 01:25:28.180
<v Speaker 5>That's like $200,</v>

3098
01:25:28.181 --> 01:25:29.500
<v Speaker 5>I want to say it's something like that.</v>

3099
01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:31.660
<v Speaker 5>So it's a top heavy sort of thing.</v>

3100
01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:31.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3101
01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:32.920
<v Speaker 5>definitely top heavy.</v>

3102
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:33.783
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

3103
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:34.511
<v Speaker 5>they were saying like,</v>

3104
01:25:34.511 --> 01:25:34.691

3105

3110
01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:45.240
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

3111
01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.870
<v Speaker 5>to divide that 10,000 out to probably $30,000 after finance charges.</v>

3112
01:25:49.871 --> 01:25:50.081
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3113
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:50.741
<v Speaker 5>it's a scam.</v>

3114
01:25:50.741 --> 01:25:51.550
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3115
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:52.000
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3116
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:52.660

01:25:53.130 --> 01:25:55.060
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of a bit of A.</v>

3119
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:55.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

3120
01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.070
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those scams.</v>

3121
01:25:57.071 --> 01:25:58.540
<v Speaker 5>It's been around for a long time though.</v>

3122
01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.460
<v Speaker 5>The high pressure marketing scam,</v>

3123
01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:01.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3124
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:02.920
<v Speaker 5>it's like a legit scam.</v>

3125
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 5>Like you're allowed to</v>

3126
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

3127
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:06.350
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to do that.</v>

3128
01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:10.370
<v Speaker 2>That kind of like high pressure shit if you're like socially awkward or weird,</v>

3129
01:26:10.371 --> 01:26:11.870
<v Speaker 2>you could really crack people with that.</v>

3130
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:12.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3131
01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:13.920
<v Speaker 5>I was just getting really pissed.</v>

3132
01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:18.900
<v Speaker 5>And the other thing you had to pay for all the tax of all the hotels that we</v>

3133
01:26:18.901 --> 01:26:19.560
<v Speaker 5>stayed at.</v>

3134
01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.670
<v Speaker 5>So at the end they were like,</v>

3135
01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:20.941
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

3136
01:26:20.941 --> 01:26:23.190
<v Speaker 5>you owe $800 in taxes.</v>

3137
01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.670
<v Speaker 5>So I ended up having to pay like back then like Ohio days,</v>

3138
01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:27.750
<v Speaker 5>$800.</v>

3139
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:31.770
<v Speaker 5>We both had to pay $400 or something like that shit load of money that drained</v>

3140
01:26:31.771 --> 01:26:35.430
<v Speaker 5>my bank account and then like I only had $300 so my room,</v>

3141
01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:38.880
<v Speaker 5>my roommate gave me the extra hundred and then I never paid him back because I</v>

3142
01:26:38.881 --> 01:26:39.121
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

3143
01:26:39.121 --> 01:26:39.540
<v Speaker 5>look dude,</v>

3144
01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:40.470
<v Speaker 5>that was bullshit.</v>

3145
01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:42.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry that you did not tell me any of this.</v>

3146
01:26:42.811 --> 01:26:44.130
<v Speaker 5>You said we had a free vacation.</v>

3147
01:26:44.131 --> 01:26:44.581
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>

3148
01:26:44.581 --> 01:26:45.330
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't eat.</v>

3149
01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:46.710
<v Speaker 5>Made me spend an extra,</v>

3150
01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:47.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3151
01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.510
<v Speaker 5>Blah Blah amount of money.</v>

3152
01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:50.790
<v Speaker 5>And so we stopped talking ever since then.</v>

3153
01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.100
<v Speaker 5>And then we became enemies for a long time.</v>

3154
01:26:53.101 --> 01:26:55.050
<v Speaker 5>And then just because over $100.</v>

3155
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny how something like that wrong,</v>

3156
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.630
<v Speaker 2>you could just decide that that person's enemy,</v>

3157
01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:00.991
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3158
01:27:00.991 --> 01:27:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Well it was just locked me out of 100 bucks.</v>

3159
01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit man.</v>

3160
01:27:03.811 --> 01:27:04.644
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

3161
01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:06.510
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely not a vacation.</v>

3162
01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:06.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3163
01:27:06.811 --> 01:27:07.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3164
01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:07.963
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

3165
01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:08.340
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>

3166
01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:11.760
<v Speaker 2>they would probably have to pay you a lot of money to make you sit there and</v>

3167
01:27:11.761 --> 01:27:12.630
<v Speaker 2>listen to those people.</v>

3168
01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:13.860
<v Speaker 2>And in the end,</v>

3169
01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.000
<v Speaker 2>what you did spend,</v>

3170
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:19.660
<v Speaker 2>you probably could have done almost the same thing with your 400 bucks or you</v>

3171
01:27:19.661 --> 01:27:20.160
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3172
01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.800
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the hell it would have cost me.</v>

3173
01:27:21.810 --> 01:27:25.590
<v Speaker 2>How much can you go to like on the cheap to the Bahamas for and stay in the</v>

3174
01:27:25.591 --> 01:27:26.820
<v Speaker 2>cheapest place possible.</v>

3175
01:27:26.821 --> 01:27:31.821
<v Speaker 2>I bet you we ended up spending more money between the two of you both got a two</v>

3176
01:27:32.821 --> 01:27:33.654
<v Speaker 2>bedroom.</v>

3177
01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.400
<v Speaker 5>The hotels were just like,</v>

3178
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.300
<v Speaker 5>that was one thing I said like it's three and a half or above a hotel.</v>

3179
01:27:40.050 --> 01:27:41.580
<v Speaker 5>It was like very borderline.</v>

3180
01:27:41.581 --> 01:27:43.330
<v Speaker 5>It was like courtyard at the Marriott,</v>

3181
01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:43.860
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3182

3184
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:52.050

01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:00.720
<v Speaker 4>And backpack with like eight people that will see some Austin.</v>

3193
01:28:00.721 --> 01:28:00.901

3196
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:03.243
<v Speaker 4>Like if I,</v>

3197
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying I have to have four seasons and like I can't,</v>

3198
01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:07.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3199
01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:08.910
<v Speaker 4>afford to do that.</v>

3200
01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:09.773
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not,</v>

3201
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:10.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3202
01:28:11.190 --> 01:28:13.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm basically not going to take a trip if I can't do it,</v>

3203
01:28:13.561 --> 01:28:15.630
<v Speaker 4>at least at a level that I'm comfortable with,</v>

3204
01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:16.523
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3205
01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:19.620
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you most of most of the time.</v>

3206
01:28:19.710 --> 01:28:20.251
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3207
01:28:20.251 --> 01:28:20.400
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3208
01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:20.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3209
01:28:20.661 --> 01:28:23.970
<v Speaker 4>I went on that show mediator and we've been camping for five nights in the</v>

3210
01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:25.260
<v Speaker 4>Missouri breaks.</v>

3211
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:26.131
<v Speaker 4>But that's a trip.</v>

3212
01:28:26.131 --> 01:28:28.110
<v Speaker 4>Usury River brain want to do that,</v>

3213
01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:29.340
<v Speaker 4>that you want that experience.</v>

3214
01:28:29.341 --> 01:28:32.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying I'm not saying like if that experience were presented to me,</v>

3215
01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.930
<v Speaker 4>I would consider that for what it is.</v>

3216
01:28:34.230 --> 01:28:35.940
<v Speaker 4>But I'm not like I met a dude who was like,</v>

3217
01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:37.080
<v Speaker 4>you haven't been to the Bahamas.</v>

3218
01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:38.250
<v Speaker 4>I went on a mail boat,</v>

3219
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:43.220
<v Speaker 4>like bringing mail over and like slept with like basically the mail carrier and</v>

3220
01:28:43.221 --> 01:28:44.160
<v Speaker 4>like the end the letters.</v>

3221
01:28:44.161 --> 01:28:44.611
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3222
01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:45.060
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>

3223
01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:46.200
<v Speaker 4>you know what the product is that.</v>

3224
01:28:46.230 --> 01:28:46.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3225
01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:48.560
<v Speaker 5>The problem with that is though I am the same way,</v>

3226
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:49.880
<v Speaker 5>but I'm kind of grumpy.</v>

3227
01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:50.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting old.</v>

3228
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm the older,</v>

3229
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:51.660
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

3230
01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:51.910
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

3231
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:52.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3232
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:56.330
<v Speaker 5>I went on this trip to Joshua tree where we stayed in this like little rv and I</v>

3233
01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:57.164
<v Speaker 5>was so against,</v>

3235
01:28:57.381 --> 01:28:57.651

3239
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:03.070
<v Speaker 5>Like what can we just stay somewhere nice?</v>

3240
01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:07.140
<v Speaker 5>And I was being a bitch about the whole thing until we got there and it ended up</v>

3241
01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:08.310
<v Speaker 5>being the coolest adventure ever.</v>

3242
01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:09.390
<v Speaker 5>Like I would never have done it,</v>

3243
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.810

<v Speaker 5>I've just been grumpy.</v>

3249
01:29:20.861 --> 01:29:21.541
<v Speaker 5>But that's again,</v>

3250
01:29:21.541 --> 01:29:22.890
<v Speaker 5>like a specific instance</v>

3251
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:24.170

<v Speaker 4>it is going something like that.</v>

3255
01:29:31.670 --> 01:29:32.061
<v Speaker 4>If you go,</v>

3256
01:29:32.061 --> 01:29:32.780
<v Speaker 4>if somebody goes,</v>

3257
01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:33.201
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

01:30:27.551 --> 01:30:27.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3298
01:30:27.761 --> 01:30:28.510
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

3299
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:29.021
<v Speaker 1>In the middle of that,</v>

3300
01:30:29.021 --> 01:30:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I had a gap and go,</v>

3301
01:30:30.071 --> 01:30:31.270
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking kidding me?</v>

3302
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:32.740
<v Speaker 1>But this was when we were kids.</v>

3303
01:30:32.770 --> 01:30:35.050
<v Speaker 1>We were both like in our early twenties,</v>

3304
01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.520
<v Speaker 1>just like in the early nineties.</v>

3305
01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:40.790
<v Speaker 4>Couple of years ago I stayed at the West Palm Beach head is a condo and I was</v>

3306
01:30:40.791 --> 01:30:42.920
<v Speaker 4>down there and my buddy chuck came to town,</v>

3307
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:45.950
<v Speaker 4>Chuck's 65 to 90 big,</v>

3308
01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:46.813
<v Speaker 4>big dude.</v>

3309
01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:47.720
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>

3310
01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:48.111
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

3314
01:30:51.670 --> 01:30:52.503
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3315
01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:53.080
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

3316
01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.380
<v Speaker 4>a bedroom and living room.</v>

3317
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:55.161
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3318
01:30:55.161 --> 01:30:55.461
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3319
01:30:55.461 --> 01:30:56.294
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

3320
01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:59.420
<v Speaker 4>lays in the bed and like,</v>

3321
01:30:59.421 --> 01:31:02.990
<v Speaker 4>before I even can sit down I hear him,</v>

3322
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:04.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3323
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.560
<v Speaker 4>like not just snoring but he also grinds his teeth.</v>

3324
01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:07.540
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3325
01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:11.760
<v Speaker 5>And it sounded like a monster was doing it because he's such an enormous person.</v>

3326
01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:13.110
<v Speaker 5>I laid on the couch</v>

3327
01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:16.140
<v Speaker 4>in that condo with my noise canceling headphones,</v>

3328
01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:18.311
<v Speaker 5>a sun,</v>

3329
01:31:18.311 --> 01:31:22.030
<v Speaker 5>like a shirt over my eyes so that like block it out and a mouth guard in my</v>

3330
01:31:22.031 --> 01:31:22.864
<v Speaker 5>mouth.</v>

3331
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:25.030
<v Speaker 5>And he came out and he was like,</v>

3332
01:31:25.031 --> 01:31:26.370
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

3333
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.680
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

3334
01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:27.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3335
01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:27.431
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

3336
01:31:27.431 --> 01:31:27.701
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3337
01:31:27.701 --> 01:31:30.010
<v Speaker 5>you came to visit and now you've ruined my night.</v>

3338
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.940
<v Speaker 5>That's what happened.</v>

3339
01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.660
<v Speaker 5>That snoring is grown.</v>

3340
01:31:34.661 --> 01:31:36.330
<v Speaker 5>Like a grinding things to worse.</v>

3341
01:31:36.331 --> 01:31:37.970
<v Speaker 5>That's just scary sounding.</v>

3342
01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:38.191
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3343
01:31:38.191 --> 01:31:39.024
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3344
01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:40.960
<v Speaker 5>why do people do that?</v>

3345
01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:42.340
<v Speaker 5>They say it's or whatever.</v>

3346
01:31:42.341 --> 01:31:42.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3347
01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:43.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm a clincher.</v>

3348
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:44.440
<v Speaker 5>Like the dentist said like,</v>

3349
01:31:44.441 --> 01:31:44.591
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3350
01:31:44.591 --> 01:31:45.690
<v Speaker 5>that's actually okay.</v>

3351
01:31:45.730 --> 01:31:47.710
<v Speaker 5>You clench and that's why you have really strong.</v>

3352
01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Many of my teeth are cracked from weightlifting.</v>

3353
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:51.350
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3354
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3355
01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Really your teeth are cracked from Ms Dot some serious weight,</v>

3356
01:31:56.961 --> 01:31:57.380
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3357
01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:58.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very strong person.</v>

3358
01:31:58.431 --> 01:31:59.264
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3359
01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:02.683
<v Speaker 2>my man.</v>

3360
01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:03.850
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3361
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:05.500
<v Speaker 2>he told me where a mouth guard when I lift weights.</v>

3362
01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:06.550
<v Speaker 2>No Shit.</v>

3363
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3364
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:08.103
<v Speaker 2>it's probably.</v>

3365
01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:11.410
<v Speaker 2>We do like squats years hitting the bag as well.</v>

3366
01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I only hit the bag with the mouthpiece on.</v>

3367
01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:13.990
<v Speaker 2>When do you.</v>

3368
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:15.280
<v Speaker 2>When you bite down,</v>

3369
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.260
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're really digging into something,</v>

3370
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:20.200
<v Speaker 2>you actually lose a lot of power if you don't bite down.</v>

3371
01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:21.250
<v Speaker 2>It's really strange.</v>

3372
01:32:21.490 --> 01:32:22.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it.</v>

3373
01:32:22.710 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't really want it.</v>

3374
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3375
01:32:24.090 --> 01:32:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3376
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:26.770
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like you can hit his heart when your mouth is open.</v>

3377
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like your whole body needs.</v>

3378
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:33.950
<v Speaker 2>It needs to work together as you explode out on impact and when your mouth is</v>

3379
01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:35.380
<v Speaker 2>open a little.</v>

3380
01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lack of,</v>

3381
01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:37.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3382
01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.631
<v Speaker 2>of power to that.</v>

3383
01:32:38.631 --> 01:32:39.580
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of strange,</v>

3384
01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's very difficult to get full bounty of,</v>

3385
01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.060
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3386
01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:45.880
<v Speaker 2>of power and explosive energy when you have your mouth open.</v>

3387
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:50.830
<v Speaker 2>They actually did like tests on it and I think it was the basis of one of those</v>

3388
01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:51.940
<v Speaker 2>mouth guards they had.</v>

3389
01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:56.230
<v Speaker 2>They had like this power guard where they proved that like if have a bit down on</v>

3390
01:32:56.231 --> 01:32:56.360
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3391
01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.900
<v Speaker 2>it actually increased the amount of weight you can lift.</v>

3392
01:32:59.170 --> 01:32:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3393
01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3394
01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:00.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3395
01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Like they aligned your jaw in a certain way that increased the amount of power</v>

3396
01:33:05.591 --> 01:33:06.041
<v Speaker 2>that your,</v>

3397
01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:06.874
<v Speaker 2>your body hand.</v>

3398
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:08.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>

3399
01:33:08.441 --> 01:33:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why that would be the case button for some reason.</v>

3400
01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:13.660
<v Speaker 2>You can't hit his heart when your mouse open.</v>

3401
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.930
<v Speaker 4>That's really interesting.</v>

3402
01:33:14.931 --> 01:33:15.910
<v Speaker 4>I know like you know,</v>

3403
01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.320
<v Speaker 4>breathing can affect like how you like,</v>

3404
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.720
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3405
01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:24.110
<v Speaker 4>like holding your breath versus breathing related to a lot of physical things</v>

3406
01:33:24.330 --> 01:33:25.280
<v Speaker 4>makes a huge difference.</v>

3407
01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.193
<v Speaker 4>Huge difference.</v>

3408
01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:31.660
<v Speaker 4>And being able to sustain like a an in and out breath versus like holding your</v>

3409
01:33:31.911 --> 01:33:35.680
<v Speaker 4>breath is one of the biggest issues in Jujitsu is breathing</v>

3410
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:36.531
<v Speaker 2>me how to breathe.</v>

3411
01:33:36.531 --> 01:33:36.801
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3412
01:33:36.801 --> 01:33:41.801
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the really the best guys are all really into yoga and Pranayama</v>

3413
01:33:42.471 --> 01:33:44.660
<v Speaker 2>and learning breathing techniques and stuff like that.</v>

3414
01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Because if you can control your breath and your,</v>

3415
01:33:47.301 --> 01:33:47.570
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3416
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:50.990
<v Speaker 2>your diaphragm is a muscle that you can control.</v>

3417
01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Much like you can control your arms,</v>

3418
01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:54.043
<v Speaker 2>your legs.</v>

3419
01:33:54.230 --> 01:33:56.230
<v Speaker 2>And there's certain guys like this dude,</v>

3420
01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Hixon Gracie is like the greatest Jujitsu guy ever.</v>

3421
01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:03.280
<v Speaker 2>He does all this crazy yoga shit with his stomach where a stomach in.</v>

3422
01:34:03.281 --> 01:34:04.850
<v Speaker 2>It's really freaky to watch man.</v>

3423
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:09.230
<v Speaker 2>But the guy has absolute control of his breathing.</v>

3424
01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:09.891
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

3425
01:34:09.891 --> 01:34:10.730
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

3426
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:12.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean not just because of that,</v>

3427
01:34:12.111 --> 01:34:14.780
<v Speaker 2>because he's also incredibly talented.</v>

3428
01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Just has a wealth of knowledge of Jujitsu.</v>

3429
01:34:18.891 --> 01:34:19.370
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

3430
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:20.160
<v Speaker 2>he's a master,</v>

3431
01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.350
<v Speaker 2>a true master.</v>

3432
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:24.440
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that he's also a Yogi.</v>

3433
01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3434
01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Not that breathing shit is like.</v>

3435
01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:28.880
<v Speaker 2>It's super important.</v>

3436
01:34:28.881 --> 01:34:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Coordinating your breath with striking as well,</v>

3437
01:34:31.071 --> 01:34:32.150
<v Speaker 2>not just with the Jujitsu.</v>

3438
01:34:32.450 --> 01:34:33.650
<v Speaker 2>When you kick the bag,</v>

3439
01:34:33.651 --> 01:34:34.490
<v Speaker 2>when you kick a person,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3461
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:11.270
<v Speaker 2>like you're tightening up as you're delivering the shot and also to protect you</v>

3462
01:35:11.271 --> 01:35:12.740
<v Speaker 2>a little bit if you get hit yourself.</v>

3463
01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:13.701
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of the,</v>

3464
01:35:13.701 --> 01:35:13.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3465
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:16.980
<v Speaker 4>like the heavy bench press guys with,</v>

3466
01:35:16.990 --> 01:35:18.580
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to wrap out on heavy weight.</v>

3467
01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:20.480
<v Speaker 4>It's always a one in one out.</v>

3468
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Take one breath in and push it out with one breath.</v>

3469
01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.280
<v Speaker 4>And that's how they try to do like two,</v>

3470
01:35:27.281 --> 01:35:27.831
<v Speaker 4>25,</v>

3471
01:35:27.831 --> 01:35:29.120
<v Speaker 4>like 30 fucking times.</v>

3472
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:30.410
<v Speaker 4>That shit is like,</v>

3473
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:31.303
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

3474
01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:31.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3475
01:35:31.641 --> 01:35:32.474
<v Speaker 4>it's better than going.</v>

3476
01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.460
<v Speaker 4>You hold your breath and you're totally fucks up the rhythm of it.</v>

3477
01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:41.290
<v Speaker 2>You know what's crazy and to do what's really hard to do that I enjoy doing.</v>

3478
01:35:41.291 --> 01:35:44.830
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it as an exercise is a minute in a minute out.</v>

3479
01:35:45.010 --> 01:35:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3480
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3481
01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I take a one minute breath in,</v>

3482
01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:49.841
<v Speaker 2>a slow,</v>

3483
01:35:49.841 --> 01:35:54.841
<v Speaker 2>one minute breath in and then a slow one minute breath out and it's very hard to</v>

3484
01:35:55.301 --> 01:35:58.690
<v Speaker 2>not freak out and just talk in the middle of it.</v>

3485
01:35:58.691 --> 01:35:59.471
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to.</v>

3486
01:35:59.471 --> 01:36:01.190
<v Speaker 2>I do like 30 seconds back there at a lot.</v>

3487
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I do it in the tank and that's how I start my tank sessions.</v>

3488
01:36:05.141 --> 01:36:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I start my tank sessions by completely controlling via always been alive,</v>

3489
01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:09.910
<v Speaker 2>breathing and.</v>

3522
01:36:43.061 --> 01:36:44.610
<v Speaker 2>pointers and uh,</v>

3523
01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:45.311
<v Speaker 2>because uh,</v>

3524
01:36:45.311 --> 01:36:45.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3525
01:36:45.551 --> 01:36:46.061
<v Speaker 2>I had some,</v>

3526
01:36:46.061 --> 01:36:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I had a bulging disc in my back that's actually been getting better,</v>

3527
01:36:49.121 --> 01:36:52.990
<v Speaker 2>but denny went through some back issues himself and he did like a very strict</v>

3528
01:36:52.991 --> 01:36:55.340
<v Speaker 2>regiment of yoga and um,</v>

3529
01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.273
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3530
01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.113
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3531
01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.580
<v Speaker 2>like it was like a type of a tension.</v>

3532
01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:03.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like a spinal decompression where it's like literally like pulling your</v>

3533
01:37:03.611 --> 01:37:04.840
<v Speaker 2>neck while this cord.</v>

3534
01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:05.711
<v Speaker 2>And he did this,</v>

3535
01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:09.970
<v Speaker 2>like very disciplined over course of like five or six weeks or something like</v>

3536
01:37:09.971 --> 01:37:11.080
<v Speaker 2>that and fixed his issue.</v>

3537
01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Denny</v>

3538
01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:12.610
<v Speaker 4>has that quality too,</v>

3539
01:37:12.611 --> 01:37:12.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3540
01:37:12.821 --> 01:37:17.140
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about how you can sense bad energy and less dangerous.</v>

3541
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:19.150
<v Speaker 4>Denny to me has,</v>

3542
01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:19.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3543
01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:21.640
<v Speaker 4>like just being around him a few moments.</v>

3544
01:37:21.641 --> 01:37:23.770
<v Speaker 4>You sense like a type of balance?</v>

3545
01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:27.610
<v Speaker 4>I get the feeling from him that I do from a lot of people who are very</v>

3546
01:37:27.611 --> 01:37:28.444
<v Speaker 4>disciplined.</v>

3547
01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.160
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain intensity to them,</v>

3548
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:31.690
<v Speaker 4>but there's also like a certain amount,</v>

3549
01:37:31.691 --> 01:37:35.350
<v Speaker 4>like you can feel like their control at work,</v>

3550
01:37:35.410 --> 01:37:37.930
<v Speaker 4>like there's such discipline characters a lot of times,</v>

3551
01:37:37.931 --> 01:37:39.490
<v Speaker 4>like really good athletes.</v>

3552
01:37:39.670 --> 01:37:42.340
<v Speaker 4>There's that like energy that they bring into a room,</v>

3553
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:43.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3554
01:37:43.061 --> 01:37:43.620
<v Speaker 4>like I know these,</v>

3555
01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:46.420
<v Speaker 4>like these guys that do like triathlons and stuff,</v>

3556
01:37:46.421 --> 01:37:47.230
<v Speaker 4>they have this,</v>

3557
01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:49.300
<v Speaker 4>it's like a quiet intensity to them.</v>

3558
01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:50.560
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>

3559
01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.530
<v Speaker 4>you meet them and you can feel their presence.</v>

3560
01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 4>Their discipline comes through just in there</v>

3561
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:57.120
<v Speaker 2>when they speak to you.</v>

3562
01:37:57.210 --> 01:37:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3563
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:58.590
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

3564
01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Now the best time for people to be around the best type of people to be around</v>

3565
01:38:02.150 --> 01:38:02.761
<v Speaker 2>good influence.</v>

3566
01:38:02.761 --> 01:38:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Control apps.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Inspirational influence.</v>

3569
01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

3570
01:38:06.330 --> 01:38:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

3571
01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:07.490
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3572
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Denny Denny is definitely inspirational.</v>

3573
01:38:09.301 --> 01:38:09.751
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>

3574
01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I love them.</v>

3575
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that I've seen him as a young man.</v>

3576
01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:15.780
<v Speaker 2>So I met him when he was very young.</v>

3577
01:38:15.781 --> 01:38:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 17 or 18 and he was always a cool kid.</v>

3578
01:38:18.721 --> 01:38:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3579
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.920
<v Speaker 2>even back then it was great.</v>

3580
01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.060
<v Speaker 2>But to see him evolve and develop and become the man he is now,</v>

3581
01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:25.110
<v Speaker 2>I love seeing that.</v>

3582
01:38:25.111 --> 01:38:25.381
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3583
01:38:25.381 --> 01:38:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I love seeing people progress and I love seeing people get it together,</v>

3584
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:30.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3585
01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:32.640
<v Speaker 2>like I was telling Tony Hinchcliffe the other day,</v>

3586
01:38:32.641 --> 01:38:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I had him on the podcast and I was like,</v>

3587
01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:37.740
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that in the time I've known you,</v>

3588
01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:39.390
<v Speaker 2>you became a really good comedian.</v>

3589
01:38:39.450 --> 01:38:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3590
01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:40.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3591
01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.460
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

3592
01:38:41.461 --> 01:38:42.061
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

3593
01:38:42.061 --> 01:38:43.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know a guy.</v>

3594
01:38:43.141 --> 01:38:45.570
<v Speaker 2>He started out and then I meet him a couple of years later.</v>

3595
01:38:45.571 --> 01:38:46.320
<v Speaker 2>He's a great comedian.</v>

3596
01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3597
01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:47.000
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

3598
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:47.880
<v Speaker 2>We got one right there.</v>

3599
01:38:47.881 --> 01:38:48.541
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty awesome.</v>

3600
01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:49.470
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking amazing.</v>

3601
01:38:49.471 --> 01:38:50.070
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>

3602
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.731
<v Speaker 2>I love Tony.</v>

3603
01:38:50.731 --> 01:38:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

3604
01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:52.920
<v Speaker 2>That guy is so funny.</v>

3605
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:55.430
<v Speaker 2>He's a total natural and like,</v>

3606
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:55.720
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3607
01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:56.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3608
01:38:56.190 --> 01:38:58.560
<v Speaker 2>the best comics are the ones that can't even help themselves.</v>

3609
01:38:58.800 --> 01:38:59.131
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

3610
01:38:59.131 --> 01:39:01.470
<v Speaker 2>if a joke is in the room to be said,</v>

3611
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:02.431
<v Speaker 2>he just jumped.</v>

3612
01:39:02.431 --> 01:39:04.080
<v Speaker 2>He dives on it like a fucking grenade.</v>

3613
01:39:04.081 --> 01:39:04.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3614
01:39:04.321 --> 01:39:05.040
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

3615
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I love that feeling with comics.</v>

3616
01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.673
<v Speaker 2>I love the um,</v>

3617
01:39:07.710 --> 01:39:11.670
<v Speaker 2>and I love seeing like I have so many friends who I started out with who I'm</v>

3618
01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.760
<v Speaker 2>proud of just watching them as my friends.</v>

3619
01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:17.040

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:19.420

<v Speaker 2>I love that dude.</v>

3625
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3626
01:39:20.610 --> 01:39:21.930
<v Speaker 2>he can't help himself either.</v>

3627
01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:22.920
<v Speaker 2>You're in the room.</v>

3628
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Great personality.</v>

3629
01:39:23.821 --> 01:39:27.720
<v Speaker 2>That guy is the best fun and he's a.</v>

3630
01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:28.441

3631
01:39:28.441 --> 01:39:28.681
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3632

3634
01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:33.900
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy.</v>

3635
01:39:33.930 --> 01:39:34.860
<v Speaker 2>There's certain guys like that,</v>

3636
01:39:34.861 --> 01:39:36.060
<v Speaker 2>like we only talked a little bit,</v>

3637
01:39:36.061 --> 01:39:37.190
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell right away.</v>

3638
01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:38.063
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>

3639
01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:38.963
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>

3640
01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:39.893
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:40.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3642
01:39:40.381 --> 01:39:42.390
<v Speaker 2>he had the week off and I asked him to come with,</v>

3643
01:39:42.450 --> 01:39:44.910
<v Speaker 2>to do the show that I'm saying Thursday,</v>

3644
01:39:44.911 --> 01:39:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Saturday and Sunday and he fucking like,</v>

3645
01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:49.440
<v Speaker 2>brought the house down every set it was honestly.</v>

3646
01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:50.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3647
01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine he'd be really funny.</v>

3648
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3649
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that came to the show,</v>

3650
01:39:54.861 --> 01:39:56.670
<v Speaker 2>it's Friday night and weekend.</v>

3651
01:39:56.671 --> 01:39:57.481
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

3652
01:39:57.481 --> 01:39:58.314
<v Speaker 2>You guys were awesome.</v>

3653
01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:00.660
<v Speaker 2>San Jose was the shit that was the shit.</v>

3654
01:40:00.690 --> 01:40:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Northern California might be the best place on earth.</v>

3655
01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:03.630
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

3656
01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:04.650
<v Speaker 2>It really might be.</v>

3657
01:40:04.651 --> 01:40:04.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3658
01:40:04.891 --> 01:40:06.180
<v Speaker 2>the weather's not the best.</v>

3659
01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:07.073
<v Speaker 2>It's not the best,</v>

3660
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.840
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like human beings as far as intelligence,</v>

3661
01:40:09.841 --> 01:40:11.490
<v Speaker 2>like vibing with human beings,</v>

3662
01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:15.090
<v Speaker 2>I think I vibed better with Northern California people than anybody on the</v>

3663
01:40:15.091 --> 01:40:15.740
<v Speaker 2>planet really.</v>

3664
01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:16.573
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

3665
01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I have some friends that live up there and whenever I go to hang with them,</v>

3666
01:40:19.531 --> 01:40:20.220
<v Speaker 2>I always feel like,</v>

3667
01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:20.820
<v Speaker 2>God dammit,</v>

3668
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:22.200
<v Speaker 2>why don't I live in northern California?</v>

3669
01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:22.800
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

3670
01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.090
<v Speaker 2>It's better is it?</v>

3671
01:40:24.091 --> 01:40:24.301
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3672
01:40:24.301 --> 01:40:24.961
<v Speaker 2>the weather sucks.</v>

3673
01:40:24.961 --> 01:40:25.794
<v Speaker 2>The Fat Dick Though,</v>

3674
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:30.600
<v Speaker 2>unless you know that's only a negative if you don't enjoy sucking dicks.</v>

3675
01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3676
01:40:30.810 --> 01:40:32.430
<v Speaker 2>but if you enjoy sucking fat decks,</v>

3677
01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking from my own personal perspective and I'm not trying to be</v>

3678
01:40:35.431 --> 01:40:36.540
<v Speaker 2>sexist or homophobic.</v>

3679
01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are too big to really get in your mouth.</v>

3680
01:40:38.791 --> 01:40:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3681
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Especially if it's like a demon dick or a big giant word.</v>

3682
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Harm the only ones a mouth.</v>

3683
01:40:43.141 --> 01:40:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

3684
01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:45.570
<v Speaker 2>That's not beyond the realm of possibility.</v>

3685
01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I watched a chimp fuck a frog.</v>

3686
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:48.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3687
01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:50.250
<v Speaker 2>watching chimp fucking frogs face.</v>

3688
01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:51.453
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

3689
01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:52.130
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3690
01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Has a video of it.</v>

3691
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of it online and we've seen it.</v>

3692
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Put CV.</v>

3693
01:40:55.330 --> 01:40:55.721
<v Speaker 2>Pull it up,</v>

3694
01:40:55.721 --> 01:40:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy.</v>

3695
01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I have seen a poor knows where I see the girl really struggled to get a guy's</v>

3696
01:41:01.391 --> 01:41:02.860
<v Speaker 2>soft dick into her mouth and I'm like,</v>

3697
01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 2>that's a big Dick right there.</v>

3698
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.120
<v Speaker 2>She's really struggling with his limp.</v>

3699
01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:10.570
<v Speaker 2>She like her mouth is all dry.</v>

3700
01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3701
01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:13.180
<v Speaker 2>That's really fucking stretching under all that.</v>

3702
01:41:13.181 --> 01:41:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Math is tough to generate saliva,</v>

3703
01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:19.060
<v Speaker 2>dry blow jobs that take too long.</v>

3704
01:41:19.061 --> 01:41:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Dry blow jobs take too long.</v>

3705
01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:21.633
<v Speaker 2>That's a</v>

3706
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:23.561
<v Speaker 2>chimp rapes.</v>

3707
01:41:23.561 --> 01:41:25.930
<v Speaker 2>A frog maybe makes this frog suck him off.</v>

3708
01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:31.170
<v Speaker 2>So because we know this exists because we know that this chimp takes this frog</v>

3709
01:41:31.511 --> 01:41:35.650
<v Speaker 2>and picks it up and puts it on his little chimp cock and Fox it because we know</v>

3710
01:41:35.651 --> 01:41:36.400
<v Speaker 2>that exists.</v>

3711
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that preposterous to propose that in an alternate world there</v>

3712
01:41:41.441 --> 01:41:43.780
<v Speaker 2>could be a giant boar that makes you suck.</v>

3713
01:41:43.781 --> 01:41:46.310
<v Speaker 2>His cock he wants to do is hold a personality flaw.</v>

3714
01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:47.650
<v Speaker 2>Rape in that mouth right now,</v>

3715
01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:51.030
<v Speaker 2>fucks it up night with them,</v>

3716
01:41:51.190 --> 01:41:51.850
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

3717
01:41:51.850 --> 01:41:53.650
<v Speaker 2>this is not the only time this has happened.</v>

3718
01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.690
<v Speaker 2>There's another video of a chimp fucking a frog.</v>

3719
01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Apparently when chimps get frogs,</v>

3720
01:41:57.191 --> 01:42:00.730
<v Speaker 2>they fuck them beat off using that fraud.</v>

3721
01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:01.590
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

3722
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:04.750
<v Speaker 2>this is some shit we never saw a mutual of Omaha's wild kingdom.</v>

3723
01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:06.880
<v Speaker 2>They would have edited this out.</v>

3724
01:42:07.090 --> 01:42:09.160
<v Speaker 2>We need the internet to give us this information.</v>

3725
01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Mutual of Omaha's wild kingdom would have you believe that chimps are cute</v>

3726
01:42:12.431 --> 01:42:16.870
<v Speaker 2>friends to be taken with on rides in semis on sitcoms.</v>

3727
01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:17.830
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

3728
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:18.850
<v Speaker 2>This is what they are.</v>

3729
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:19.601
<v Speaker 2>Ship is busted.</v>

3730
01:42:19.601 --> 01:42:22.030
<v Speaker 2>I received this murderous frog rapers.</v>

3731
01:42:22.031 --> 01:42:22.510
<v Speaker 2>To be fair.</v>

3732
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:23.680
<v Speaker 2>I bet it does feel pretty decent.</v>

3733
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Probably feels good.</v>

3734
01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I feel better about your own impulsive,</v>

3735
01:42:27.250 --> 01:42:28.690
<v Speaker 2>like nature when you see that.</v>

3736
01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3737
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I would try snake that like,</v>

3738
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:31.990
<v Speaker 2>like cut off the head and fuck the snake.</v>

3739
01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:33.161
<v Speaker 2>Not a bad idea,</v>

3740
01:42:33.161 --> 01:42:36.400
<v Speaker 2>but the whole you need a whole frogs have a nice big hole.</v>

3741
01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:37.241
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3742
01:42:37.241 --> 01:42:40.390
<v Speaker 2>if you can keep them from clamping down on your cock and balls and I think that</v>

3743
01:42:40.391 --> 01:42:42.910
<v Speaker 2>maybe chimps probably have a much more leathery skin.</v>

3744
01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Then I think that was the whole idea in the beginning.</v>

3745
01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:46.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3746
01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:49.930
<v Speaker 2>we had more leathery skin and then that's why the head retracted.</v>

3747
01:42:49.931 --> 01:42:52.360
<v Speaker 2>You have the sensitive tip and that's what makes you shoot,</v>

3748
01:42:52.570 --> 01:42:56.320
<v Speaker 2>but the average cock back in the day was probably a lot tougher than the Kochs</v>

3749
01:42:56.321 --> 01:42:56.980
<v Speaker 2>have today.</v>

3750
01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:58.690
<v Speaker 2>What is fucking dicks today?</v>

3751
01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:00.580
<v Speaker 2>They can't take branches.</v>

3752
01:43:00.610 --> 01:43:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Snap it into them are rubbing up against gravel where you fucking try to climb</v>

3753
01:43:04.421 --> 01:43:05.620
<v Speaker 2>up the rocks at the beach.</v>

3754
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Now these cops are today or a week.</v>

3755
01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3756
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.490
<v Speaker 2>because you would,</v>

3757
01:43:08.490 --> 01:43:09.200
<v Speaker 2>you would funk,</v>

3758
01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.150
<v Speaker 2>you would fuck winches,</v>

3759
01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:11.980
<v Speaker 2>winches and you wouldn't wash it off.</v>

3760
01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:12.480
<v Speaker 2>You're just like,</v>

3761
01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.360
<v Speaker 2>you know that winches.</v>

3762
01:43:13.361 --> 01:43:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Is that what they used to become?</v>

3763
01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Winch a winch winches?</v>

3764
01:43:16.031 --> 01:43:16.160
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3765
01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:16.841
<v Speaker 2>Fuck a winch.</v>

3766
01:43:16.841 --> 01:43:20.080
<v Speaker 2>A winch is a thing you put on the back of a truck to pull a log out of a ditch</v>

3767
01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:21.310
<v Speaker 2>that's a winch,</v>

3768
01:43:21.610 --> 01:43:22.990
<v Speaker 2>a winch winches.</v>

3769
01:43:22.991 --> 01:43:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I think the look because I got in trouble for saying winches on fear factor was</v>

3770
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:28.180
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3771
01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:28.870
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

3772
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:30.640
<v Speaker 2>I was just trying to motivate a girl.</v>

3773
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:31.330
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3774
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:33.750
<v Speaker 2>she was on an all girls fear factor and um,</v>

3775
01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:35.560
<v Speaker 2>there was these other girls there were saying,</v>

3776
01:43:35.561 --> 01:43:36.161
<v Speaker 2>don't do it.</v>

3777
01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Don't do it though,</v>

3778
01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:37.660
<v Speaker 2>because she,</v>

3779
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:40.450
<v Speaker 2>she was scared and so they were trying to make her more scared and I said,</v>

3780
01:43:40.451 --> 01:43:40.720
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3781
01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:40.991
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3782
01:43:40.991 --> 01:43:41.291
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3783
01:43:41.291 --> 01:43:41.680
<v Speaker 2>listen to me.</v>

3784
01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Don't listen to those caddy winches.</v>

3785
01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:44.021
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3786
01:43:44.021 --> 01:43:44.854
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

3787
01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.330
<v Speaker 2>like what would a winch be today?</v>

3788
01:43:46.331 --> 01:43:46.571
<v Speaker 2>Like A.</v>

3789
01:43:46.571 --> 01:43:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3790
01:43:47.110 --> 01:43:47.590
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

3791
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:48.423
<v Speaker 2>The parent.</v>

3792
01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.170
<v Speaker 2>What they said what the why.</v>

3793
01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:53.180
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I got in is because apparently a wench is like a prostitute.</v>

3794
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:54.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3795
01:43:54.531 --> 01:43:56.150
<v Speaker 2>we're talking medieval time folks.</v>

3796
01:43:56.151 --> 01:43:56.451
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3797
01:43:56.451 --> 01:43:57.261
<v Speaker 2>Is it really,</v>

3798
01:43:57.261 --> 01:43:58.430
<v Speaker 2>is that what it really means?</v>

3799
01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:00.530
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean what it means.</v>

3800
01:44:00.531 --> 01:44:02.720
<v Speaker 2>The cultural context and the cultural context.</v>

3801
01:44:02.721 --> 01:44:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Where I grew up in Boston,</v>

3802
01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:05.840
<v Speaker 2>a wench was a like,</v>

3803
01:44:05.970 --> 01:44:06.500
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

3804
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 2>fucking wench is like,</v>

3805
01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:09.170
<v Speaker 2>she was kind of a bitch.</v>

3806
01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:10.430
<v Speaker 2>She was like a little bitch.</v>

3807
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.760
<v Speaker 2>I trust,</v>

3808
01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3809
01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:11.771
<v Speaker 2>winches and,</v>

3810
01:44:11.771 --> 01:44:15.380
<v Speaker 2>and so a caddy winch would not be a prostitute.</v>

3811
01:44:15.381 --> 01:44:19.520
<v Speaker 2>It would be a chick that talks too fucking much and is trying to damage a young</v>

3812
01:44:19.521 --> 01:44:23.180
<v Speaker 2>ladies confidence in completing a challenge for $50,000.</v>

3813
01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Wench Patty wench.</v>

3814
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:30.500
<v Speaker 2>But people get all upset they got or they got all upset and this was back in the</v>

3815
01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:31.430
<v Speaker 2>day and this is a fear factor,</v>

3816
01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:33.560
<v Speaker 2>like season two or something like that.</v>

3817
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:34.910
<v Speaker 2>It's not like today.</v>

3818
01:44:34.911 --> 01:44:36.410
<v Speaker 2>If you said anything like that today,</v>

3819
01:44:36.411 --> 01:44:37.400
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably get arrested.</v>

3820
01:44:38.290 --> 01:44:38.570
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3821
01:44:38.570 --> 01:44:42.940
<v Speaker 5>somebody tweeted like that rh sit on his recent podcast,</v>

3822
01:44:42.941 --> 01:44:46.550
<v Speaker 5>a punch drunk that he doesn't believe half the stories I say that story is</v>

3823
01:44:46.551 --> 01:44:46.881
<v Speaker 5>useful.</v>

3824
01:44:46.881 --> 01:44:47.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3825
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.720
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3826
01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.021
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3827
01:44:48.021 --> 01:44:48.530
<v Speaker 5>How?</v>

3828
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:49.620
<v Speaker 5>Why would I wake make no?</v>

3829
01:44:49.730 --> 01:44:54.680
<v Speaker 5>How would I make that shit up that even me merely because you're a little</v>

3830
01:44:54.681 --> 01:44:55.514
<v Speaker 5>awkward,</v>

3831
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:56.470
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3832
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:57.303
<v Speaker 5>A little.</v>

3833
01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.440
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

3834
01:44:59.850 --> 01:45:04.850
<v Speaker 2>And you've been known to tell a story a bit on the exaggerating side</v>

3835
01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.620
<v Speaker 5>to make it more exciting.</v>

3836
01:45:06.621 --> 01:45:07.130
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

3837
01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:07.963
<v Speaker 5>Occasionally.</v>

3838
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:11.090
<v Speaker 5>But that doesn't mean that you're not a liar.</v>

3839
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:12.170
<v Speaker 5>I really think,</v>

3840
01:45:12.250 --> 01:45:12.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3841
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:15.510
<v Speaker 5>just need to follow me around to these massage parlors and stuff like that.</v>

3842
01:45:15.511 --> 01:45:16.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe me.</v>

3843
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:16.491
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3844
01:45:16.491 --> 01:45:21.491
<v Speaker 5>You also live an extraordinary life sexually that I'm sure he's not really able</v>

3845
01:45:22.521 --> 01:45:26.430
<v Speaker 5>to deal with that because he knew you back in the day when you were kind of a</v>

3846
01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:28.120
<v Speaker 5>zero and a.</v>

3847
01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:29.420
<v Speaker 5>I just hate that you were a hero.</v>

3848
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:30.051
<v Speaker 5>I hate that shit.</v>

3849
01:45:30.051 --> 01:45:31.000
<v Speaker 5>I hate when you know.</v>

3850
01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:31.970
<v Speaker 5>It's stuff like that though.</v>

3851
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.500
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

3852
01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:33.230
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3853
01:45:33.230 --> 01:45:34.520
<v Speaker 5>if you really don't believe my stores,</v>

3854
01:45:34.521 --> 01:45:35.360
<v Speaker 5>why don't you ask now,</v>

3860
01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.550
<v Speaker 2>why does he care?</v>

3861
01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Why do you,</v>

3862
01:45:41.410 --> 01:45:42.500
<v Speaker 2>you guys are friends.</v>

3866
01:45:44.001 --> 01:45:44.990
<v Speaker 2>it's a distracting.</v>

3867
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.610
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3868
01:45:45.610 --> 01:45:46.910
<v Speaker 2>it's an energy distraction.</v>

3869
01:45:46.911 --> 01:45:49.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not something to focus on for him or for you.</v>

3870
01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:50.390
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't have focused on it.</v>

3871
01:45:50.391 --> 01:45:51.350
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't focus on it.</v>

3872
01:45:51.650 --> 01:45:51.951
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3873
01:45:51.951 --> 01:45:53.200
<v Speaker 2>it's like in.</v>

3874
01:45:53.210 --> 01:45:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you're on a podcast and you're ranting and he wants to keep it real</v>

3875
01:45:57.621 --> 01:45:58.730
<v Speaker 2>and that's really what he thinks.</v>

3876
01:45:59.020 --> 01:45:59.231
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3877
01:45:59.231 --> 01:46:00.064
<v Speaker 2>There's that too,</v>

3878
01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:01.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's unnecessary.</v>

3879
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:02.011
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3880
01:46:02.011 --> 01:46:02.810
<v Speaker 2>it's when,</v>

3881
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:03.770
<v Speaker 2>when you do that,</v>

3882
01:46:03.771 --> 01:46:07.100
<v Speaker 2>especially like with a friend you put out like a certain amount of energy,</v>

3883
01:46:07.101 --> 01:46:08.300
<v Speaker 2>you put out a certain thing,</v>

3884
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3885
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:10.460
<v Speaker 2>you put it out there and then okay,</v>

3886
01:46:10.461 --> 01:46:12.920
<v Speaker 2>well then that has to be responded to it.</v>

3887
01:46:12.921 --> 01:46:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Like it's being responded to now and he probably didn't even think about that</v>

3888
01:46:16.071 --> 01:46:16.790
<v Speaker 2>when he did it,</v>

3889
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:20.360
<v Speaker 2>but if he just said it or if he just thought it and then didn't say it,</v>

3890
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:21.800
<v Speaker 2>it'd be way better off.</v>

3891
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Or if he wanted to talk to you about it,</v>

3892
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:25.490
<v Speaker 2>just say,</v>

3893
01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:26.090
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

3894
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:29.360
<v Speaker 2>I just want to tell you that sometimes you tell stories and I think they're</v>

3895
01:46:29.361 --> 01:46:30.194
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

3896
01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust them.</v>

3897
01:46:31.330 --> 01:46:31.550
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3898
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.630
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3899
01:46:31.630 --> 01:46:31.950
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

3900
01:46:31.950 --> 01:46:33.650
<v Speaker 5>And then I would say what stories are.</v>

3901
01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:35.163
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3902
01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:36.620
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3903
01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:39.340
<v Speaker 5>you do tell a squirrely story on occasion.</v>

3904
01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:41.013
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember.</v>

3905
01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.570
<v Speaker 5>So I can have people that were involved in the story.</v>

3906
01:46:43.571 --> 01:46:44.181
<v Speaker 5>There are no,</v>

3907
01:46:44.181 --> 01:46:44.451
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3908
01:46:44.451 --> 01:46:45.030
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3909
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Listen.</v>

3910
01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:45.831
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3911
01:46:45.831 --> 01:46:49.090
<v Speaker 2>well that's even more ridiculous because you're saying you've never exaggerated</v>

3912
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 2>or told the story a little</v>

3913
01:46:50.230 --> 01:46:50.440
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>

3914
01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.020
<v Speaker 5>I would have to have an example.</v>

3915
01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:52.500
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3916
01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:54.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm in high school,</v>

3917
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:55.620
<v Speaker 5>never did it.</v>

3918
01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:56.161
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm saying,</v>

3919
01:46:56.161 --> 01:46:57.330
<v Speaker 5>like as an example,</v>

3920
01:46:57.331 --> 01:47:00.240
<v Speaker 5>I would probably be prone to saying something like,</v>

3921
01:47:00.630 --> 01:47:01.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3922
01:47:01.501 --> 01:47:02.011
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3923
01:47:02.011 --> 01:47:03.660
<v Speaker 5>that girl was like fucking hot man.</v>

3924
01:47:03.690 --> 01:47:04.800
<v Speaker 5>She was like an La 10,</v>

3925
01:47:04.801 --> 01:47:05.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3926
01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:07.140
<v Speaker 5>when maybe she was like seven or eight,</v>

3927
01:47:07.530 --> 01:47:08.250
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3928
01:47:08.250 --> 01:47:10.410
<v Speaker 5>Nothing like a slight exaggeration,</v>

3929
01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:11.120
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

3930
01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:11.720
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

3931
01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.250
<v Speaker 2>appreciate it when someone tells me the truth.</v>

3932
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Like Ra would tell them the truth.</v>

3933
01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>

3934
01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:15.800
<v Speaker 2>what did she look like?</v>

3935
01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:16.320
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>

3936
01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.153
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3937
01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.153
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

3938
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:19.010
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3939
01:47:19.010 --> 01:47:19.843
<v Speaker 2>Maybe</v>

3940
01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:22.460
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't say,</v>

3941
01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:22.701
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3942
01:47:22.701 --> 01:47:25.340
<v Speaker 2>she was 10 greatest piece of ass ever.</v>

3943
01:47:25.530 --> 01:47:25.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3944
01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:29.900
<v Speaker 2>everybody appreciates that more than they appreciate exaggeration,</v>

3945
01:47:30.290 --> 01:47:31.220
<v Speaker 2>exaggeration.</v>

3946
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Although I enjoy it.</v>

3947
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Like Joey Diaz style exaggeration is the greatest fucking thing on earth.</v>

3948
01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:35.781
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3949
01:47:35.781 --> 01:47:36.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3950
01:47:36.081 --> 01:47:38.780
<v Speaker 2>so in a way it's hypocritical so you don't enjoy exaggeration.</v>

3951
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.860
<v Speaker 2>It's just saying you know,</v>

3952
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:41.350
<v Speaker 2>enjoy that.</v>

3953
01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:41.950
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3954
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Joey also tells them a very honest story as well with the crazy saturations</v>

3955
01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:46.280
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3956
01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:46.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3957
01:47:46.731 --> 01:47:47.930
<v Speaker 2>or for comedic effect.</v>

3958
01:47:47.931 --> 01:47:48.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3959
01:47:48.111 --> 01:47:49.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like part of the fun of it all,</v>

3960
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:52.350
<v Speaker 2>but that's also part of each of the,</v>

3961
01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:53.630
<v Speaker 2>these people's nature.</v>

3962
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Like Ari is a guy who,</v>

3963
01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:57.020
<v Speaker 2>he's not like,</v>

3964
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3965
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to add all this little spice to the story.</v>

3966
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:01.520
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like it when you do it either.</v>

3967
01:48:01.521 --> 01:48:01.731
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3968
01:48:01.731 --> 01:48:02.780
<v Speaker 2>And he's a very specific.</v>

3969
01:48:02.781 --> 01:48:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3970
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:05.810
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't want you to bullshit him because he's not a bullshitter,</v>

3971
01:48:06.050 --> 01:48:07.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's his own trip to,</v>

3972
01:48:07.361 --> 01:48:07.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3973
01:48:07.611 --> 01:48:11.180
<v Speaker 2>his own trip is that he's very like focused and ambitious now and he doesn't</v>

3974
01:48:11.181 --> 01:48:12.260
<v Speaker 2>want to hear any nonsense,</v>

3975
01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:12.891
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3976
01:48:12.891 --> 01:48:13.180
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3977
01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:15.890
<v Speaker 2>and that's because he's on a great groove right now.</v>

3978
01:48:15.891 --> 01:48:17.780
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want anything getting hijacked,</v>

3979
01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:22.340
<v Speaker 2>whether it's this time hijacked where the fake story or someone giving them a</v>

3980
01:48:22.341 --> 01:48:24.770
<v Speaker 2>fake impression of what happened.</v>

3981
01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Another guy who you've witnessed crazy leap.</v>

3982
01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:28.551
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3983
01:48:28.551 --> 01:48:32.240
<v Speaker 2>we were with Ari when he was first starting at the store.</v>

3984
01:48:32.241 --> 01:48:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I think when Ari came to the store.</v>

3985
01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:34.941
<v Speaker 2>I hate that.</v>

3986
01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:35.774
<v Speaker 2>I don't know this,</v>

3987
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:36.703
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if he's.</v>

3988
01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I think he started out his first sets in DC right now I think.</v>

3989
01:48:42.501 --> 01:48:44.780
<v Speaker 2>But then when he came over the DC Improv,</v>

3990
01:48:44.781 --> 01:48:44.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3991
01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Because I remember him having a hard time for them.</v>

3992
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking him seriously.</v>

3993
01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:50.870
<v Speaker 2>You Say Baltimore?</v>

3994
01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was from Baltimore,</v>

3995
01:48:51.981 --> 01:48:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Maryland.</v>

3996
01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:53.133
<v Speaker 2>He's from it.</v>

3997
01:48:54.130 --> 01:48:55.220
<v Speaker 2>It's close enough close.</v>

3998
01:48:55.221 --> 01:48:57.320
<v Speaker 2>But he's not from Baltimore now he's from Washington DC.</v>

3999
01:48:57.620 --> 01:48:58.453
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

4000
01:48:58.880 --> 01:48:59.900
<v Speaker 2>he's from Maryland.</v>

4001
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:01.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean DC and Maryland.</v>

4002
01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're like right next to each other.</v>

4003
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4004
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:04.790
<v Speaker 2>In Virginia is right there too.</v>

4005
01:49:05.210 --> 01:49:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

4006
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:09.980
<v Speaker 2>point being he came over here when he was fairly new to comedy,</v>

4007
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:10.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4008
01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:11.990
<v Speaker 2>but he was a really smart dude.</v>

4009
01:49:11.991 --> 01:49:13.130
<v Speaker 2>He was always a smart dude.</v>

4010
01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:17.720
<v Speaker 2>We became friends like immediately he was a young kid hanging out at the comedy</v>

4011
01:49:17.721 --> 01:49:18.680
<v Speaker 2>store and uh,</v>

4012
01:49:18.850 --> 01:49:19.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4013
01:49:19.090 --> 01:49:21.050
<v Speaker 2>I remember at first he was like,</v>

4014
01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4015
01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:25.700
<v Speaker 2>everybody's weird around people that are already like successful when you're an</v>

4016
01:49:25.701 --> 01:49:26.240
<v Speaker 2>amateur.</v>

4017
01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:26.540
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

4018
01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:28.280
<v Speaker 2>you can't believe you're allowed to even talk to them.</v>

4019
01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Of course they get weird,</v>

4020
01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:31.250
<v Speaker 2>but then once you get past that weirdness,</v>

4021
01:49:31.251 --> 01:49:31.700
<v Speaker 2>he realized,</v>

4022
01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4023
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:32.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4024
01:49:32.721 --> 01:49:36.020
<v Speaker 2>that's just Tommy Lauren or Tommy Tommy Lawrence.</v>

4025
01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:37.213
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>

4026
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:39.260
<v Speaker 2>What's the fucking guys from in living color?</v>

<v Speaker 2>What the Hell's the Tommy Davidson?</v>

4028
01:49:40.221 --> 01:49:41.054
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Davidson.</v>

4029
01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:45.950
<v Speaker 2>A confusing with Joey Lawrence for some reason because the first time I saw Joey</v>

4030
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence was one of the first celebrities oversaw.</v>

4031
01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4032
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:48.550
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4033
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I was on the set of news radio and Joey Lawrence had his show right next to our</v>

4034
01:49:52.181 --> 01:49:53.370
<v Speaker 2>show is like a,</v>

4035
01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.250
<v Speaker 2>he had his Mercedes there and he was like,</v>

4036
01:49:55.410 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 2>he had his leg outside the car and he's like singing along to his own song.</v>

4037
01:49:59.850 --> 01:50:00.683
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

4038
01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:01.901
<v Speaker 2>and I showed up.</v>

4039
01:50:01.901 --> 01:50:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4040
01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:03.380
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of starstruck.</v>

4041
01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:03.641
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4042
01:50:03.641 --> 01:50:04.061
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

4043
01:50:04.061 --> 01:50:04.900
<v Speaker 2>this Joey Lawrence.</v>

4044
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:05.181
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4045
01:50:05.181 --> 01:50:06.011
<v Speaker 2>There's Joey Lawrence,</v>

4046
01:50:06.011 --> 01:50:07.700
<v Speaker 2>like singing his own his own shit.</v>

4047
01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Buy his own car.</v>

4048
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:10.990
<v Speaker 2>So Tommy Davidson was another one.</v>

4049
01:50:11.170 --> 01:50:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I remember first talking to Tommy Davidson at the comedy store.</v>

4050
01:50:13.810 --> 01:50:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Davidson was like,</v>

4051
01:50:14.681 --> 01:50:14.981
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

4052
01:50:14.981 --> 01:50:15.760
<v Speaker 2>what's going on man?</v>

4053
01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Like he didn't know who the fuck I was.</v>

4054
01:50:17.541 --> 01:50:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I was nobody when I first came to the store.</v>

4055
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:23.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean I might've been a paid regular but I might not even been a paid regular</v>

4056
01:50:23.651 --> 01:50:24.190
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

4057
01:50:24.190 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized,</v>

4058
01:50:24.970 --> 01:50:25.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4059
01:50:25.181 --> 01:50:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Davidson is just a comic,</v>

4060
01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:27.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4061
01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:28.450
<v Speaker 2>like we're all just comics.</v>

4062
01:50:28.770 --> 01:50:32.560
<v Speaker 2>And then I always tried to be the same way with guys,</v>

4063
01:50:32.590 --> 01:50:33.423
<v Speaker 2>young guys,</v>

4064
01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:34.630
<v Speaker 2>young guys coming up.</v>

4065
01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4066
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I always tried to make sure I let them all know we're all just the same fucking</v>

4067
01:50:38.681 --> 01:50:39.250
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

4068
01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:40.480
<v Speaker 2>just because that's Tim Allen,</v>

4069
01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:42.180
<v Speaker 2>just because you see George Carlin over there,</v>

01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:47.350

<v Speaker 2>Without good comedy I life would not be nearly as interesting.</v>

4089
01:51:13.451 --> 01:51:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

4090
01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't be as interesting to,</v>

4091
01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:19.390
<v Speaker 2>to perform because you'd be looking around and all this other stuff and you</v>

4092
01:51:19.391 --> 01:51:20.470
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be enjoying yourself.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4094
01:51:21.311 --> 01:51:22.450
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be interesting.</v>

4095
01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.830
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to watch.</v>

<v Speaker 5>The carrots.</v>

4196
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:40.131
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>

4197
01:53:40.131 --> 01:53:44.360
<v Speaker 5>I was really stoned and I was reading about who framed Roger Rabbit and how they</v>

4198
01:53:44.361 --> 01:53:45.530
<v Speaker 5>edited out all these,</v>

4199
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:46.730
<v Speaker 5>like the artists,</v>

4200
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:47.060
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4201

01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:50.780

4203
01:53:50.781 --> 01:53:54.020
<v Speaker 5>vagina and there's a few other scenes where like a baby looks up address and</v>

4204
01:53:54.021 --> 01:53:55.100
<v Speaker 5>there's drool coming out of it.</v>

4205
01:53:55.101 --> 01:53:55.761
<v Speaker 5>The baby's mouth.</v>

4206
01:53:55.761 --> 01:53:56.630
<v Speaker 5>What's that guy's name?</v>

4207
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:59.760
<v Speaker 5>Robert Fletcher.</v>

4208
01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:00.560
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4209
01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:00.741
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4210
01:54:00.741 --> 01:54:01.040
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

4212
01:54:01.341 --> 01:54:01.461
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4213
01:54:01.461 --> 01:54:01.750
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4214
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:02.960
<v Speaker 5>The opposite.</v>

4215
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:05.030
<v Speaker 5>Jessica Rabbit I'm talking about.</v>

4216
01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:05.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4217
01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:06.713
<v Speaker 5>The Guy Bob.</v>

4218
01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:10.210
<v Speaker 5>No haskins hoskins.</v>

4219
01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:11.133
<v Speaker 5>Bob Hoskins.</v>

4220
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:12.223
<v Speaker 5>Bob Hoskins.</v>

4221
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:16.160
<v Speaker 5>So then I found out that the only version that you can find that part in the</v>

4222
01:54:16.161 --> 01:54:17.690
<v Speaker 5>movie is on a laser dispersion.</v>

4223
01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:19.280
<v Speaker 5>There's only one version of that laser.</v>

4224
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:21.290
<v Speaker 5>This ebay and bought it for $4.</v>

4225
01:54:21.291 --> 01:54:22.190
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a laser player?</v>

4226
01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:23.053
<v Speaker 5>I do in Ohio.</v>

4227
01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:26.240
<v Speaker 5>Do you have to go back to Ohio to get it?</v>

4228
01:54:26.241 --> 01:54:27.830
<v Speaker 5>Just so I can see her vagina.</v>

4229
01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:28.731
<v Speaker 5>Where do you.</v>

4230
01:54:28.731 --> 01:54:29.900
<v Speaker 5>How do you buy a laser player?</v>

4231
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:31.450
<v Speaker 5>Because it's not like a turntables.</v>

4232
01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:32.293
<v Speaker 5>We still have turned to.</v>

4233
01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:33.190
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4234
01:54:33.190 --> 01:54:36.700
<v Speaker 5>It's like literally the ones that are out there are the ones exist.</v>

4235
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:39.500
<v Speaker 5>What's cool about the one I got is I got this really high tech,</v>

4236
01:54:39.501 --> 01:54:43.250
<v Speaker 5>like five disc change changer slash laser disc player and I was like,</v>

4237
01:54:43.251 --> 01:54:46.400
<v Speaker 5>this is like the best because it was on clearance for some reason and then like</v>

4238
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:47.930
<v Speaker 5>two months later DVD came out.</v>

4239
01:54:47.931 --> 01:54:48.141
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4240
01:54:48.141 --> 01:54:48.770
<v Speaker 5>oh goodbye.</v>

4241
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:51.710
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it kind of fucked up that the real sound people,</v>

4242
01:54:51.711 --> 01:54:56.711
<v Speaker 5>the sound freaks say that music played over a record sounds the best laser.</v>

4243
01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:58.850
<v Speaker 5>This is better than DVD,</v>

4244
01:54:58.851 --> 01:55:01.130
<v Speaker 5>but yet everyone went crazy on DVD a way better.</v>

4245
01:55:01.131 --> 01:55:02.090
<v Speaker 5>Is it better than blue ray though?</v>

4246
01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:02.481
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4247
01:55:02.481 --> 01:55:03.111
<v Speaker 5>it's not better in blue.</v>

4248
01:55:03.111 --> 01:55:03.270
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4249
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:04.103
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

4250
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:09.710
<v Speaker 5>there's no argument that suck unless you have a laptop made by apple who can't</v>

4251
01:55:09.711 --> 01:55:11.000
<v Speaker 5>work out a deal with Sony.</v>

4252
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:16.350
<v Speaker 5>I just feel so weak when I see a fucking Pcu or whip out his Bluetooth or Blu</v>

4253
01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:17.270
<v Speaker 5>Ray Bluetooth.</v>

4254
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:18.980
<v Speaker 5>Look at the players are in the.</v>

4255
01:55:18.981 --> 01:55:19.940
<v Speaker 5>All the pc laptops,</v>

4256
01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:20.630
<v Speaker 5>a lot of pieces.</v>

4257
01:55:20.630 --> 01:55:21.463
<v Speaker 5>There's no laptop.</v>

4258
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:22.340
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

4259
01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:26.630
<v Speaker 5>None of the new apple fanboy saying none of the laptops today have DVD players</v>

4260
01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:28.520
<v Speaker 5>in this because that's blue rights.</v>

4261
01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:29.900
<v Speaker 5>The only ones that don't are apple ones.</v>

4262
01:55:30.010 --> 01:55:33.380
<v Speaker 5>Well they're actually taking them out of most laptops nowadays.</v>

4263
01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:34.730
<v Speaker 5>You take them out and wait,</v>

4264
01:55:34.731 --> 01:55:35.570
<v Speaker 5>why would you take him out?</v>

4265
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:36.590
<v Speaker 5>Why would I take them out?</v>

4266
01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:37.770
<v Speaker 5>You take them out is you said no,</v>

4267
01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:37.911
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4268
01:55:37.911 --> 01:55:38.051
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4269
01:55:38.051 --> 01:55:38.201
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4270
01:55:38.201 --> 01:55:38.381
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4271
01:55:38.381 --> 01:55:38.690
<v Speaker 5>I didn't.</v>

4272
01:55:38.690 --> 01:55:39.680
<v Speaker 5>Laptops and laptops.</v>

4273
01:55:39.681 --> 01:55:40.514
<v Speaker 5>The laptops.</v>

4274
01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:41.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm not up on that,</v>

4275
01:55:41.511 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 5>but I did when I was at my friend and the Google friend's</v>

4276
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.730
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

4277
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:44.941
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4278
01:55:44.941 --> 01:55:47.760
<v Speaker 2>I did see the google laptop with the chrome operating system.</v>

4279
01:55:47.770 --> 01:55:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I got to play with that touchscreen.</v>

4280
01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Touchscreen laptop.</v>

4281
01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:51.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4282
01:55:51.211 --> 01:55:52.500
<v Speaker 2>But it's all non local.</v>

4283
01:55:52.501 --> 01:55:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Everything is stored in the cloud.</v>

4284
01:55:54.130 --> 01:55:54.963
<v Speaker 5>Horrible idea.</v>

4285
01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:58.960
<v Speaker 5>That's what supposedly the next xbox is supposed to be where you don't buy</v>

4286
01:55:58.961 --> 01:55:59.381
<v Speaker 5>games.</v>

4287
01:55:59.381 --> 01:56:00.640
<v Speaker 5>All your games are on a cloud,</v>

4288
01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.740
<v Speaker 5>so you can only play if you have an Internet connection,</v>

4289
01:56:02.741 --> 01:56:04.300
<v Speaker 5>which drives me fucking crazy.</v>

4290
01:56:04.301 --> 01:56:05.350
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine sitting there going,</v>

4291
01:56:05.590 --> 01:56:06.490
<v Speaker 5>I just wanna play video games.</v>

4292
01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:07.473
<v Speaker 5>There's a storm.</v>

4293
01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:08.703
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>

4294
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:10.091
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

4295
01:56:10.091 --> 01:56:10.790
<v Speaker 5>You should be able to</v>

4296
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:11.780
<v Speaker 2>play if you're camping,</v>

4297
01:56:12.170 --> 01:56:12.490
<v Speaker 2>camping.</v>

4298
01:56:12.490 --> 01:56:13.640
<v Speaker 2>He set up a generator.</v>

4299
01:56:13.641 --> 01:56:17.030
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't have to hook a fucking Internet connection to it through your cell</v>

4300
01:56:17.031 --> 01:56:17.390
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

4301
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:18.223
<v Speaker 2>No</v>

4302
01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:20.151
<v Speaker 2>camping.</v>

4303
01:56:20.151 --> 01:56:21.410
<v Speaker 2>He can't get away from your xbox.</v>

4304
01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:24.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm such a second generation guy for that too.</v>

4305
01:56:24.241 --> 01:56:29.241
<v Speaker 5>Like I like people to buy that first one that needs all the work and then come</v>

4306
01:56:29.311 --> 01:56:30.560
<v Speaker 5>through in the second half of me,</v>

4307
01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:31.230
<v Speaker 5>my friend.</v>

4308
01:56:31.230 --> 01:56:31.391
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4309
01:56:31.391 --> 01:56:31.591
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

4310
01:56:31.591 --> 01:56:33.470
<v Speaker 5>You got to get everything I can.</v>

4311
01:56:33.490 --> 01:56:36.630
<v Speaker 5>I love your dedication to seeing the Jessica rabbit snatch.</v>

4312
01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:37.411
<v Speaker 5>One of the,</v>

4313
01:56:37.411 --> 01:56:38.244
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4314
01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:40.140
<v Speaker 5>one of the episodes</v>

4315
01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:40.971
<v Speaker 2>as of this new show.</v>

4316
01:56:40.971 --> 01:56:45.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing Isabelle computer simulation theory and one of the things I'm doing is</v>

4317
01:56:46.041 --> 01:56:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I went down to a place that makes computer games.</v>

4318
01:56:50.541 --> 01:56:50.881
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

4319
01:56:50.881 --> 01:56:51.161
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4320
01:56:51.161 --> 01:56:55.520
<v Speaker 2>they actually do like three d scanning and they scan my face and they're going</v>

4321
01:56:55.521 --> 01:56:57.940
<v Speaker 2>to put me in like this fake game with a creative.</v>

4322
01:56:57.970 --> 01:56:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow dude.</v>

4323
01:56:59.150 --> 01:57:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Way to use this show.</v>

4324
01:57:00.290 --> 01:57:00.711
<v Speaker 2>This show is,</v>

4325
01:57:00.711 --> 01:57:02.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting to do so much cool shit.</v>

4326
01:57:02.091 --> 01:57:04.610
<v Speaker 2>And most of it I can't talk about because I can't give away any secrets or</v>

4327
01:57:04.611 --> 01:57:06.440
<v Speaker 2>anything on any of the things that we found out.</v>

4328
01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:07.370
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

4329
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:08.300
<v Speaker 2>it's so much fun.</v>

4330
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:12.590
<v Speaker 2>It's been really interesting because I'm getting to talk to all these experts</v>

4331
01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:13.091
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

4332
01:57:13.091 --> 01:57:15.020
<v Speaker 2>getting to talk to all these like interesting,</v>

4333
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:17.450
<v Speaker 2>intelligent people and crazy people too,</v>

4334
01:57:17.770 --> 01:57:18.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4335
01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:20.750
<v Speaker 2>it's been like a couple of months so far,</v>

4336
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:23.420
<v Speaker 2>a couple of weeks around there and a couple of weeks.</v>

4337
01:57:23.421 --> 01:57:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I've had so much fun.</v>

4338
01:57:24.321 --> 01:57:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

4339
01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:28.040
<v Speaker 5>I believe that 100 percent in the simulation theory it's getting worse and worse</v>

4340
01:57:28.041 --> 01:57:28.490
<v Speaker 5>and worse.</v>

4341
01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:29.290
<v Speaker 5>Why do you say that?</v>

4342
01:57:29.290 --> 01:57:30.081
<v Speaker 5>Like last night my,</v>

4343
01:57:30.081 --> 01:57:31.490
<v Speaker 5>I've been having problems with my website,</v>

4344
01:57:31.491 --> 01:57:34.160
<v Speaker 5>so I call a dream house who's my,</v>

4345
01:57:34.190 --> 01:57:37.940
<v Speaker 5>who serves it and it's like five in the morning and this girl lives in</v>

4346
01:57:37.941 --> 01:57:38.481
<v Speaker 5>California.</v>

4347
01:57:38.481 --> 01:57:42.710
<v Speaker 5>She works from her house and she's just helping me out and not to get your freak</v>

4348
01:57:42.711 --> 01:57:43.070
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

4349
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:44.740
<v Speaker 5>And it's kind of funny you said that.</v>

4350
01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:45.770
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>

4351
01:57:45.770 --> 01:57:46.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4352
01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:47.180
<v Speaker 5>I uh,</v>

4353
01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:48.530
<v Speaker 5>was watching this movie,</v>

4354
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4355
01:57:48.730 --> 01:57:52.460
<v Speaker 5>Tim and Eric's billion dollar movie and letting a Taffeta no one's got time for</v>

4356
01:57:52.461 --> 01:57:54.530
<v Speaker 5>that in the movie.</v>

4357
01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:56.390
<v Speaker 5>They were in this mall and it's,</v>

4358
01:57:56.391 --> 01:57:58.280
<v Speaker 5>I always find like places that have closed down,</v>

4359
01:57:58.281 --> 01:57:58.840
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

4360
01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:01.730
<v Speaker 5>Like this whole mall is actually a real model that's in palm springs and</v>

4361
01:58:01.731 --> 01:58:02.210
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

4362
01:58:02.210 --> 01:58:06.230
<v Speaker 5>So I'm like researching this mall while I'm on hold trying to get to talk to</v>

4363
01:58:06.231 --> 01:58:06.980
<v Speaker 5>this girl.</v>

4364
01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:07.790
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4365
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:10.910
<v Speaker 5>I found out there was all these pictures of this big Marilyn Monroe statute</v>

4366
01:58:10.911 --> 01:58:14.290
<v Speaker 5>where they took two parts of Marilyn Monroe and put it in front of this mall and</v>

4367
01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:16.940
<v Speaker 5>somehow it came up with Google search and I'm just looking at this crazy</v>

4368
01:58:16.941 --> 01:58:17.780
<v Speaker 5>Maryland moreau thing.</v>

4369
01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:18.650
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4370
01:58:18.650 --> 01:58:19.071
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

4371
01:58:19.071 --> 01:58:21.680
<v Speaker 5>so I'm talking to this girl and uh,</v>

4372
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:25.340
<v Speaker 5>the next day today I noticed that she follows me on twitter or somebody from</v>

4373
01:58:25.341 --> 01:58:27.800
<v Speaker 5>dreamhost follows me on twitter and who's a girl?</v>

4374
01:58:28.010 --> 01:58:29.390
<v Speaker 5>And she like writes me,</v>

4375
01:58:29.391 --> 01:58:29.721

4378
01:58:33.471 --> 01:58:34.230
<v Speaker 5>website.</v>

4379
01:58:34.230 --> 01:58:34.550
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4380
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:35.540
<v Speaker 5>So direct message.</v>

4381
01:58:35.630 --> 01:58:38.450
<v Speaker 5>So I go through her photos because see what she looks like.</v>

4382
01:58:38.451 --> 01:58:38.750
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

4383
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:40.130
<v Speaker 5>she's a pretty Asia and I'm like,</v>

4384
01:58:40.131 --> 01:58:40.281
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

4385
01:58:40.281 --> 01:58:42.390
<v Speaker 5>So you've started her after she was falling.</v>

4386
01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.500
<v Speaker 5>So I went through and I'm like,</v>

4387
01:58:44.501 --> 01:58:44.591
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

4388
01:58:44.591 --> 01:58:45.610
<v Speaker 5>she's a pretty Asian girl.</v>

4389
01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:50.350
<v Speaker 5>Like the fourth photo is her in front of that fucking Maryland Mary Statue.</v>

4390
01:58:50.570 --> 01:58:52.390
<v Speaker 5>Never seen in my whole entire life.</v>

4391
01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:54.040
<v Speaker 5>And now this girl that's helping me out,</v>

4392
01:58:54.041 --> 01:58:55.120
<v Speaker 5>this Asian girl that's helping me out.</v>

4393
01:58:55.170 --> 01:58:56.003
<v Speaker 5>Andrea,</v>

4394
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:59.440
<v Speaker 5>you guys get him therapy together in the next picture.</v>

4395
01:58:59.441 --> 01:59:00.730
<v Speaker 5>If you backed up one further,</v>

4396
01:59:00.731 --> 01:59:04.930
<v Speaker 5>you'd see her finger yourself with the desk while the whole time.</v>

4397
01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:06.670
<v Speaker 5>I hope so.</v>

4398
01:59:06.670 --> 01:59:09.400
<v Speaker 5>This whole time that she's actually the one that hacked my computer.</v>

4399
01:59:09.401 --> 01:59:11.020
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen the pictures of Rhonda Rousy</v>

4400
01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:11.690
<v Speaker 2>with a desk while?</v>

4401
01:59:11.690 --> 01:59:14.330
<v Speaker 2>T shirt on the fucking coolest thing ever.</v>

4402
01:59:14.331 --> 01:59:15.081
<v Speaker 2>And that's very cool.</v>

4403
01:59:15.081 --> 01:59:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Seeing Ronda Rousey gives the thumbs up.</v>

4404
01:59:18.020 --> 01:59:19.370
<v Speaker 2>The baddest chick on the planet.</v>

4405
01:59:19.371 --> 01:59:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4406
01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:20.421
<v Speaker 2>But by the way,</v>

4407
01:59:20.421 --> 01:59:22.400
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of bad ass chicks on a planet.</v>

4408
01:59:22.590 --> 01:59:24.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a gang of a man,</v>

4409
01:59:24.231 --> 01:59:26.450
<v Speaker 2>there's some skillful women out there,</v>

4410
01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:26.950
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

4411
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:27.830
<v Speaker 2>So many of them.</v>

4412
01:59:27.831 --> 01:59:32.660
<v Speaker 2>This new fight that they have the new episode of the ultimate fighter with this</v>

4413
01:59:32.661 --> 01:59:35.990
<v Speaker 2>girl cat Zingano and Ronda Rousey together.</v>

4414
01:59:36.260 --> 01:59:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4415
01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:37.040
<v Speaker 2>looking at it.</v>

4416
01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:37.873
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

4417
01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:40.010
<v Speaker 2>So nice man.</v>

4418
01:59:40.011 --> 01:59:41.420
<v Speaker 2>She wants to come on the podcast again too.</v>

4419
01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:46.010
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to be on somewhere after the beginning of May.</v>

4420
01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:47.600
<v Speaker 2>We're going to look how bad ass she is.</v>

4421
01:59:47.630 --> 01:59:49.370
<v Speaker 2>She has a fucking bed in her kitchen.</v>

4422
01:59:50.210 --> 01:59:51.320
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to do it.</v>

4423
01:59:51.670 --> 01:59:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4424
01:59:51.930 --> 01:59:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4425
01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:52.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4426
01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:54.260
<v Speaker 2>she probably lives in a studio.</v>

4427
01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:55.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean she,</v>

4428
01:59:55.731 --> 01:59:57.350
<v Speaker 2>this is probably the same place.</v>

4429
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:59.300
<v Speaker 2>She's one of those tricks that probably wants to keep it real too,</v>

4430
01:59:59.950 --> 02:00:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

4431
02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4432
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:01.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say where she lives,</v>

4433
02:00:01.671 --> 02:00:02.900
<v Speaker 2>but she's awesome.</v>

4434
02:00:03.110 --> 02:00:04.100
<v Speaker 2>She'll be back here again,</v>

4435
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:08.060
<v Speaker 2>but she's fighting a cat Zingano and they're going to coach against each other</v>

4436
02:00:08.061 --> 02:00:08.960
<v Speaker 2>on the ultimate fighter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And Cat Zingano too.</v>

4440
02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:19.490
<v Speaker 2>They're all like pretty girls that can beat the fuck out of you.</v>

4441
02:00:19.491 --> 02:00:20.480
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of scary,</v>

4442
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:22.100
<v Speaker 2>but this is in Gong.</v>

4443
02:00:22.101 --> 02:00:23.740
<v Speaker 2>Chick is I based man.</v>

4444

4450
02:00:34.510 --> 02:00:34.780
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

4451
02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:35.180
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4452
02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:36.410
<v Speaker 2>the female fight.</v>

4453
02:00:36.411 --> 02:00:36.651
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

4454
02:00:36.651 --> 02:00:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I was watching it and my friend [inaudible] place,</v>

4455
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:42.410
<v Speaker 2>the female fight was the highlight of the room.</v>

4456
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:44.120
<v Speaker 2>We were going crazy.</v>

4457
02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:45.051
<v Speaker 2>It was me,</v>

4458
02:00:45.051 --> 02:00:47.700
<v Speaker 2>my friend Aubrey and a bunch of his buddies,</v>

4459
02:00:47.701 --> 02:00:51.500
<v Speaker 2>he had like five of his friends over and we were eating Mexican food and</v>

4460
02:00:51.501 --> 02:00:52.130
<v Speaker 2>watching the fights.</v>

4461
02:00:52.130 --> 02:00:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Having a great fucking time,</v>

4462
02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:57.260
<v Speaker 2>but the room went nuts when the meesha take cuts and in.</v>

4463
02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:57.471
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4464
02:00:57.471 --> 02:00:58.400
<v Speaker 2>fight was going down.</v>

4465
02:00:58.730 --> 02:01:00.140
<v Speaker 2>It was chaos.</v>

4466
02:01:00.141 --> 02:01:01.820
<v Speaker 2>These girls were going off on each other.</v>

4467
02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

4468
02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:03.650
<v Speaker 2>it's seriously.</v>

4469
02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Might've been one of the most entertaining fights I've ever seen in my life is</v>

4470
02:01:06.441 --> 02:01:06.980
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

4471
02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:07.970
<v Speaker 2>You got to see the finished.</v>

4472
02:01:07.971 --> 02:01:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Just look up the finish.</v>

4473
02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:13.760
<v Speaker 2>The whole fight was great and you know me should take him really close again or</v>

4474
02:01:13.761 --> 02:01:14.720
<v Speaker 2>in a heel hook.</v>

4475
02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.730
<v Speaker 2>It was like dominant grappling exchanges and yeah,</v>

4476
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:20.200
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to watch all this stuff now,</v>

4477
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:23.450
<v Speaker 2>although the actual fight parts that are cut off youtube,</v>

4478
02:01:23.451 --> 02:01:24.740
<v Speaker 2>but I think they have like highlights.</v>

4479
02:01:24.770 --> 02:01:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4480
02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:25.820
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

4481
02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:27.740
<v Speaker 2>this is sort of showing you the highlight</v>

4482
02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:30.413
<v Speaker 5>was working.</v>

4483
02:01:31.190 --> 02:01:34.070
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to play all this stuff because I hope it doesn't get us</v>

4484
02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:35.790
<v Speaker 2>hold off of youtube or something like that,</v>

4485
02:01:36.210 --> 02:01:37.960
<v Speaker 2>but I probably won't.</v>

4486
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4487
02:01:38.131 --> 02:01:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

4488
02:01:38.370 --> 02:01:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Imagine it just do picture in picture and you just show the video.</v>

4489
02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:41.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4490
02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:42.440
<v Speaker 2>she beats.</v>

4491
02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:43.880
<v Speaker 2>They beat the fuck out of each other,</v>

4492
02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:44.151
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4493
02:01:44.151 --> 02:01:45.050
<v Speaker 2>It was nasty.</v>

4494
02:01:45.170 --> 02:01:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like such a tightly,</v>

4495
02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:51.170
<v Speaker 2>tightly contested fight and really Misha tate was probably getting the better of</v>

4496
02:01:51.171 --> 02:01:52.340
<v Speaker 2>it on the scorecards,</v>

4497
02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:57.470
<v Speaker 2>but the end of it hits her with that elbow and drops her and referee Kim winslow</v>

4498
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:58.430
<v Speaker 2>stops the fight.</v>

4499
02:01:58.730 --> 02:01:59.930
<v Speaker 2>She's a bad ass man.</v>

4500
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>

4501
02:02:01.210 --> 02:02:02.043
<v Speaker 2>Was like,</v>

4502
02:02:02.250 --> 02:02:05.840
<v Speaker 2>this is what excites me is it's not that the girls anymore,</v>

4503
02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:09.320
<v Speaker 2>it's now they're like really highly skilled fighters.</v>

4504
02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4505
02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:11.030
<v Speaker 2>That not just women.</v>

4506
02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:11.510
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

4507
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:12.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not just like,</v>

4508
02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:12.680
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4509
02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:13.550
<v Speaker 2>girls can do it too.</v>

4510
02:02:13.551 --> 02:02:13.851
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4511
02:02:13.851 --> 02:02:14.061
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4512
02:02:14.061 --> 02:02:15.830
<v Speaker 2>these chicks are bad ass,</v>

4513
02:02:16.030 --> 02:02:17.300
<v Speaker 2>like they're not half fascinated.</v>

4514
02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:18.260
<v Speaker 2>They're all going for it.</v>

4515
02:02:18.261 --> 02:02:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4516
02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:21.410
<v Speaker 2>And now that Ronda Rousey's become so famous,</v>

4517
02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:24.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like this is going to open the door to so many female athletes that have</v>

4518
02:02:24.591 --> 02:02:25.970
<v Speaker 2>never even considered it before.</v>

4561
02:03:09.441 --> 02:03:13.250
<v Speaker 2>It may take a bundle of arrows and he couldn't snap it.</v>
