00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches while there's this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of guys who are in the business</v>

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>of doing heroic acts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>you've heard of the firemen fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fact that women find guys</v>

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.190
<v Speaker 1>bought fireman to be very attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it actually turns out that there was</v>

6
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>a study that was done that actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows this to be the case.</v>

7
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And I discussed this in one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>articles on psychology today.</v>

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a guy approach women either</v>

9
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>wearing a fireman suit or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>his chances of getting her phone number</v>
<v Speaker 1>increases quite substantially.</v>

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Really if he is wearing a fireman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do they know this?</v>

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Did they do a study where they did they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the same guy?</v>

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Not where the firemen with the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach and the same,</v>

14
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.670
<v Speaker 1>same word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same script,</v>

15
00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>same everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One version.</v>

16
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>It's called the field experiment.</v>

17
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.730
<v Speaker 1>In one version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

18
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>you approach women at a cafe wearing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and another version,</v>

19
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy who actually did that</v>
<v Speaker 1>research is a French psychologist.</v>

20
00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:01.971
<v Speaker 1>His name is Nico [inaudible] and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually covered a few of his studies on</v>

21
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>my website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>my most read article ever over maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

23
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:12.771
<v Speaker 1>400,000 readers is one of his studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I was simply,</v>

24
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>because we're going to talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowback issue now and here again,</v>

25
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>it was a study where he looked at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihood of women being picked up as</v>

26
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>hitchhikers as a function of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>breasts size.</v>

27
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>So he actually had the same woman and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

28
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificially manipulated her breast size</v>

29
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>and on different days she would stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

30
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course it turned out that men</v>

31
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>were much more likely to pick up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman if she had the same woman that she</v>

32
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:41.034
<v Speaker 1>had bigger rest side.</v>

33
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>So I just summarize that study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it up,</v>

34
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 1>and then I remember I'd gone on</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation,</v>

35
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>came back from vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found out that I had completely gone</v>

36
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>viral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a million hate mail,</v>

37
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>not just from readers but from fellow</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology today,</v>

38
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>bloggers who were arguing that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>peddling pornography because I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture as the teaser image for that</v>

40
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a photo of a woman sitting in a</v>

41
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>passenger seat would big with large</v>
<v Speaker 1>breasts.</v>

42
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed appropriate for the topic</v>

43
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>given that that's what the topic of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>study was.</v>

44
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>But by putting that image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was objectifying women.</v>

45
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I was treating them as mere sex objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even though I had nothing to do</v>

46
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>with the study and I was simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>summarizing somebody else's work,</v>

47
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I was a horrifying pornographic peddler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny that just a photograph of</v>

48
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>a woman with large breasts is considered</v>
<v Speaker 1>pornographic?</v>

49
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.983
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to this.</v>

50
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.860
<v Speaker 1>So then I've also written articles on</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology today where I talk about all</v>

51
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:40.190
<v Speaker 1>kinds of issues dealing with penis size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>so do women want a guy with a bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>penis?</v>

53
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Are they more likely to have orgasms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got a bigger penis.</v>

54
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a gay relationship,</v>

55
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

56
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you likely to be top or bottom as a</v>

57
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>function of your penis size?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That study has been done by science.</v>

58
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>And so for those articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put sexy images of men.</v>

59
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>So then I wrote to each of those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had written the hate man.</v>

60
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.484
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

61
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>in all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you now have to write an equally hateful</v>

62
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I am also sexually exploiting</v>

63
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>men's bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they went away and never came</v>

64
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the,</v>

65
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the coolest times</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever to be alive.</v>

66
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I really do and I think that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why it's one of the coolest</v>

67
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:30.450
<v Speaker 1>times ever to be alive is because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so chaotic and it's so strange and</v>

68
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>no one can do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can stop it.</v>

69
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Now they're going to try and net</v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrality and they're gonna try to put</v>

70
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>the brakes here and charge people for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you're gonna,</v>

71
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>you're in trouble and you're on a list</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to watch you.</v>

72
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>What do you try to be anonymous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucker.</v>

73
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I want to know where you are.</v>

74
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about this right before</v>

75
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 2>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all that shit that's coming out,</v>

76
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 2>like all the corruption and anger and</v>
<v Speaker 2>government and competence.</v>

77
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to believe that it has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be there because that's what wakes us up</v>

78
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need so many agencies.</v>

79
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 2>We don't need like so many wars and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much bullshit.</v>

80
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's just decide things for ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course we need some laws.</v>

81
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 2>We need some police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need some roads.</v>

82
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's really it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

83
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like have a nice day.</v>

84
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 2>We don't need you archiving fucking baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>photos.</v>

85
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we've gone over the line.</v>

86
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 2>And so you're seeing the people realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people realize that banks are</v>

87
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 2>ineffective ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People realize that the old media is</v>

88
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 2>dying out and they don't give a shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about their viewers.</v>

89
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 2>So they're just moving over to better</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

90
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 2>And it's happening across the board in</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much every industry even.</v>

91
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

92
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman,</v>

93
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Tiffany van goalie on my show recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was another podcast host and she was</v>

94
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 2>talking to me about how all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery stores now have an organic</v>

95
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 2>section and that's taking off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're seeing like this,</v>

96
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 2>we have new standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>

97
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I think what's happening is that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher standards than we used to.</v>

98
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 2>And so across the board is better stuff.</v>

99
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt that things are getting</v>

100
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:58.590
<v Speaker 1>more complex and harder to control</v>
<v Speaker 1>because no doubt,</v>

101
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.080
<v Speaker 1>and there's no doubt that these old</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

102
00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>whether it's like afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watch the news,</v>

103
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:06.480
<v Speaker 1>it's six or five or whatever the fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

104
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.870
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you're watching a parody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>The anchorman is becoming more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

106
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:13.500
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watch,</v>

107
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:16.200
<v Speaker 1>if you try to watch like the La news</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to watch any of those channels,</v>

108
00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:19.500
<v Speaker 1>local news at five o'clock it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people were aliens,</v>

109
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.363
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

110
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 2>I think these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not supposed to exist forever and</v>

111
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>that's why to us it seems so kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>silly.</v>

112
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's supposed to be dying out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the,</v>

113
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 2>it's the new season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New stuff's going to come out.</v>

114
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

115
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Like every year it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>something different.</v>

116
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:33.640
