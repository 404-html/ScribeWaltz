00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is going on.</v>

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.610
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the very last versions of the Joe Rogan questions everything</v>

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>podcasts that we're releasing as an actual podcast.</v>

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>We did somewhere around 10 of them and I think we have two left.</v>

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>So probably this one and one other one might not have been 10 but don't get all</v>

7
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.224
<v Speaker 1>specific.</v>

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen this show was really a pleasure to do the.</v>

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.880
<v Speaker 2>The big pleasure of it was working with my buddy Duncan of course and exposing</v>

10
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 2>him to millions of people worldwide who didn't didn't know about my brilliant</v>

11
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:44.721
<v Speaker 2>friend and one of things I really love about doing podcast with Duncan is he</v>

12
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:51.291
<v Speaker 2>really gets me inspired to go on these wild rants and I think I inspire him in</v>

13
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 2>the same way and we have this really cool give and take energy when it comes to</v>

14
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 2>certain things and he was just absolutely brilliant on the show and in</v>

15
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.770
<v Speaker 2>introducing subjects and talking to people and injecting new ideas into these</v>

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.340
<v Speaker 2>silly subjects like psychics which is this this episode and a huge thank you to</v>

17
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Benishek who was the guy who we interviewed during the show and had him put on a</v>

18
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:26.061
<v Speaker 2>little bit of a demonstration that really opened up my mind to what is possible</v>

19
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 2>in the world of trickery and manipulation and sleight of hand the art thereof of</v>

20
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

21
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd always known that there was a real art to magic but boy did that guy</v>

22
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:36.774
<v Speaker 2>blow my mind.</v>

23
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 2>And what are the things I really appreciated about battered check was that he</v>

24
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 2>blew my mind and then he told me it was all bullshit.</v>

25
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 2>He didn't try to pretend that he had some magic power or some device that only</v>

26
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:48.220
<v Speaker 2>the government knows about hidden horseshit you.</v>

27
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.990
<v Speaker 2>He told you after he was doing that.</v>

28
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 2>And even during the time he was doing it that it was all bullshit but he was so</v>

29
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 2>good at it it was still unbelievably fascinating.</v>

30
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Speaker 2>I hope this also opens up a lot of people's eyes as to what is possible in terms</v>

31
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 2>of trickery in terms of what someone can what someone can trick you into</v>

32
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:14.811
<v Speaker 2>believing and what kind of manipulation people can pull off when they pretend to</v>

33
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 2>have psychic abilities.</v>

34
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that going on folks.</v>

35
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 2>There's I mean there very well may be some sort of a psychic energy that people</v>

36
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:31.551
<v Speaker 2>possess whether it's a sense that people are not aware of or smells that people</v>

37
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 2>can detect that they can't quite describe that aren't quite olfactory but to</v>

38
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 2>some sense of something being wrong.</v>

39
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 2>But there's also a lot of liars out there man.</v>

40
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of fakers and there's a lot of bullshit.</v>

41
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I was most proud about the sci fi show was that we</v>

42
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:54.501
<v Speaker 2>were able to expose some of that bullshit and whether it was bullshit about the</v>

43
00:02:55.591 --> 00:03:00.591
<v Speaker 2>science behind chem trails or whether it was the evidence in quotes when it</v>

44
00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:06.291
<v Speaker 2>comes to UFOs or whether it was not bullshit like the that the technical and</v>

45
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.460
<v Speaker 2>technological innovation that's going on at this incredibly rapid rate that</v>

46
00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:13.770
<v Speaker 2>we're experiencing and where this all could lead to.</v>

47
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.830
<v Speaker 2>You know it was one of my favorite parts about the show in fact.</v>

48
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.720
<v Speaker 2>One of the least controversial and most real aspects of the show.</v>

49
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.750
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately it was a lot of fun to do.</v>

50
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.490
<v Speaker 2>And so thank you to Duncan Trussell and Duncan has an amazing podcast that</v>

67
00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 2>we recorded on the show.</v>

68
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.700
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people thought they were like we were faking podcasts they were</v>

69
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:33.420
<v Speaker 2>actually real podcasts and allegedly there was real marijuana involved.</v>

70
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Anyway this is one of the last ones and this one is brought to you by Ting Ting</v>

71
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:43.260
<v Speaker 3>is a cell phone service that utilizes the sprint backbone.</v>

72
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.120
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my favorite all time podcast sponsors because I have had nothing but</v>

73
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:53.121
<v Speaker 3>positive feedback from Ting Ting is the cell phone service if you've heard us</v>

74
00:04:56.371 --> 00:05:01.371
<v Speaker 3>talk about it before that uses Top End and phones and what they do is they rent</v>

75
00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:07.121
<v Speaker 3>space off of the off the sprint backbone so they do it on their terms like they</v>

76
00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:11.000
<v Speaker 3>don't have any contracts they don't have any early termination fees they don't</v>

77
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:15.920
<v Speaker 3>have all the nonsense that a lot of people have that's attached to his cell</v>

78
00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:20.921
<v Speaker 3>phone service it's like hidden fees and overages with Tang you only pay for what</v>

79
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:25.310
<v Speaker 3>you use if you go over your allotted minutes you just pay for what you use is</v>

80
00:05:25.311 --> 00:05:29.930
<v Speaker 3>not some exorbitant rate that you have to pay for it's not some some go fuck</v>

81
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:34.130
<v Speaker 3>yourself nonsense that comes along because that's that's a real problem with a</v>

82
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:39.131
<v Speaker 3>lot of these companies that are selling cell phone services that they're greedy</v>

83
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 3>they don't just want a little bit they want it all they want to suck you dry and</v>

84
00:05:45.141 --> 00:05:50.090

88
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:14.771
<v Speaker 3>way where you are going to save money guaranteed you're going to save it because</v>

89
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:20.621
<v Speaker 3>98 percent of people 98 percent people would save money would tank if you're one</v>

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:46.480
<v Speaker 7>all the fucking money.</v>

224
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.740
<v Speaker 10>So this podcast is about psychics</v>

225
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.250
<v Speaker 10>and maybe the lack thereof.</v>

226
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.770
<v Speaker 11>You know at a certain point time in the show.</v>

227
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.873
<v Speaker 11>You got it.</v>

228
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.500
<v Speaker 11>I was wondering what exactly was going on when it came to psychics.</v>

229
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.453
<v Speaker 11>I always wondered.</v>

230
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.330
<v Speaker 11>I mean I would never want to completely discredit the possibility that someone</v>

231
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.620
<v Speaker 11>could have some extraordinary power that I don't possess.</v>

232
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.633
<v Speaker 11>Who knows.</v>

233
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.110
<v Speaker 8>You know I mean in a way it's been explained.</v>

234
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 8>McKenna described communication as a form of telepathy talking because in a way</v>

235
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:35.730
<v Speaker 8>you're you're making established sounds with your mouth that are attached to a</v>

236
00:13:36.201 --> 00:13:39.050
<v Speaker 8>cultural context that we all sort of agree to.</v>

237
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.230
<v Speaker 8>And in doing so you're reading my mind.</v>

238
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.610
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking to you.</v>

239
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.410
<v Speaker 8>You know what I'm I'm talking about a laptop.</v>

240
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 8>I went to the store to get my laptop fixed and the guy behind the counter was in</v>

241
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.690
<v Speaker 8>such a nice guy.</v>

242
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.720
<v Speaker 8>You were you're experiencing that with me you know so you're sort of like</v>

243
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.420
<v Speaker 8>getting a version of my memories.</v>

244
00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.160
<v Speaker 8>And so I never wanted to like completely say oh it's all b.s.</v>

245
00:14:01.161 --> 00:14:05.720
<v Speaker 8>there's no way but man as we do the show like The more we did it at a certain</v>

246
00:14:05.721 --> 00:14:10.310
<v Speaker 8>point Tom I was like how much of this is fucking free you know how much of this</v>

247
00:14:10.311 --> 00:14:11.144
<v Speaker 8>is kooky.</v>

248
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.990
<v Speaker 8>There was there were several times we were doing the show where else.</v>

249
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.720
<v Speaker 8>Like Paul Smith who seemed like a very nice guy tried to get me to a remote view</v>

250
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.800
<v Speaker 8>and I had nothing screw a bunch of stuff down on paper and he was like Just go</v>

251
00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:28.880
<v Speaker 8>to with whatever is moving you know just like there's nothing there.</v>

252
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.680
<v Speaker 8>I honestly maybe it's just me.</v>

253
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:31.910
<v Speaker 8>I mean I left it to me.</v>

254
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:37.250
<v Speaker 8>I'm like I want to see him do it because you know he'd been doing it for more</v>

255
00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:38.084
<v Speaker 8>than a decade.</v>

256
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.260
<v Speaker 8>He's an expert at and he's actually had positive results with it but me trying</v>

257
00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:42.350
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

258
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.470
<v Speaker 8>They were saying that they could show me how to do it within X amount of minutes</v>

259
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.700
<v Speaker 8>I would be doing it right.</v>

260
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.623
<v Speaker 8>Nothing I wrote.</v>

261
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.440
<v Speaker 8>I drew some stuff that I drew like a square and I wrote the color red and</v>

262
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:55.280
<v Speaker 8>something was square with red in it but it was I guess it was a dumb guess it</v>

263
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:58.290
<v Speaker 8>was a guest where there was a bunch of shapes and stuff in this location.</v>

264
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.340
<v Speaker 8>So if I had to judge myself on a pass or fail I would give myself a ninety nine</v>

265
00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:05.730
<v Speaker 8>point nine nine percent fail.</v>

266
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:11.140
<v Speaker 12>I can't say 100 percent fail because I did have a square that had red in it and</v>

267
00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:12.570
<v Speaker 12>there was something like that.</v>

268
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 12>It seems to me to be like something that shows up a lot.</v>

269
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 12>Look there's this hour on air sign it's a rectangle that has red in it.</v>

270
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 12>I mean it's like there's a lot of squares with red and I'm Yeah.</v>

271
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 12>So I think that easily could have been nonsense.</v>

272
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.610
<v Speaker 12>So but then I talked to Ed dames okay and he's the number one top dog.</v>

273
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.880
<v Speaker 12>If you start Google and like people that are able to do that.</v>

274
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 12>People that have that remote viewing skill Ed dames name comes up like</v>

275
00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:40.034
<v Speaker 12>immediately.</v>

276
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.570
<v Speaker 12>He's like the godfather of this stuff.</v>

277
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 12>He started that Stargate program.</v>

278
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.790
<v Speaker 12>You know so he was working on remote viewing.</v>

279
00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.530
<v Speaker 12>He said they had really positive result.</v>

280
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 12>He said he knows how to do it.</v>

281
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 12>And he said that they found Osama bin Laden and he actually said they found</v>

282
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:55.670
<v Speaker 12>Osama bin Laden.</v>

283
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.610
<v Speaker 12>He believes they didn't go after him because they didn't want to end the war yet</v>

284
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.760
<v Speaker 12>for whatever reason you know.</v>

285
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.920
<v Speaker 12>So take that for you know the grain of salt whatever.</v>

286
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.203
<v Speaker 12>Maybe he's right.</v>

287
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:09.770
<v Speaker 13>But now you do take something like that with a grain of salt like he's saying</v>

288
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:14.300
<v Speaker 13>that psychics saw Osama bin Laden who did they call go how does that</v>

289
00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 13>conversation go down.</v>

290
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.430
<v Speaker 13>Hey what's that.</v>

291
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.010
<v Speaker 12>Well he's not to psychics he's working for the CIA.</v>

292
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 12>He's in the government.</v>

293
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.980
<v Speaker 12>He's working in the government right.</v>

294
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.070
<v Speaker 12>I mean he's he's been.</v>

295
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.480
<v Speaker 12>And he said also in this I found this kind of interesting and kind of make</v>

296
00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:27.314
<v Speaker 12>sense.</v>

297
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 12>He said that they were trying to like distance themselves from this program</v>

298
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:35.990
<v Speaker 12>because it's like this paranormal thing like you're working on like psychics.</v>

299
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 12>And he was like even if it was effective they were like look we don't want to be</v>

300
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:42.950
<v Speaker 12>connected to that because it just sounds too loony even if it's effective.</v>

301
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.330
<v Speaker 14>Well you know what man.</v>

302
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 14>If you look at the history of the various experiments the CIA have done.</v>

303
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 14>They're not afraid of loony right they were dumping acid into a guy's mouth and</v>

304
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:57.410
<v Speaker 14>brothels with to a windows.</v>

305
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.030
<v Speaker 14>You see the effects of LSD.</v>

306
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.770
<v Speaker 14>Once you've done that you'll do anything for folks who don't know that story.</v>

307
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 12>It was called the operation midnight climax.</v>

308
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.920
<v Speaker 12>And what they did was they they bought brothels in New York and in San</v>

309
00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:13.514
<v Speaker 12>Francisco.</v>

310
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:19.750
<v Speaker 12>And these guys they came in to engage in you know prostitution type activities</v>

311
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 12>and they dosed them.</v>

312
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.500
<v Speaker 11>They dosed them with LSD.</v>

313
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

314
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.190
<v Speaker 11>And it's an amazing story because the guys can say shit you know you're not</v>

315
00:17:28.191 --> 00:17:31.550
<v Speaker 11>supposed to be in a whorehouse anyway and you're out there and you're getting</v>

316
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:34.460
<v Speaker 11>dosed up with acid like Yikes Holy shit.</v>

317
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.080
<v Speaker 13>They did a lot more than that man.</v>

318
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.360
<v Speaker 13>A lot more than that they went in a mental asylum.</v>

319
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.800
<v Speaker 13>And they doped people up so much that they tried to rewrite their memories to</v>

320
00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:46.250
<v Speaker 13>fix their their various mental disorders.</v>

321
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.530
<v Speaker 13>They wanted to see if they could or right erase memories.</v>

322
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.650
<v Speaker 13>They're doing this to mentally ill people in mental hospitals.</v>

323
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.723
<v Speaker 13>I'll look it up.</v>

324
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:53.720
<v Speaker 13>Project Monarch.</v>

325
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:58.740
<v Speaker 13>The whole point is the CIA is not afraid of putting their feet and crazy river.</v>

326
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.760
<v Speaker 13>They do it all the time.</v>

327
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.770
<v Speaker 13>So I think that the idea that they there is they stopped this thing because they</v>

328
00:18:05.771 --> 00:18:07.120
<v Speaker 13>don't want to embarrass themselves.</v>

329
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.960
<v Speaker 13>No they stopped it because it wasn't working because let me tell you.</v>

330
00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.480
<v Speaker 12>Okay but let's let's for a moment before I stop you I just want to play devil's</v>

331
00:18:13.481 --> 00:18:14.314
<v Speaker 12>advocate okay.</v>

332
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.020
<v Speaker 12>All of those things that we're mentioning are in the past.</v>

333
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.680
<v Speaker 12>Operation midnight climax believes in the 1950s.</v>

334
00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.350
<v Speaker 12>Yeah the this remote viewing movement.</v>

335
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:23.930
<v Speaker 12>They stopped.</v>

336
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.310
<v Speaker 12>That is well.</v>

337
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:30.370
<v Speaker 12>Is it possible and again this is just devil's advocate that they try things and</v>

338
00:18:30.371 --> 00:18:32.260
<v Speaker 12>they don't work so they move on.</v>

339
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:33.730
<v Speaker 12>Is that possible.</v>

340
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.540
<v Speaker 12>Is it possible that they it's it's just that it didn't work.</v>

341
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.910
<v Speaker 13>I mean I think that if any government on the planet figured out a way to use a</v>

342
00:18:42.911 --> 00:18:46.360
<v Speaker 13>team of elite psychics to locate their enemies right.</v>

343
00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.970
<v Speaker 13>They're not gonna be like oh let's cancel this program it's embarrassing they're</v>

344
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.510
<v Speaker 13>gonna keep using it because it's effective.</v>

345
00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:57.220
<v Speaker 13>What's a better thing than you've just set some guy in a chair and have him</v>

346
00:18:57.221 --> 00:19:02.050
<v Speaker 13>communicate all over the planet with whatever matrix of intelligence exist</v>

347
00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.620
<v Speaker 13>between him and whatever.</v>

348
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.360
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

349
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.860
<v Speaker 12>What if it only works every now and then but sometimes it really does work.</v>

350
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.530
<v Speaker 13>I think there's plenty of money in the government to keep somebody like that on</v>

351
00:19:14.531 --> 00:19:16.090
<v Speaker 13>tap but maybe not man.</v>

352
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.200
<v Speaker 13>I think it does work.</v>

353
00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:22.290
<v Speaker 13>I've had so many moments where I'm thinking of a friend and they call or I'll</v>

354
00:19:22.541 --> 00:19:26.410
<v Speaker 13>get a weird feeling about somebody and something bad will happen to them and I</v>

355
00:19:26.411 --> 00:19:29.770
<v Speaker 13>know plenty of people who do that and I know plenty of people who will get</v>

356
00:19:29.771 --> 00:19:34.070
<v Speaker 13>around certain people and immediately not be comfortable around them and they're</v>

357
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.370
<v Speaker 13>sensing something about that person.</v>

358
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.400
<v Speaker 13>I think animals are always tuning into this deeper instinctual level so at some</v>

359
00:19:42.971 --> 00:19:45.730
<v Speaker 13>point it just becomes I think semantics.</v>

360
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.610
<v Speaker 13>Some people are gonna say well I just listen to my instincts.</v>

361
00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.780
<v Speaker 13>Some people are going to say that their psychic so I don't think that there is a</v>

362
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.450
<v Speaker 13>it's too out there to think that there's some people who have especially</v>

363
00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.070
<v Speaker 13>developed instincts where they're really good at tuning in to watch Sheldrake</v>

364
00:20:03.071 --> 00:20:05.140
<v Speaker 13>call the more for genetic field.</v>

365
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.420
<v Speaker 13>I think that's possible that you could do that.</v>

366
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.530
<v Speaker 13>The problem is well if you if it is possible then how come it can't be or</v>

367
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.420
<v Speaker 13>reproduced in laboratory settings.</v>

368
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:18.750
<v Speaker 13>And a lot of people say that immediately discounts it but man I I can't imagine</v>

369
00:20:21.431 --> 00:20:25.780
<v Speaker 13>meeting someone who's never had that moment where you think about someone and</v>

370
00:20:25.781 --> 00:20:28.660
<v Speaker 13>suddenly they call someone that you haven't talked to in years.</v>

371
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.440
<v Speaker 12>You know that that has happened now.</v>

372
00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:35.670
<v Speaker 12>To play devil's advocate again Sam Harris says that all that is is coincidental</v>

373
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.020
<v Speaker 12>and that we think about people all the time and they don't call but occasionally</v>

374
00:20:41.021 --> 00:20:45.130
<v Speaker 12>you think about people and they do call and then it really is just dumb luck.</v>

375
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.110
<v Speaker 12>But we make it out to be this big important moment and we sort of discredit all</v>

376
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:51.730
<v Speaker 12>the other times where it failed.</v>

377
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
<v Speaker 12>But he's like really super logical when it comes to stuff like that to the point</v>

378
00:20:57.191 --> 00:21:01.750
<v Speaker 12>where I almost have to step back like he said that statistically no one really</v>

379
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 12>ever gets a hot hand in basketball where they can't miss it just seems like they</v>

380
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:06.730
<v Speaker 12>do.</v>

381
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:11.730
<v Speaker 12>But if you count up statistically like there's never a zone for where there's an</v>

382
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:15.580
<v Speaker 12>unusual amount of activity over a course of an hour it's like these little</v>

383
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:19.120
<v Speaker 12>bursts where things are really good and then they go away but it all balances</v>

384
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:20.080
<v Speaker 12>itself out in the end.</v>

385
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.320
<v Speaker 12>And I've found it found that very fascinating cause I've always felt like</v>

386
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 12>someone getting in the zone whether it's in golf or in pool or in basketball or</v>

387
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Speaker 12>anything.</v>

388
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.930
<v Speaker 12>I always thought that was a real thing and some people I've seen pool players do</v>

389
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:34.660
<v Speaker 12>it when you get into a place where you just can't miss.</v>

390
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:40.020
<v Speaker 12>And you know you just find that zone and you're significantly better than when</v>

391
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:41.270
<v Speaker 12>you're not in that zone right.</v>

392
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.360
<v Speaker 12>So I've always felt that it was a real thing.</v>

393
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 12>So Sam Harris is a tricky guy when it comes to his ideas on these things.</v>

394
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:48.990
<v Speaker 13>Well who knows man.</v>

395
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.170
<v Speaker 15>Maybe he hasn't experienced it himself but maybe he has and he's analyzed it</v>

396
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.940
<v Speaker 15>more objectively than you and I am.</v>

397
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 15>That's a possibility too.</v>

398
00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:01.290
<v Speaker 14>I had a dream once where in the dream this girl that I was engaged to be married</v>

399
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:07.350
<v Speaker 14>came up to me and said hey I'm pregnant and in the dream I was bummed out.</v>

400
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 14>I'm like Oh great.</v>

401
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.560
<v Speaker 14>Pregnant and then the next day I woke up and an hour after I woke up she called</v>

402
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.620
<v Speaker 14>to tell me that she's getting married now.</v>

403
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.430
<v Speaker 14>Wow.</v>

404
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.220
<v Speaker 14>What is that.</v>

405
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:23.290
<v Speaker 14>Well I know that that happened to me and I know that every night I don't dream</v>

406
00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:26.140
<v Speaker 14>about my ex fiancee being pregnant.</v>

407
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.650
<v Speaker 14>That's not a recurring dream if it were I would be in therapy.</v>

408
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 12>Is she getting married because she's pregnant.</v>

409
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.270
<v Speaker 12>No.</v>

410
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 12>But.</v>

411
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.620
<v Speaker 12>OK well then that doesn't see that's where I would step in as a skeptic.</v>

412
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 12>Not necessarily.</v>

413
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 12>I'm not really a skeptic but if I was I would say because I kind of am sometimes</v>

414
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.420
<v Speaker 12>I would say you probably think about her all the time I think about my exes all</v>

415
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:47.254
<v Speaker 12>the time.</v>

416
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.790
<v Speaker 12>It's like a normal part of life.</v>

417
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.090
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

418
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.830
<v Speaker 14>I don't you're you you were engaged.</v>

419
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.580
<v Speaker 14>Sure.</v>

420
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.240
<v Speaker 14>And I've vivid dreams I understand that.</v>

421
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.360
<v Speaker 12>But you were engaged to her.</v>

422
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.140
<v Speaker 12>That's a very strong connection with someone it's very likely that you bring her</v>

423
00:22:58.141 --> 00:23:00.180
<v Speaker 12>up in your mind on occasion.</v>

424
00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.160
<v Speaker 12>I have your scenario on my stomach.</v>

425
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.540
<v Speaker 12>Your scenario is different than her scenario your scenario is she was pregnant</v>

426
00:23:06.541 --> 00:23:09.030
<v Speaker 12>her scenario the reality was that she was getting married.</v>

427
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.600
<v Speaker 12>Well you just happen to be thinking about her and she just happened to call you</v>

428
00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:16.050
<v Speaker 12>and tell you that she's getting married and you have made this grandiose</v>

429
00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:17.310
<v Speaker 12>connection between a dream.</v>

430
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.180
<v Speaker 14>Well let me play the real devil's advocate because as many Christians know the</v>

431
00:23:21.181 --> 00:23:26.181
<v Speaker 14>devil is the advocate of psychics the psychics say that what actually happens is</v>

432
00:23:27.451 --> 00:23:32.430
<v Speaker 14>that your mind is kind of like scanning and it doesn't always accurately</v>

433
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 14>interpret the event.</v>

434
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.460
<v Speaker 14>So pregnancy and marriage that go hand in hand and then she did end up having</v>

435
00:23:38.461 --> 00:23:39.294
<v Speaker 14>children.</v>

436
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.920
<v Speaker 14>So the the point what makes it special and by the way I don't I know what Sam</v>

437
00:23:43.921 --> 00:23:44.700
<v Speaker 14>Harris is talking about.</v>

438
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.700
<v Speaker 14>They've done studies about the idea that there's perpetually as just a vortex of</v>

439
00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.020
<v Speaker 14>variables spinning through your mind that consist of all the people you know and</v>

440
00:23:55.021 --> 00:23:58.970
<v Speaker 14>all the things that could happen and those things are mostly in the subconscious</v>

441
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:02.940
<v Speaker 14>but when something in the external universe happens that resonates with</v>

442
00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 14>something in the subconscious that creates the sense of synchronicity that you</v>

443
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.693
<v Speaker 14>say is real.</v>

444
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:12.120
<v Speaker 14>Yeah man I know that I don't always dream about it I know the dream was very</v>

445
00:24:12.121 --> 00:24:16.170
<v Speaker 14>vivid I know it was like really soon after waking up to the point where when I</v>

446
00:24:16.171 --> 00:24:18.540
<v Speaker 14>got off the phone I was like What the fuck.</v>

447
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.090
<v Speaker 14>That is really weird.</v>

448
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:26.040
<v Speaker 12>So well it is like it's not outside of the realm of possibility but all I ever</v>

449
00:24:26.041 --> 00:24:31.041
<v Speaker 12>say in these situations is I try even though I am a natural dork and my natural</v>

450
00:24:34.141 --> 00:24:35.730
<v Speaker 12>inclination is to believe in psychics.</v>

451
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.940
<v Speaker 12>My natural inclination is to believe in Bigfoot and aliens and UFOs and</v>

452
00:24:38.941 --> 00:24:39.540
<v Speaker 12>everything.</v>

453
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 12>But I also think that there's a benefit in considering the completely numerical</v>

454
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.980
<v Speaker 12>scientific approach you know in looking at how a guy like Sam Harris would look</v>

455
00:24:49.981 --> 00:24:54.350
<v Speaker 12>out and go you know what you have to address that too why wouldn't you address</v>

456
00:24:54.351 --> 00:24:54.470
<v Speaker 12>that.</v>

457
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.970
<v Speaker 12>You know we don't want to address that because we don't want to miss out on some</v>

458
00:24:56.971 --> 00:25:01.320
<v Speaker 12>of the magic that is the world right and we'd like to think that in in being</v>

459
00:25:01.321 --> 00:25:04.410
<v Speaker 12>able to tell when things are about to happen to you that somehow maybe that</v>

460
00:25:04.411 --> 00:25:07.260
<v Speaker 12>offers you some veil of protection that other people don't enjoy.</v>

461
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.830
<v Speaker 12>You know and sometime with its shit is going to happen I'm not going to know not</v>

462
00:25:10.831 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 12>to get on that plane.</v>

463
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.900
<v Speaker 12>You know and we would like to think that we would like to think that I know many</v>

464
00:25:15.901 --> 00:25:20.520
<v Speaker 12>people miss planes and then the plane crashes and they swear they knew they</v>

465
00:25:20.521 --> 00:25:21.600
<v Speaker 12>shouldn't get on that plane.</v>

466
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.910
<v Speaker 12>I mean there's probably a lot of that too.</v>

467
00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.660
<v Speaker 12>I would if that happened I maybe I hadn't thought it I'd say I was going to get</v>

468
00:25:27.661 --> 00:25:30.810
<v Speaker 12>on the plane maybe maybe we'd become a part of your consciousness maybe whether</v>

469
00:25:30.811 --> 00:25:32.430
<v Speaker 12>you like it or not just enter in there.</v>

470
00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:37.110
<v Speaker 14>Well yeah you know I like what Terence McKenna said about people you know</v>

471
00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:42.690
<v Speaker 14>ancient humans and hunting and how you would have to develop the ability to</v>

472
00:25:42.691 --> 00:25:45.900
<v Speaker 14>silently communicate with a group of people that you're hunting with.</v>

473
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.040
<v Speaker 14>It would make it it would make you very effective if as a hunter especially if</v>

474
00:25:50.041 --> 00:25:53.430
<v Speaker 14>you're hunting in group situations where you had to stalk something.</v>

475
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:53.850
<v Speaker 14>Yes.</v>

476
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.850
<v Speaker 14>So in that way I could see how there might be a part of our brain that you can</v>

477
00:25:59.971 --> 00:26:04.971
<v Speaker 14>develop to be acutely tuned in to what the people around you are thinking about</v>

478
00:26:05.371 --> 00:26:06.000
<v Speaker 14>doing.</v>

479
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.850
<v Speaker 14>I think all sports teams are based on that.</v>

480
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:14.060
<v Speaker 14>I think that I'm sure that people who fight or you get in there really serious</v>

481
00:26:14.221 --> 00:26:18.570
<v Speaker 14>situations will tell you that they can really tune in to every sound you hear</v>

482
00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:22.290
<v Speaker 14>that when someone's in a situation where they have to fight or they're in a life</v>

483
00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:24.030
<v Speaker 14>or death situation you always hear this.</v>

484
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.360
<v Speaker 14>Suddenly everything becomes very loud they can hear everything see everything.</v>

485
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:35.880
<v Speaker 14>So I think it makes sense that there is a deeper part of the human mind that is</v>

486
00:26:35.881 --> 00:26:40.050
<v Speaker 14>more aware than the conscious part of the mind that makes sense.</v>

487
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.943
<v Speaker 14>I don't I don't.</v>

488
00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.670
<v Speaker 14>I don't know if that's what psychics say that they're using but I think that</v>

489
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 14>that does exist in the human mind.</v>

490
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.690
<v Speaker 12>It's also possible.</v>

491
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:54.060
<v Speaker 12>I think that there is like it's almost like a waterfall that we sort of can poke</v>

492
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:57.660
<v Speaker 12>our heads through and then pull it back and then we can't tune in all the time.</v>

493
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.930
<v Speaker 12>It's very ethereal it's very slippery.</v>

494
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.320
<v Speaker 12>Yeah and you get it or you don't get it and maybe some people get it better than</v>

495
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.213
<v Speaker 12>than we do.</v>

496
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.340
<v Speaker 12>But one of the things that I have to respectfully acknowledge is that Ed dames</v>

497
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:17.240
<v Speaker 12>who has done this for so long trains people and it was pretty clear to me that I</v>

498
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 12>needed to learn it in order to really understand it and I didn't learn it and I</v>

499
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:23.340
<v Speaker 12>certainly didn't learn it from him.</v>

500
00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:28.020
<v Speaker 12>I mean Paul taught it to me very quickly but it was really just for the show.</v>

501
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 12>You know if we had spent a bunch of time together like over several weeks and I</v>

502
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:36.270
<v Speaker 12>really like tried to do it as if I was a prospect for one of their programs</v>

503
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 12>maybe I could learn what the hell he was talking about maybe it's just my</v>

504
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:40.620
<v Speaker 12>silliness.</v>

505
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:44.460
<v Speaker 12>Maybe there was a breakthrough to be had that I didn't recognize it's super</v>

506
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:45.780
<v Speaker 12>possible that that's the case.</v>

507
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 12>But you know there's all there's part of you for sure.</v>

508
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.790
<v Speaker 12>That's always gonna be skeptical until it's right and front of you.</v>

509
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:53.540
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>

510
00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.320
<v Speaker 13>And if you've experienced it then you have it.</v>

511
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.420
<v Speaker 13>You can be skeptical about the experience but you have to acknowledge the</v>

512
00:27:59.421 --> 00:28:00.254
<v Speaker 13>experience.</v>

513
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:00.860
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

514
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.160
<v Speaker 12>No.</v>

515
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.140
<v Speaker 12>And then I went to the Rhine Institute.</v>

516
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.860
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

517
00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.780
<v Speaker 12>And this is really interesting.</v>

518
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.590
<v Speaker 12>That's the.</v>

519
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.490
<v Speaker 12>They're the place for the Scientific Study of the paranormal center.</v>

520
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.010
<v Speaker 12>And I had a great time there.</v>

521
00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.900
<v Speaker 12>Who is the guy that ran the Ryan center.</v>

522
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.323
<v Speaker 12>John Cruyff.</v>

523
00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:23.260
<v Speaker 12>John Carruth is the guy who ran the Ryan center and was kind enough to take us</v>

524
00:28:23.421 --> 00:28:24.254
<v Speaker 12>through and show.</v>

525
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.900
<v Speaker 12>I sucked it over everything I tried to be psychic with the numbers like can</v>

526
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.560
<v Speaker 12>picking which button to press.</v>

527
00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.830
<v Speaker 12>I try to be psychic with picking winners but in the process I screwed that up.</v>

528
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:38.870
<v Speaker 12>And but one thing I did do is they had this this room where it's totally dark</v>

529
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:43.970
<v Speaker 12>and they have this meter that measures photons and apparently you can create</v>

530
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:49.030
<v Speaker 12>some sort of light from your body some sort of set so some sort of photon</v>

531
00:28:50.421 --> 00:28:54.850
<v Speaker 12>release that can be measured and the highest that anybody ever did it was this</v>

532
00:28:54.851 --> 00:28:59.851
<v Speaker 12>guy IRL and this guy IRL was like if he was a character in a Will Ferrell movie</v>

533
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.420
<v Speaker 12>like he would be like the perfect cohort he'd be like Will Ferrell's crazy</v>

534
00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:11.340
<v Speaker 12>partner who also happens to be psychic.</v>

535
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Speaker 9>Yeah and he was trying to move me with his mind.</v>

536
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.040
<v Speaker 9>Ed what did I say his name was Will Earl.</v>

537
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.390
<v Speaker 9>He seems like it should be at Earl.</v>

538
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.380
<v Speaker 9>HIS NAME WAS ED Yeah.</v>

539
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:25.790
<v Speaker 9>Ed had gotten to one million on this thing and Ed also could make you weave back</v>

540
00:29:27.211 --> 00:29:27.990
<v Speaker 9>and forth.</v>

541
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:32.430
<v Speaker 9>He could he could like direct you with his body and force force your body</v>

542
00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:33.360
<v Speaker 9>backward and forward.</v>

543
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.790
<v Speaker 9>Or so he said he tried to do it.</v>

544
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.870
<v Speaker 9>I didn't move at all.</v>

545
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 9>I don't know what he's talking about but I try.</v>

546
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.300
<v Speaker 9>I let him try it but he's gotten to a million on this photon thing.</v>

547
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:48.110
<v Speaker 9>I got to four hundred thousand which they were very shocked by but I had a</v>

548
00:29:48.271 --> 00:29:49.760
<v Speaker 9>battery pack on my head.</v>

549
00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 9>I had a microphone and when I was doing it I was stretching so mean the battery</v>

550
00:29:56.311 --> 00:29:58.740
<v Speaker 9>pack we had like tape over the light and everything like that.</v>

551
00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.160
<v Speaker 9>But the bottom line is there's like a piece of electronics in the room sure.</v>

552
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:07.700
<v Speaker 11>We did it again and I got even though I got less much less than the first time I</v>

553
00:30:07.831 --> 00:30:09.300
<v Speaker 11>basically did the same stuff I was doing.</v>

554
00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:13.080
<v Speaker 11>I was most like leaning forward and touching my toes like stretching and stuff.</v>

555
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.890
<v Speaker 15>And I was also trying to breathe really hard as I was.</v>

556
00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.430
<v Speaker 15>But then I thought about us like how is that psychic.</v>

557
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.950
<v Speaker 15>What am I doing even if I can glow you know like in a way that a human being</v>

558
00:30:25.951 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 15>couldn't even perceive if you could like hold your breath to the point we</v>

559
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.480
<v Speaker 15>fucking glow or get tense up and scream to the point where you G.I.</v>

560
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.530
<v Speaker 15>until a spark comes out of your dick.</v>

561
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.250
<v Speaker 15>I don't know I don't know if that's possible but either way it's not psychic.</v>

562
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.510
<v Speaker 15>I mean there was nothing I did that gave me any inclination whatsoever that have</v>

563
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:47.570
<v Speaker 15>any psychic ability but I registered very highly on this one silly test.</v>

564
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.140
<v Speaker 15>Yeah while I was running a battery pack.</v>

565
00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:50.490
<v Speaker 16>Yeah.</v>

566
00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.750
<v Speaker 16>You know it's to be the battery.</v>

567
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.330
<v Speaker 16>I mean I think who knows man.</v>

568
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.670
<v Speaker 9>I don't know call them up the next day because he seem like an honest guy and</v>

569
00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.220
<v Speaker 9>you know he was really excited about the results I said you know what I think we</v>

570
00:30:59.221 --> 00:30:59.920
<v Speaker 9>screwed up.</v>

571
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.130
<v Speaker 9>Well I think we should have done one without the battery pack.</v>

572
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.940
<v Speaker 9>We did it twice to see if we could replicate it you know but this thing is still</v>

573
00:31:05.941 --> 00:31:10.941
<v Speaker 9>on me and even though it's behind me and we're in this when it's totally dark</v>

574
00:31:11.251 --> 00:31:14.910
<v Speaker 9>room I'm still wearing a battery pack and I'm moving around and I don't know if</v>

575
00:31:14.911 --> 00:31:16.950
<v Speaker 9>Ed was doing the same things that I was doing.</v>

576
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:21.840
<v Speaker 11>So even though my score on this this thing was was higher I might have been</v>

577
00:31:21.841 --> 00:31:23.160
<v Speaker 11>moving more than he was.</v>

578
00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.090
<v Speaker 14>That might have been why the the light changed in the room wearing this little</v>

579
00:31:27.091 --> 00:31:30.900
<v Speaker 14>battery pack so this wasn't really scientific test but if you look at the</v>

580
00:31:30.901 --> 00:31:35.901
<v Speaker 14>evolution of animals right and you think about animals before eyeballs existed</v>

581
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.590
<v Speaker 14>the evolution of the eye.</v>

582
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.830
<v Speaker 14>You think about the gradual evolution of the eye.</v>

583
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.250
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

584
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:45.270
<v Speaker 14>There would be certain animals that were that mutation was happening to more</v>

585
00:31:45.271 --> 00:31:46.110
<v Speaker 14>than other animals.</v>

586
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.640
<v Speaker 14>Yet those animals could talk and they started reporting to other animals Hey man</v>

587
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.580
<v Speaker 14>there is stuff all around us.</v>

588
00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:55.030
<v Speaker 14>There are things swimming.</v>

589
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.520
<v Speaker 14>I've seeing reefs right.</v>

590
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.390
<v Speaker 14>That's if that the other animals like you are out of your mind there's this</v>

591
00:32:00.391 --> 00:32:02.970
<v Speaker 14>darkness and movement that's all there is.</v>

592
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.110
<v Speaker 14>You're crazy.</v>

593
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:09.410
<v Speaker 14>So I don't think that it's an insane idea that our senses are continuing to</v>

594
00:32:10.111 --> 00:32:12.000
<v Speaker 14>expand and to evolve right.</v>

595
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.330
<v Speaker 14>And if you think about what they used to be compared to what they are now we are</v>

596
00:32:15.331 --> 00:32:17.410
<v Speaker 14>like gods compared to what we used to be.</v>

597
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:21.330
<v Speaker 14>You know when we are just tiny little lemur creatures eating each other's poop</v>

598
00:32:21.331 --> 00:32:24.450
<v Speaker 14>and running from snakes all day that's a very good point.</v>

599
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.480
<v Speaker 12>But another point is if that is the case and we're pretty aware of the</v>

600
00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:34.110
<v Speaker 12>established state of consciousness that exists right now without psychic ability</v>

601
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:38.280
<v Speaker 12>we're pretty sure that most of the time almost everywhere you go there's no</v>

602
00:32:38.281 --> 00:32:43.281
<v Speaker 12>psychic ability going on it's just normal life but little peeps of it pop</v>

603
00:32:43.441 --> 00:32:43.980
<v Speaker 12>through.</v>

604
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.280
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

605
00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:48.660
<v Speaker 12>Every now and then almost like poking through a membrane finding its way</v>

606
00:32:48.661 --> 00:32:53.560
<v Speaker 12>dissolving this membrane slowly but surely with new experiences all the time.</v>

607
00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:57.810
<v Speaker 12>But the membranes gigantic because really what we're talking about is an</v>

608
00:32:57.811 --> 00:33:02.811
<v Speaker 12>evolving ability and it takes a long ass time for a human being to evolve an</v>

609
00:33:03.511 --> 00:33:04.050
<v Speaker 12>ability.</v>

610
00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:04.450
<v Speaker 14>Right.</v>

611
00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:08.130
<v Speaker 14>And you know some people though say that it's not an evolving ability it's a</v>

612
00:33:08.131 --> 00:33:12.870
<v Speaker 14>devolving ability than we used to be more tuned into what was happening around</v>

613
00:33:12.871 --> 00:33:12.990
<v Speaker 14>us.</v>

614
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:17.070
<v Speaker 14>But then technology took the place of that because really I don't need to be</v>

615
00:33:17.071 --> 00:33:21.690
<v Speaker 14>telepathic I can send you a text through the air I don't need to be in a panic</v>

616
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.350
<v Speaker 14>but look at birds look at birds what they can do or look at.</v>

617
00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:26.940
<v Speaker 14>Dogs.</v>

618
00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.360
<v Speaker 14>Dogs.</v>

619
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.900
<v Speaker 12>I don't think that people think that you that we used to be able to do it</v>

620
00:33:30.901 --> 00:33:31.734
<v Speaker 12>though.</v>

621
00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:35.590
<v Speaker 14>Well I think the idea is and maybe it is a romantic idea.</v>

622
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.320
<v Speaker 14>But the idea is that the more tuned in you get to nature the more tuned in you</v>

623
00:33:40.321 --> 00:33:45.321
<v Speaker 14>get to the movement of things on Earth the actual the life force on Earth.</v>

624
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:50.880
<v Speaker 14>Yeah and the more you begin to hear deeper parts of yourself when things quiet</v>

625
00:33:51.121 --> 00:33:54.360
<v Speaker 14>down you can eat like you go in that floatation tank.</v>

626
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:54.910
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

627
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:59.540
<v Speaker 14>You know and when things really quiet down you can hear very deep parts of</v>

628
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:01.820
<v Speaker 14>yourself that normally you don't listen to at all.</v>

629
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:02.390
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

630
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.540
<v Speaker 14>So I think the idea is without all the distractions of modern life.</v>

631
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.170
<v Speaker 14>People were more tuned into a deeper instinct than we have now.</v>

632
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 12>I think you're completely right.</v>

633
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:16.240
<v Speaker 12>I think that it's real possible that we're inundated by too much sensory</v>

634
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:21.701
<v Speaker 12>overload and that we're not relying on a lot of the instincts that we had to</v>

635
00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 12>rely on when we were hunter gatherers.</v>

636
00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 12>We're all we're doing is constantly hunting down animals and on the prowl for</v>

637
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:33.890
<v Speaker 12>your next meal and being really in touch with the Earth without any electrical</v>

638
00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:37.070
<v Speaker 12>signals around us all the time without any Wi-Fi without any radio.</v>

639
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:41.300
<v Speaker 12>You know I like to think that that shit doesn't have any effect on me that I'm</v>

640
00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:42.530
<v Speaker 12>not affected by Wi-Fi.</v>

641
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.220
<v Speaker 12>And that sounds like totally kooky talk.</v>

642
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 15>Like what are you talking about man.</v>

643
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:47.750
<v Speaker 15>Scared a cell phone towers dude.</v>

644
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 15>Are they zapping you.</v>

645
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.560
<v Speaker 12>I'm not saying that but what I am saying is there is something undeniably</v>

646
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:58.780
<v Speaker 12>different about where it feels when there's nothing.</v>

647
00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.020
<v Speaker 12>If you go to a place that's in the mountains and very peaceful and you step</v>

648
00:35:03.021 --> 00:35:07.040
<v Speaker 12>outside and there's no cell phone signals you don't I mean I guess you could</v>

649
00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:10.670
<v Speaker 12>probably tune into the radio up there but it is not much.</v>

650
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.540
<v Speaker 12>Yes it's fucking quiet as shit to you're not getting any noise pollution not</v>

651
00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:15.750
<v Speaker 12>getting city not.</v>

652
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:17.090
<v Speaker 12>It's a different feeling.</v>

653
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 12>Now if that was life all the time and without even the distractions the</v>

654
00:35:22.641 --> 00:35:27.641
<v Speaker 12>electronic distractions that that world sort of forces on you there's still some</v>

655
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.860
<v Speaker 12>who still you still have a TV still have.</v>

656
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.000
<v Speaker 12>If you were just in the woods all the time it's a totally different feeling.</v>

657
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:40.280
<v Speaker 14>Yeah and if you're in the woods now with a tracker who knows how to track</v>

658
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:44.570
<v Speaker 14>animals and they just start tracking animals it would seem like they're magical</v>

659
00:35:44.571 --> 00:35:46.640
<v Speaker 14>probably in some of the things that they could do.</v>

660
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:51.790
<v Speaker 14>Yeah it's amazing so yeah man I think that that there is a difference.</v>

661
00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:56.300
<v Speaker 14>I just saw this awesome visual depiction of why five you seen that it's a</v>

662
00:35:56.301 --> 00:36:01.301
<v Speaker 14>picture of what Wi-Fi would look like if if if we could see it in the air and we</v>

663
00:36:02.001 --> 00:36:06.290
<v Speaker 14>look like it looks just like an ocean like this rolling ocean of information</v>

664
00:36:06.291 --> 00:36:08.630
<v Speaker 14>that we're all swimming around in right now.</v>

665
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:09.710
<v Speaker 14>That's so crazy.</v>

666
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:10.460
<v Speaker 14>It's crazy.</v>

667
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.340
<v Speaker 12>How long is it going to be before people forget about being psychic.</v>

668
00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.300
<v Speaker 12>How long's it gonna be before you have some sort of Verizon chip in your head</v>

669
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.130
<v Speaker 12>that allows you to tune into the Internet.</v>

670
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.800
<v Speaker 12>Not long it doesn't seem like it's gonna be long right.</v>

671
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:23.840
<v Speaker 12>Not long ago within one hundred years.</v>

672
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.570
<v Speaker 14>That's gonna be reality I think within ten years.</v>

673
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.230
<v Speaker 14>Really.</v>

674
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.650
<v Speaker 14>Yes.</v>

675
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:31.040
<v Speaker 14>Like an operation I don't know about an operation I think within 10 years</v>

676
00:36:31.041 --> 00:36:34.940
<v Speaker 14>they'll figure out a way to do it without an operation that's going to be so</v>

677
00:36:34.941 --> 00:36:35.450
<v Speaker 14>strange.</v>

678
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:38.750
<v Speaker 14>And then it will be a world of psychics and then being psychic won't seem</v>

679
00:36:38.751 --> 00:36:42.260
<v Speaker 14>strange at all because everyone will have the ability to tune in immediately to</v>

680
00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:47.270
<v Speaker 14>all information on and available to anyone on earth or that's on the Internet</v>

681
00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:48.920
<v Speaker 14>and you know some people going to complain about that.</v>

682
00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:53.180
<v Speaker 14>Again I go through.</v>

683
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.120
<v Speaker 17>It everyone's thinking hell for lives.</v>

684
00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:01.970
<v Speaker 18>Did you hear about the cyborg that just got beaten up in France a cyborg.</v>

685
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:03.090
<v Speaker 18>Yeah a guy's got.</v>

686
00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:07.190
<v Speaker 18>There's a guy who one of the first ocular implants.</v>

687
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:12.310
<v Speaker 18>It's like connected to his bones it's a video camera that films things and he</v>

688
00:37:12.411 --> 00:37:17.411
<v Speaker 18>was in a McDonald's in Paris and he goes in there the owner of the McDonald's</v>

689
00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.960
<v Speaker 18>sees him tells him to take off his google glass he throws Google glasses and I</v>

690
00:37:23.961 --> 00:37:25.100
<v Speaker 18>can't I can't take it off.</v>

691
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:29.930
<v Speaker 18>He brings medical papers with him to show people that it's an implant right.</v>

692
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:35.120
<v Speaker 18>But they didn't care and they you know they tried to rip it off his face but</v>

693
00:37:35.661 --> 00:37:37.160
<v Speaker 18>it's connected to his bones.</v>

694
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.220
<v Speaker 18>Oh my God.</v>

695
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.990
<v Speaker 18>So the thing is got now the thing is got in it.</v>

696
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:47.150
<v Speaker 18>This if it starts malfunctioning it starts taking pictures of what's happening</v>

697
00:37:47.241 --> 00:37:51.890
<v Speaker 18>when it malfunctions so he's got images of these French dudes who tried to rip</v>

698
00:37:51.891 --> 00:37:52.730
<v Speaker 18>his face off.</v>

699
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.780
<v Speaker 18>So what happened to the he's filing charges with the police but they don't</v>

700
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:57.350
<v Speaker 18>they're not.</v>

701
00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:58.730
<v Speaker 18>I mean it's like it's so weird.</v>

702
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.950
<v Speaker 18>The cops are like look we don't know how to handle cyborg crime.</v>

703
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.040
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>

704
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.960
<v Speaker 18>Why would they say this is gonna be an emergent form of.</v>

705
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:11.420
<v Speaker 18>This is gonna be a new kind of hate crime which is people beating up cyborgs.</v>

706
00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.640
<v Speaker 19>I think that's probably going to be the case.</v>

707
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:18.110
<v Speaker 19>I think especially if the limbs possessed superpowers like if you start getting</v>

708
00:38:18.111 --> 00:38:21.800
<v Speaker 19>into like some six million dollar man realm where you decide to get your legs</v>

709
00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:25.360
<v Speaker 19>chopped off and put these super bionic legs on you just jumping over buildings</v>

710
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:27.380
<v Speaker 19>and shirt and you know some guys might kick your ass.</v>

711
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.090
<v Speaker 19>The MillerCoors is crazy.</v>

712
00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:29.953
<v Speaker 19>Good luck.</v>

713
00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.140
<v Speaker 19>I know you have your cyborg legs.</v>

714
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.260
<v Speaker 19>They'll be really hard but if they hit you in the head you probably saw a human</v>

715
00:38:36.261 --> 00:38:39.030
<v Speaker 19>head you know sucker punch you Ryan see it coming.</v>

716
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:40.840
<v Speaker 19>And then when you're out it's fuck you up.</v>

717
00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.440
<v Speaker 18>Well this is like another problem.</v>

718
00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.730
<v Speaker 18>This is a very off topic but this is another problem that's emerging is that</v>

719
00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:52.060
<v Speaker 18>right now the disparity in wealth is indicated through people's possessions</v>

720
00:38:52.251 --> 00:38:54.230
<v Speaker 18>their cars and their homes and their bling.</v>

721
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.850
<v Speaker 18>But in the future this disparity will be reflected in their physical appearance</v>

722
00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:03.680
<v Speaker 18>so poor people who can't afford cyborg legs or cyborg arms or implants that</v>

723
00:39:03.681 --> 00:39:08.681
<v Speaker 18>allow them to tune into the Internet they're going to have this incredible</v>

724
00:39:08.841 --> 00:39:13.130
<v Speaker 18>disadvantage compared to people who can afford the implants.</v>

725
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.340
<v Speaker 18>You know and that's that's a real problem and you're really seeing evolution</v>

726
00:39:16.341 --> 00:39:21.170
<v Speaker 18>there because those people who can't afford it are going to gradually slowly die</v>

727
00:39:21.171 --> 00:39:22.004
<v Speaker 18>out.</v>

728
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:27.550
<v Speaker 12>Yeah I wonder man I really wonder if what these what we're seeing with these</v>

729
00:39:28.251 --> 00:39:32.090
<v Speaker 12>people that possess this sort of psychic energy that tune into this psychic</v>

730
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Speaker 12>Genji if everyone can do it we're just scared of even knowing that we can do it</v>

731
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.170
<v Speaker 12>so we don't look into it.</v>

732
00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.820
<v Speaker 11>I mean why haven't I looked into it.</v>

733
00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:45.380
<v Speaker 11>Why haven't I picked up a book on you know on psychic skills like there's books</v>

734
00:39:45.381 --> 00:39:49.070
<v Speaker 11>on it supposedly teach you how to cultivate your psychic skills.</v>

735
00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.020
<v Speaker 11>I haven't given them an honest try.</v>

736
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:55.520
<v Speaker 11>I haven't like sat down with them and been been completely objective.</v>

737
00:39:55.550 --> 00:40:00.550
<v Speaker 11>So if I was making any judgment that psychic energy wasn't real I would be I</v>

738
00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.100
<v Speaker 11>would be kind of a dick because it's not fair.</v>

739
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.270
<v Speaker 11>I really haven't tried.</v>

740
00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:09.050
<v Speaker 11>I don't possess it but I haven't tried I haven't tried to cultivate it I haven't</v>

741
00:40:09.051 --> 00:40:13.200
<v Speaker 11>done any of the work these guys had dames and and and Paul Smith.</v>

742
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.330
<v Speaker 11>They they have done their work and they say they can do it.</v>

743
00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.380
<v Speaker 8>So I have to take their word for it but I think that I would like to see</v>

744
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.900
<v Speaker 8>something that really stands out for me.</v>

745
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.750
<v Speaker 8>I mean they had some good stories about stuff that works.</v>

746
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:31.020
<v Speaker 8>I would like to see something really stands out for me because the most</v>

747
00:40:31.021 --> 00:40:35.610
<v Speaker 8>impressive display of psychic ability I've ever seen in my life was self</v>

748
00:40:35.611 --> 00:40:40.611
<v Speaker 8>admittedly fake a better check that was the best display of psychic ability I</v>

749
00:40:42.101 --> 00:40:43.520
<v Speaker 8>have ever seen in my life.</v>

750
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 15>I do not know how he did it but I saw him make forks bend without barely</v>

751
00:40:50.011 --> 00:40:50.844
<v Speaker 15>touching them.</v>

752
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.380
<v Speaker 14>I saw him make them twist up in a circle as he was guiding them his search that</v>

753
00:40:55.381 --> 00:40:58.680
<v Speaker 14>as soon as I got down to find out how to do that and would they say well what</v>

754
00:40:58.681 --> 00:41:01.770
<v Speaker 14>you do is you take a I mean there's a step by step guide to it.</v>

755
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.360
<v Speaker 14>Know it's possible.</v>

756
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.020
<v Speaker 14>Oh yeah.</v>

757
00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:08.150
<v Speaker 14>You take the you take aluminum forks.</v>

758
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.840
<v Speaker 14>Right exactly like what he had.</v>

759
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.620
<v Speaker 14>And I mean this is according to the YouTube thing I didn't spend a lot of time</v>

760
00:41:13.621 --> 00:41:17.070
<v Speaker 14>with it because you have to bend but you bend them right so you bend them and</v>

761
00:41:17.071 --> 00:41:17.904
<v Speaker 14>they heat up.</v>

762
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:22.380
<v Speaker 14>So before you do your show you spend some time on these forks.</v>

763
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:27.420
<v Speaker 14>They get there by bending them they heat up they're looser and then that makes</v>

764
00:41:27.421 --> 00:41:28.350
<v Speaker 14>them more bendable.</v>

765
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.750
<v Speaker 14>And I imagine that's it.</v>

766
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:34.860
<v Speaker 14>Ben this is not a if you google search a lot of what he did there is it shows</v>

767
00:41:35.701 --> 00:41:37.050
<v Speaker 14>how to do it on the really.</v>

768
00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:37.380
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

769
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:42.380
<v Speaker 11>Boy I would like to see that because I guess it's very possible I didn't really</v>

770
00:41:42.571 --> 00:41:46.080
<v Speaker 11>completely thoroughly examine those force but I did click them together and they</v>

771
00:41:46.081 --> 00:41:46.620
<v Speaker 11>were metal.</v>

772
00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:50.520
<v Speaker 11>Clink clink and I picked them up I looked at them there were real forks whether</v>

773
00:41:50.521 --> 00:41:54.390
<v Speaker 11>or not that was the fourth that actually made it into his hand when he did that.</v>

774
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.990
<v Speaker 11>I don't I mean there's guys that are really good with sleight of hand.</v>

775
00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:58.440
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

776
00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.760
<v Speaker 11>You know they're really good with it.</v>

777
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:04.320
<v Speaker 11>So that's possible but what's important is that he says it's bullshit all right.</v>

778
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.540
<v Speaker 11>He told us that it's all tricks.</v>

779
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:10.080
<v Speaker 11>He said I'm not psychic I have no psychic energy I can't tell you how I did this</v>

780
00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.650
<v Speaker 11>because then I would reveal my sources but I'm not psychic.</v>

781
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.573
<v Speaker 11>I believe him.</v>

782
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.400
<v Speaker 11>I mean I don't have any reason to not believe him.</v>

783
00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.690
<v Speaker 11>He seems like a very nice guy and it was very entertaining.</v>

784
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:26.340
<v Speaker 11>He's very very talented like I felt like we really got a treat because we got</v>

785
00:42:26.341 --> 00:42:30.390
<v Speaker 11>like a very small intimate show with a master magician.</v>

786
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:30.750
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

787
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.130
<v Speaker 11>I mean he really is a master.</v>

788
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:32.520
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

789
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.380
<v Speaker 11>So it was really entertaining.</v>

790
00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:39.210
<v Speaker 11>And then the fact that on top of that he was telling us that it was all just</v>

791
00:42:39.211 --> 00:42:39.900
<v Speaker 11>tricks.</v>

792
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.530
<v Speaker 11>I found that to be like really fascinating.</v>

793
00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.150
<v Speaker 14>Oh yeah.</v>

794
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.650
<v Speaker 14>He's like an uber skeptic.</v>

795
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:43.870
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

796
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:47.490
<v Speaker 14>And he's showing how it's so easy to manipulate people and he's showing how</v>

797
00:42:47.491 --> 00:42:52.190
<v Speaker 14>you've got to be very careful when you get around somebody who tells you that</v>

798
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.190
<v Speaker 14>they can talk to dead people they can talk to invisible people because you get</v>

799
00:42:56.191 --> 00:42:59.160
<v Speaker 14>all you get a lot of trouble with those folks.</v>

800
00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:02.810
<v Speaker 15>Well he fooled scientists for four years.</v>

801
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:03.360
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>

802
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.740
<v Speaker 15>They thought he had real psychic abilities for four years he fooled them.</v>

803
00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:09.120
<v Speaker 15>Yeah it's amazing.</v>

804
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 14>He made me much more skeptical but I'm.</v>

805
00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:13.440
<v Speaker 14>But he still didn't.</v>

806
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.690
<v Speaker 14>You can't remove from me like experiences I've had where it's like I don't know</v>

807
00:43:18.691 --> 00:43:23.490
<v Speaker 14>what that is but it's such an incredible coincidence that it seems beyond</v>

808
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:24.450
<v Speaker 14>coincidence.</v>

809
00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:26.160
<v Speaker 12>I don't think he was trying to remove that.</v>

810
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.220
<v Speaker 12>I think what he was trying to do is it's show that you could B.S.</v>

811
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:30.290
<v Speaker 12>people yes you can.</v>

812
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.140
<v Speaker 12>And that's what he did.</v>

813
00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:31.710
<v Speaker 12>He B.S.</v>

814
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:32.230
<v Speaker 12>people.</v>

815
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.460
<v Speaker 12>He's.</v>

816
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.440
<v Speaker 12>I don't think he's saying that you can't have these unique moments where where</v>

817
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.490
<v Speaker 12>something becomes apparent to you.</v>

818
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.050
<v Speaker 12>I think what he was trying to do was just show you that you can be tricked.</v>

819
00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.590
<v Speaker 12>Yes.</v>

820
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:44.650
<v Speaker 12>And he was really good.</v>

821
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.050
<v Speaker 12>I mean really good at it.</v>

822
00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.220
<v Speaker 12>Amazing at it.</v>

823
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 15>We put coins over his eyeballs duct taped his face and he read the serial number</v>

824
00:43:52.531 --> 00:43:54.540
<v Speaker 15>on a bill that was in my pocket.</v>

825
00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:58.920
<v Speaker 15>I have no idea how he did that he wasn't even looking at it.</v>

826
00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.480
<v Speaker 15>He was looking over there.</v>

827
00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:01.220
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>

828
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.460
<v Speaker 15>That was crazy man.</v>

829
00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.950
<v Speaker 15>It was crazy a lot of what he did was crazy.</v>

830
00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:06.690
<v Speaker 15>First of all he's 50 OK.</v>

831
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:10.410
<v Speaker 15>The idea that he could read it from my hand this far away.</v>

832
00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:15.030
<v Speaker 15>I've got it I've got it a full arm's length away from his face that he can even</v>

833
00:44:15.031 --> 00:44:18.840
<v Speaker 15>look over and read that serial number there's little tiny print on a dollar</v>

834
00:44:18.841 --> 00:44:19.410
<v Speaker 15>bill.</v>

835
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:20.490
<v Speaker 15>They're going to read that from there.</v>

836
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.780
<v Speaker 15>That would be really hard to do.</v>

837
00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 15>But with duct tape over your face or coins over your eyeball yet and you're not</v>

838
00:44:27.181 --> 00:44:29.430
<v Speaker 15>even looking at it I don't know how he did it.</v>

839
00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.440
<v Speaker 15>I don't know how he did a lot of what he did.</v>

840
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 15>It was amazing.</v>

841
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:32.790
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>

842
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 15>That girl when he picked her out of the audience and told her her dog's name.</v>

843
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 15>That girl freaked out man.</v>

844
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 15>She was like ready to cry.</v>

845
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 15>She got emotional you could see her face.</v>

846
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.400
<v Speaker 15>Her jaw was and she wasn't a plant.</v>

847
00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.240
<v Speaker 15>No she wasn't.</v>

848
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.510
<v Speaker 14>You know what I didn't know though man when I was getting all shrill of IRA</v>

849
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:51.720
<v Speaker 14>being a plant as I didn't know that in the beginning it had people write</v>

850
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:54.040
<v Speaker 14>information down and put it into an envelope.</v>

851
00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 19>Yeah but she didn't write about her dog.</v>

852
00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.710
<v Speaker 19>Well I don't know that you know.</v>

853
00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.820
<v Speaker 19>We know that we read her information.</v>

854
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 19>She did write about her dog did read the information and the crew did.</v>

855
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.110
<v Speaker 11>We had we had her information read right.</v>

856
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:05.670
<v Speaker 11>Yes she didn't write a thing about her dog.</v>

857
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:06.563
<v Speaker 20>Well then</v>

858
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Speaker 20>see she wrote the dogs.</v>

859
00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.560
<v Speaker 21>Now women he got.</v>

860
00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 21>Did you read all that shit.</v>

861
00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:15.573
<v Speaker 20>Yes</v>

862
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.520
<v Speaker 20>she wrote it and put it in her purse.</v>

863
00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:22.820
<v Speaker 11>OK.</v>

864
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.570
<v Speaker 11>Do you know that there are pens and when you write things down these pens they</v>

865
00:45:26.571 --> 00:45:31.250
<v Speaker 11>create an exact replica of that in a computer program and they work wirelessly.</v>

866
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:33.200
<v Speaker 16>See I didn't know that bit of information.</v>

867
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:36.440
<v Speaker 16>So my mind was just trying to decode what he did because it would've been</v>

868
00:45:36.441 --> 00:45:36.980
<v Speaker 16>impossible.</v>

869
00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.090
<v Speaker 16>Then it's like oh well we don't know maybe she used her own pen which in case</v>

870
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:45.650
<v Speaker 16>Look man she said he named initials and you would get that from someone writing</v>

871
00:45:45.651 --> 00:45:47.000
<v Speaker 16>their name on a thing right.</v>

872
00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:50.240
<v Speaker 16>Maybe he had a camera that was watching all of them.</v>

873
00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:53.690
<v Speaker 18>Well I guess the point is like we're trying to figure out the specifics of what</v>

874
00:45:53.691 --> 00:45:57.740
<v Speaker 18>he did but it's no question that what he did was tragic and it was a trick</v>

875
00:45:57.741 --> 00:45:58.520
<v Speaker 18>because that's what he said.</v>

876
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.730
<v Speaker 12>He even had a camera behind me with a zoom lens and that's how he could read</v>

877
00:46:01.731 --> 00:46:01.970
<v Speaker 12>that.</v>

878
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.560
<v Speaker 12>That's also he could react on the audience.</v>

879
00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:04.550
<v Speaker 12>I mean who the hell knows.</v>

880
00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.240
<v Speaker 16>Yeah there's no way to how far in advance did he know where we were going.</v>

881
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.280
<v Speaker 21>How long in advance did he know.</v>

882
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:14.933
<v Speaker 21>No idea</v>

883
00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:17.613
<v Speaker 21>the location.</v>

884
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.450
<v Speaker 20>No idea how I got there.</v>

885
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.970
<v Speaker 11>Did he knew or know about it beforehand though before the call.</v>

886
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.823
<v Speaker 20>Possibly.</v>

887
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:30.970
<v Speaker 11>I don't think it's</v>

888
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:37.020
<v Speaker 11>we're we're we're trying to do here folks listening to this is trying to figure</v>

889
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:41.640
<v Speaker 11>out how the hell that guy did what he did what he did was masterful.</v>

890
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.050
<v Speaker 11>I mean everything about it even if it was tricks whatever it was it was amazing.</v>

891
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:51.530
<v Speaker 11>But having him say that it was tricks and it was so good it makes you really</v>

892
00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:56.160
<v Speaker 11>call into question all the other psychic ability that people claim.</v>

893
00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:01.110
<v Speaker 13>Well another thing that it does is it shines a light on how monstrous some</v>

894
00:47:01.111 --> 00:47:06.111
<v Speaker 13>people are because imagine being such a sociopath that you use tricks like that</v>

895
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:10.650
<v Speaker 13>to get around people to show them that you have powers and then you charge them</v>

896
00:47:10.651 --> 00:47:15.651
<v Speaker 13>money to let them communicate with their dead relatives your people who do that</v>

897
00:47:15.721 --> 00:47:16.554
<v Speaker 13>for a living.</v>

898
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.800
<v Speaker 13>They are the most vile monstrous people on earth because they seek out the most</v>

899
00:47:21.961 --> 00:47:26.250
<v Speaker 13>gullible humans who are desperate and morning and full of grief and guilt and</v>

900
00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:28.320
<v Speaker 13>then they do a couple banter check tricks.</v>

901
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:31.530
<v Speaker 13>They get them convinced that they are magical and then they're like Yeah for a</v>

902
00:47:31.531 --> 00:47:36.450
<v Speaker 13>thousand bucks or for a donation I'll let you say hello to your mom again.</v>

903
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:37.380
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

904
00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:41.940
<v Speaker 12>He was very adamant about his his hate for that.</v>

905
00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:46.410
<v Speaker 12>That type of price that minute bit of practice and what he does he calls himself</v>

906
00:47:46.411 --> 00:47:49.530
<v Speaker 12>a mentalist and he's an entertainer and he's also a debunker.</v>

907
00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:53.860
<v Speaker 12>He likes to debunk stuff you tell people that what he's doing is a trick.</v>

908
00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:54.360
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

909
00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.150
<v Speaker 12>Just so you know he's so good at it and he's telling you it's a trick.</v>

910
00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.780
<v Speaker 12>So be careful because other people were probably tricking you too but they're</v>

911
00:48:00.781 --> 00:48:02.970
<v Speaker 12>not going to be as ethical as he is.</v>

912
00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:03.230
<v Speaker 12>All right.</v>

913
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:04.220
<v Speaker 12>He's a really cool guy man.</v>

914
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 12>That was a real privilege it having him on the show.</v>

915
00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:12.290
<v Speaker 16>But it is fun to imagine that he's just an evil Talib he's just an awesome real</v>

916
00:48:12.361 --> 00:48:15.700
<v Speaker 16>psychic and that's how he makes a living by pretending he's not he's not.</v>

917
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.930
<v Speaker 16>He just goes there because he knows that if he tells people that being a</v>

918
00:48:18.931 --> 00:48:23.500
<v Speaker 16>telepath is possible then everyone will have telepathic abilities and he'll he</v>

919
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.990
<v Speaker 16>won't you won't be special anymore.</v>

920
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:29.850
<v Speaker 12>I wonder if he used his own pen if he made them write their stuff down with his</v>

921
00:48:29.851 --> 00:48:30.510
<v Speaker 12>pen.</v>

922
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:31.560
<v Speaker 12>That would explain a lot.</v>

923
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:32.370
<v Speaker 12>We don't.</v>

924
00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:34.100
<v Speaker 12>I do know that they can do that now.</v>

925
00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.770
<v Speaker 12>They have these special pens his computer pens and they dictate.</v>

926
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:39.390
<v Speaker 16>Well we don't know.</v>

927
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.740
<v Speaker 16>We got to get your pen back.</v>

928
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.560
<v Speaker 16>I mean I know you don't know you can do it wirelessly.</v>

929
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:48.390
<v Speaker 14>No but if you have like a I'm saying you want to get your magic wireless pen</v>

930
00:48:48.391 --> 00:48:48.720
<v Speaker 14>back.</v>

931
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.120
<v Speaker 14>You don't want it true sir but I.</v>

932
00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:53.220
<v Speaker 12>But I think that they gave their pen back anyway and people don't steal pens</v>

933
00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:56.280
<v Speaker 12>when you fill out a rhyme especially if you say can I have my pen back please.</v>

934
00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:59.670
<v Speaker 9>Like if the magic Pentagon to ask Can I have that blinking pen back that I gave</v>

935
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.180
<v Speaker 9>the lower the numbers says only megabytes are left.</v>

936
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:04.973
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

937
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:09.240
<v Speaker 9>I don't know what these tricks were but the important thing is that he says</v>

938
00:49:09.241 --> 00:49:10.010
<v Speaker 9>there were tricks.</v>

939
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.490
<v Speaker 14>Yes.</v>

940
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:11.323
<v Speaker 14>And they were amazing.</v>

941
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:15.360
<v Speaker 14>Yeah but just because someone can emulate something doesn't mean that it's not</v>

942
00:49:15.361 --> 00:49:15.990
<v Speaker 14>real.</v>

943
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:20.990
<v Speaker 12>But it made going to the Rhine Research Center feel so silly you know like me</v>

944
00:49:21.031 --> 00:49:23.670
<v Speaker 12>standing in front of these things trying to figure out which one's gonna go off</v>

945
00:49:23.671 --> 00:49:26.040
<v Speaker 12>next and totally getting nothing right.</v>

946
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.790
<v Speaker 12>Like thinking like maybe I've got this power.</v>

947
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:31.500
<v Speaker 12>And then this guy comes along that shows you like the craziest psychic shit</v>

948
00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:32.590
<v Speaker 12>you've ever seen in your life.</v>

949
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.710
<v Speaker 12>And then just goes oh by the way it's all lies.</v>

950
00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.650
<v Speaker 14>Yeah it's true man.</v>

951
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.780
<v Speaker 14>I mean there's a you can do a lot.</v>

952
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:44.490
<v Speaker 14>You could do a lot like think of Rasputin think of like grass butin this dirty</v>

953
00:49:44.491 --> 00:49:47.790
<v Speaker 14>filthy guy who just comes into Russia says that he's a.</v>

954
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.800
<v Speaker 14>Psychic or a mystic and the next thing you know he's basically running Russia by</v>

955
00:49:52.801 --> 00:49:56.790
<v Speaker 14>manipulating the leaders because he's convinced them that he has these powers.</v>

956
00:49:57.090 --> 00:50:01.080
<v Speaker 22>I mean you can go far if you can convince people even something out about</v>

957
00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:06.081
<v Speaker 22>Rasputin his giant cock his giant cock his cock that was so giant that cut it</v>

958
00:50:06.241 --> 00:50:07.380
<v Speaker 22>off and bottled it.</v>

959
00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:08.850
<v Speaker 22>They saved it forever.</v>

960
00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.740
<v Speaker 22>You know a jar of formaldehyde.</v>

961
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.170
<v Speaker 22>And people go to a museum in Russia and look at it.</v>

962
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.560
<v Speaker 22>Yeah.</v>

963
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.530
<v Speaker 22>That's a Vegas caucus.</v>

964
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:17.040
<v Speaker 22>I've seen that just like eleven inches flaccid.</v>

965
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:17.790
<v Speaker 22>Yeah.</v>

966
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:18.750
<v Speaker 22>It's a giant hog.</v>

967
00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.110
<v Speaker 22>It's a terrible thing to terrible evil looking dick.</v>

968
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.093
<v Speaker 22>Yeah it is.</v>

969
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.310
<v Speaker 22>Imagine going into a woman that you once loved just plunging into her.</v>

970
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.230
<v Speaker 14>I think that when the apocalypse happens it's going to wake up and break out of</v>

971
00:50:31.231 --> 00:50:32.064
<v Speaker 14>that jar.</v>

972
00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 12>It's going to come out.</v>

973
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.970
<v Speaker 12>Is he taking his digs into sprout legs in the middle of the night.</v>

974
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:36.460
<v Speaker 12>No.</v>

975
00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.700
<v Speaker 12>Remember that scene in aliens.</v>

976
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:39.660
<v Speaker 12>The second one.</v>

977
00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:40.733
<v Speaker 12>Where.</v>

978
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:41.820
<v Speaker 12>What's his face.</v>

979
00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.650
<v Speaker 12>Mad About You kept</v>

980
00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:48.780
<v Speaker 12>the chick in the in the lab tried to get her contaminated with one of those</v>

981
00:50:48.781 --> 00:50:49.614
<v Speaker 12>little face huggers.</v>

982
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.820
<v Speaker 12>It would be like it'd be like the face hugger.</v>

983
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:55.830
<v Speaker 12>It's going to grow some legs and Kravitz way around the laboratory till it</v>

984
00:50:55.831 --> 00:50:59.550
<v Speaker 12>shoves its giant pickled cock in your mouth.</v>

985
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:01.950
<v Speaker 16>Giant giant pickled wizard.</v>

986
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:07.240
<v Speaker 16>Hundreds of years of formaldehyde soaked in this terrible green pulsating zombie</v>

987
00:51:08.941 --> 00:51:13.290
<v Speaker 16>Dick with crab legs and antique jizz remnants pile and that's where it starts.</v>

988
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 12>They open up the vault to try to rescue and you know it's a fucking swarm like a</v>

989
00:51:19.021 --> 00:51:23.060
<v Speaker 12>beehive of bugs flying through the air that are all miniature little little</v>

990
00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:28.070
<v Speaker 12>giant flying crab cocks and they just it just spreads it spreads like like a</v>

991
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:30.480
<v Speaker 12>like a virus aerial.</v>

992
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.850
<v Speaker 23>That would be the funniest apocalypse.</v>

993
00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.330
<v Speaker 23>They're looking at it on a slide for the first time and it's a little tiny.</v>

994
00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:40.200
<v Speaker 23>Evil cocks flapping their wings like what the fuck are we looking at.</v>

995
00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:45.450
<v Speaker 23>They have to look at it like 100 x hundred times the size just to get it.</v>

996
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.820
<v Speaker 23>Or do we see two giant pickled cocks with wings next to my thigh.</v>

997
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:51.900
<v Speaker 23>Little tiny.</v>

998
00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:52.420
<v Speaker 23>Yeah that's right.</v>

999
00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:54.420
<v Speaker 14>The Sharknado man right.</v>

1000
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:55.010
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:55.420
<v Speaker 14>That's.</v>

1002
00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.610
<v Speaker 14>I think that it's a that's a terrifying aspect of Rasputin.</v>

1003
00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:02.770
<v Speaker 12>Also the fact that they shot him several times and they kept Yeah poisoned them</v>

1004
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.210
<v Speaker 12>they lost his voice and shot him.</v>

1005
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:09.360
<v Speaker 12>I think due to the Dick that big as a special man you probably have a lot of</v>

1006
00:52:09.361 --> 00:52:10.770
<v Speaker 12>special tolerances.</v>

1007
00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:13.440
<v Speaker 12>You know it's a rigid human being.</v>

1008
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:15.000
<v Speaker 12>If you got a big giant cock like that.</v>

1009
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:20.070
<v Speaker 12>It's like the universe is like trying really hard to get you to breed you know</v>

1010
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 12>like.</v>

1011
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:21.060
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>

1012
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:25.170
<v Speaker 12>We all know that like penis size no matter what anybody says it's means</v>

1013
00:52:25.171 --> 00:52:25.800
<v Speaker 12>something.</v>

1014
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.800
<v Speaker 12>If it didn't mean anything it wouldn't bother if you dig a little it means</v>

1015
00:52:28.801 --> 00:52:29.280
<v Speaker 12>something.</v>

1016
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.030
<v Speaker 12>OK.</v>

1017
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:32.620
<v Speaker 12>And you probably don't need a gigantic humongous one.</v>

1018
00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.950
<v Speaker 12>But if you have one you got that.</v>

1019
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:37.950
<v Speaker 12>That's that's a big thing with people.</v>

1020
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.030
<v Speaker 12>So when a guy like Rasputin comes along and he has a giant cock and he's</v>

1021
00:52:42.031 --> 00:52:44.040
<v Speaker 12>charismatic with a big giant cock.</v>

1022
00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:45.060
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:50.060
<v Speaker 14>It's it's a perfect storm of evil scary giant horse cock can communicate with</v>

1024
00:52:51.061 --> 00:52:51.894
<v Speaker 14>the dead.</v>

1025
00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:55.340
<v Speaker 14>That's all you need to take over Russia.</v>

1026
00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.890
<v Speaker 12>It is a real problem with people that were gullible.</v>

1027
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:03.630
<v Speaker 12>You know that we want a balloon boy silly things in over the course of this</v>

1028
00:53:03.631 --> 00:53:04.200
<v Speaker 12>show.</v>

1029
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.910
<v Speaker 12>One of the things that I've found is how many people get upset at you if you</v>

1030
00:53:08.911 --> 00:53:11.550
<v Speaker 12>don't believe the things that they believe.</v>

1031
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:13.530
<v Speaker 14>Yeah well you feel embarrassed.</v>

1032
00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.930
<v Speaker 14>I mean yeah part of it is you feel embarrassed.</v>

1033
00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:20.010
<v Speaker 14>You want to defend it because you can't you know that if you're experiencing</v>

1034
00:53:20.011 --> 00:53:24.180
<v Speaker 14>some strange thing that some part of you is going to be skeptical.</v>

1035
00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 14>And when you decide to believe in the strange thing then you become very</v>

1036
00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:28.320
<v Speaker 14>defensive.</v>

1037
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.410
<v Speaker 14>It's embarrassing.</v>

1038
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:33.420
<v Speaker 14>And that's that I think that's why sometimes you feel a little bit of sympathy</v>

1039
00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:37.410
<v Speaker 14>for some of these people but yes they've invested their lives into ideas that</v>

1040
00:53:37.411 --> 00:53:40.740
<v Speaker 14>they haven't fully investigated or explored in a real way.</v>

1041
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:41.490
<v Speaker 14>Right.</v>

1042
00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:46.490
<v Speaker 14>It's really sad when you know knocking the legs out from under the table upon</v>

1043
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:49.850
<v Speaker 14>which rests a person's entire paradigm.</v>

1044
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:54.390
<v Speaker 14>That's a sad thing to see happen you're watching someone fight against that with</v>

1045
00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 14>all their might.</v>

1046
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:56.520
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 12>And we're seeing that every week.</v>

1048
00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.410
<v Speaker 12>Yeah yeah.</v>

1049
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:04.110
<v Speaker 12>Every week we're seeing some some person who believes something.</v>

1050
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:08.490
<v Speaker 12>And I think somewhere along the line the show is becoming more about psychology</v>

1051
00:54:08.491 --> 00:54:10.350
<v Speaker 12>than it is even about these ideas.</v>

1052
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 13>Oh yeah man.</v>

1053
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:16.160
<v Speaker 13>And it's one thing it's taught me is is that we can't let people who believe in</v>

1054
00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:21.330
<v Speaker 13>invisible unprovable things have any kind of power.</v>

1055
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:22.660
<v Speaker 13>That's what it's showing me like.</v>

1056
00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.020
<v Speaker 13>Now a lot of these people you meet them there.</v>

1057
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.400
<v Speaker 13>They don't have a church a congregation.</v>

1058
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.680
<v Speaker 13>They haven't started a religion but you can see how someone like that if they</v>

1059
00:54:31.681 --> 00:54:35.670
<v Speaker 13>had power they would be incredibly dangerous if you're around somebody.</v>

1060
00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:36.400
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.530
<v Speaker 12>Well I think that people having power in that sense like the.</v>

1062
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:46.040
<v Speaker 12>Presidential power or king type power is probably going to be a thing of the</v>

1063
00:54:46.441 --> 00:54:47.340
<v Speaker 12>past one day.</v>

1064
00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:51.870
<v Speaker 12>I think ultimately we're gonna realize that anybody that gets to control people</v>

1065
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:53.370
<v Speaker 12>it's probably a bad idea.</v>

1066
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:57.480
<v Speaker 12>It should all be like some sort of a group minded thing because if it's not then</v>

1067
00:54:57.481 --> 00:55:01.410
<v Speaker 12>you get led into wars and you get led into crazy situations bank takeovers and</v>

1068
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:02.820
<v Speaker 12>bailouts and stuff.</v>

1069
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:07.710
<v Speaker 14>I just saw a video on a Christian show which is a speech of Ronald Reagan when</v>

1070
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:12.600
<v Speaker 14>he's president talking about how he believes that the end of the world is going</v>

1071
00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:16.290
<v Speaker 14>to happen in Israel based on biblical prophecy.</v>

1072
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:21.800
<v Speaker 14>This is a president who controls nuclear weapons and he's free freely saying</v>

1073
00:55:22.621 --> 00:55:27.621
<v Speaker 14>this is what I believe it's better prophesies done in the old testament.</v>

1074
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:33.230
<v Speaker 14>It's like no no your president you can't believe that you're not supposed to</v>

1075
00:55:33.991 --> 00:55:38.250
<v Speaker 14>believe that yes it's too weak an idea it's too weak an idea too.</v>

1076
00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:42.750
<v Speaker 12>And if you exhibit this week idea it should disqualify you from controlling</v>

1077
00:55:42.751 --> 00:55:45.720
<v Speaker 12>anything because it says it's a crazy persons thought.</v>

1078
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:46.890
<v Speaker 12>So we have to re-evaluate.</v>

1079
00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:50.280
<v Speaker 12>Oh did we just let a charismatic crazy person run things.</v>

1080
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:55.200
<v Speaker 12>Or did we really pick a wise leader right to the point when the point is a</v>

1081
00:55:55.201 --> 00:55:56.620
<v Speaker 12>leader can't really be a leader.</v>

1082
00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.760
<v Speaker 12>You need a bunch of people working with you need a hole and everyone says that.</v>

1083
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:00.840
<v Speaker 12>But there's still a president.</v>

1084
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.400
<v Speaker 12>It should there shouldn't be one.</v>

1085
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:03.420
<v Speaker 12>There shouldn't be.</v>

1086
00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.570
<v Speaker 12>There's no fucking way one person should be running anything.</v>

1087
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:07.170
<v Speaker 12>So yeah.</v>

1088
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:11.100
<v Speaker 12>One person who believes crazy shit shouldn't be running anything you know well</v>

1089
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:12.750
<v Speaker 12>shouldn't be running anything anybody.</v>

1090
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:15.320
<v Speaker 12>No one should be running a goddamn country right.</v>

1091
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.270
<v Speaker 12>No one it should be the entire country gets to vote on shit.</v>

1092
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:18.780
<v Speaker 12>Yes.</v>

1093
00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:23.340
<v Speaker 12>You know what I think you can go a totally different sense of who people are</v>

1094
00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:24.330
<v Speaker 12>based on that.</v>

1095
00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:25.163
<v Speaker 16>Like read it.</v>

1096
00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:26.313
<v Speaker 16>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:27.960
<v Speaker 16>Run the country with a rabbit.</v>

1098
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.600
<v Speaker 16>Or Yeah I've be true to my or Twitter.</v>

1099
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:32.340
<v Speaker 16>Imagine if you could vote on Twitter.</v>

1100
00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:33.420
<v Speaker 16>Yeah I would be amazed.</v>

1101
00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:34.470
<v Speaker 16>It would be incredible.</v>

1102
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.440
<v Speaker 16>It would be amazing but also probably pretty easy to hack.</v>

1103
00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:40.250
<v Speaker 16>Maybe but why can we do our banking online then.</v>

1104
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:42.083
<v Speaker 23>Right.</v>

1105
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.133
<v Speaker 23>Good point.</v>

1106
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.840
<v Speaker 12>You tell me you trust it with money you don't trust it with votes.</v>

1107
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:46.770
<v Speaker 12>That's ridiculous.</v>

1108
00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.720
<v Speaker 12>Right sounds like you want to manipulate votes.</v>

1109
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.620
<v Speaker 12>They can do it.</v>

1110
00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:52.470
<v Speaker 12>They can do pretty much everything online with banking and you're dealing with</v>

1111
00:56:52.471 --> 00:56:56.940
<v Speaker 12>millions and billions of dollars every day going back and forth including the</v>

1112
00:56:56.941 --> 00:56:57.640
<v Speaker 12>stock market.</v>

1113
00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.480
<v Speaker 15>Yeah so you're fine with all that but we can't vote.</v>

1114
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:02.160
<v Speaker 16>Voting is too complicated.</v>

1115
00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:03.390
<v Speaker 16>That's the.</v>

1116
00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:05.040
<v Speaker 16>One man one vote.</v>

1117
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:06.500
<v Speaker 16>What are you trying to say.</v>

1118
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:10.070
<v Speaker 16>The whole system would have a bunch of hackers getting control.</v>

1119
00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:12.990
<v Speaker 16>You want a bunch of guys with Guy Fawkes masks.</v>

1120
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:15.130
<v Speaker 16>One in this fucking country right.</v>

1121
00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:17.940
<v Speaker 16>They can't give it back to the people and they know that's what that would be.</v>

1122
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:18.870
<v Speaker 16>They do it.</v>

1123
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.710
<v Speaker 12>They can't do it.</v>

1124
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:20.490
<v Speaker 12>You can never do it.</v>

1125
00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:20.930
<v Speaker 12>It'll never.</v>

1126
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:21.760
<v Speaker 12>You'll never be able to vote.</v>

1127
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.620
<v Speaker 12>Well I think you eventually will because I think the people that are in the</v>

1128
00:57:25.621 --> 00:57:29.520
<v Speaker 12>position to control things will eventually get phased out let new people come</v>

1129
00:57:29.521 --> 00:57:29.640
<v Speaker 12>in.</v>

1130
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.990
<v Speaker 12>I just think it's inevitable because the generations that are coming up it's</v>

1131
00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:36.390
<v Speaker 12>going to be way harder to be as corrupt as the generations that are in power</v>

1132
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:39.720
<v Speaker 12>that are just used to abusing it and having that kind of control.</v>

1133
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:41.160
<v Speaker 18>You wouldn't want that.</v>

1134
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:46.190
<v Speaker 18>Like if you could have the level of control of like a Julius Caesar I think it's</v>

1135
00:57:46.501 --> 00:57:47.334
<v Speaker 18>dangerous.</v>

1136
00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:48.360
<v Speaker 15>Things change.</v>

1137
00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.193
<v Speaker 15>Fuck no.</v>

1138
00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:51.300
<v Speaker 15>I would if it was like me or Hitler.</v>

1139
00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:51.930
<v Speaker 15>I'd say yeah.</v>

1140
00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:52.763
<v Speaker 15>You know I'm saying.</v>

1141
00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:58.010
<v Speaker 15>But it's never that and I think it's really what it should be is we should all</v>

1142
00:58:00.301 --> 00:58:05.301
<v Speaker 15>have ideas that we share and we should all have maybe things that we agree on or</v>

1143
00:58:06.961 --> 00:58:09.990
<v Speaker 15>disagree on or things that we can debate public discourse.</v>

1144
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.910
<v Speaker 12>But ultimately it should be a vote should be 300 million people X amount of them</v>

1145
00:58:14.911 --> 00:58:18.640
<v Speaker 12>are over 18 whatever the age do we decide is it really should be probably 21.</v>

1146
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:19.110
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

1147
00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:21.660
<v Speaker 12>And then from there on they get to make the choice.</v>

1148
00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:26.730
<v Speaker 14>Yeah but what if what if for example this voting happens in a country where</v>

1149
00:58:26.881 --> 00:58:31.881
<v Speaker 14>people believe in like Sharia law and believe that women should be covered in</v>

1150
00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:37.890
<v Speaker 14>burqas and that you know sort of that you cut off someone's hand who steals.</v>

1151
00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:38.993
<v Speaker 24>What if there's</v>

1152
00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:42.000
<v Speaker 24>red or white with a machine.</v>

1153
00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:43.163
<v Speaker 21>Really.</v>

1154
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.980
<v Speaker 21>Would they convict her of Oh my God.</v>

1155
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.000
<v Speaker 21>That's scary.</v>

1156
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:50.083
<v Speaker 24>Right.</v>

1157
00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:51.353
<v Speaker 24>Read her mind.</v>

1158
00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.560
<v Speaker 24>It was admissible admissible in court that she actually had prior knowledge of</v>

1159
00:58:55.561 --> 00:58:56.190
<v Speaker 24>this crime.</v>

1160
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:59.590
<v Speaker 21>That's incredible experience and knowledge.</v>

1161
00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:01.050
<v Speaker 21>That's incredible.</v>

1162
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:05.790
<v Speaker 12>Not admissible not admissible in the U.S. Court while tell the story if people</v>

1163
00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:09.490
<v Speaker 12>listen to this I didn't hear what they just said is that there.</v>

1164
00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:13.480
<v Speaker 12>There is a woman in India that was convicted with this machine called an F M r.</v>

1165
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.860
<v Speaker 12>I.</v>

1166
00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:14.700
<v Speaker 21>What does it stand for.</v>

1167
00:59:16.530 --> 00:59:21.530
<v Speaker 12>Functional MRI Magnetic Resonance imagery is what MRI stands for and that she</v>

1168
00:59:22.141 --> 00:59:27.141
<v Speaker 12>was convicted for murder because they knew that she had some sort of a memory of</v>

1169
00:59:28.891 --> 00:59:32.130
<v Speaker 12>the crime and they were able to read her mind find that wow.</v>

1170
00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:34.200
<v Speaker 12>Holy shit that's incredible.</v>

1171
00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:35.123
<v Speaker 12>That's cool.</v>

1172
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:40.190
<v Speaker 15>I think that eventually we're going to have a hard drive on our brain and I</v>

1173
00:59:40.801 --> 00:59:45.801
<v Speaker 15>think we're gonna be able to record life in a way that looks exactly as if</v>

1174
00:59:46.711 --> 00:59:47.544
<v Speaker 15>you're live in it.</v>

1175
00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:50.700
<v Speaker 15>And I think you'll be able to watch it and experience it.</v>

1176
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:52.530
<v Speaker 15>I think first of all probably visual.</v>

1177
00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:55.650
<v Speaker 15>But then as people the technology gets better and better and people get more</v>

1178
00:59:55.651 --> 00:59:56.460
<v Speaker 15>advanced.</v>

1179
00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.770
<v Speaker 15>We'll figure out a way to experience everything too.</v>

1180
00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.390
<v Speaker 15>Would be like black and white TV.</v>

1181
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.870
<v Speaker 15>They started out it was just a black and white television right.</v>

1182
01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 15>Then also there was color HD stereo stereo sound worth those winds whistling</v>

1183
01:00:10.591 --> 01:00:12.630
<v Speaker 15>behind human TV today are incredible.</v>

1184
01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.720
<v Speaker 15>Yeah but they start out as big stupid wooden box with this dumb little tube in</v>

1185
01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:19.950
<v Speaker 15>the middle of it that look like shit.</v>

1186
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:21.530
<v Speaker 15>It was rounded like a fishbowl.</v>

1187
01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.680
<v Speaker 15>I think that first they're gonna start out with video.</v>

1188
01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:28.920
<v Speaker 15>It's gonna be you in the video and have some sort of an audio and you got to be</v>

1189
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:29.790
<v Speaker 15>a play it back.</v>

1190
01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:30.653
<v Speaker 15>Google Glass.</v>

1191
01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:34.380
<v Speaker 15>Something along those lines but it'll be all the time and you'll be able to</v>

1192
01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:35.100
<v Speaker 15>access it.</v>

1193
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:39.210
<v Speaker 15>You'll have a giant like 18 trillion terabyte hard drive in your head.</v>

1194
01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.610
<v Speaker 15>Yeah and you'll be able to access your entire life.</v>

1195
01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.640
<v Speaker 15>So we're gonna have to people are going to be able to read your minds by just</v>

1196
01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.773
<v Speaker 15>taking it out.</v>

1197
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.390
<v Speaker 15>Yeah and like we'll see what Duncan was doing up beaten off the tranny porn.</v>

1198
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.690
<v Speaker 15>Where are you.</v>

1199
01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:54.770
<v Speaker 15>Duncan yelling ball gags and tranny porn.</v>

1200
01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:57.170
<v Speaker 15>Sure they'll be able to find out what you saw.</v>

1201
01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:57.800
<v Speaker 15>No way.</v>

1202
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.480
<v Speaker 15>There was nothing wrong with that man.</v>

1203
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.780
<v Speaker 15>And the more we realize the quicker we realize there's nothing wrong with that</v>

1204
01:01:02.781 --> 01:01:05.530
<v Speaker 15>the happier Robbie but the.</v>

1205
01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:06.490
<v Speaker 15>The.</v>

1206
01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 15>The point is that they're going to be it was gonna be a moot point.</v>

1207
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:11.090
<v Speaker 15>I think everyone's going to be psychic.</v>

1208
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.530
<v Speaker 14>Yes exactly.</v>

1209
01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:17.060
<v Speaker 12>I mean yeah for sure people if you look at how we already are psychic and not</v>

1210
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:21.140
<v Speaker 12>connected to our heads yet more certainly way more psychic today than people</v>

1211
01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:24.440
<v Speaker 12>were that were living in like you know 15 20.</v>

1212
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:24.920
<v Speaker 12>Yes.</v>

1213
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 12>You know what we can do now is call it what it call what you will.</v>

1214
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:33.470
<v Speaker 12>The connection is always on and it's much more powerful and we can do things</v>

1215
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.860
<v Speaker 12>incredible like talk to people that are on the other side of the world in real</v>

1216
01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:37.670
<v Speaker 12>time.</v>

1217
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:38.430
<v Speaker 14>I mean what is it.</v>

1218
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:43.430
<v Speaker 14>I am pregnant misquoted but didn't Asimov say technology that is an</v>

1219
01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:47.060
<v Speaker 14>and a technology.</v>

1220
01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:50.090
<v Speaker 14>I'm going to butcher this quote but it's nothing like a technology an advanced</v>

1221
01:01:50.091 --> 01:01:53.480
<v Speaker 14>enough technology would be indistinguishable from magic.</v>

1222
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:54.990
<v Speaker 14>Yes that's exactly the quote.</v>

1223
01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.850
<v Speaker 14>So that's so that's the idea which is that if you were to go back and tell</v>

1224
01:01:58.851 --> 01:02:02.600
<v Speaker 14>people yes we use wireless signals to show us where we're going.</v>

1225
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 14>We use wireless signals to communicate with people on the other side of the</v>

1226
01:02:05.661 --> 01:02:06.410
<v Speaker 14>planet.</v>

1227
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:09.320
<v Speaker 14>We use wireless signals to control cars.</v>

1228
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.930
<v Speaker 14>We use wireless signals to do everything.</v>

1229
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.720
<v Speaker 14>People be like What are you talking about how is that even possible.</v>

1230
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:16.130
<v Speaker 14>But now it's real.</v>

1231
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:21.150
<v Speaker 14>And so I'm sure that in the future once technology becomes more part of us than</v>

1232
01:02:21.741 --> 01:02:26.741
<v Speaker 14>we all become cyborgs then in that way the notion of being able to mentally</v>

1233
01:02:26.961 --> 01:02:29.960
<v Speaker 14>merge with a person won't seem insane at all.</v>

1234
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:33.650
<v Speaker 14>In fact you will be able to merge with the consciousness of the planet.</v>

1235
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:37.370
<v Speaker 14>There'll be some kind of emotional Internet where you can empathic we</v>

1236
01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:42.610
<v Speaker 14>technologically merge with all human beings and experience the way the entire</v>

1237
01:02:43.131 --> 01:02:44.060
<v Speaker 14>planet feels.</v>

1238
01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:45.360
<v Speaker 12>I think you're absolutely right.</v>

1239
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:48.590
<v Speaker 12>I think that we're starting to feel the beginnings of this with the Internet</v>

1240
01:02:48.591 --> 01:02:49.670
<v Speaker 12>that we're experiencing today.</v>

1241
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:53.870
<v Speaker 12>I think the Internet is joining people today in a way that we've never</v>

1242
01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:54.800
<v Speaker 12>experienced before.</v>

1243
01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.570
<v Speaker 12>And it's just begun.</v>

1244
01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:00.590
<v Speaker 12>And I think the next step is probably going to be lot more immersive.</v>

1245
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:01.070
<v Speaker 12>Yes.</v>

1246
01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:06.070
<v Speaker 12>And that next step might deal with real time video and audio from person to</v>

1247
01:03:06.351 --> 01:03:10.130
<v Speaker 12>person you might be able to access people's actual experiences as they're taking</v>

1248
01:03:10.131 --> 01:03:10.790
<v Speaker 12>place.</v>

1249
01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:14.780
<v Speaker 14>Sure and then there's going to be designer augmented realities where you can</v>

1250
01:03:14.781 --> 01:03:19.700
<v Speaker 14>have you can download upgrades just a normal reality like make your reds redder</v>

1251
01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:24.780
<v Speaker 14>yeah make the colors deeper let's turn it turn let's let's enhance smells and</v>

1252
01:03:25.311 --> 01:03:28.630
<v Speaker 14>they'll be like well let's change smells all together this turns the smell of</v>

1253
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.990
<v Speaker 14>far into roses.</v>

1254
01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.570
<v Speaker 14>So from now on you're not going to smell any bad things.</v>

1255
01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.840
<v Speaker 14>And that's going to be what starts happening as we begin to enhance our reality</v>

1256
01:03:38.451 --> 01:03:40.670
<v Speaker 14>technologically which I've heard in Google Glass.</v>

1257
01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:44.120
<v Speaker 14>It's already happening like the one thing that they're desperately trying to</v>

1258
01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:46.640
<v Speaker 14>keep out of Google Glass is facial recognition.</v>

1259
01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.380
<v Speaker 14>But someone's already hacked it.</v>

1260
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:51.830
<v Speaker 14>So it does that because the last thing you want is for a stranger to be able to</v>

1261
01:03:51.831 --> 01:03:56.831
<v Speaker 14>walk up to you with Google Glass scan your face go do a google image search and</v>

1262
01:03:57.561 --> 01:04:00.800
<v Speaker 14>come up with like Oh hey Ted do you remember me.</v>

1263
01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:01.953
<v Speaker 14>Really.</v>

1264
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.200
<v Speaker 14>That's a problem as you like wait do I really know you or are you just using the</v>

1265
01:04:06.201 --> 01:04:06.940
<v Speaker 14>Internet.</v>

1266
01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:08.120
<v Speaker 14>So they don't want that to happen.</v>

1267
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:11.000
<v Speaker 14>But the thing about it is they're already going to hack it.</v>

1268
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:14.750
<v Speaker 14>That happens and then you can have like a yelp for people.</v>

1269
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:18.470
<v Speaker 14>You know what I mean so that when you're doing facial scans for people you could</v>

1270
01:04:18.471 --> 01:04:23.210
<v Speaker 14>see hanging above them douchebag rapist or pedophile or whatever.</v>

1271
01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:28.240
<v Speaker 14>So people are going to be cursed with this cloud that whatever is about them in</v>

1272
01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:33.310
<v Speaker 14>the cloud will be around them and you can you could change that you can upgrade</v>

1273
01:04:33.311 --> 01:04:34.350
<v Speaker 14>it if you want.</v>

1274
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:39.370
<v Speaker 16>You can make it so that assholes always have flies swarming around them you know</v>

1275
01:04:40.401 --> 01:04:41.270
<v Speaker 16>to avoid them.</v>

1276
01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.920
<v Speaker 16>That's a great idea.</v>

1277
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.550
<v Speaker 16>Yeah.</v>

1278
01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:47.030
<v Speaker 19>If technology really can do that and we start judging each other based on our</v>

1279
01:04:47.031 --> 01:04:47.864
<v Speaker 19>experiences.</v>

1280
01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.800
<v Speaker 19>But you're gonna have like you're gonna have to look at a guy's record to like.</v>

1281
01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:51.290
<v Speaker 19>OK.</v>

1282
01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:52.910
<v Speaker 19>Who gave you one star.</v>

1283
01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.550
<v Speaker 16>Oh look at this guy he's an asshole.</v>

1284
01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.413
<v Speaker 16>Sure.</v>

1285
01:04:56.830 --> 01:04:57.380
<v Speaker 16>You could tell.</v>

1286
01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.140
<v Speaker 14>You know we already can't do that like you just takes a second.</v>

1287
01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.280
<v Speaker 14>Yeah I can already get your name and go on your Facebook account and within 10</v>

1288
01:05:05.331 --> 01:05:07.630
<v Speaker 14>seconds figure out if you're a douchebag.</v>

1289
01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.120
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

1290
01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.750
<v Speaker 19>I mean how many times you gonna to someone's Twitter and you go Oh I know what's</v>

1291
01:05:11.751 --> 01:05:12.730
<v Speaker 19>going on in your head.</v>

1292
01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:13.460
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

1293
01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:14.690
<v Speaker 19>Quick right away.</v>

1294
01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.150
<v Speaker 19>That's sort of psycho in a way.</v>

1295
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.670
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

1296
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:21.670
<v Speaker 19>I mean it's communicative and essentially the idea of psychic is it cuts out all</v>

1297
01:05:22.671 --> 01:05:24.860
<v Speaker 19>the middlemen and you get right to the information.</v>

1298
01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.880
<v Speaker 14>Yeah yeah yeah.</v>

1299
01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:30.940
<v Speaker 14>It's a it's a form of technologically enhanced connectivity that's never existed</v>

1300
01:05:31.551 --> 01:05:36.530
<v Speaker 14>as far as we know on this planet until today and it's only going to get more and</v>

1301
01:05:36.531 --> 01:05:39.380
<v Speaker 14>more intense and everyone's you know this is part of the thing where ever it's</v>

1302
01:05:39.381 --> 01:05:43.060
<v Speaker 14>like oh god the NSA they're watching everything I do there's no more privacy</v>

1303
01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:45.080
<v Speaker 14>it's like oh you have no idea.</v>

1304
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:50.390
<v Speaker 14>You're so lucky right now if you exist right now this is the last era of</v>

1305
01:05:50.391 --> 01:05:51.224
<v Speaker 14>privacy.</v>

1306
01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:54.320
<v Speaker 14>It's already there's hardly any privacy if you do something dumb enough on a</v>

1307
01:05:54.321 --> 01:05:59.321
<v Speaker 14>city bus the entire planet will see if you if you murder someone.</v>

1308
01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.830
<v Speaker 2>It's so much more difficult to get away with it today than it's ever been</v>

1309
01:06:03.831 --> 01:06:04.250
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1310
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:07.790
<v Speaker 13>Yeah but you can't commit a crime you commit a crime if you just do something</v>

1311
01:06:07.791 --> 01:06:12.320
<v Speaker 13>embarrassing if you like if you try to take a burning tequila shot and set your</v>

1312
01:06:12.321 --> 01:06:16.910
<v Speaker 13>face on fire within 30 minutes the entire planet might be looking at that event.</v>

1313
01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:20.900
<v Speaker 13>So privacy is already going the way of the dinosaur.</v>

1314
01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:24.440
<v Speaker 13>But in 15 years you will not be able to go outside.</v>

1315
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:25.880
<v Speaker 13>Do you think to be out for it.</v>

1316
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.480
<v Speaker 12>Do you think that's going to cause a convergence though a real convergence where</v>

1317
01:06:29.481 --> 01:06:33.710
<v Speaker 12>people have real empathy for other people because they're experiencing they're</v>

1318
01:06:33.711 --> 01:06:35.570
<v Speaker 12>paying their feelings all the time.</v>

1319
01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:40.880
<v Speaker 12>I think that if anything positive can come out of this connection that human</v>

1320
01:06:40.881 --> 01:06:45.881
<v Speaker 12>beings are experiencing it's going to be that are going to realize somewhere</v>

1321
01:06:46.991 --> 01:06:51.070
<v Speaker 12>along the line that we're going to all be a lot better off if everybody's happy</v>

1322
01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:55.930
<v Speaker 12>and there must be a way if you can get two people to be happy or for people to</v>

1323
01:06:55.931 --> 01:06:56.590
<v Speaker 12>be happy.</v>

1324
01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:57.670
<v Speaker 12>Why can't you get four million.</v>

1325
01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.660
<v Speaker 12>What is missing.</v>

1326
01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:00.760
<v Speaker 12>Well at what point in time does it become.</v>

1327
01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.320
<v Speaker 12>Does everybody lose value.</v>

1328
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:05.260
<v Speaker 12>Is it 4000 is it forty thousand four hundred thousand.</v>

1329
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:09.310
<v Speaker 12>There's a number where people stop giving a shit about certain people they read</v>

1330
01:07:09.311 --> 01:07:10.160
<v Speaker 12>about the newspaper.</v>

1331
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:12.770
<v Speaker 12>If there's only four of you one of you dies everybody gets sad.</v>

1332
01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:16.420
<v Speaker 12>Yeah but if this four million of you like we lost another one today hey this</v>

1333
01:07:16.421 --> 01:07:18.060
<v Speaker 12>fucking four million people don't worry about it.</v>

1334
01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:19.420
<v Speaker 14>Yeah right.</v>

1335
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:21.710
<v Speaker 14>Man Well I think that's one part of it.</v>

1336
01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:25.030
<v Speaker 14>I think the other part of it is there's going to just be people even more</v>

1337
01:07:25.031 --> 01:07:29.260
<v Speaker 14>addicted and negativity and like the NAB think so yeah I think the Nancy Grace</v>

1338
01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 14>show is gonna be really hard to watch because you'll be able to emotionally tune</v>

1339
01:07:33.791 --> 01:07:36.040
<v Speaker 14>into it and guarantee Nancy Grace if you like.</v>

1340
01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.640
<v Speaker 14>Here's the way it feels to be an eight year old getting strangled to death.</v>

1341
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:43.030
<v Speaker 14>People want to experience those dark things too.</v>

1342
01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:48.080
<v Speaker 14>But I think ultimately it's the ultimate device of peace because when let's say</v>

1343
01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:53.131
<v Speaker 14>the president of Iran sits down with the president of Israel and they</v>

1344
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:59.520
<v Speaker 14>telepathically merge minds so that one can experience the totality of the other</v>

1345
01:08:00.341 --> 01:08:05.341
<v Speaker 14>person's life and what they whatever their religion is and whatever their ideas</v>

1346
01:08:07.241 --> 01:08:12.241
<v Speaker 14>are if those things merge thinking like oh shit we're exactly the same.</v>

1347
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.230
<v Speaker 14>We really are the same.</v>

1348
01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.580
<v Speaker 14>That's that's the problem.</v>

1349
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:19.630
<v Speaker 12>Yeah yeah the problem is if you live their life you would have a very similar</v>

1350
01:08:19.631 --> 01:08:23.260
<v Speaker 12>way of looking at the world as they do and they lived yours they would probably</v>

1351
01:08:23.261 --> 01:08:27.820
<v Speaker 12>have all your experiences all your hopes and dreams and loves and conquests and</v>

1352
01:08:27.821 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 12>failures all that shit together makes you.</v>

1353
01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.930
<v Speaker 12>And unless someone is you.</v>

1354
01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.600
<v Speaker 12>It's hard it's hard for them to understand you.</v>

1355
01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:37.600
<v Speaker 12>But when we all can see each other it's gonna get real weird.</v>

1356
01:08:37.690 --> 01:08:41.890
<v Speaker 14>Man it's hard for you to understand you much less somebody else but you still</v>

1357
01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:44.740
<v Speaker 14>you know where else it's going to ruin it's going to ruin the meat industry</v>

1358
01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:49.480
<v Speaker 14>because the first thing PETA is gonna do is slap one of these brainwave devices</v>

1359
01:08:49.481 --> 01:08:51.160
<v Speaker 14>on a cow that's about to get slaughtered.</v>

1360
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:54.970
<v Speaker 14>Send that up on the Internet be like Go ahead eat a cheeseburger.</v>

1361
01:08:55.180 --> 01:09:00.180
<v Speaker 14>But first experienced this insane terror that that meat felt right before it got</v>

1362
01:09:01.361 --> 01:09:02.170
<v Speaker 14>murder.</v>

1363
01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:04.270
<v Speaker 12>I think you're right it's going to be a weird world.</v>

1364
01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.300
<v Speaker 12>I think there's gonna be a lot of weird things we're gonna be able to experience</v>

1365
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:10.870
<v Speaker 12>a lot of weird ways and we're gonna be able to be in touch with each other.</v>

1366
01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:15.220
<v Speaker 14>And also getting hacked our minds are gonna be able to get hacked and that's</v>

1367
01:09:15.221 --> 01:09:18.760
<v Speaker 14>another scary thing in the way that sometimes you wake up and someone will be</v>

1368
01:09:18.761 --> 01:09:22.630
<v Speaker 14>and you'll have like six emails from your friends being like hey asshole you got</v>

1369
01:09:22.631 --> 01:09:23.440
<v Speaker 14>fished.</v>

1370
01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.730
<v Speaker 14>I don't want to buy a purse.</v>

1371
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:27.670
<v Speaker 14>Please stop trying to sell me purses in the same way.</v>

1372
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:32.410
<v Speaker 14>You might wake up in like your brain has been hacked and implanted all over your</v>

1373
01:09:32.411 --> 01:09:37.050
<v Speaker 14>brain as the desire to go eat a cheeseburger to like go on a certain website.</v>

1374
01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:38.740
<v Speaker 14>That's another scary thing.</v>

1375
01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:40.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1376
01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.440

1377
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:44.390
<v Speaker 24>Yeah.</v>

1378
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:46.000
<v Speaker 24>We just have a few little bits to hear.</v>

1379
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:50.620
<v Speaker 24>What do you have to greatest you haven't been the right.</v>

1380
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:52.813
<v Speaker 24>Right.</v>

1381
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:56.030
<v Speaker 24>But I said it earlier I talked about the run as to</v>

1382
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.560
<v Speaker 24>what you mean what you said is great.</v>

1383
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.880
<v Speaker 24>Kind of do it as if you haven't been there yet.</v>

1384
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.713
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

1385
01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.200
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

1386
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.860
<v Speaker 12>So I'm headed to this place called the Rhine Research Center and it's the gold</v>

1387
01:10:09.861 --> 01:10:13.310
<v Speaker 12>standard for the scientific study of the paranormal.</v>

1388
01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:17.480
<v Speaker 12>Yeah I've heard of them they make the cards they've been studying the paranormal</v>

1389
01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:19.100
<v Speaker 12>since the 1930s.</v>

1390
01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:22.640
<v Speaker 12>So I'm going to go there and see what they can show me.</v>

1391
01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.610
<v Speaker 12>What kind of scientific proof they could demonstrate that apparently they can</v>

1392
01:10:25.611 --> 01:10:29.500
<v Speaker 12>show you all the different ways that they can measure psychic ability and we're</v>

1393
01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:30.680
<v Speaker 12>gonna we're gonna try a few out.</v>

1394
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:34.040
<v Speaker 14>Yeah man they're the ones who invented those psychic cards at those squiggly</v>

1395
01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:35.550
<v Speaker 14>lines in the square in the circle.</v>

1396
01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.070
<v Speaker 14>They're the ones that came up with that test.</v>

1397
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.113
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

1398
01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.060
<v Speaker 12>Well apparently they say some people have innate abilities.</v>

1399
01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:41.983
<v Speaker 12>Some people don't.</v>

1400
01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:45.830
<v Speaker 12>Some people you can you can sort of cultivate their their abilities.</v>

1401
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:46.723
<v Speaker 12>Some people can't.</v>

1402
01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:47.600
<v Speaker 12>Sure I believe it.</v>

1403

1432
01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.920
<v Speaker 16>Borders is on blurring show why hoarders.</v>

1433
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:14.630
<v Speaker 24>You say hoarders I think hoarders isn't hoarders on the arts and entertainment.</v>

1434
01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:17.660
<v Speaker 23>There is on arts and entertainment.</v>

1435
01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:18.330
<v Speaker 23>Right.</v>

1436
01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:20.030
<v Speaker 23>Because I'm an art or an entertainment both.</v>

1437
01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:26.330
<v Speaker 23>So you know I don't know man.</v>

1438
01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:26.780
<v Speaker 11>I don't.</v>

1439
01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.040
<v Speaker 11>I don't know about this.</v>

1440
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:33.310
<v Speaker 11>This psychic ability thing I think we have to wrap it up now but my my take on</v>

1441
01:12:33.621 --> 01:12:38.360
<v Speaker 11>it is I did not feel like in doing the show that it disproved anything to me.</v>

1442
01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:42.080
<v Speaker 11>It did prove to me that there's guys like Bana check who are absolutely</v>

1443
01:12:42.081 --> 01:12:44.240
<v Speaker 11>masterful at doing what he did.</v>

1444
01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.650
<v Speaker 11>However he did it.</v>

1445
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:48.170
<v Speaker 11>He claims that it's a trick and he's not psychic.</v>

1446
01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.250
<v Speaker 11>I believe him.</v>

1447
01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.440
<v Speaker 11>What he did was amazing though.</v>

1448
01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:55.310
<v Speaker 11>So I learned that there's people like that.</v>

1449
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:58.380
<v Speaker 11>I was really blown away by his abilities but I didn't.</v>

1450
01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.930
<v Speaker 11>It didn't take away from me the possibility that a guy like Ed dames can remote</v>

1451
01:13:02.931 --> 01:13:05.270
<v Speaker 11>view or their guy like Paul Smith can remove you.</v>

1452
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:06.410
<v Speaker 11>I couldn't do it.</v>

1453
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.440
<v Speaker 11>I didn't see evidence of it but there's enough there for me enough anecdotal</v>

1454
01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:18.320
<v Speaker 11>evidence enough stories of these guys seeing things that turned out to be real</v>

1455
01:13:18.321 --> 01:13:22.760
<v Speaker 11>that I would be foolish if I dismissed it without actually learning how to do</v>

1456
01:13:22.761 --> 01:13:22.970
<v Speaker 11>it.</v>

1457
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:25.430
<v Speaker 11>And that was one of the important things so I'm going to leave it at that.</v>

1458
01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:30.670
<v Speaker 11>I don't know whether or not psychic energy is real but I am incredibly impressed</v>

1459
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:32.323
<v Speaker 11>impressed.</v>

1460
01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.020
<v Speaker 11>Say again I don't know if psychic energy is real or psychic abilities real but</v>

1461
01:13:36.021 --> 01:13:41.021
<v Speaker 11>I'm incredibly impressed at Banamex ability to fake it and it deems descriptions</v>

1462
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.940
<v Speaker 11>of how it works.</v>

1463
01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:45.290
<v Speaker 11>So that's where I'll leave it.</v>

1464
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.980
<v Speaker 11>Cool.</v>

1465
01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:47.030
<v Speaker 11>I'm in the middle on it.</v>

1466
01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.080
<v Speaker 11>I'm all over the place.</v>

1467
01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.490
<v Speaker 13>I know people out there try to develop their abilities.</v>

1468
01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:51.553
<v Speaker 12>I should too.</v>

1469
01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.290
<v Speaker 12>You know I don't know what's wrong with me why I don't want to like sit down or</v>

1470
01:13:54.291 --> 01:13:55.100
<v Speaker 12>read a book on it.</v>

1471
01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:58.040
<v Speaker 12>I really need to figure out what's what's wrong with me that I don't want to</v>

1472
01:13:58.041 --> 01:13:58.700
<v Speaker 12>give it a chance.</v>

1473
01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.080
<v Speaker 14>God when I was a kid I used to read those books all the time.</v>

1474
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.943
<v Speaker 14>Did they work.</v>

1475
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.500
<v Speaker 14>No.</v>

1476
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.160
<v Speaker 14>But like I would.</v>

1477
01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.640
<v Speaker 14>I remember reading that you could sit and like if you stare at the back of</v>

1478
01:14:07.641 --> 01:14:11.570
<v Speaker 14>someone's neck you could make them look at you Savi riding in the car and just</v>

1479
01:14:11.571 --> 01:14:15.980
<v Speaker 14>staring at the back of my brother's neck trying to get into turnaround it work.</v>

1480
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:22.250
<v Speaker 25>I mean there's cardio shit i absolutely tired of my shit and he would turn</v>

1481
01:14:22.251 --> 01:14:23.540
<v Speaker 25>around anyway to punch me.</v>
