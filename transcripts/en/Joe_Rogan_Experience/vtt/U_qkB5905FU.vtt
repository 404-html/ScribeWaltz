2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan podcast by night.</v>

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.841
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you're here,</v>

5
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Jim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.953
<v Speaker 1>you've got a very interesting setup and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to quite a few people work </v>

7
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Speaker 1>with you and your unconventional ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got a great reputation,</v>

9
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.290
<v Speaker 1>just so you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you so convinced of this time,</v>

11
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>tiffany scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>that reverse hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that machine that you create.</v>

13
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about that 100 times on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

14
00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Get that thing has done wonders for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and uh,</v>

15
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.970
<v Speaker 1>a genius product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're good.</v>

17
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a genius product.</v>

18
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:42.434
<v Speaker 1>How did you invent that?</v>

19
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.063
<v Speaker 3>I broke my lower back in 1973.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You invented that thing in 73 while I </v>

20
00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 3>started to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually about 74 started,</v>

21
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 3>but I brought my daughter back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 73 and I was on crutches for</v>

22
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:58.510
<v Speaker 3>10 months and no one was helping me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just come out,</v>

23
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.353
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd do back extensions where you hook </v>

24
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:03.320
<v Speaker 3>your ankles and raise your upper body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that would kill my back.</v>

25
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.921
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

26
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 3>if I did it in reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I jumped up on a platform,</v>

27
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:07.850
<v Speaker 3>dropped my legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raise them up,</v>

28
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 3>pumped up my back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't hurt,</v>

29
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Speaker 3>and that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the beginning stages of it.</v>

30
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 3>And then years later we've always been a</v>
<v Speaker 3>private gym.</v>

31
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 3>We're not open to the public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was never out in the public.</v>

32
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:21.350
<v Speaker 3>And then I finally made a machine years </v>
<v Speaker 3>later and got my first patent in 1994.</v>

33
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.380
<v Speaker 1>How is it that no one knows about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

34
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:25.214
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that it's not a gigantic </v>

35
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:27.764
<v Speaker 1>success?</v>

36
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we were actually,</v>

37
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 3>should we sell over a little bit over </v>
<v Speaker 3>$100 a month?</v>

38
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 3>100 machines a month?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

39
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 3>I hope I've sold some of them for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have.</v>

40
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.810
<v Speaker 3>I want to thank you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the way you know,</v>

41
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 3>is like sex once you have you gotta you </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotTa keep it.</v>

42
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how I heard about it.</v>

43
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who initially told me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

44
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:51.880
<v Speaker 1>but I was having some disc issues and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they all want to cut you open man.</v>

45
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.213
<v Speaker 1>If you go to doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all want to fuse disks and cut you </v>

46
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>open and there's all this talk and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

47
00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:58.300
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be another way.</v>

48
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.313
<v Speaker 1>So then I started research and stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how I came upon the </v>

49
00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>reverse hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember as soon as I saw it,</v>

50
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:05.081
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

51
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:07.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a genius idea because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

52
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.560
<v Speaker 1>The idea is right that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a bulging disk is because things</v>

53
00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>are getting compressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just pull them apart.</v>

54
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.223
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got another machine that belt </v>

55
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.443
<v Speaker 3>squat machine we usually for grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually fight in there and it's </v>

56
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:21.530
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a reverse every bit to traction</v>

57
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:22.364
<v Speaker 3>device as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we do an enormous amount of work and </v>

58
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 3>at the same time as the restoration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the other one called?</v>

59
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 3>It's called a belt squat machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bell squat puts you in a platform with</v>

60
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 3>a belt around your waist with maybe 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200,</v>

61
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:33.644
<v Speaker 3>300 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we grapple or or we spar or it </v>

62
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:37.754
<v Speaker 3>could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We actually lift weights and we use an </v>

63
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:41.270
<v Speaker 3>enormous amount of wage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>May Two thousand pounds in it,</v>

64
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.880
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's building up your glutes and all the</v>

65
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.723
<v Speaker 3>old lower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lower body is tractioning out your </v>

66
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 3>spine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's um,</v>

67
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 3>but the restoration street medicine next</v>
<v Speaker 3>day you don't even know you worked out,</v>

68
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.870
<v Speaker 3>but you've done thousands of pounds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>work and that's why I've got the world's</v>

69
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:54.704
<v Speaker 3>strongest soon.</v>

70
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you started out as a power lifter.</v>

71
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.203
<v Speaker 3>Shadows apparently started limping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lifting I was 14 and then I went to my </v>

72
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.100
<v Speaker 3>first time meeting 1966 and salt guys is</v>
<v Speaker 3>really built.</v>

73
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Never went back to Olympic lifting </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

74
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 3>And then a power lifted all my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Made top 10 for 34 years.</v>

75
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm so beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

76
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the sport.</v>

77
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.630
<v Speaker 3>I love the strength and power also loves</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>

78
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 3>if it's in time or weights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

79
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something you can measure,</v>

80
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

81
00:03:22.441 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good to be a.</v>

82
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 3>I like to work with football because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd average three tents off,</v>

83
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 3>12 linemen going in the nfl some when </v>
<v Speaker 3>the NFL,</v>

84
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 3>some didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just never know.</v>

85
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 3>But I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like just basic things to statistics,</v>

86
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how strong are you,</v>

87
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 3>how fast are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

88
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 3>for the person who doesn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

89
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 3>what is difference between power lifting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Olympic lifting,</v>

90
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.263
<v Speaker 3>power lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been squat and dead lift and </v>

91
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.484
<v Speaker 3>Olympic lifting a clean jerk and snatch </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the things that absolute </v>

92
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 3>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sport law the way could be very,</v>

93
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.450
<v Speaker 3>very slow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

94
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 3>and Olympic lifting because I could to </v>
<v Speaker 3>clean,</v>

95
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 3>you have four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have two poles,</v>

96
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 3>front squat and a jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever your weakest at touch,</v>

97
00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 3>what you're limited at.</v>

98
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 3>But that's a speed strength sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means velocity.</v>

99
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Speed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strength is intermediate philosophy.</v>

100
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 3>My sport had slow velocity and then if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you jump,</v>

101
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.743
<v Speaker 3>that's explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm explosive power and that's measured </v>

102
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 3>in past philosophies but didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build explosive power.</v>

103
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 3>You Gen and how'd you get involved with </v>
<v Speaker 3>work when fighters,</v>

104
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 3>because I know you work with Matt Brown </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you worked with a bunch of guys.</v>

105
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.031
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not bunch.</v>

106
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:22.864
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Randleman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Brown started Kevin Randleman and </v>

107
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 3>a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin has experimented.</v>

108
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:27.514
<v Speaker 3>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was afraid I was going to </v>

109
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:28.954
<v Speaker 3>hurt the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that you can't hurt these guys </v>

110
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 3>know they ever hurt me and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's how it started.</v>

111
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

112
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 3>back when Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

113
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.743
<v Speaker 3>when it was champion and one was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably know when he was probably </v>

114
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 3>around 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

115
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was somewhere in that range,</v>

116
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around there.</v>

117
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 3>He was the UFC heavyweight champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

118
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:45.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

119
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his buddy.</v>

120
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm Mark Coleman down here and I'd never</v>
<v Speaker 3>get marked down here.</v>

121
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I went to his house twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought he's going to kick my ass.</v>

122
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.273
<v Speaker 3>I got it all psyched up and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>staring me down to rock it back and </v>

123
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:57.094
<v Speaker 3>forth and I don't really shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I tried to calm me down to get </v>

124
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:01.324
<v Speaker 3>the hell out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he said he wanted to talk to </v>

125
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 3>him again about a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Guy.</v>

126
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.523
<v Speaker 3>So I go back up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing happened and then I asked </v>

127
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:08.111
<v Speaker 3>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

128
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why you wanted to come down?</v>

129
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:09.710
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

130
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 3>he said he'd have to train.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I trained optimally.</v>

131
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:13.774
<v Speaker 3>I don't train on smartsheet optimally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only need to have a bunch of stuff </v>

132
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:18.304
<v Speaker 3>out in the first round.</v>

133
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 3>He trained everything optimally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not minimal,</v>

134
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 3>not maximal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's optimal.</v>

135
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.980
<v Speaker 3>So when you take a guy like Kevin random</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like a stud athlete like that,</v>

136
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 3>like how would you assess like what </v>
<v Speaker 3>optimum is for a guy like that,</v>

137
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.820
<v Speaker 3>but that's when he was the first guy I </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever had.</v>

138
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 3>And you know what a freak he was on men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm Tom,</v>

139
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.330
<v Speaker 3>which a lot of guys right now and I mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin was used freak.</v>

140
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.203
<v Speaker 3>You saw Kevin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

141
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 3>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do a lot of sled work,</v>

142
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:42.364
<v Speaker 3>upper body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lower body and a lot of the dumbbells </v>

143
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 3>for time like him and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

144
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:48.890
<v Speaker 3>he is so upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One time we tie,</v>

145
00:05:48.891 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 3>they did a 107 reps with 75 pound </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumbbells in five minutes on a stability</v>

146
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 3>ball and he tied me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

147
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 3>We both did 107 reps and he was highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>upset.</v>

148
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the best athletes ever in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sport.</v>

149
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Explosive.</v>

150
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.873
<v Speaker 3>Did he win the UFC heavyweight title?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he fought boss Rutan and I think </v>

151
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.333
<v Speaker 3>he lost the title to Bas rutten office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a real controversial decision </v>

152
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 3>because boss was hitting them off his </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

153
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 3>He broke boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows that,</v>

154
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

155
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those breaks are pretty common </v>

156
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.230
<v Speaker 3>habit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost every fight.</v>

157
00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least some sort of bright.</v>

158
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 3>Almost every fighter has like some kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a DD deviated septum.</v>

159
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.050
<v Speaker 3>What you see in our fighting is down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark was probably champion UFC champ,</v>

160
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 3>but fighting is changed now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

161
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:38.324
<v Speaker 3>you know that every week you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm only at home and in my recliner </v>

162
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 3>watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's so much more sophisticated.</v>

163
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 3>I love MMA because it's highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>technical.</v>

164
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll hear people boots still when they</v>

165
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 3>get on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the ground game.</v>

166
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.090
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

167
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Have to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

168
00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:54.630
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely very technical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

169
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.473
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting too is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different approaches to </v>

170
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:58.274
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning and that's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the reasons why I wanted to talk to </v>

171
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:01.514
<v Speaker 3>you because one of the things that I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen was matt working out with you and </v>

172
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 3>your guys and he was doing all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy stuff.</v>

173
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 3>Like when you devise a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for an athlete,</v>

174
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:13.830
<v Speaker 3>like a Matte Brown or someone like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do you do?</v>

175
00:07:13.831 --> 00:07:14.664
<v Speaker 3>You work with them first and try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out what they're capable of and </v>

176
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:18.970
<v Speaker 3>then think about what their style is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

177
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.053
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you're gonna have a different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different need if you're a striker </v>

178
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 3>versus grappler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well one thing we do,</v>

179
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.610
<v Speaker 3>we try to get them where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioned to do five minute rounds and</v>

180
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 3>recovering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One minute.</v>

181
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 3>When I worked everything was five </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes and minute recovery.</v>

182
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.220
<v Speaker 3>Some guys had went through eight rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys I was able to do that.</v>

183
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean pretty good fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

184
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:41.890
<v Speaker 3>13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 wins and and pro fights,</v>

185
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.153
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just whatever recovery I want to </v>

186
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.664
<v Speaker 3>maximize the amount of work it can do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes and then be able to cover </v>

187
00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 3>in one minute and do it again </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly.</v>

188
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 3>That's all I ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Work on five minute intervals.</v>

189
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.763
<v Speaker 3>So did you work with guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use heart rate monitors and how did you </v>

190
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 3>decide what to have done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any of that?</v>

191
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Really never now my print now John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sattler,</v>

192
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.473
<v Speaker 3>he's got Shitty Chi Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's basically started almost ready to </v>

193
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 3>first MMA school in America if you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about because he was judo,</v>

194
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu Samba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also striking and he started in 1995</v>

195
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 3>and he does everything by heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we do take by percentages,</v>

196
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.263
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like said we trained by a range of </v>

197
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 3>velocity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speed,</v>

198
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 3>strength training and 75 to 85 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would do heart rates like that.</v>

199
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.250
<v Speaker 3>And like if you and I would grapple </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

200
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 3>we could talk to each other for a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour,</v>

201
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 3>that'd be optimal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

202
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 3>me and you can talk while we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

203
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 3>That's an optimal heart rate that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

204
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.453
<v Speaker 3>So he kept track of heart rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically how we do a percentage of one </v>

205
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:38.054
<v Speaker 3>rep Max.</v>

206
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.103
<v Speaker 3>So meaning that it's optimal if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could still talk while you're doing the </v>

207
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 3>extra train optimally you knew you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not like,</v>

208
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:47.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I would be in here.</v>

209
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.740
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

210
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:49.933
<v Speaker 3>but if you're going to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're in a fight and it's a </v>

211
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.663
<v Speaker 3>very high paced fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very likely that you're going to </v>

212
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 3>achieve much higher of heart rate would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be much more exhausted.</v>

213
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.153
<v Speaker 3>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be up to much how we train </v>

214
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:00.861
<v Speaker 3>our speed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>

215
00:09:00.861 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 3>I to today for squatting and deadlifting</v>
<v Speaker 3>is optimized.</v>

216
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.393
<v Speaker 3>They do a 25 squats at one way and two </v>
<v Speaker 3>for speed strength acceleration into 20 </v>

217
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 3>deadlifts and then the other days Max </v>
<v Speaker 3>effort.</v>

218
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.680
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you go all out and around someone's</v>

219
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 3>pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

220
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:18.480
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to take you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to fight back.</v>

221
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.770
<v Speaker 3>So it would say it always changes.</v>

222
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 3>You can't do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the law of accommodation few</v>

223
00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:24.170
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

224
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 3>if you and I grappled at the same rate </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time,</v>

225
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 3>I would actually catch up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

226
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 3>so you'd have to be able to maximize </v>
<v Speaker 3>your potential and run me into dirt.</v>

227
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.450
<v Speaker 3>So that's why you got to have few </v>
<v Speaker 3>different days,</v>

228
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.284
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just do the same type of work </v>

229
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.144
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where a lot of projects </v>

230
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 3>go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get wordy pages up too much.</v>

231
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 3>You see that before fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters cover up.</v>

232
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

233
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:47.994
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna Watch fights all my life from </v>

234
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Roberto Duran to Mohammed Ali.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched him.</v>

235
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've got to be a big fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>fan and you just see how some people get</v>

236
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:59.250
<v Speaker 3>in a scheduled amount of work per </v>
<v Speaker 3>randomly and that's when you beat them.</v>

237
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Take them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

238
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:01.563
<v Speaker 3>another word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

239
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make you go at my pace,</v>

240
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.230
<v Speaker 3>not you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

241
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.443
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go call your patient will make you feel </v>

242
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mine.</v>

243
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.940
<v Speaker 3>So varying the intensity of the training</v>
<v Speaker 3>varying how you do your training.</v>

244
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.450
<v Speaker 3>You think that's very important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>

245
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:13.284
<v Speaker 3>Hence the change those zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So does it have to change all the time </v>

246
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 3>because the body just adapts and gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>efficient?</v>

247
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:19.194
<v Speaker 3>Try that as well as ask about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In Law of accommodation is you adapt to </v>

248
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:25.230
<v Speaker 3>a training loader stimulus and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't change it,</v>

249
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.073
<v Speaker 3>you get no better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You actually go backwards so you can </v>

250
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:31.160
<v Speaker 3>actually got to change these stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Does a lot of stuff of war barrels.</v>

251
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.003
<v Speaker 3>We push we're bells around for half a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mile running sometimes heavier weight </v>

252
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:37.750
<v Speaker 3>walking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get into belts.</v>

253
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Clot is very grueling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then just a maximal strength.</v>

254
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.350
<v Speaker 3>Went to simple things like deadlifts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good mornings.</v>

255
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.303
<v Speaker 3>We do a lot of stuff holding the bars in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their elbows come has to do a lot of </v>

256
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 3>that because almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

257
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 3>grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pumbling and then uh,</v>

258
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:51.161
<v Speaker 3>other times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

259
00:10:51.161 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 3>you got to do quick stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So quicker page stuff.</v>

260
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.250
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

261
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.250
<v Speaker 3>it does how fights are their number one </v>
<v Speaker 3>pace.</v>

262
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you create a schedule like say if</v>

263
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:01.280
<v Speaker 3>you're working with a guy and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

264
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't believe in schedule,</v>

265
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.140
<v Speaker 3>you don't believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

266
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:06.090
<v Speaker 3>even my guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the strongest gym in the world,</v>

267
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:06.924
<v Speaker 3>spoke about 140 all time world records </v>
<v Speaker 3>at breakfast and time can verify at </v>

268
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 3>breakfast in the morning at 6:00,</v>
<v Speaker 3>6:30.</v>

269
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.530
<v Speaker 3>We decide what we're going to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>day because he drinks majored in time.</v>

270
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not measured in weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's measured in time.</v>

271
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.290
<v Speaker 3>Talking about velocities and so we just </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick an exercise like for you.</v>

272
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Speaker 3>If we did a real low box squat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't takes longer than squatting.</v>

273
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Eight hundred pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your gun squad a hundred pounds.</v>

274
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.080
<v Speaker 3>You know you choked me out after a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

275
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:35.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna tap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

276
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.503
<v Speaker 3>Or if we run after awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to run out of oxygen and I'm </v>

277
00:11:38.251 --> 00:11:39.960
<v Speaker 3>going to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say thank for strength,</v>

278
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.070
<v Speaker 3>economic strain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so long,</v>

279
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Speaker 3>so long as you strained at least that </v>
<v Speaker 3>length of time or longer,</v>

280
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.920
<v Speaker 3>you're going to break a classical lift </v>
<v Speaker 3>and squat venture debt with.</v>

281
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not totally sure I understand what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying.</v>

282
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you have different?</v>

283
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Speaker 3>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you grapple,</v>

284
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have different </v>
<v Speaker 3>opponents,</v>

285
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 3>big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small ones,</v>

286
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 3>fast and slow ones left hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right hand,</v>

287
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you,</v>

288
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:01.563
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you adapt to all different </v>

289
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:03.590
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

290
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 3>that's what we do.</v>

291
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 3>As long as our training is harder than a</v>
<v Speaker 3>contest,</v>

292
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:10.500
<v Speaker 3>we're going to break records.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a gentleman not long ago,</v>

293
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 3>a 800 pound squat at one 65 top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world right now,</v>

294
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.943
<v Speaker 3>1880 total top of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I promise the one year old world record </v>

295
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:18.740
<v Speaker 3>in less than a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each quarter,</v>

296
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 3>80 pound world record until of 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we just got systematically,</v>

297
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 3>we run everything in ways three for </v>
<v Speaker 3>speed.</v>

298
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.920
<v Speaker 3>We work on speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strength,</v>

299
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 3>exhilaration and we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he goes,</v>

300
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is basically 75,</v>

301
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:32.650
<v Speaker 3>80,</v>
<v Speaker 3>85 percent.</v>

302
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 3>And then on the fourth week we way back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and start over.</v>

303
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:38.920
<v Speaker 3>We changed the bar so that way by </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing a safety squat bar,</v>

304
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:41.020
<v Speaker 3>if you know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even a front squat,</v>

305
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.480
<v Speaker 3>we changed them link to the spine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

306
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without really,</v>

307
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only got one of the spine,</v>

308
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 3>but we do it systematically by using </v>
<v Speaker 3>different bars so you,</v>

309
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.243
<v Speaker 3>your brain has to now think differently </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's got a bar from where it </v>

310
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 3>sits on top of your back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your lower back is different.</v>

311
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 3>So it has adopted that every three </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>

312
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.400
<v Speaker 4>So by changing bars and changing is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the type of workouts you do,</v>

313
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:04.234
<v Speaker 4>it forces your body to adapt all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 4>of different loads or all sorts of </v>

314
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:10.390
<v Speaker 4>different ways of standing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All sorts of different outputs.</v>

315
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.453
<v Speaker 3>We change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your leverage is constantly changing </v>

316
00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:15.450
<v Speaker 3>leverage and where the bar has to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>going the same,</v>

317
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your car.</v>

318
00:13:17.101 --> 00:13:18.630
<v Speaker 3>I talk about this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

319
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.100
<v Speaker 3>if you look at your car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a normal car,</v>

320
00:13:20.101 --> 00:13:23.250
<v Speaker 3>it will shifts at 2,500 rpm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every time it shifts gears,</v>

321
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.770
<v Speaker 3>well that's optimal horsepower for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

322
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.320
<v Speaker 3>And so we traded it to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>percentage of the bar.</v>

323
00:13:28.321 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Speed is optimal for postal power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if we want,</v>

324
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 30,</v>

325
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.320
<v Speaker 3>40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

326
00:13:34.321 --> 00:13:35.154
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm want to take you down and I'd work </v>

327
00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:37.740
<v Speaker 3>on 30 slash 40 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait til one a muscle you,</v>

328
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.490
<v Speaker 3>I've worked with 75 to 85 percent wage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it'd be strength speed,</v>

329
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.790
<v Speaker 3>and if I had to really grind you out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why we got to make you stronger,</v>

330
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how strong grapplers are.</v>

331
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.510
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we work on all,</v>

332
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.793
<v Speaker 3>all different philosophies and string </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of one week and in where instead </v>

333
00:13:52.981 --> 00:13:56.380
<v Speaker 3>of doing high reputations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a person Icu,</v>

334
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.590
<v Speaker 3>let's say your lower back is susceptible</v>
<v Speaker 3>to injury.</v>

335
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.030
<v Speaker 3>You might have 600 pound legs and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but only 450 pound lower back.</v>

336
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.710
<v Speaker 3>So we work a individual muscle groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>single joint activity like reverse hyper</v>

337
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:10.020
<v Speaker 3>works your low back hamstrings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>spinal rectors,</v>

338
00:14:10.021 --> 00:14:10.854
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got a special machine of works to </v>

339
00:14:11.971 --> 00:14:12.960
<v Speaker 3>hamstrings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

340
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.920
<v Speaker 3>we got all these different apparatuses </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were different parts of your body.</v>

341
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.920
<v Speaker 3>So we don't have any Muslim bounces like</v>
<v Speaker 3>MMA if you've got no stand up,</v>

342
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stand up with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got no grappling.</v>

343
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

344
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.990
<v Speaker 3>so wherever you said we work on all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these witnesses have balances,</v>

345
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.943
<v Speaker 3>so we have constant balance of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>strengths and abilities and we're </v>

346
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.680
<v Speaker 3>capacity</v>

347
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.690
<v Speaker 4>and so because you don't have a schedule</v>
<v Speaker 4>and because you decide what you're going</v>

348
00:14:36.691 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 4>to do that day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you just kind of assess like how your</v>

349
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:39.934
<v Speaker 4>athletes are performing and what they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're capable of doing given the </v>

350
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:44.950
<v Speaker 4>each individual day.</v>

351
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.820
<v Speaker 3>We have records on all kinds of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like penn dead lifts or box deadlifts or</v>

352
00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.470
<v Speaker 3>some kind of squatters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of bench.</v>

353
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.250
<v Speaker 3>They break the entire gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's only maybe 15,</v>

354
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 3>maybe 15 guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a private gym,</v>

355
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.710
<v Speaker 3>but you break the record over 90 percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the time you're in,</v>

356
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:01.544
<v Speaker 3>you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why'd you decide to have a private </v>

357
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:03.891
<v Speaker 3>gym?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how come?</v>

358
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:05.690
<v Speaker 3>How come you don't open the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>commercial gyms?</v>

359
00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:09.470
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand to be around people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know if you're a real fire.</v>

360
00:15:09.471 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be around a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>

361
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:14.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can't stand.</v>

362
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.520
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand to go into commercial gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't stand it.</v>

363
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.713
<v Speaker 3>I just got out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll leave in five minutes because </v>

364
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:20.240
<v Speaker 3>they're not working out hard enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not worry,</v>

365
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.770
<v Speaker 3>not hard data on what the hell they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

366
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:22.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking in the mirrors,</v>

367
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.290
<v Speaker 3>looking girls and shit like that.</v>

368
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.380
<v Speaker 3>I like to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

369
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.841
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

370
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:28.200
<v Speaker 3>gym I want to work out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'll go look at that.</v>

371
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.413
<v Speaker 3>So you just decided to set up this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should do like a little tour of the </v>

372
00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 3>gym at the end of the iron sharpens </v>
<v Speaker 3>iron,</v>

373
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:35.090
<v Speaker 3>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

374
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.140
<v Speaker 3>So if you're one with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you develop a limp.</v>

375
00:15:37.141 --> 00:15:39.740
<v Speaker 3>So don't hang around people like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how long have you had this gym for?</v>

376
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:41.363
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

377
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 3>I've had a gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started training by myself.</v>

378
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:44.534
<v Speaker 3>I had a top toe in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1973 for a while until I brought my </v>

379
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've,</v>

380
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:49.244
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a gym book would training </v>

381
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:53.170
<v Speaker 3>partners since 1976.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got my first part in 19 six.</v>

382
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.990
<v Speaker 3>It's always been private.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it my basement?</v>

383
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.833
<v Speaker 3>I went to my garage and we had to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting bigger and bigger and bigger is </v>

384
00:15:58.731 --> 00:15:59.564
<v Speaker 3>not better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we had to get bigger because we </v>

385
00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:02.600
<v Speaker 3>started to attract a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were good.</v>

386
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're selected to come here </v>
<v Speaker 3>like anybody else in English,</v>

387
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.810
<v Speaker 3>so they just pay a membership fee or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

388
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I pay everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pay everything.</v>

389
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.560
<v Speaker 3>How do you keep this place running?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This business right here.</v>

390
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling books and videos.</v>

391
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:15.801
<v Speaker 3>Machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

392
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:16.634
<v Speaker 3>We got um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got like 11 or 13 patents I've paid my </v>

393
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:23.690
<v Speaker 3>money comes from royalties from putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>my name on different companies.</v>

394
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.183
<v Speaker 3>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like almost the gym itself </v>

395
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.510
<v Speaker 3>doesn't bring any profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just reputation.</v>

396
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.950
<v Speaker 3>Probably 50 grand a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

397
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.720
<v Speaker 3>When you say 500 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did gym costs me 55,000 a year.</v>

398
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:39.773
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's one of the most respected </v>

399
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 3>places in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Science and most famous gym.</v>

400
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 3>There's no sign you don't need a song?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

401
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.640
<v Speaker 3>We're pulling in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where the fuck is this?</v>

402
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.510
<v Speaker 3>Twice.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

404
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:53.750
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

405
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.610
<v Speaker 3>that's about as hardcore as it gets.</v>

406
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.993
<v Speaker 3>And it's how it would choke him into </v>
<v Speaker 3>lovelace because a lot of people like </v>

407
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:03.520
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not that old.</v>

408
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still power lift yourself and.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Squatting to meet 500.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five bench six 75 to 70 when you're 63?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

414
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.890
<v Speaker 3>My neck just gave out wide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starting to pass out all the time zone.</v>

415
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.440
<v Speaker 3>You start passing out all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of my neck.</v>

416
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Like what's going on and to compress </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's the basically from my mid back,</v>

419
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.923
<v Speaker 3>from my deck to my mid back is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>locked up all just from carrying heavy </v>

420
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:34.960
<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy squats and heavier.</v>

421
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I was squatting for 10 when I was 14 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years old for 10.</v>

422
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.570
<v Speaker 3>At 14 to 16 to content support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keen at 1:40.</v>

423
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hold new.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll be 69 in two weeks.</v>

425
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.320
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how old were you when you were saying</v>

426
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 3>that you lifted all that weight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The law,</v>

427
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.590
<v Speaker 3>the most recent 63,</v>
<v Speaker 3>63 and that's when you done,</v>

428
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:54.463
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's enough.</v>

429
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.083
<v Speaker 3>I was passing out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't pass out and I came off a </v>

430
00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 3>platform and I expect for him was </v>
<v Speaker 3>described good.</v>

431
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Speaker 3>It was 7:35 and he said No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

432
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:03.791
<v Speaker 3>what was wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

433
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:04.530
<v Speaker 3>you pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

434
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I was on Queer Street,</v>

435
00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:10.830
<v Speaker 3>I noticed as real dark covered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I went I made it through.</v>

436
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:15.810
<v Speaker 3>That meant I needed to get an 1885 total</v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually 37th in the world that year.</v>

437
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

438
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:17.904
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I thought I could actually tell </v>

439
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.380
<v Speaker 3>what 2000 pounds if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing training which was squatting</v>

440
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:22.790
<v Speaker 3>the age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

441
00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.650
<v Speaker 3>but because it needs context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were geared,</v>

442
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:26.760
<v Speaker 3>it takes longer to get up and down.</v>

443
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Just caused me to pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

444
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever thought about inventing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that would strengthen the rest</v>

445
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 3>of respond the same way you did the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reverse hyper?</v>

446
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I wish because I've got two devices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It definitely worked for the lower spine</v>

447
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.590
<v Speaker 3>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need something from upper right now.</v>

448
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:44.424
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just went through a series of stem </v>

449
00:18:45.401 --> 00:18:47.160
<v Speaker 3>cell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you got.</v>

450
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:51.600
<v Speaker 3>You get stem cell stem cell in my knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both hips and my shoulder and.</v>

451
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:56.100
<v Speaker 3>Right and I just yesterday had platelet </v>
<v Speaker 3>injections in my knee and my hip.</v>

452
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.180
<v Speaker 3>You got to go back next week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>

453
00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.450
<v Speaker 3>I get nerve blocks in my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

454
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.373
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to get my neck well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think my also got kicked in my </v>

455
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.270
<v Speaker 3>leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

456
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.870
<v Speaker 3>by a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A fight or a small one.</v>

457
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:08.930
<v Speaker 3>One 35 and he screwed up by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

458
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.010
<v Speaker 3>So that didn't help me any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did he kick you in the leg?</v>

459
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.650
<v Speaker 3>But I told him to kick me in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't kick me,</v>

460
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.820
<v Speaker 3>don't kick me in and he kicked me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nene.</v>

461
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.430
<v Speaker 3>Torn muscle in basically must be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a hamstring right above my knee.</v>

462
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Will you guys sparring or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

463
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.133
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

464
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just stupid.</v>

465
00:19:23.201 --> 00:19:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Like dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's still spar?</v>

466
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:25.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

467
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.293
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

468
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep.</v>

469
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.320
<v Speaker 3>I can barely get around now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a fracture is called 13 guy hit me</v>

470
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:32.760
<v Speaker 3>in a hipaa baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13,</v>

471
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.490
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>broken jaw and broken hand by 18.</v>

472
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't have him in me back then.</v>

473
00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.773
<v Speaker 3>Have you thought about inventing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that would have strengthened </v>

474
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.633
<v Speaker 3>the cervical spine and linkedin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know I got on a boat of things I just </v>

475
00:19:48.461 --> 00:19:50.220
<v Speaker 3>said we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to introduce the machine.</v>

476
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 3>October 21st going to absolutely change </v>
<v Speaker 3>of strength training as world knows.</v>

477
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 3>It's called a static dynamic of Elbert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will change.</v>

478
00:19:57.031 --> 00:20:00.090
<v Speaker 3>The world is static dynamic developer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that going to do?</v>

479
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.163
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like if I hold elbow and a get </v>

480
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.733
<v Speaker 3>pressure on your arm and go in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a machine that's going to hold </v>

481
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:08.610
<v Speaker 3>you like throw a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold it,</v>

482
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 3>let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buy Button.</v>

483
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Hm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

484
00:20:13.621 --> 00:20:15.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm just watching you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do a a judo.</v>

485
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:18.540
<v Speaker 3>You ever see judo toss where a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you in crash pad,</v>

486
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.210
<v Speaker 3>like one for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

487
00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.380
<v Speaker 3>we'll hold you down while the other guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>tries to throw.</v>

488
00:20:22.381 --> 00:20:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Then the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go.</v>

489
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>

490
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.790
<v Speaker 3>Just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

491
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a machine that could do that.</v>

492
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

493
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.060
<v Speaker 3>So you could pull like as hard as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can and can't budge.</v>

494
00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Me and I released zooming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible to develop something like</v>

495
00:20:37.741 --> 00:20:40.410
<v Speaker 3>a reverse hyper that works on some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a neck brace?</v>

496
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.633
<v Speaker 3>Like a similar type of movement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've done reverse hypers with NEC </v>

497
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:46.200
<v Speaker 3>harnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

498
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.540
<v Speaker 3>Where you're working in the top of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>spine to the very bottom of your spine.</v>

499
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.303
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

500
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.373
<v Speaker 4>Now how would that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you would do the reverse hyper with </v>

501
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.100
<v Speaker 4>which to people are just listening to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

502
00:20:57.101 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 4>What a reverse hyper is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like say a table.</v>

503
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.083
<v Speaker 4>If you put your upper body on a table </v>
<v Speaker 4>and your lower body was suspended </v>

504
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.700
<v Speaker 4>underneath the table,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hanging underneath the table,</v>

505
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 4>you would attach your ankles to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>harness.</v>

506
00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:10.774
<v Speaker 4>That's like a leg curl attachment and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you lift your legs up straight and then </v>

507
00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:17.740
<v Speaker 4>when you let your legs down it's pulling</v>
<v Speaker 4>on your spine.</v>

508
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.300
<v Speaker 4>So it's active</v>

509
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:20.463
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

510
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.680
<v Speaker 3>And what would you do with your neck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've put it,</v>

511
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.900
<v Speaker 3>we use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but put a neck,</v>

512
00:21:24.901 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 3>arm or song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you're down,</v>

513
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.970
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you raised that,</v>

514
00:21:27.971 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 3>when you raise your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we also read your upper body and then so</v>

515
00:21:31.331 --> 00:21:32.164
<v Speaker 3>when we do have to use at neck harness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're working the very top of your </v>

516
00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:38.300
<v Speaker 3>spine right up to the atlas all the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to six.</v>

517
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:38.880
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

518
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.660
<v Speaker 4>would it be a neck harness?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like with weights on it?</v>

519
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.610
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

520
00:21:41.611 --> 00:21:42.444
<v Speaker 4>So just like a regular neck harness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like where you hang your weights down </v>

521
00:21:44.841 --> 00:21:45.620
<v Speaker 4>and you do it.</v>

522
00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you pick up your feet,</v>

523
00:21:47.121 --> 00:21:48.450
<v Speaker 3>you pick up your head as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

524
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.420
<v Speaker 3>you rub it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth.</v>

525
00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.510
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

526
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.710
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks Joe.</v>

527
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you do.</v>

528
00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.753
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mean as soon as I saw that reverse </v>

529
00:21:59.541 --> 00:22:00.650
<v Speaker 4>hyper machine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

530
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.040
<v Speaker 4>well how come this isn't used constantly</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it totally makes sense.</v>

531
00:22:04.041 --> 00:22:06.200
<v Speaker 4>It's Trenton's the back and a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>strange way.</v>

532
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.053
<v Speaker 4>Like I brought in a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>have had back issues and they just try </v>

533
00:22:10.611 --> 00:22:12.230
<v Speaker 4>it once and then go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

534
00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:12.801
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

535
00:22:12.801 --> 00:22:14.510
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck is this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Everywhere.</v>

536
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.510
<v Speaker 3>It's marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know Tom Barry here.</v>

537
00:22:17.511 --> 00:22:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Does one marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

538
00:22:19.101 --> 00:22:20.770
<v Speaker 3>we're just starting and I never tried to</v>
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>

539
00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.460
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care about my business,</v>

540
00:22:22.461 --> 00:22:25.700
<v Speaker 3>cared about my gym now he cared about my</v>
<v Speaker 3>gym on my life.</v>

541
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.740
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the most common injuries for</v>

542
00:22:29.741 --> 00:22:31.870
<v Speaker 4>people who lift weights or for people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who grapple,</v>

543
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.093
<v Speaker 4>like I know a lot of fighters who have </v>
<v Speaker 4>either have had diskectomy where they </v>

544
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 4>take a chunk out of your disk or they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting disc replacements.</v>

545
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:41.284
<v Speaker 4>Now a lot of guys are getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>displacements because it develops a </v>

546
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:44.403
<v Speaker 4>pretty new technology in Europe where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have these articulating titanium </v>

547
00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:47.914
<v Speaker 4>disks and they just cut out all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gelatinous substance between the discs </v>

548
00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:52.354
<v Speaker 4>and they put this articulating </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanical disc in there and guys were </v>

549
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 4>getting great relief and they're able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>start fighting again.</v>

550
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 4>I know rick story has to have them in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his neck.</v>

551
00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

552
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.920
<v Speaker 4>quite a few guys have had these things </v>
<v Speaker 4>done where there their back was just too</v>

553
00:23:05.921 --> 00:23:07.540
<v Speaker 4>fucked up and they just couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

554
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:09.640
<v Speaker 4>It's another actually replacing disks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

555
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.030
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with you,</v>

556
00:23:12.031 --> 00:23:13.230
<v Speaker 3>they wanted a fuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You right.</v>

557
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.880
<v Speaker 3>I had two doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2005 but would not pregnant on me.</v>

558
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.990
<v Speaker 3>She says she dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was 11 years ago.</v>

559
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Why too dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

560
00:23:20.521 --> 00:23:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Is that Ohio state do you sent me to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

561
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.150
<v Speaker 3>to search into Ohio state and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't operate on me.</v>

562
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.550
<v Speaker 3>And you wonder why it was because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking,</v>

563
00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:29.520
<v Speaker 3>I was living on Nyquil and tylenol pm.</v>

564
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.680
<v Speaker 4>So it was too dangerous because you were</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking so many pain pills?</v>

565
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.000
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said it was at that time there,</v>

566
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:36.834
<v Speaker 3>the procedures they had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought it was more dangerous not </v>

567
00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:40.114
<v Speaker 3>to operate on me then leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean they weren't going through </v>

568
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.530
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been trached.</v>

569
00:23:43.531 --> 00:23:45.740
<v Speaker 3>I've had chest tubes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a thoracic outlet.</v>

570
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.940
<v Speaker 3>What do my doctor here in town?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outlet threat cutlets with.</v>

571
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:50.774
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have open heart surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't put your hands over your </v>

572
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:54.280
<v Speaker 3>head anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

573
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.183
<v Speaker 3>I went to my doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had me put my hand over my head and </v>

574
00:23:57.531 --> 00:23:58.364
<v Speaker 3>raise my head and my pulse stopped </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it basically goes in and touch </v>

575
00:24:01.381 --> 00:24:03.840
<v Speaker 3>his carotid artery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why it stopped my.</v>

576
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.693
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you would raise your hands over </v>

577
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:09.820
<v Speaker 3>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would compress your carotid artery.</v>

578
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.113
<v Speaker 3>What's causing it to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it would push whatever is doing </v>

579
00:24:14.881 --> 00:24:16.510
<v Speaker 3>and would just cut the oxygen.</v>

580
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.673
<v Speaker 3>See if I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to tap me out and just puts </v>

581
00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:22.250
<v Speaker 3>her head backwards and I'll go to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

582
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like head backwards anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Powerlifting sounds fucking terrible for</v>

00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:28.230
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

584
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.040
<v Speaker 3>if you had grappled guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait one second.</v>

585

<v Speaker 3>I grabbed hold of guys away to 2,920.</v>

586
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Well not exactly what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

587
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when you want to unlimited turn</v>

<v Speaker 3>monster on your hands.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Same thing to get bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's A.</v>

590
00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.430
<v Speaker 3>You're burning the candle at both ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know the weights each Sheila,</v>

591
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.130
<v Speaker 3>but you don't sound like you have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>regrets whatsoever.</v>

592
00:24:49.131 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't regret if I hadn't been beat up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all my life.</v>

593
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 3>I've never learned what I learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

594
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:55.340
<v Speaker 3>people make fun of me is.</v>

<v Speaker 3>broker math.</v>

596
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:57.891
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

597
00:24:57.891 --> 00:24:59.700
<v Speaker 3>I have no bicep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tore my bicep off.</v>

598
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 3>$70 towards this and off a knotted up </v>
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>

599
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.710
<v Speaker 3>That's where the bicep ties into your </v>
<v Speaker 3>forum.</v>

600
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.980
<v Speaker 3>So both your biceps had been torn off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it never stopped me.</v>

601
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.843
<v Speaker 3>I told this and I'll totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they told me I was done six months </v>

602
00:25:12.981 --> 00:25:14.570
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>won a national championship.</v>

603
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Third biggest total estimate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pulled that.</v>

604
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:19.280
<v Speaker 3>Let me see what that looks like again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's gone.</v>

605
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.810
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no bicep?</v>

606
00:25:20.811 --> 00:25:22.850
<v Speaker 3>No right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's insane.</v>

607
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.680
<v Speaker 3>So you don't do curls it very few curls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Curls don't matter for us.</v>

608
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Curls for the girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sandra.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Extension.</v>

610
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.620
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's how I learned.</v>

611
00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:34.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you going to learn.</v>

612
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:35.683
<v Speaker 3>So when you tour it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't even think about getting </v>

613
00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:37.454
<v Speaker 3>surgery to get a return.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to three surgeons to set </v>

614
00:25:39.111 --> 00:25:39.890
<v Speaker 3>operating one second.</v>

615
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.210
<v Speaker 3>You don't care what it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't operate.</v>

616
00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:43.520
<v Speaker 3>And I said I'm not operating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

617
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said six months.</v>

618

<v Speaker 3>made my way clients and then you had to </v>

<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

620

<v Speaker 3>but I told them my patella tendon and </v>
<v Speaker 3>half,</v>

621
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.850
<v Speaker 3>I'd never done curls like you said.</v>

<v Speaker 4>steroids,</v>

651
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:05.323

<v Speaker 4>because it's one of those things in the </v>

652
00:27:08.741 --> 00:27:09.574
<v Speaker 4>world of power lifting the world of </v>
<v Speaker 4>bodybuilding and even in the world of </v>

<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a dirty,</v>

654
00:27:13.571 --> 00:27:16.720
<v Speaker 4>dark secret that people like to keep to </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

655
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.090
<v Speaker 3>but your grandpa can take it.</v>

656
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

657
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:20.604
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

658
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.180
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in my,</v>

659
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.740
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be.</v>

660
00:27:23.741 --> 00:27:26.650
<v Speaker 3>You should pass the physical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one has the right to tell you what to</v>

661
00:27:26.651 --> 00:27:27.484
<v Speaker 3>do in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes time to die on the one </v>

662
00:27:29.951 --> 00:27:32.200
<v Speaker 3>that's got a di,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's time for me to live letting me</v>

663
00:27:32.201 --> 00:27:33.400
<v Speaker 3>lead to life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to live,</v>

664
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:34.803
<v Speaker 4>but what do you think in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem with a lot of people have the </v>

665
00:27:38.921 --> 00:27:43.060
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem they see with using steroids</v>

666
00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:43.894
<v Speaker 4>in sports is it's going to force young </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to use steroids to be able to </v>

667
00:27:46.631 --> 00:27:48.970
<v Speaker 4>compete with the people that are using </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and do it anyhow.</v>

668
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.343
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if everybody's forced to be cleaned </v>

669
00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:54.660
<v Speaker 4>and they don't like what we're doing now</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the UFC,</v>

670
00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:58.660
<v Speaker 4>you were like the Usada the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that have stepped in and Jeff</v>

671
00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.510
<v Speaker 4>Novitsky running that program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy who caught Lance Armstrong.</v>

672
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Well actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lance Armstrong was never caught,</v>

673
00:28:04.551 --> 00:28:05.384
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He passed.</v>

674
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.090
<v Speaker 3>He passed 25 tests for seven years in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>row.</v>

675
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.740
<v Speaker 3>I never was tested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

676
00:28:09.741 --> 00:28:11.330
<v Speaker 3>it's not against the rules to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

677
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.880
<v Speaker 3>It's against the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get caught taking drugs.</v>

678
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.390
<v Speaker 4>That's a fucking loophole.</v>

679
00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.880
<v Speaker 3>You got a good doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're on the craft or not.</v>

680
00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why there should be no,</v>

681
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

682
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Tyson period said an even playing field </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop the drug test.</v>

683
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.960
<v Speaker 3>I'd say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Old Barn was seeing my testosterone.</v>

684
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:31.890
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

685
00:28:31.891 --> 00:28:34.830
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if I was born today,</v>

686
00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:35.664
<v Speaker 3>I would be in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not telling me to teach all </v>

687
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

688
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.780
<v Speaker 3>some of those fighters have got way more</v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone than another fighter.</v>

689
00:28:42.781 --> 00:28:44.160
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Born at same amount.</v>

690
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.740
<v Speaker 3>So the only thing you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not train?</v>

691
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.750
<v Speaker 3>You got a better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you got a better,</v>

692
00:28:48.751 --> 00:28:49.301
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

693
00:28:49.301 --> 00:28:52.920
<v Speaker 3>if you could kick my ass because you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and shit and I don't do any,</v>

694
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.450
<v Speaker 3>but that don't mean you're tougher than </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

695
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I just means you got a better coach in </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

696
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.960
<v Speaker 3>So are you cheating me?</v>

697
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:03.330
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if two guys do have the same coaches</v>

698
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.290
<v Speaker 4>and they do have similar body types and </v>
<v Speaker 4>one guy's taking steroids,</v>

699
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:08.850
<v Speaker 4>he's going to have an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

700
00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:11.870
<v Speaker 3>But isn't at pharmaceutical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you looking at?</v>

701
00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Watch TV every five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to a drug commercial one.</v>

702
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.600
<v Speaker 3>Every year I'll be 69.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take all the god,</v>

703
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm 68.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be 600 to let's take all the health</v>

704
00:29:22.211 --> 00:29:23.830
<v Speaker 3>medication off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six to eight year olds.</v>

705
00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.410
<v Speaker 3>I'll be the only one left on her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any ailments.</v>

706
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.880
<v Speaker 3>Tom will tell you my problem is they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the doctor does note some Romaine.</v>

707
00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:30.723
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just beat the crap out of myself </v>

708
00:29:32.501 --> 00:29:34.840
<v Speaker 3>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have high blood pressure,</v>

709
00:29:34.841 --> 00:29:35.674
<v Speaker 3>high cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have anything and so let's just </v>

710
00:29:38.351 --> 00:29:39.184
<v Speaker 3>take all the drugs away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But all the old 68 year old guys off is </v>

711
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.823
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well be the only one lit for a guy like </v>

712
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.283
<v Speaker 3>all the old women.</v>

713
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a guy like you who's not competing,</v>

714
00:29:50.511 --> 00:29:51.344
<v Speaker 4>and was he one of the arguments for </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting is that steroids allow you to </v>

715
00:29:55.141 --> 00:29:55.974
<v Speaker 4>do more damage to your opponent and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is one of the reasons why steroids </v>

716
00:30:00.241 --> 00:30:03.150
<v Speaker 4>should be illegal is because you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>train harder,</v>

717
00:30:03.151 --> 00:30:04.950
<v Speaker 4>you have more endurance and not just </v>
<v Speaker 4>steroids,</v>

718
00:30:04.951 --> 00:30:07.320
<v Speaker 4>but things like epo and bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

719
00:30:07.321 --> 00:30:10.710
<v Speaker 4>You'll have more energy in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could possibly land more blows,</v>

720
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.753
<v Speaker 4>possibly wind up beating someone that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't be able to beat and do </v>

721
00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:17.430
<v Speaker 4>damage to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's different a lot of ways,</v>

722
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:18.783
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't person take us force for </v>

723
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:20.920
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

724
00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.010
<v Speaker 3>is called PDDS performance enhancing </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

725
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.680
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you do that in sports?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

726
00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.573
<v Speaker 3>his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they would think of it as </v>

727
00:30:28.631 --> 00:30:29.411
<v Speaker 3>cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

728
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:30.880
<v Speaker 3>who does?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

729
00:30:30.881 --> 00:30:33.550
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people don't know how many guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>are cry their eyes out,</v>

730
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:36.200
<v Speaker 3>but get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he cried like bitches and a lie.</v>

731
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baseball players,</v>

732
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never took drugs.</v>

733
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:41.920
<v Speaker 3>You get caught in a car like bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I don't like.</v>

734
00:30:41.921 --> 00:30:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Just tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

735
00:30:43.631 --> 00:30:44.464
<v Speaker 3>I'll never read the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see the billboards on the freeway </v>

736
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.040
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shall not lie.</v>

737
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Just quit line and come out and say I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>take droids you know the NFL.</v>

738
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Why would you be in this for like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>NFL?</v>

739
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what drugs do is for recovery.</v>

740
00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

741
00:30:58.860 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 3>you take.</v>

742
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.570
<v Speaker 3>I can give my strongest people I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen doing.</v>

743
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I've seen guys take board drugs than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone I've ever had much.</v>

744
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.380
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

745
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Jugs up make you strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're born that way.</v>

746
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:12.220
<v Speaker 3>You're born Fascia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>born slow.</v>

747
00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.920
<v Speaker 3>You're born with an attitude or you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

748
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:16.863
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big misconception about </v>

749
00:31:17.861 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 3>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

750
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 3>Is that they make you bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The work makes you bigger,</v>

751
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.160
<v Speaker 3>is to recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you to recover,</v>

752
00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:25.610
<v Speaker 3>to do more workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

753
00:31:25.611 --> 00:31:28.810
<v Speaker 3>So everyone doesn't want to do workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did the people,</v>

754
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>save you want to be an MMA fighter,</v>

755
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.940
<v Speaker 3>intimidated in a cage one time and never</v>
<v Speaker 3>get by.</v>

756
00:31:33.941 --> 00:31:34.774
<v Speaker 3>Coleman told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark said he had a million restaurants </v>

757
00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:39.160
<v Speaker 3>when he had hammer house here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Soon as they got onboard one time,</v>

758
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:40.150
<v Speaker 3>but he never came back.</v>

759
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.313
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a mild benefit to taking </v>

760
00:31:44.971 --> 00:31:47.460
<v Speaker 4>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of other stuff without doing any</v>

761
00:31:47.461 --> 00:31:50.160
<v Speaker 4>physical work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But almost all of it is in the fact that</v>

762
00:31:50.161 --> 00:31:50.980
<v Speaker 4>you could put in or</v>

763
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.470
<v Speaker 3>work and you recover far quicker than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the average person.</v>

764
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But see that way if everyone took it,</v>

765
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.490
<v Speaker 3>you're not cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

766
00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.480
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotTa,</v>

767
00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.890
<v Speaker 3>you gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a corvette,</v>

768
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.753
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to put high test cats in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think that like it also for </v>

769
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:07.024
<v Speaker 3>young guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can fuck up your endocrine system </v>

770
00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:10.530
<v Speaker 3>and fucks up your body's production </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>

771
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.100
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what hcg sport,</v>

772
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.660
<v Speaker 3>you got to spark doc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take her.</v>

773
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Everybody takes hcg because your muscles</v>
<v Speaker 3>shrink up because if you take roids,</v>

774
00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.110
<v Speaker 3>you take tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking more in mother nature told</v>

775
00:32:23.111 --> 00:32:23.944
<v Speaker 3>you so you're not measuring cup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are morons anyhow because you </v>

776
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:27.390
<v Speaker 3>took act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're nuts.</v>

777
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.263
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't drink up HCG.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that stand for in tropic </v>

778
00:32:30.791 --> 00:32:31.624
<v Speaker 3>hormone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It raises all your home men's vendors </v>

779
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.770
<v Speaker 3>and sports there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot.</v>

780
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 3>There's no sportsmanship in sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It mean you were still fight in</v>

781
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 1>front of a big crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the crowd will want me to knock you</v>

782
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:44.114
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other half the crowd would want </v>

783
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 1>you to knock me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that sportsmanship?</v>

784
00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just people.</v>

785
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Sportsmanship is supposed to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes competing without cheating.</v>

786
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.153
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

787
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 1>if there was a pill that you could take </v>
<v Speaker 1>that made you invulnerable,</v>

788
00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:58.953
<v Speaker 1>gave you like a God pill and you took </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone into a fight and the other guy </v>

789
00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:02.840
<v Speaker 1>thought he was fighting a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

790
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 1>you're invulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can hurt you.</v>

791
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't be hurt and you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired,</v>

792
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.170
<v Speaker 1>which you have superhuman strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

793
00:33:09.171 --> 00:33:11.300
<v Speaker 1>With share Roy still be legal or illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>type point.</v>

794
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be better than steroids.</v>

795
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.870
<v Speaker 1>It would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like a superstar Roy,</v>

796
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:16.723
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you think that that would be </v>

797
00:33:17.391 --> 00:33:18.310
<v Speaker 1>cheating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

798
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

799
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.100
<v Speaker 1>but we'll then nobody can beat anybody.</v>

800
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.410
<v Speaker 1>You just beat the fuck out of each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nothing would ever happen.</v>

801
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.940
<v Speaker 1>But in the hills right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all starts up in your brain,</v>

802
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:26.991
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

803
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I kind of could see how you can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that argument with other sports,</v>

804
00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:35.090
<v Speaker 1>but fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean fighting is about fighting.</v>

805
00:33:35.091 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Is problem solving with dire physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

806
00:33:38.091 --> 00:33:38.924
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what it is and if you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimize those consequences through </v>

807
00:33:42.231 --> 00:33:43.064
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people would think that would </v>

808
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:46.760
<v Speaker 1>be cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at this,</v>

809
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:47.703
<v Speaker 1>I look at the Diaz brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing they got a lot of </v>

810
00:33:50.271 --> 00:33:51.104
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who in the hell their dad </v>

811
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:54.850
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he must have a lot of testosterone.</v>

812
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

813
00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Those guys eat Vegan for the most part </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

814
00:33:58.371 --> 00:33:59.204
<v Speaker 1>Nate eats fish and eggs to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if Nicki's fish it </v>

815
00:34:02.831 --> 00:34:04.880
<v Speaker 1>might have in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he does anymore.</v>

816
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.713
<v Speaker 1>I think he's pretty much Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which most people that eat vegan have </v>

817
00:34:09.111 --> 00:34:09.944
<v Speaker 1>lower testosterone because the substrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>for developing testosterone is fats is </v>

818
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:18.410
<v Speaker 1>like cholesterol and fans and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important.</v>

819
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when people get on ketogenetic</v>

820
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.193
<v Speaker 1>diets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the more interesting things that </v>

821
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:22.844
<v Speaker 1>happens when they consume a large amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fats and saturated fats and </v>

822
00:34:25.491 --> 00:34:30.491
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol is that their testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes way up to high cholesterol diet.</v>

823
00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't.</v>

824
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily know if those guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>have high testosterone.</v>

825
00:34:35.301 --> 00:34:38.240
<v Speaker 1>What they do have is high endurance </v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance is through the roof,</v>

826
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.940
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of that is because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in triathlons,</v>

827
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:42.830
<v Speaker 1>a lot of endurance running endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming,</v>

828
00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Speaker 1>biking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>

829
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:48.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still have to have the brain thought</v>

830
00:34:48.981 --> 00:34:50.490
<v Speaker 1>to go kick someone's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

831
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.240
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that Ronda Rousey </v>
<v Speaker 1>has that brain thought to.</v>

832
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.850
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have any testosterone but </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes.</v>

833
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.720
<v Speaker 1>She has some but not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

834
00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.800
<v Speaker 1>But more than other girls have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not more than about Cyborg.</v>

835
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a little different.</v>

836
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Well see that's the argument for </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids right there.</v>

837
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the argument because she actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been caught,</v>

838
00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.280
<v Speaker 1>but she's actually tested positive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's passionate test now,</v>

839
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:11.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

840
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:12.674
<v Speaker 1>But you know as well as I do that when a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman takes male hormones for a long </v>

841
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.160
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they get off of them,</v>

842
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.730
<v Speaker 1>there's benefits that they keep forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with men.</v>

843
00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just because you're passing the drug</v>

844
00:35:25.011 --> 00:35:26.570
<v Speaker 1>test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't say who,</v>

845
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:29.060
<v Speaker 1>but I trained the top international shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>putter.</v>

846
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.670
<v Speaker 1>He could go off and apart and eight days</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass a drug test,</v>

847
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.980
<v Speaker 1>IOC said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say say that's it.</v>

848
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:34.993
<v Speaker 1>It's only eight days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get onto the Nana par se </v>

849
00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 1>antibodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the quickest ones to get</v>

850
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.430
<v Speaker 3>off of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

851
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean you.</v>

852
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean how I forget to take stuff for </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight days.</v>

853
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.440
<v Speaker 4>So the benefits unquestionably are </v>
<v Speaker 4>permanent or at least some of them are.</v>

854
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.680
<v Speaker 3>What I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

855
00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:51.514
<v Speaker 3>what you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at a fight and career as </v>

856
00:35:52.991 --> 00:35:56.410
<v Speaker 3>you see it in an envelope and then when </v>
<v Speaker 3>that day that tough part retires,</v>

857
00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.273
<v Speaker 3>you forget about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what about the years later after a </v>

858
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.410
<v Speaker 3>fighter's career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he was on antibiotics,</v>

859
00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.850
<v Speaker 3>he would survive the fighting years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to continue with his older years</v>

860
00:36:06.851 --> 00:36:07.684
<v Speaker 3>like me.</v>

861
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.260
<v Speaker 4>So what you're saying is that listening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

862
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:15.440
<v Speaker 4>longevity post career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally understand that.</v>

863
00:36:15.441 --> 00:36:18.230
<v Speaker 4>A lot of fighters believed that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like testosterone replacement,</v>

864
00:36:18.231 --> 00:36:21.470
<v Speaker 4>growth hormone therapy for guys who have</v>
<v Speaker 4>retired,</v>

865
00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.453
<v Speaker 4>but while they're competing themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to do anything because </v>

866
00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:25.724
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to think that the reason</v>
<v Speaker 4>why they accomplish those goals because </v>

867
00:36:27.591 --> 00:36:28.424
<v Speaker 4>they were taking drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could shoot tons of Roy and so much </v>

868
00:36:31.851 --> 00:36:35.630
<v Speaker 4>that I think will make them kick my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not gonna make them kick their ass,</v>

869
00:36:35.631 --> 00:36:36.464
<v Speaker 4>but there's no question that some </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters fight better when they're </v>

870
00:36:38.901 --> 00:36:42.200
<v Speaker 4>taking steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about just a nutritionist?</v>

871
00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.200
<v Speaker 4>Let's just cut out the nutritionist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

872
00:36:45.201 --> 00:36:46.580
<v Speaker 4>but the nutritionist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

873
00:36:46.581 --> 00:36:48.290
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows how to eat healthy.</v>

874
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.393
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're eating healthy and you're </v>

875
00:36:50.301 --> 00:36:51.134
<v Speaker 4>training hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one guy's taking steroids and one </v>

876
00:36:53.271 --> 00:36:54.104
<v Speaker 4>guy's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a giant advantage with the guy </v>

877
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.033
<v Speaker 4>was taking steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just know too many people take </v>

878
00:36:57.741 --> 00:37:00.440
<v Speaker 4>steroids and then the passenger test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all I'm trying to say.</v>

879
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.000
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that bring up any names.</v>

880
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.863
<v Speaker 4>I understand and I know you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's one of the reasons why the </v>

881
00:37:05.721 --> 00:37:08.810
<v Speaker 4>UFC is instituted this incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>invasive.</v>

882
00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:12.260
<v Speaker 4>You sought a policy where they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>wake you up at 6:30 in the morning.</v>

883
00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:13.550
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how'd you like that?</v>

884
00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.250
<v Speaker 4>Watching piss in a cup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it exactly,</v>

885
00:37:16.251 --> 00:37:17.960
<v Speaker 4>but that's the only way to catch people.</v>

886
00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never go into a drug test.</v>

887
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had drug tests intro.</v>

888
00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.700
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a good argument there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

889
00:37:27.701 --> 00:37:29.500
<v Speaker 4>it's a good argument for baseball </v>
<v Speaker 4>because baseball,</v>

890
00:37:29.501 --> 00:37:30.334
<v Speaker 4>no one's getting hurt in the NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could make the argument that you're </v>

891
00:37:33.221 --> 00:37:34.054
<v Speaker 4>able to hurt guys more and then that </v>
<v Speaker 4>damages them and it shortens their </v>

892
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:37.504
<v Speaker 4>career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

893
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.640
<v Speaker 4>But baseball does no argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion.</v>

894
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.750
<v Speaker 4>Baseball's boring as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if,</v>

895
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean some people like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it,</v>

896
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.093
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm saying is like if you got a</v>
<v Speaker 4>drug that lets you hit more balls over </v>

897
00:37:48.731 --> 00:37:50.140
<v Speaker 4>the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take that.</v>

898
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.970
<v Speaker 4>That's the only thing interesting about.</v>

899
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.730
<v Speaker 3>So how do you let that sport get away </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it?</v>

900
00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.780
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not make it legal for all,</v>

901
00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like baseball's a funny thing.</v>

902
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you hit less than 50 home runs,</v>

903
00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:03.384
<v Speaker 3>I guess your drug free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you start hitting 51 year old roy </v>

904
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.050
<v Speaker 3>dry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like as what this core.</v>

905
00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:07.923
<v Speaker 3>And he talked about the base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the steroid here [inaudible] we're </v>

906
00:38:09.911 --> 00:38:12.960
<v Speaker 3>taking a drug to 19 sixties who they </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying the kid where they.</v>

907
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in St Louis,</v>

908
00:38:14.261 --> 00:38:15.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a football team.</v>

909
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.781
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

910
00:38:16.781 --> 00:38:17.880
<v Speaker 3>the raiders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

911
00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.650
<v Speaker 3>I've heard stories where I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>documented on espn.</v>

912
00:38:20.651 --> 00:38:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Never gone in and had the ball tabs on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the training table.</v>

913
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

914
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.320
<v Speaker 3>you know what I say to the raiders or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the baseball team,</v>

915
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:30.820
<v Speaker 3>the oral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

916
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.670
<v Speaker 3>the aes athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was like,</v>

917
00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.533
<v Speaker 3>if they're in the same town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sign these 200 and sexual </v>

918
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.680
<v Speaker 3>wondergirls room section about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls.</v>

919
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:40.693
<v Speaker 3>What if no one has it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They knew football players were taking </v>

920
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:49.900
<v Speaker 3>it in in Oakland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why wasn't,</v>

921
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.900
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't the baseball player if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken it right down the street.</v>

922
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:56.900
<v Speaker 4>The other problem was what do you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people were thinking of steroids as</v>

923
00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:57.890
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

924
00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.410
<v Speaker 4>like that kind of power being a crucial </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspect of baseball.</v>

925
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.790
<v Speaker 3>But I think what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

926
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.870
<v Speaker 3>But baseball is more of a skill game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think?</v>

927
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Did anyone ever tests Mickey Mantle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roger Maris,</v>

928
00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Hank Aaron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think Hank Aaron was doing steroids.</v>

929
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.500
<v Speaker 3>They had steroids back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shirts 19,</v>

930
00:39:12.501 --> 00:39:13.334
<v Speaker 3>39.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But where people were athletes taking </v>

931
00:39:15.081 --> 00:39:15.914
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

932
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

933
00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.240
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the football team was taking it.</v>

934
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:21.223
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't a principal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll get these fortunate result </v>

935
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:24.201
<v Speaker 3>geeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyhow,</v>

936
00:39:24.201 --> 00:39:25.820
<v Speaker 3>they interviewed the goddamn thing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>her life,</v>

937
00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.193
<v Speaker 3>but they're also a hypocritical and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>got these ideas and they're popping on </v>

938
00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.200
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably taken a,</v>

939
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a testosterone therapy as it is.</v>

940
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:38.660
<v Speaker 3>I was that apparently one time and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors are big fat guy and he's talking</v>

941
00:39:38.661 --> 00:39:42.080
<v Speaker 3>about how bad boy josh does listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and then like for instance,</v>

942
00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:43.220
<v Speaker 3>what's a patch on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

943
00:39:43.221 --> 00:39:44.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a testosterone patch.</v>

944
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:50.690
<v Speaker 3>What kind of thinking is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a true story.</v>

945
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.160
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of hypocritical.</v>

946
00:39:52.161 --> 00:39:54.020
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it comes to that stuff for sure.</v>

947
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:55.100
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

948
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:55.933
<v Speaker 4>it's an interesting debate and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people think that you should be able to </v>

949
00:39:58.521 --> 00:39:59.354
<v Speaker 4>do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the pride days during the pride </v>

950
00:40:02.271 --> 00:40:04.520
<v Speaker 4>days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which in my opinion are some of the most</v>

951
00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.790
<v Speaker 4>exciting all time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed martial arts fights.</v>

952
00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:08.893
<v Speaker 4>Those guys did whatever the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted and the Japanese literally told </v>

953
00:40:12.501 --> 00:40:15.770
<v Speaker 4>them like in their contract we will not </v>
<v Speaker 4>test you for steroids.</v>

954
00:40:15.771 --> 00:40:16.670
<v Speaker 4>They told them that</v>

955
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:21.040
<v Speaker 3>hell at horse racing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dog Racing.</v>

956
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But everybody that's okay.</v>

957
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.550
<v Speaker 3>And he just worry about that.</v>

958
00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>echo poise,</v>

959
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:30.020
<v Speaker 4>poise is equity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got a horse in the fucking title.</v>

960
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:30.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

961
00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.280
<v Speaker 4>and that's something that people take </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's a hormone for steroids,</v>

962
00:40:34.281 --> 00:40:36.590
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for horses now.</v>

963
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:40.810
<v Speaker 4>So you don't think there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative with.</v>

964
00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.730
<v Speaker 4>There's obviously got to be some </v>
<v Speaker 4>drawbacks of steroids,</v>

965
00:40:43.731 --> 00:40:44.564
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

966
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:50.130
<v Speaker 3>I went on antibiotics 19 January 1970,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1970,</v>

967
00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.420
<v Speaker 3>1970.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

968
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.000
<v Speaker 3>so what was this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two Thousand 16?</v>

969
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never been off.</v>

970
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.480
<v Speaker 4>You never been off in 46 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

971
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.640
<v Speaker 4>Just stay on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try no cycle in that.</v>

972
00:41:03.641 --> 00:41:08.070
<v Speaker 4>Go off to tell everybody you're off.</v>

973
00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:12.320
<v Speaker 3>I get sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go out there and tell the truth.</v>

974
00:41:12.321 --> 00:41:15.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't lie to people get upset at you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're so honest about it.</v>

975
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a damn of the upset of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course,</v>

976
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:18.223
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just curious if you ever come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the council of self respect and I </v>

977
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.720
<v Speaker 3>give him hell about these geeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing crap.</v>

978
00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.093
<v Speaker 3>They suck when they were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They suck when you're middle age and </v>

979
00:41:26.801 --> 00:41:27.640
<v Speaker 3>they suck when you're old.</v>

980
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.120
<v Speaker 3>That's how I look at our day in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be on Roy John Little country road.</v>

981
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:38.963
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be putting our world </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be in shape us in the day if </v>

982
00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:44.840
<v Speaker 3>they had some nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they had not stayed,</v>

983
00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't need steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

984
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:50.861
<v Speaker 3>Because then let's say some aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some aggression.</v>

985
00:41:51.111 --> 00:41:51.944
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my friend was a psychologist and he </v>

986
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:56.960
<v Speaker 3>would test people in prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rapists and murderers.</v>

987
00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:57.794
<v Speaker 3>He said he had tested some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had 25 times the rate testosterone's </v>

988
00:42:01.121 --> 00:42:05.540
<v Speaker 3>normal man does 25 one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I say,</v>

989
00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even possible.</v>

990
00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:08.283
<v Speaker 3>Well why are they out there raping </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and why they killing people with </v>

991
00:42:10.881 --> 00:42:11.714
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no remorse because he got an enormous </v>

992
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:15.890
<v Speaker 3>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that he saw.</v>

993
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 3>That's why they probably did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't,</v>

994
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can't do that stuff,</v>

995
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:21.704
<v Speaker 3>he realized that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he thought that's why they will be </v>

996
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:24.440
<v Speaker 3>on a course to do stuff like that.</v>

997
00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 3>It was just absolutely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take a look at elephant.</v>

998
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:29.600
<v Speaker 3>These elephants a well they call it when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

999
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 3>It just ease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll test house on route,</v>

1000
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 3>killing each other and knock it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Villagers and everything.</v>

1001
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:36.270
<v Speaker 3>So the world needs more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1002
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it needs more because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the.</v>

1003
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid,</v>

1004
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 3>just 10 percent gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they say there's 34,</v>

1005
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.360
<v Speaker 3>34 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four percent fluxes that.</v>

1006
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:48.760
<v Speaker 3>But college is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it.</v>

1007
00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Boy Bands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no ways.</v>

1008
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Thirty four percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four percent.</v>

1009
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1010
00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm sure some would test out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrific.</v>

1011
00:42:59.841 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 3>I look at Jeffrey Dahmer and he's out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there killing people.</v>

1012
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:03.843
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was gay too.</v>

1013
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:04.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1014
00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.093
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think that's a </v>

1015
00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 3>testosterone thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1016
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:11.000
<v Speaker 3>That's a sociopath psychopath thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

1017
00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.500
<v Speaker 3>I will say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1018
00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:13.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

1019
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about the gay part.</v>

1020
00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.850
<v Speaker 3>The other part we're eating people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.140
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that.</v>

1022
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:21.223
<v Speaker 3>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not a good argument for </v>

1023
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:25.400
<v Speaker 3>testosterone if you're seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoners and rapists and murderers have</v>

1024
00:43:25.401 --> 00:43:26.234
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everybody has got a lot of opinions </v>

1025
00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:30.380
<v Speaker 3>about Roy's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen probably a thousand people</v>

1026
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.810
<v Speaker 3>on Roy's over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1027
00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1028
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.231
<v Speaker 3>maybe more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1029
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:34.064
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones who took the most drugs were </v>

1030
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.000
<v Speaker 3>not always the strongest to strong guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't take that much and uh,</v>

1031
00:43:40.001 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1032
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.160
<v Speaker 3>and the lesser guys take a ton of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he just can't necessarily.</v>

1033
00:43:44.161 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 3>That's not what strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1034
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:49.790
<v Speaker 3>isn't there also a point of diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>returns where like taking too much of it</v>

1035
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:50.624

<v Speaker 1>bench press over 500 or the fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder to doctors.</v>

1150
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:32.383
<v Speaker 3>I did 24 reps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 pound dumbbells with 2,400 pound </v>

1151
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:36.930
<v Speaker 3>dumbbells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1152
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:39.660
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the mind.</v>

1153
00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.350
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying it's all in the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1154
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.193
<v Speaker 3>there's a book a fighter's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember his name is called pain don't </v>

1155
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:46.590
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It don't matter to me.</v>

1156
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm so freaking used to paint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It don't matter,</v>

1157
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:53.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fake shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't mean are they,</v>

1158
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.170
<v Speaker 1>are you supposed to be able to lift that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of weight in a fake shoulder?</v>

1159
00:48:56.171 --> 00:48:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Like did doctors tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to go</v>

1160
00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.310
<v Speaker 3>back to training?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had it done by the doctor.</v>

1161
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:01.203
<v Speaker 3>His name is Dr Bianchi was the Cleveland</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown searching at the time and he </v>

1162
00:49:04.601 --> 00:49:07.270
<v Speaker 3>basically gave me no instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left the hospital that day,</v>

1163
00:49:07.271 --> 00:49:08.104
<v Speaker 3>I recovery and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never I did my own therapy to give you </v>

1164
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:14.110
<v Speaker 3>no instructions already knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He literally,</v>

1165
00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:15.123
<v Speaker 3>it was new at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kind of wanted to see if it would </v>

1166
00:49:17.681 --> 00:49:19.170
<v Speaker 3>hold up my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1167
00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.580
<v Speaker 3>my buddy march was a strength coach with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the browns.</v>

1168
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.100
<v Speaker 3>He said this guy is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1169
00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:25.523
<v Speaker 3>so he wanted to find out this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>would hold up and it must have held up </v>

1170
00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:29.320
<v Speaker 3>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1171
00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:30.960
<v Speaker 3>and it's still okay now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1172
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Score and you see this,</v>

1173
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.020
<v Speaker 3>you don't believe me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1174
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:36.080
<v Speaker 3>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>PCB did stuff.</v>

1176
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.970
<v Speaker 3>And so when you got your soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder replacement,</v>

1177
00:49:42.971 --> 00:49:44.620
<v Speaker 3>how long did you wait before you started</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting?</v>

1178
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Heavy benching?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started pinching in one week,</v>

1179
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.430
<v Speaker 3>started to branch to come one week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

1180
00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.850
<v Speaker 3>How much will you benching one week?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a broomstick,</v>

1181
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.013
<v Speaker 3>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1182
00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 3>in three months I benched 300.</v>

1183
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.900
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1184
00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that case,</v>

1185
00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I got to think steroids helped your </v>
<v Speaker 1>recovery.</v>

1186
00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1187
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:07.950
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the best things for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1188
00:50:07.951 --> 00:50:08.784
<v Speaker 1>Is recovering for injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the best argument is </v>

1189
00:50:10.441 --> 00:50:14.140
<v Speaker 1>send it to athletes and nuts too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't sit around the doctor.</v>

1190
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Take him for eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

1191
00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't go to doctors out of being a leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a quacks.</v>

1192
00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Surgeons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they know.</v>

1193
00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't know nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were experts on everything.</v>

1194
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.050
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know this Dr.</v>

1195
00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:33.970
<v Speaker 4>well that's one of the best arguments </v>
<v Speaker 4>for steroids is post-injury recovery,</v>

1196
00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:35.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was for.</v>

1197
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.910
<v Speaker 4>It was for concentration camp victims in</v>
<v Speaker 4>World War II.</v>

1198
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:43.030
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen 39 antibiotics came up for </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentration camp.</v>

1199
00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.850
<v Speaker 4>They tried them to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People come out of concentration camp,</v>

1200
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.800
<v Speaker 4>prisoner of war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they make.</v>

1201
00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Antibody was first thing they made him </v>
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>

1202
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.600
<v Speaker 4>Well it's really good for people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are wasting diseases.</v>

1203
00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.113
<v Speaker 4>Same thing if you're in the prison of </v>
<v Speaker 4>war camp and give you some sort of </v>

1204
00:50:56.081 --> 00:50:57.260
<v Speaker 4>vitality back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1205
00:50:57.490 --> 00:50:58.323
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when when you see guys that get </v>

1206
00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:04.870
<v Speaker 4>injured and you see them try to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>things without steroids,</v>

1207
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:07.150
<v Speaker 4>like especially injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like injury recovery,</v>

1208
00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.013
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of the best arguments</v>
<v Speaker 4>that like maybe when an athlete blows </v>

1209
00:51:11.591 --> 00:51:13.150
<v Speaker 4>his knee out or something like that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>get surgery,</v>

1210
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:14.890
<v Speaker 4>they really should be allowed to use </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1211
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Do you think are in America professional</v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes?</v>

1212
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:20.900
<v Speaker 3>All tone was in her at least 100 times </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

1213
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:25.610
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple million older men </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking testosterone replacement.</v>

1214
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:28.590
<v Speaker 3>So that's my art met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you not let an athlete?</v>

1215
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:32.290
<v Speaker 3>What is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I just said,</v>

1216
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:33.820
<v Speaker 3>but I don't care if you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want to take,</v>

1217
00:51:33.821 --> 00:51:37.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine with me a damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't wanna eat a protein shake.</v>

1218
00:51:37.341 --> 00:51:38.690
<v Speaker 3>You don't eat right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

1219
00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.770
<v Speaker 4>Well when it comes to eating right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what kind of.</v>

1220
00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.810
<v Speaker 4>What kind of Diet do you subscribe?</v>

1221
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I really don't describe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat eggs and meat in the morning and I</v>

1222
00:51:50.621 --> 00:51:52.040
<v Speaker 3>ate pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1223
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.160
<v Speaker 3>A lot of chicken and rice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not entered a good food.</v>

1224
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:57.590
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people real clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have no aggression,</v>

1225
00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:00.970
<v Speaker 3>so like a lot of bodybuilders super </v>
<v Speaker 3>clean.</v>

1226
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.290
<v Speaker 3>It seems like I have no aggression and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1227
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:07.100
<v Speaker 3>if you're like what I outside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing punches or kicks,</v>

1228
00:52:07.101 --> 00:52:08.150
<v Speaker 3>it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fight.</v>

1229
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:11.480
<v Speaker 3>You gotta fight these big white jeep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys stay on Dad,</v>

1230
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.420
<v Speaker 3>you gotta lift it and then you got to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it over and over and over.</v>

1231
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.273
<v Speaker 3>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1232
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:18.050
<v Speaker 4>11,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 to aggression now.</v>

1233
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.540
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that that's the lack of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol in the Diet?</v>

1234
00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:21.680
<v Speaker 4>Lack of fat?</v>

1235
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:24.470
<v Speaker 3>It may be because I've just seen them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1236
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been around too many people.</v>

1237
00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:28.604
<v Speaker 3>Bodybuilder also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were the one that had the side </v>

1238
00:52:30.111 --> 00:52:31.600
<v Speaker 3>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd get around.</v>

1239
00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.700
<v Speaker 3>They of the guys that have no facial </v>
<v Speaker 3>hair and uh,</v>

1240
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or nobody here.</v>

1241
00:52:36.081 --> 00:52:36.914
<v Speaker 3>It seems like those were the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've noticed over the years and has no </v>

1242
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:40.034
<v Speaker 3>side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of drugs will give them </v>

1243
00:52:41.601 --> 00:52:43.970
<v Speaker 3>side effects and other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1244
00:52:43.971 --> 00:52:46.590
<v Speaker 3>you always talk about taking stuff for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come out.</v>

1245
00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 3>I've never taken anything like God darn </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1246
00:52:48.411 --> 00:52:52.070
<v Speaker 3>I've never needed anything for Gyno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for one made a real tough looking guy.</v>

1247
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:52.993
<v Speaker 3>He'd never had any problem taking raw </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're already got </v>

1248
00:52:54.441 --> 00:52:56.360
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a.</v>

1249
00:52:56.361 --> 00:53:00.480
<v Speaker 3>it's not something new to their system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but guys get guy.</v>

1250
00:53:00.481 --> 00:53:01.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just because they have a ridiculous</v>

1251
00:53:01.971 --> 00:53:04.190
<v Speaker 3>amount of testosterone in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starts producing estrogen,</v>

1252
00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:06.980
<v Speaker 3>high estrogen anyhow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1253
00:53:06.981 --> 00:53:08.750
<v Speaker 3>so you think it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1254
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Because I've seen guys with big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thick beard,</v>

1255
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.510
<v Speaker 3>rough kind of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have no problem.</v>

1260
00:53:24.331 --> 00:53:25.164

<v Speaker 3>the guys that get whacked out on drugs </v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm not Finland,</v>

1263
00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Finland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but almost kind of</v>

1264
00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.573
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the person who doesn't power lift </v>

1265
00:53:36.771 --> 00:53:38.720
<v Speaker 4>or people are unaware of the sport and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1266
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.633
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think of a bodybuilder doing the </v>

1267
00:53:41.241 --> 00:53:42.950
<v Speaker 4>same kind of things that have gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you would do,</v>

1268
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.810
<v Speaker 4>that's what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1269
00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.213
<v Speaker 4>But that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the big difference between </v>

1270
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.983
<v Speaker 4>bodybuilders?</v>

1271
00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 3>There's a high purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high reputations in the eat different.</v>

1272
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.033
<v Speaker 3>They take other things different to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>very big and then we don't want to get </v>

1273
00:53:59.121 --> 00:53:59.954
<v Speaker 3>big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just like,</v>

1274
00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.793
<v Speaker 3>we wanted to stay in the smallest weight</v>
<v Speaker 3>class we can and get as strong as it </v>

1275
00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:04.280
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same big Ang strong,</v>

1276
00:54:04.281 --> 00:54:05.114
<v Speaker 3>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong.</v>

1277
00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:06.643
<v Speaker 3>So we just want to be strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everything we do is not to build </v>

1278
00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.540
<v Speaker 3>larger muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've worked with track people,</v>

1279
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:12.523
<v Speaker 3>mostly girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to put 10 pounds of </v>

1280
00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:16.660
<v Speaker 3>bodyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost 10 pounds of extra weight that it</v>

1281
00:54:16.661 --> 00:54:18.410
<v Speaker 3>had to overcome gravity rundown down </v>
<v Speaker 3>track.</v>

1282
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:19.303
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we keep keep your body weight to a </v>

1283
00:54:21.021 --> 00:54:23.270
<v Speaker 3>minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The muscle mass,</v>

1284
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:24.283
<v Speaker 3>we just want to make it strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to get bigger to be </v>

1285
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.180
<v Speaker 3>stolen.</v>

1286
00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:27.013
<v Speaker 4>That's confusing to a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of people think of big </v>

1287
00:54:29.061 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 4>muscles meaning stronger and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>only way to get stronger.</v>

1288
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:34.720
<v Speaker 4>But I've seen some people in power </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifting competitions.</v>

1289
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:37.870
<v Speaker 4>It just lift insane amounts of weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're not that big trunk.</v>

1290
00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:39.380
<v Speaker 4>Well how is that possible?</v>

1291
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.690
<v Speaker 3>But muscle type,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1292
00:54:40.691 --> 00:54:43.870
<v Speaker 3>you're always talking about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always mentioned you a few times.</v>

1293
00:54:43.871 --> 00:54:46.780
<v Speaker 3>You talk about like a wooly and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my muscular.</v>

1294
00:54:46.781 --> 00:54:48.670
<v Speaker 3>He runs out of gas real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>

1295
00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.590
<v Speaker 3>Tyrone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyron Woodley.</v>

1296
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has the same.</v>

1297
00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Got a pretty pretty much the same amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of muscle mass.</v>

1298
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.310
<v Speaker 3>He just has very fast twitch muscle guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1299
00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.213
<v Speaker 3>you're not about to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Endurance may have board slow twitch </v>

1300
00:55:00.971 --> 00:55:01.804
<v Speaker 3>muscle and then so that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why he can fight five rounds and </v>

1301
00:55:04.631 --> 00:55:07.450
<v Speaker 3>tyrone were to start to wear out </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the second round.</v>

1302
00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.653
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also because a guy like tyron is </v>

1303
00:55:10.131 --> 00:55:15.131
<v Speaker 4>capable of putting out so much energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the way he can attack guys and move</v>

1304
00:55:15.321 --> 00:55:19.190
<v Speaker 4>so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like having a 500 horsepower engine</v>

1305
00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.530
<v Speaker 4>versus having a 400 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One's going to just use.</v>

1306
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well just fashion.</v>

1307
00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:27.930
<v Speaker 3>She got sprinters and marathon runners </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it looked totally different.</v>

1308
00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:29.383
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so when someone looks at a </v>

1309
00:55:30.741 --> 00:55:33.140
<v Speaker 4>bodybuilder and they see this guy just </v>
<v Speaker 4>covered in muscles,</v>

1310
00:55:33.141 --> 00:55:36.010
<v Speaker 4>they assume that guy will be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lift a ton of weights,</v>

1311
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.770
<v Speaker 4>but for the most part those guys can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>live nearly as much weight as a garlic.</v>

1312
00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:43.550
<v Speaker 4>You can know that that's crazy to people</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that doesn't even make sense.</v>

1313
00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of things are crazy.</v>

1314
00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:49.620
<v Speaker 3>People do don't aren't in and know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're mentioning.</v>

1315
00:55:49.621 --> 00:55:50.454
<v Speaker 3>What about the anabolic stimulus?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it frustrate you that this lack of </v>

1316
00:55:55.541 --> 00:55:58.480
<v Speaker 3>understanding the general public has </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this stuff?</v>

1317
00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo you ever.</v>

1318
00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:04.540
<v Speaker 3>You ever look at the Olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We look at our weight lifters,</v>

1319
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.370
<v Speaker 3>Olympic weight lifters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't go to the Olympics.</v>

1320
00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.680
<v Speaker 3>We never did hope to never get any </v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympic.</v>

1321
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Never tend to worsen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if there's ever been.</v>

1322
00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:13.030
<v Speaker 3>They said our Olympic weight lifting </v>
<v Speaker 3>team is pretty bad.</v>

1323
00:56:13.031 --> 00:56:15.180
<v Speaker 3>We can't get the guy on the 18th.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1324
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.253
<v Speaker 3>and they're just not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at our women's gymnastics </v>

1325
00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.950
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're extremely strong.</v>

1326
00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Ain't a blurb out of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Go China.</v>

<v Speaker 3>archery ministry muscular and they </v>

1328
00:56:27.341 --> 00:56:28.174
<v Speaker 3>killed everybody that your gym's look </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathetic these because they're all in </v>

1329
00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:31.820
<v Speaker 3>different systems.</v>

1330
00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:32.653
<v Speaker 3>She didn't know who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got better coaches and and better </v>

1331
00:56:35.051 --> 00:56:39.670
<v Speaker 3>systems that take stuff so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>American doesn't have good Olympic power</v>

1332
00:56:39.671 --> 00:56:41.390
<v Speaker 3>lifters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympic weight lifters,</v>

1333
00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:42.323
<v Speaker 3>lifters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We rule the world power of Jews in this </v>

1334
00:56:44.051 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>American witnesses are not very good.</v>

1335
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.100
<v Speaker 3>They're not know terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1336
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:49.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not know that.</v>

1337
00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:54.070
<v Speaker 3>There was one girl what got a bronzy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympic one girl got a bronze.</v>

1338
00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.770
<v Speaker 3>We in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my sport,</v>

1339
00:56:55.771 --> 00:56:57.530
<v Speaker 3>there's 12 male way classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1340
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:58.483
<v Speaker 3>we hold seven of the total records my </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim Holtz to and in women there's 10 </v>

1341
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:03.094
<v Speaker 3>week classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>America holds nine of the 10 and my Jim </v>

1342
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:06.214
<v Speaker 3>holds five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the strongest male power lifter </v>

1343
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.940
<v Speaker 3>ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Period.</v>

1344
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.060
<v Speaker 3>And the best and the strongest female it</v>
<v Speaker 3>will bury St Jim.</v>

1345
00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Now what about shit like those strongest</v>
<v Speaker 3>men contests?</v>

1346
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well her strongest guys.</v>

1347
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:20.770
<v Speaker 3>But that's a different thing entirely as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1348
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.980
<v Speaker 3>It's another defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like boxing is different than intimate.</v>

1349
00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More,</v>

1350
00:57:25.361 --> 00:57:27.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more ties different in boxing.</v>

1351
00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:28.024
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never said I'm going to say it in a </v>

1352
00:57:29.981 --> 00:57:30.814
<v Speaker 3>more Thai guy that's going to win a </v>
<v Speaker 3>world boxing championship and vice </v>

1353
00:57:33.731 --> 00:57:35.650
<v Speaker 3>versa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it has</v>

1354
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:40.670
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ty was what the fuck is his name?</v>

1355
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a kid though.</v>

1356
00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:42.613
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gold medal is thought Thailand </v>

1357
00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:46.840
<v Speaker 1>packet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you shouldn't have your key.</v>

1358
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Might've been a one time champions on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1359
00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Algieri.</v>

1360
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a kickboxing champion.</v>

1361
00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Time to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the fuck is his name?</v>

1362
00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was the guy that.</v>

1363
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:05.300
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that John Claude van Damme </v>
<v Speaker 1>was always supposed to fight.</v>

1364
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.550
<v Speaker 1>John Claude van Damme pretends is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a fight.</v>

1365
00:58:07.551 --> 00:58:11.160
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have a kickboxing fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this is Thai guy and.</v>

1366
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:14.750
<v Speaker 1>But that guy won a world title as a boy </v>
<v Speaker 1>tie fighter and as a boxer.</v>

1367
00:58:14.751 --> 00:58:17.090
<v Speaker 1>But that's pretty rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I agree with you,</v>

1368
00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.370
<v Speaker 1>but now like what would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference?</v>

1369
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:22.520
<v Speaker 1>See like if you see like if you had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy come to you that wanted to win,</v>

1370
00:58:22.521 --> 00:58:23.354
<v Speaker 1>like a strongest man competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like something that will be </v>

1371
00:58:25.671 --> 00:58:26.504
<v Speaker 1>right up your alley because you're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at preparing fighters and </v>

1372
00:58:29.031 --> 00:58:31.520
<v Speaker 1>understanding the different demands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different sports.</v>

1373
00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:32.723
<v Speaker 3>My friend in Finland's name Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got poor guys in that gym over 900 </v>

1374
00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 3>and they're all strong man and he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He trains of Straw man.</v>

1375
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into that,</v>

1376
00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:47.240
<v Speaker 3>but he told Tom and I had one thing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>each sprint with barrels,</v>

1377
00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:49.383
<v Speaker 3>thousand pounds on willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do a lot of willpower work and also </v>

1378
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.610
<v Speaker 3>to carry heavy yoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's two of the primary.</v>

1379
00:58:53.611 --> 00:58:55.020
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get them to be strong men.</v>

1380
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.090
<v Speaker 3>What's a yoke?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Yoga thing,</v>

1381
00:58:57.091 --> 00:58:58.500
<v Speaker 3>putting me back in your walk around with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1382
00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Like if you walk around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do an enormous amount of walking with</v>

1383
00:59:02.341 --> 00:59:04.860
<v Speaker 3>bars with a badge and change hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

1384
00:59:04.861 --> 00:59:07.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's unstable because that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be.</v>

1385
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:09.930
<v Speaker 3>You got to be stable and unstable </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1386
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.090
<v Speaker 3>So they walk a half a mile of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1387
00:59:12.091 --> 00:59:13.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets his strong.</v>

1388
00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:14.473
<v Speaker 1>Is that why you like wheelbarrows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's almost like a dead lift </v>

1389
00:59:16.221 --> 00:59:17.054
<v Speaker 1>that you've got to kind of walk with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm going to price you will get </v>

1390
00:59:20.151 --> 00:59:20.984
<v Speaker 1>more type fired at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doj thought that really helped us up is </v>

1391
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:24.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is plum colored clinch.</v>

1392
00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

1393
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:27.223
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so did you come up with the idea of </v>

1394
00:59:29.931 --> 00:59:34.931
<v Speaker 1>using wheelbarrows for nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1990 and it's just something that looked</v>

1395
00:59:35.241 --> 00:59:39.550
<v Speaker 1>to you like a good unstable platform </v>
<v Speaker 1>that builds up your ministry ministry,</v>

1396
00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:41.930
<v Speaker 1>building up your back and grip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1397
00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:43.410
<v Speaker 1>you've got to have a grip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1398
00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys got great grips anyhow,</v>

1399
00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:49.910
<v Speaker 1>but it builds up grip and it builds up </v>
<v Speaker 1>all your muscles and your walking.</v>

1400
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:51.290
<v Speaker 1>See My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1401
00:59:51.291 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys do strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>

1402
00:59:53.151 --> 00:59:53.984
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's got to be combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that much time because </v>

1403
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:58.670
<v Speaker 1>fighting is a treatment and skill.</v>

1404
00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 1>You need all your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the world's strongest man.</v>

1405
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:02.984
<v Speaker 1>Hate the damn the MMA champion now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe you got to strength and </v>

1406
01:00:05.991 --> 01:00:06.824
<v Speaker 1>conditioning st time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we do so much outside </v>

1407
01:00:08.391 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 1>walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing heavy objects walking.</v>

1408
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:14.270
<v Speaker 1>So we're conditioning and strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

1409
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you pay any attention to Marius </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]?</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1415
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't given up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing it for quite a long time</v>

1416
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>now and he's actually beaten so pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>good guys at this point.</v>

1417
01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:33.560
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out halls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gracie,</v>

1418
01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:35.540

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1419
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>he lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Silvia.</v>

1420
01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>But that's a fight that he never should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have taken.</v>

1421
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:39.643
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Silvia is big giant former UFC </v>

1422
01:00:42.081 --> 01:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight champion,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Tim's got like a lot of body fat on him.</v>

1424
01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.310
<v Speaker 1>He is not like the most gifted athlete </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like,</v>

1425
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:53.360
<v Speaker 1>like randleman is like a freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was when he was alive.</v>

1426
01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Recipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's a great guy.</v>

1427
01:00:54.871 --> 01:00:55.704
<v Speaker 1>I love Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was probably one of the biggest </v>

1428
01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.353
<v Speaker 1>natural genetic freaks I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim's not that Tim's just hard work and </v>

1429
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>dedication and just toughness and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat the fuck out of Mary's [inaudible].</v>

1430
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of funny when you see the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them together.</v>

1431
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I might've saw that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1432
01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:16.730
<v Speaker 1>he might've have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he started out.</v>

1433
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>He started out kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denise,</v>

1434
01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:21.200
<v Speaker 1>before we even went into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he kicked box when he was a kid,</v>

1435
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:22.360
<v Speaker 1>puts an asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he?</v>

1436
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was a boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxer,</v>

1437
01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:27.253
<v Speaker 1>boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1438
01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.213
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you not believe it when you see him </v>

1439
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>hit the pads and he was starting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1440
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost like,</v>

1441
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's weighing himself down,</v>

1442
01:01:37.821 --> 01:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>like throwing weights all over his body </v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to move himself.</v>

1443
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.563
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point being he's actually </v>

1444
01:01:43.731 --> 01:01:44.564
<v Speaker 1>transition is become a legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional mma fighter who's beaten </v>

1445
01:01:48.531 --> 01:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>some guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not.</v>

1446
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's not.</v>

1447
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:52.573
<v Speaker 1>No one's gonna say he's a threat to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC heavyweight title least at this </v>

1448
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:55.544
<v Speaker 1>point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting to me because he </v>

1449
01:01:57.541 --> 01:02:00.710
<v Speaker 1>still 300 plus pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still a massive,</v>

1450
01:02:00.711 --> 01:02:01.544
<v Speaker 1>massive guy and he's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these events are all places where I </v>

1451
01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>don't think they test them too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting too.</v>

1452
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:11.151
<v Speaker 1>Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sylvia,</v>

1453
01:02:11.151 --> 01:02:11.984
<v Speaker 1>when he was at his best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he won the title against Ricoh </v>

1454
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Rodriguez was on some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a.</v>

1455
01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>He looked so different back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't look like a</v>

1456
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:24.720
<v Speaker 4>doughy sort of heavy guy over his best </v>
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>

1457
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.300
<v Speaker 4>Ubereats?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.143
<v Speaker 4>When when overeem came to the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he fought brock lesnar and you </v>

1459
01:02:30.351 --> 01:02:31.184
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was kind of the wild west of testing </v>

1460
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:37.110
<v Speaker 4>back then all you had to do was pass the</v>
<v Speaker 4>post test.</v>

1461
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:38.550
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all you have to do.</v>

1462
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Which was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1463
01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.810
<v Speaker 4>like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you take an avant,</v>

1464
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:44.220
<v Speaker 4>they just get off it for eight days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're clean,</v>

1465
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:45.533
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the facts were obviously still </v>

1466
01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:48.294
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1467
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1468
01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:53.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean and has always been the drug of </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice for collegiate wrestlers,</v>

1469
01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way back years ago because the fact it </v>

1470
01:02:56.251 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 3>gets out of your system so quickly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he keeps your body weight down.</v>

1471
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:00.990
<v Speaker 3>You want the demurrage really </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilding,</v>

1472
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:06.950
<v Speaker 3>they take drugs that you know that on </v>
<v Speaker 3>low calorie diets he can maintain muscle</v>

1473
01:03:07.171 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 3>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He touched the Princeton I think was the</v>

1474
01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:12.690
<v Speaker 3>only one kind of antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't bodybuilder look like I do and</v>

1475
01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.533
<v Speaker 3>was part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know why they look different if </v>

1476
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:17.040
<v Speaker 3>we're taking the same drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it totally is totally different.</v>

1477
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:17.440
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1478
01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.260
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the orientations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally different.</v>

1479
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:22.510
<v Speaker 4>One of the big dirty secrets about Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 4>bodybuilders,</v>

1480
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:27.770
<v Speaker 4>like almost all Vegan bodybuilders are </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking something and the reason being is</v>

1481
01:03:27.821 --> 01:03:29.980
<v Speaker 4>because of the fact they're not getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough cholesterol,</v>

1482
01:03:29.981 --> 01:03:33.700
<v Speaker 4>they're not getting enough saturated fat</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their diet and so your body just does</v>

1483
01:03:33.701 --> 01:03:35.650
<v Speaker 4>not want to produce that kind of muscle </v>
<v Speaker 4>mass.</v>

1484
01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.753
<v Speaker 4>So those kind of guys are almost all </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking something in order to put that </v>

1485
01:03:39.911 --> 01:03:41.290
<v Speaker 4>kind of mass onto their body.</v>

1486
01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:45.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say we are trained to Olympic gold medal</v>

1487
01:03:45.921 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 3>spreaders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1488
01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:50.760
<v Speaker 3>I've trained all kinds of people and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you just been around power</v>

1489
01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:52.720
<v Speaker 3>lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone I know,</v>

1490
01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:54.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a rate like,</v>

1491
01:03:54.851 --> 01:03:56.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will get back to the drug tests.</v>

1492
01:03:56.681 --> 01:03:59.350
<v Speaker 3>You ever think about the Olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were records that the drug at the</v>

1493
01:03:59.351 --> 01:04:00.184
<v Speaker 3>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What records of her breaking world </v>

1494
01:04:02.801 --> 01:04:04.780
<v Speaker 3>records drug free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you need drug testing?</v>

1495
01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Maybe one of your callers calling me up </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me that one.</v>

1496
01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're passing the drug.</v>

1497
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:12.743
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they're also catching them from </v>

1498
01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:16.370
<v Speaker 4>previous years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you hear about the,</v>

1499
01:04:16.371 --> 01:04:17.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russians,</v>

1500
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:18.643
<v Speaker 4>those two guys from 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got their gold medals pulled from </v>

1501
01:04:21.231 --> 01:04:23.690
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just bullshit is bullshit.</v>

1502
01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.080
<v Speaker 4>It's bullshit because you think other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were doing it too,</v>

1503
01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.693
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Russia has a very sophisticated </v>

1504
01:04:31.251 --> 01:04:32.084
<v Speaker 4>anti-doping program in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Divergence now let's say that America I </v>

1505
01:04:37.101 --> 01:04:40.790
<v Speaker 4>don't think is so blatant about their </v>
<v Speaker 4>endorsement of drugs.</v>

1506
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:43.320
<v Speaker 4>I think America kind of knows about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1507
01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:46.180
<v Speaker 4>but they can't come out and say it or </v>
<v Speaker 4>come out and</v>

1508
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:49.500
<v Speaker 3>if you're overseas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pain just went to them.</v>

1509
01:04:49.501 --> 01:04:51.000
<v Speaker 3>What place you got?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care.</v>

1510
01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.630
<v Speaker 3>How do you don't think they care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1511
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.260
<v Speaker 3>Course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Overseas.</v>

1512
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:56.123
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

1513
01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's done by the state uses.</v>

1514
01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.433
<v Speaker 3>It's done by the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that what the problem was that </v>

1515
01:05:01.741 --> 01:05:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Russia was guilty because it was state </v>
<v Speaker 3>funded drug administration.</v>

1516
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do I mean?</v>

1517
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:08.300
<v Speaker 3>They're doing the same thing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Report.</v>

1518
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.273
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just that rush is killing the </v>

1519
01:05:10.151 --> 01:05:12.490
<v Speaker 4>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the scientists know about it.</v>

1520
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:13.463
<v Speaker 4>A good giant percentage of those guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>had been shot in the fucking heck we've </v>

1521
01:05:16.001 --> 01:05:17.680
<v Speaker 4>been reading about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1522
01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 4>they're dropping</v>

1523
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.360
<v Speaker 1>like flies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1524
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>all these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because once Russia got in trouble,</v>

1525
01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:22.414
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in danger of being eliminated </v>

1526
01:05:23.561 --> 01:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>from the Rio Olympic Games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know about that,</v>

1527
01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:27.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1528
01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:27.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1529
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1530
01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:29.524
<v Speaker 1>they allowed them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there was no way that they don't </v>

1531
01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>forget how many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple hundred Russians did not go.</v>

1532
01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know.</v>

1533
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a girl here in America,</v>

1534
01:05:37.761 --> 01:05:38.594
<v Speaker 1>it's a high jumper I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a pole vaulter which tested 33 times </v>

1535
01:05:41.861 --> 01:05:43.920
<v Speaker 1>in three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>

1536
01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>It's total bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had victor content on my podcast,</v>

1544
01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:09.994
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he was a guy that had developed </v>

1545
01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.290
<v Speaker 1>a designer steroid that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>undetectable,</v>

1546
01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:17.020
<v Speaker 1>which they still have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still have those,</v>

1547
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.620
<v Speaker 1>how they break and world records and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucking the drug test.</v>

1548
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:22.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born at night joe,</v>

1549
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.640
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't born last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1550
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1551
01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to believe that people are just,</v>

1552
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.400
<v Speaker 1>it's just hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And folks who,</v>

1553
01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:32.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in that,</v>

1554
01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:35.493
<v Speaker 1>do you think it would be better if </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody just came clean and everybody </v>

1555
01:06:37.631 --> 01:06:38.980
<v Speaker 1>just did whatever they wanted to do?</v>

1556
01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really did.</v>

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:44.180
<v Speaker 3>I think or know why is your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1558
01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.073
<v Speaker 3>Why possibly is your father on going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ancient clinic and taking </v>

1559
01:06:49.281 --> 01:06:52.280
<v Speaker 3>testosterone growth hormone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was that damn bad that you hit.</v>

1560
01:06:52.281 --> 01:06:55.910
<v Speaker 3>Your Dad wouldn't be going there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple million people I know.</v>

1561
01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:56.744
<v Speaker 3>You're just that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's probably over 2 million people </v>

1562
01:06:58.731 --> 01:07:01.040
<v Speaker 3>doing it annually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are they doing?</v>

1563
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly helps you.</v>

1564
01:07:03.861 --> 01:07:05.710
<v Speaker 1>It makes you and your brain function </v>
<v Speaker 1>every.</v>

1565
01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Everything's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

1566
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:08.980
<v Speaker 1>your drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your muscle,</v>

1567
01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>your muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got more muscle.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's my whole freaking problem.</v>

1571
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:20.390
<v Speaker 1>My brain's never changed since I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 16.</v>

1572
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.300
<v Speaker 1>So your brain's still functioned the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>

1573
01:07:23.301 --> 01:07:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of that</v>

1574

<v Speaker 3>face never get around a person.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I can do that.</v>

1578
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:39.290
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that's road rage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was when I was born.</v>

1580
01:07:40.591 --> 01:07:44.040
<v Speaker 3>I was that way when I was 10 years old </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm that way now.</v>

1581
01:07:44.041 --> 01:07:45.480
<v Speaker 3>I just teach sometime.</v>

<v Speaker 4>a lot of zest for life.</v>

1600
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:29.050

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:37.260
<v Speaker 4>You say I kinda weird too that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>go to like any kind of a nutrition store</v>

1604
01:08:37.261 --> 01:08:38.094
<v Speaker 4>vitamin store and this shelves are </v>
<v Speaker 4>filled with muscle builders and </v>

1605
01:08:41.911 --> 01:08:44.130
<v Speaker 4>recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This growth hormone,</v>

1606
01:08:44.131 --> 01:08:46.410
<v Speaker 4>that and fake test house rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1607
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:47.303
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of them turn out to be </v>

1608
01:08:48.301 --> 01:08:51.330
<v Speaker 4>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then he'd go to use against all.</v>

1609
01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.313
<v Speaker 4>Well it is against the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you sign it has a page and when we </v>

1610
01:08:54.871 --> 01:08:57.720
<v Speaker 4>had no Wicki on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is when I found out about this,</v>

1611
01:08:57.721 --> 01:09:00.720
<v Speaker 4>I was blown away because they have list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it like?</v>

1612
01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:01.583
<v Speaker 4>It was over a thousand more than a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand different products that have </v>

1613
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:09.420
<v Speaker 4>tesco have steroids in them that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are buying under the guise of just being</v>

1614
01:09:09.421 --> 01:09:10.254
<v Speaker 4>some natural muscle builder or you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's probably thousands of people </v>

1615
01:09:13.051 --> 01:09:15.660
<v Speaker 4>on here in America and city year against</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking drugs,</v>

1616
01:09:15.661 --> 01:09:17.300
<v Speaker 4>but you're taking drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1617
01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's certainly a lot of people that,</v>

1618
01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:20.971
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1619
01:09:20.971 --> 01:09:21.804
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that have taken </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs and they don't want to admit </v>

1620
01:09:23.881 --> 01:09:26.550
<v Speaker 4>they're taking drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people want a drug free America,</v>

1621
01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:27.503
<v Speaker 4>but they want to drink beer and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to drink coffee and they want to </v>

1622
01:09:30.121 --> 01:09:32.050
<v Speaker 4>smoke cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these things for trunks.</v>

1623
01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:33.273
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1624
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:34.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've said that you'll go to a football </v>

1625
01:09:35.661 --> 01:09:36.720
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a house steak.</v>

1626
01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.040
<v Speaker 3>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got 100,000 drunk take,</v>

1627
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and smoking cigarettes,</v>

1628
01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:44.100
<v Speaker 3>watching 22 athletes on the field that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are clean.</v>

1629
01:09:44.101 --> 01:09:45.020
<v Speaker 3>That didn't make any sense.</v>

1630
01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.513
<v Speaker 4>I can't drive him out the parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that leave even for high </v>

1631
01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:54.740
<v Speaker 4>school athletes that like steroids are a</v>
<v Speaker 4>good idea?</v>

1632
01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.600
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're able to vote you </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1633
01:09:58.601 --> 01:10:00.820
<v Speaker 3>build you anything you want at 18 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

1634
01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:01.810
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could drink,</v>

1635
01:10:01.811 --> 01:10:03.880
<v Speaker 3>why couldn't you take roids if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1636
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:05.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still believe it should be the draft.</v>

1637
01:10:05.621 --> 01:10:07.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what's wrong with America</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

1638
01:10:07.001 --> 01:10:07.834
<v Speaker 3>There's no draft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough people that have a </v>

1639
01:10:09.881 --> 01:10:13.000
<v Speaker 3>father figure in his country and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they went in the army,</v>

1640
01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:15.740
<v Speaker 3>you eventually have a father figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

1641
01:10:15.741 --> 01:10:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Ios actually was a bought 10 or 12 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

1642
01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:22.660
<v Speaker 3>I tend to block during summer vacation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then during school,</v>

1643
01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:25.340
<v Speaker 3>the guy who picked me up and I actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>knock holes out these that thing.</v>

1644
01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.193
<v Speaker 3>There's called a knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will knock out these blocks and </v>

1645
01:10:28.081 --> 01:10:30.550
<v Speaker 3>putting the word take out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a block tender?</v>

1646
01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:31.413

<v Speaker 3>Twelve years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 years old.</v>

1649
01:10:38.230 --> 01:10:39.450
<v Speaker 3>I started working at 12 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

1650
01:10:39.451 --> 01:10:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Social Security card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve years old.</v>

1651
01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.120
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1652
01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:47.650
<v Speaker 3>That's how I grew up and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up by if I want to make money,</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1656
01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:51.640
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my parents had money,</v>

1657
01:10:51.641 --> 01:10:55.090
<v Speaker 3>but the party there were party animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I didn't get nothing.</v>

1658
01:10:55.091 --> 01:10:57.220
<v Speaker 3>I bought everything I've ever done since</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 14 years old.</v>

1659
01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.280
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever given me nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

1660
01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:01.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1662
01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.970
<v Speaker 3>if they make a world record or get on </v>
<v Speaker 3>our board down there to get money.</v>

1663
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:08.920
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never take any money.</v>

<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1668
01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:22.900
<v Speaker 4>So you think that way by saying that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>draft exists,</v>

1669
01:11:22.901 --> 01:11:23.734
<v Speaker 4>like forcing people into the military </v>
<v Speaker 4>force to them to serve would at least </v>

1670
01:11:26.471 --> 01:11:30.850
<v Speaker 4>give them some discipline and give them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like make them understand what hard work</v>

1671
01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:31.460
<v Speaker 4>really is.</v>

1672
01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Caucasian and discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1673
01:11:33.821 --> 01:11:35.660
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with the police force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1674
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:37.790
<v Speaker 3>in America today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a lack of,</v>

1675
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:40.610
<v Speaker 3>it's just a lack of common sense and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean authority.</v>

1676
01:11:40.611 --> 01:11:41.470
<v Speaker 3>They don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1677
01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.080
<v Speaker 3>represent authority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1678
01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.160
<v Speaker 3>I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1679
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:47.330
<v Speaker 3>I remember was I used to play baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can help people to story.</v>

1680
01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.450
<v Speaker 3>I was like 12 years old and we played </v>
<v Speaker 3>this game.</v>

1681
01:11:50.451 --> 01:11:52.130
<v Speaker 3>If you hit a ball out the yard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're out.</v>

1682
01:11:52.131 --> 01:11:54.320
<v Speaker 3>But if you had inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he already got the second score.</v>

1683
01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.273
<v Speaker 3>You got to score to run and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>you against me with a neutral pitcher </v>

1684
01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:01.700
<v Speaker 3>and I slid into second base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 12 years old and my neighbor was a</v>

1685
01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.010
<v Speaker 3>high school senior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1686
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm memory probably like 220 pounds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then he gets up and he said,</v>

1687
01:12:06.711 --> 01:12:07.371
<v Speaker 3>you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1688
01:12:07.371 --> 01:12:08.204
<v Speaker 3>I'm safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he slapped the hard as he can slap </v>

1689
01:12:09.831 --> 01:12:11.420
<v Speaker 3>me and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're out.</v>

1690
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:12.920
<v Speaker 3>I was out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't kick his attitude.</v>

1691
01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:17.500
<v Speaker 3>I grew up a pecking order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knows what a pecking order is and</v>

1692
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:18.343
<v Speaker 3>number to picking nowhere you over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is that good for society to have </v>

1693
01:12:22.491 --> 01:12:23.324
<v Speaker 3>that kind of a pecking order?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't be ran over by all these </v>

1694
01:12:25.101 --> 01:12:27.080
<v Speaker 3>countries right now if we had a pecking </v>
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>

1695
01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Every look at the picking order now </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all,</v>

1696
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:30.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to school because you got </v>

1697
01:12:31.731 --> 01:12:33.590
<v Speaker 3>bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1698
01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:35.540
<v Speaker 3>I got kicked out of school in first </v>
<v Speaker 3>grade.</v>

1699
01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not for a day.</v>

1700
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.230
<v Speaker 3>I got kicked out for the first grade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A kid stole my shoe.</v>

1701
01:12:41.231 --> 01:12:42.410

<v Speaker 3>Columbus here on east side,</v>

1703
01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:46.701
<v Speaker 3>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1704
01:12:46.701 --> 01:12:48.560
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you tell me that tomorrow,</v>

1715
01:13:13.941 --> 01:13:16.100
<v Speaker 3>we'll say Barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wouldn't let me at school.</v>

1716
01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:16.934
<v Speaker 3>I had to set it on a freaking year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't start school at seven years </v>

1717
01:13:18.591 --> 01:13:19.910
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1719
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:24.410
<v Speaker 3>What kind of teacher can't take a six </v>
<v Speaker 3>year old punch?</v>

1720
01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:25.523
<v Speaker 3>I have exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically back then that seems </v>

1721
01:13:28.791 --> 01:13:29.624
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I.</v>

1722
01:13:29.690 --> 01:13:31.660
<v Speaker 3>But I still think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1723
01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.040
<v Speaker 3>no one has any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no trades in America,</v>

1724
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:34.883
<v Speaker 3>you know that they're talking about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>now knowing you don't have any </v>

1725
01:13:37.341 --> 01:13:38.174
<v Speaker 3>tradesman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they went in the army at least two </v>

1726
01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:41.300
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get a couple of years of college</v>

1727
01:13:41.301 --> 01:13:44.520
<v Speaker 3>free education and something gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>something from the government instead of</v>

1728
01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:45.650
<v Speaker 3>a handout from the government.</v>

1729
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:46.603
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people think that it would be that </v>

1730
01:13:47.201 --> 01:13:48.034
<v Speaker 4>mandatory military service would be good</v>
<v Speaker 4>because then they would realize the </v>

1731
01:13:50.841 --> 01:13:53.450
<v Speaker 4>consequences of war that would really </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand it.</v>

1732
01:13:53.451 --> 01:13:55.490
<v Speaker 4>Like Israel does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Israel,</v>

1733
01:13:55.491 --> 01:13:56.324
<v Speaker 4>everybody has mandatory military service</v>
<v Speaker 4>and their patriotism is at a very high </v>

1734
01:14:00.201 --> 01:14:01.034
<v Speaker 4>level because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they realize that they're all </v>

1735
01:14:03.081 --> 01:14:06.500
<v Speaker 4>connected in this giant army.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the army goes toward that literally</v>

1736
01:14:06.501 --> 01:14:07.334
<v Speaker 4>is them.</v>

1737
01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I believe the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it would change.</v>

1738
01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:14.800
<v Speaker 3>Think I can say this country so sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1739
01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:15.511
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

<v Speaker 3>things because your kids building well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be the bully then to be </v>

1742
01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:20.644
<v Speaker 3>bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bullied everybody I kid could and the </v>

1743
01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:26.220
<v Speaker 3>bigger people bullied me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way.</v>

1744
01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Is that good though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know my role in society,</v>

1745
01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.353
<v Speaker 3>but wasn't a little bitch and acted like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I run my mouth to you and you touched </v>

1746
01:14:36.311 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1747
01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I go call the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1748
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:42.100

<v Speaker 3>Fuck that guy beat my ass up.</v>

1749
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:45.070
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1750
01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.360
<v Speaker 3>I've got 13 teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1751
01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:47.194
<v Speaker 3>How are you thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I got 13 from running my </v>

1752
01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:51.874
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>

1753
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.153
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1754
01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.270
<v Speaker 3>and I don't have no regrets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No regrets.</v>

1755
01:14:57.271 --> 01:14:58.104
<v Speaker 3>It taught me lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that the only way to learn lessons </v>

1756
01:15:00.691 --> 01:15:02.510
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a damn good for you.</v>

1757
01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.353
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't think you're something that </v>

1758
01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:08.460
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have to grow.</v>

1759
01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:10.740
<v Speaker 3>That is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know what you really are.</v>

1760
01:15:10.741 --> 01:15:12.690
<v Speaker 3>That's all that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1761
01:15:12.691 --> 01:15:13.524
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people think there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something other than what they really </v>

1762
01:15:15.871 --> 01:15:19.100
<v Speaker 3>are because they're not tested because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not the.</v>

1763
01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:19.993
<v Speaker 3>You know how many people in this life go</v>
<v Speaker 3>through difficult physical struggles on </v>

1764
01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:25.524
<v Speaker 3>a regular basis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the main things that human </v>

1765
01:15:27.121 --> 01:15:28.440
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially men,</v>

1766
01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.513
<v Speaker 3>one of the main thing that men lack in </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is very difficult physical </v>

1767
01:15:32.551 --> 01:15:35.130
<v Speaker 3>struggles that tests your character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right,</v>

1768
01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:38.970
<v Speaker 3>but being a bully doesn't test your </v>
<v Speaker 3>character or somebody that be bullied.</v>

1769
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.180

01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:09.840
<v Speaker 3>stands you up and it will put you in </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1831
01:18:09.841 --> 01:18:13.650
<v Speaker 3>It can move your legs back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get well then would assisted in it,</v>

1832
01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:15.600
<v Speaker 3>you could read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have resistance,</v>

1833
01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:19.900
<v Speaker 1>so for someone who's like maybe two a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week to actually lift the weights up,</v>

1834
01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.390
<v Speaker 3>like if you couldn't move your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>visitors you'd like,</v>

1835
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:25.210
<v Speaker 3>I can move your leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say okay,</v>

1836
01:18:25.211 --> 01:18:26.140
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1837
01:18:26.141 --> 01:18:26.974
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then week after week until we finally </v>

1838
01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:31.450
<v Speaker 3>get that full range of motion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once we gained full range of motion,</v>

1839
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:35.410
<v Speaker 3>then we could put a resistance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanical resistance for you picking up</v>

1840
01:18:35.411 --> 01:18:37.150
<v Speaker 3>two pound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three pound or whatever,</v>

1841
01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:39.580
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's static dynamic developer.</v>

1842
01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:40.414
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming out was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionize the strength training for </v>

1843
01:18:41.441 --> 01:18:42.940
<v Speaker 3>every sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1844
01:18:42.941 --> 01:18:44.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you.</v>

1845
01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.180
<v Speaker 3>Do you have that here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1846
01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:49.110
<v Speaker 3>we've got it on film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can a little bit on film,</v>

1847
01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:51.610
<v Speaker 3>but when you feel that you would not </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it.</v>

1848
01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very curious.</v>

1849
01:18:53.171 --> 01:18:54.004
<v Speaker 3>I'm very curious to see what that's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got one more book on writing a </v>

1850
01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.950
<v Speaker 3>book right now and then I'm pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>done with discussing the editor and have</v>

1851
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:03.580
<v Speaker 3>it track and field a track now.</v>

1852
01:19:03.610 --> 01:19:04.443
<v Speaker 3>Feel just track for sprinting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance and just about developing </v>

1853
01:19:08.081 --> 01:19:10.450
<v Speaker 3>strength for helping strengthen reducing</v>
<v Speaker 3>injuries.</v>

1854
01:19:10.451 --> 01:19:13.330
<v Speaker 3>There's so many injuries now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about an MMA,</v>

1855
01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:14.213
<v Speaker 3>a dessert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's a way to reduce </v>

1856
01:19:15.461 --> 01:19:17.920
<v Speaker 3>injuries and MMA through powerless?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too much.</v>

1857
01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1858
01:19:19.810 --> 01:19:22.410
<v Speaker 3>I think he's far but too much problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

1859
01:19:22.411 --> 01:19:23.244
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to talk to guys way back in the </v>

1860
01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.253
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big that guy because it was 95 percent </v>

1861
01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:29.680
<v Speaker 3>of fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would go there.</v>

1862
01:19:29.681 --> 01:19:33.700
<v Speaker 3>He was a kate one fire and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think you've got to slow that down</v>

1863
01:19:33.701 --> 01:19:34.750
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1864
01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.730
<v Speaker 3>they say in boxing fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get you.</v>

1865
01:19:36.731 --> 01:19:38.050
<v Speaker 3>It's as foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1866
01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.130
<v Speaker 3>So that someone was firing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working on skill and work on your skill.</v>

1867
01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Was this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say that because that's the trend.</v>

1868
01:19:43.811 --> 01:19:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Cowboy cerrone,</v>

1869
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:47.390
<v Speaker 3>who's never looked any better than he </v>
<v Speaker 3>does right now,</v>

1870
01:19:47.391 --> 01:19:48.370
<v Speaker 3>and he's on a tear.</v>

1871
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:50.710
<v Speaker 3>He said he stopped sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't spar.</v>

1872
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Says all I do is do drills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1873
01:19:52.331 --> 01:19:54.190
<v Speaker 3>I already know how to fight or know I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>tough.</v>

1874
01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:55.810
<v Speaker 3>He goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't waste myself in a gym.</v>

1875
01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:59.950
<v Speaker 3>We have the greatest squatters bar ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the history of the sport,</v>

1876
01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:02.140
<v Speaker 3>and we don't squat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We settled on boxes.</v>

1877
01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:03.910
<v Speaker 3>We don't do regular squats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

1878
01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.220
<v Speaker 3>We sit down a bunch of just sitting on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>chair.</v>

1879
01:20:06.221 --> 01:20:09.420
<v Speaker 3>We will and then stand back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I taught were you training to.</v>

1880
01:20:09.421 --> 01:20:11.730
<v Speaker 3>We go to a contest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you got to do a squat.</v>

1881
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:14.980
<v Speaker 3>We don't do any regular debit with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rope,</v>

1882
01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.440
<v Speaker 3>a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and real weights.</v>

1883
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 3>None.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And our top,</v>

1884
01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:21.030
<v Speaker 3>our top five average is 890 and</v>

1885
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:22.410
<v Speaker 1>10 is eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty six.</v>

1886
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.273
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do if you don't do regular </v>

1887
01:20:24.421 --> 01:20:27.750
<v Speaker 1>dead lifts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do bands over the bar in power racks.</v>

1888
01:20:27.751 --> 01:20:29.720
<v Speaker 1>We use two or three different bands over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bar,</v>

1889
01:20:29.721 --> 01:20:30.690
<v Speaker 1>meaning elastic band</v>

1890
01:20:30.730 --> 01:20:32.470
<v Speaker 3>instead of my edge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>220 pounds of attention.</v>

1891
01:20:32.471 --> 01:20:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Like if you picked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1892
01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:36.010
<v Speaker 3>200 on the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stand up,</v>

1893
01:20:36.011 --> 01:20:37.220
<v Speaker 3>it's 4:40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1894
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:39.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or we got stronger boundaries.</v>

1895
01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you have to kind of bands and,</v>

1896
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:41.560
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1897
01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.690
<v Speaker 1>we just do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that.</v>

1898
01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:45.690
<v Speaker 1>So what that means to people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this,</v>

1899
01:20:45.691 --> 01:20:47.430
<v Speaker 1>when you have these elastic bands on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bar,</v>

1900
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:48.473
<v Speaker 1>that makes it more difficult when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get up to the top of the range of </v>

1901
01:20:50.191 --> 01:20:52.890
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same with chains to it.</v>

1902
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1903
01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:55.550
<v Speaker 3>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called accommodating resistance,</v>

1904
01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:57.970
<v Speaker 3>but it builds a tremendous acceleration </v>
<v Speaker 3>in these.</v>

1905
01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:58.813
<v Speaker 3>A lot of band camp treat mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceleration to very bottom because you </v>

1906
01:21:01.551 --> 01:21:03.380
<v Speaker 3>knew you had at the outrun the bands.</v>

1907
01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1908
01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:05.593
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to outrun the bands and then </v>

1909
01:21:06.741 --> 01:21:09.230
<v Speaker 1>when you get to the top it becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

1910
01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.333
<v Speaker 1>So you when you have just a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>deadlift or a regular squat with it </v>

1911
01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:16.190
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any of those bands at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end you have more horsepower.</v>

1912
01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

1913
01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:22.960
<v Speaker 1>So you don't do any regular squats or </v>
<v Speaker 1>any regular deadlifts and you think that</v>

1914
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:26.210
<v Speaker 1>that helps you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That preserves athletes as well.</v>

1915
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:27.143
<v Speaker 3>Greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Squatters your greatest male female </v>

1916
01:21:28.090 --> 01:21:29.970
<v Speaker 3>pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a number one,</v>

1917
01:21:29.971 --> 01:21:30.804
<v Speaker 3>number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest quality of all time and I've </v>

1918
01:21:32.761 --> 01:21:36.090
<v Speaker 3>got a one 65 I think have become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be the great squatter bolt</v>

1919
01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:39.510
<v Speaker 3>on or thinking about 950,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five pounds of one 69,</v>

1920
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:43.500
<v Speaker 1>955 pounds at 165.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1921
01:21:43.501 --> 01:21:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Dot eight nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did that easy.</v>

1922
01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:47.160
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And keep him out of jail.</v>

1923
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>

1924
01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.470
<v Speaker 1>And a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How weird.</v>

1925
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say he's.</v>

1926
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:55.710
<v Speaker 1>We'll just say straight down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1927
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

1928
01:21:57.330 --> 01:21:58.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not the case with almost </v>

1929
01:21:59.071 --> 01:22:02.130
<v Speaker 1>everybody who's like at the very top </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of anything.</v>

1930
01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Normally people only give you normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

1931
01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good quote.</v>

1932
01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:09.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a good quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That needs to be a meme as normal people</v>

1933
01:22:09.511 --> 01:22:11.940
<v Speaker 1>only give you normal results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need normal people.</v>

1934
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:13.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way of looking at </v>

1935
01:22:14.731 --> 01:22:15.564
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1936
01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:16.813
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what I was saying before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're kind of insulated because </v>

1937
01:22:18.451 --> 01:22:20.580
<v Speaker 1>you're in this world of savages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1938
01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:24.150
<v Speaker 1>in your attitude about things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not an attitude that most people</v>

1939
01:22:24.151 --> 01:22:24.984
<v Speaker 1>have in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's worried about everybody's </v>

1940
01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:27.924
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's worried about being </v>

1941
01:22:28.591 --> 01:22:29.424
<v Speaker 1>sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that this is the time of toxic </v>

1942
01:22:32.641 --> 01:22:35.790
<v Speaker 1>masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People worried about masculinity.</v>

1943
01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1944
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Forgot like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it strange I'm going to do.</v>

1945
01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:41.260
<v Speaker 1>I think the world is screwed up and</v>

1946
01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:43.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1947
01:22:43.811 --> 01:22:44.644
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1948
01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.493
<v Speaker 3>had told Tom to buy all these books and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the straw man back in 1900 and they all </v>

1949
01:22:49.791 --> 01:22:50.624
<v Speaker 3>look like mma fighters today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men Don't look like at today like I did </v>

1950
01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:56.480
<v Speaker 3>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No loan before roids.</v>

1951
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:59.490
<v Speaker 3>They looked like gamers loaded to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gills and there wasn't a road back.</v>

1952
01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:01.220
<v Speaker 3>He was probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>food was better.</v>

1953
01:23:01.221 --> 01:23:02.054
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1954
01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.850
<v Speaker 3>but they all had attitude and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>will kick your ass.</v>

1955
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:07.540
<v Speaker 3>So I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that I can send to warrants</v>

1956
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.100
<v Speaker 3>to soft man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be hard.</v>

1957
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:13.030
<v Speaker 3>You can have an easy life because once </v>
<v Speaker 3>things get hard,</v>

1958
01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:16.300
<v Speaker 3>you're screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see that in my sport.</v>

1959
01:23:16.301 --> 01:23:20.200
<v Speaker 3>I watched guys will accelerate them so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast and it gets hard to quit.</v>

1960
01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:22.780
<v Speaker 3>We like in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

1961
01:23:22.781 --> 01:23:24.790
<v Speaker 3>I just quit tap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

1962
01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1963
01:23:26.051 --> 01:23:27.030
<v Speaker 3>punch me in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well done.</v>

1964
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:27.903
<v Speaker 3>I'm done with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That drives me insane because work </v>

1965
01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:34.510
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of hours to get these guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>super,</v>

1966
01:23:34.511 --> 01:23:36.130
<v Speaker 3>super strong and then they quit,</v>

1967
01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.633
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't that make you appreciate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like a matte brown or someone like </v>

1968
01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:45.130
<v Speaker 1>who is like a legitimate check from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect for all finders.</v>

1969
01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1970
01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:47.200
<v Speaker 1>any fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1971
01:23:47.201 --> 01:23:49.300
<v Speaker 1>What level?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they get into UFC cage.</v>

1972
01:23:49.301 --> 01:23:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I got loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respectful,</v>

1973
01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:53.680
<v Speaker 1>but in 2016 does have rare type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1974
01:23:53.681 --> 01:23:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this ever softening world,</v>

1975
01:23:55.481 --> 01:23:58.000
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that's why MMA is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular?</v>

1976
01:23:58.180 --> 01:23:59.013
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody wants to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to go through that </v>

1977
01:24:01.361 --> 01:24:02.194
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the recognize how unique it </v>

1978
01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:05.170
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They recognize.</v>

1979
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.093
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of people that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends with like MMA that they don't </v>

1980
01:24:09.521 --> 01:24:10.354
<v Speaker 1>have those qualities themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they appreciate them and other </v>

1981
01:24:12.031 --> 01:24:12.280
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1982
01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.900
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1983
01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.090
<v Speaker 3>I've always admired fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a huge boxing fan,</v>

1984
01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:19.820
<v Speaker 3>like triple g and guys like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>

1985
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:24.070
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Roman Gonzales' classical boxers,</v>

1986
01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.960
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to classic because uh,</v>

1987
01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:27.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go try to do it.</v>

1988
01:24:27.051 --> 01:24:29.890
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy to do at no works insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1989
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:32.020
<v Speaker 3>and everybody thinks it's a brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even boxing.</v>

1990
01:24:32.021 --> 01:24:33.740
<v Speaker 3>I was a brutal sport and they think in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the maze.</v>

1991
01:24:33.741 --> 01:24:36.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of so much technique.</v>

1992
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:39.860
<v Speaker 1>There's more technique than anyone would</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever really imagined.</v>

1993
01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know another thing that fighters are</v>

1994
01:24:42.051 --> 01:24:44.500
<v Speaker 1>getting into a lot lately as yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

1995
01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:46.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever mess with that?</v>

1996
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.721
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1997
01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I probably should.</v>

1998
01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I know Matt was doing yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1999
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:50.323
<v Speaker 1>Hot Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to subtract girls to do the hot </v>

2000
01:24:52.161 --> 01:24:53.300
<v Speaker 1>yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say it's really,</v>

2001
01:24:53.301 --> 01:24:54.140
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2002
01:24:54.141 --> 01:24:54.974
<v Speaker 1>it's a great thing for your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why I brought </v>

2003
01:24:56.901 --> 01:24:57.734
<v Speaker 1>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing for like lengthening your </v>

2004
01:24:58.911 --> 01:24:59.744
<v Speaker 1>spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain decompression exercises </v>

2005
01:25:01.401 --> 01:25:02.234
<v Speaker 1>that you do in Yoga where you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You grabbed the bottom of your heels </v>

2006
01:25:05.031 --> 01:25:08.420
<v Speaker 1>from underneath and you're pulling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>straighten your legs out.</v>

2007
01:25:08.421 --> 01:25:10.340
<v Speaker 1>You literally feel your back on like </v>
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

2008
01:25:10.341 --> 01:25:10.791
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

2009
01:25:10.791 --> 01:25:11.624
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop.</v>

2010
01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Like I do it all the time and I can feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>my back,</v>

2011
01:25:15.081 --> 01:25:18.530
<v Speaker 1>especially in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel it's separating and it makes it a</v>

2012
01:25:18.531 --> 01:25:20.750
<v Speaker 1>little pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like you're getting adjusted by a</v>

2013
01:25:20.751 --> 01:25:21.584
<v Speaker 1>chiropractor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that you would </v>

2014
01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:27.410
<v Speaker 1>recommend to your athletes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that something you might think about?</v>

2015
01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:29.810
<v Speaker 1>If it's not an advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a disadvantage,</v>

2016
01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.750
<v Speaker 1>anything of a person I want them to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2017
01:25:32.751 --> 01:25:33.380
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2018
01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:35.930
<v Speaker 1>other kinds of therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cold therapy,</v>

2019
01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:37.570
<v Speaker 1>ice bass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy,</v>

2020
01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:38.563
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

2021
01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Prolotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stem cell,</v>

2022
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:45.900
<v Speaker 3>platelet injections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could think of it.</v>

2023
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even get it.</v>

2024
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:48.403
<v Speaker 3>I don't want your cat and your readers </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hear everything I've done because </v>

2025
01:25:50.931 --> 01:25:52.040
<v Speaker 3>they would probably have me locked in.</v>

2026
01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Like what have you done that would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>you locked up?</v>

2027
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I've used our stint and strict nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>injections.</v>

2028
01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:58.940
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strychnine arsenic.</v>

2029
01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Strychnine or arsenic and strychnine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2030
01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Why would they inject you with poison?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it raises your red</v>

2031
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.610
<v Speaker 3>blood cell count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've used nitroglycerin.</v>

2032
01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:12.960
<v Speaker 3>Nitroglycerin cream because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a stimulating blood flow and me start</v>

2033
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:14.000
<v Speaker 3>your heart up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2034
01:26:14.001 --> 01:26:17.150
<v Speaker 3>And I use it because I broke my back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to admit I broke my back a</v>

2035
01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.770
<v Speaker 3>second time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I use it,</v>

2036
01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:21.560
<v Speaker 3>I told my friend who was a professor at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ohio state that says,</v>

2037
01:26:21.561 --> 01:26:22.320
<v Speaker 3>don't go nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2038
01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.690
<v Speaker 3>we'll see what his does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2039
01:26:23.691 --> 01:26:26.390
<v Speaker 3>I was raised and being for three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it felt like you were hit me in the head</v>

2040
01:26:26.391 --> 01:26:28.820
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every heartbeat just hit me in a temple.</v>

2041
01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2042
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:32.140
<v Speaker 3>but I've done it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing I haven't tried.</v>

2043
01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.920
<v Speaker 3>I did electric statement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called a microwave.</v>

2044
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.620
<v Speaker 3>It lengthens out the muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Tom did it for what?</v>

2045
01:26:39.621 --> 01:26:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Fifteen seconds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did for 96 minutes.</v>

2046
01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.453
<v Speaker 3>What does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lengthens out the muscles literally </v>

2047
01:26:44.841 --> 01:26:47.870
<v Speaker 3>straighten out your leg right off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground is electrocuting you.</v>

2048
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.090
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for six minute segments.</v>

2049
01:26:50.091 --> 01:26:53.390
<v Speaker 3>And I did 96 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's electrical muscular stimulation.</v>

2050
01:26:53.710 --> 01:26:55.660
<v Speaker 3>It lengthens it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2051
01:26:55.661 --> 01:26:58.130
<v Speaker 3>And I should never done it because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think I've got too many injuries,</v>

2052
01:26:58.131 --> 01:27:00.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it basically tore.</v>

2053
01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:01.880
<v Speaker 3>It popped my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2054
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:03.810
<v Speaker 3>my hips and my shoulders out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his uncle.</v>

2055
01:27:04.290 --> 01:27:09.290
<v Speaker 3>What if my hip don't?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six hour right here,</v>

2056
01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.560
<v Speaker 3>my hipbone crazy here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your whole body's like a walking medical</v>

2057
01:27:17.601 --> 01:27:18.434
<v Speaker 3>encyclopedia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when you got to try it right </v>

2058
01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:21.713

<v Speaker 3>While I'm finding out because what has </v>

2062
01:27:32.661 --> 01:27:33.494
<v Speaker 3>been about three weeks against stem cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>in both hips and my knee and my </v>

2063
01:27:37.281 --> 01:27:38.990
<v Speaker 3>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's wrong with your hips?</v>

2064
01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some squatting ride.</v>

2065
01:27:40.641 --> 01:27:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Just beating the crap out of myself.</v>

2066
01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:45.170
<v Speaker 3>It was all torn out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm shorten real wide.</v>

2067
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.540
<v Speaker 3>So all your parents are here for </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>

2068
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:51.920
<v Speaker 3>so it's just all wear and tear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you feel any different?</v>

2069
01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.990
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's starting to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2070
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.530
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't allowed to take anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammatories.</v>

2071
01:27:57.531 --> 01:28:02.010
<v Speaker 3>I've been on an antiinflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nike's 1991 because uh,</v>

2072
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:04.520
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See when I tore my knee off,</v>

2073
01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm allergic to anesthesia so I went </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the beginning is fine.</v>

2074
01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:09.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went back in and gave me a shot to </v>

2075
01:28:12.951 --> 01:28:15.410
<v Speaker 3>sort of calm me down for surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take the wires out of my knees,</v>

2076
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:19.370
<v Speaker 3>out of my knee and it put me to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave me on stages and they're getting</v>

2077
01:28:19.371 --> 01:28:22.210
<v Speaker 3>trached why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm jumping around.</v>

2078
01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.440
<v Speaker 3>There's ticket chest tubes in me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that really,</v>

2079
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.200
<v Speaker 3>that's how I got the rest of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They several,</v>

2080
01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:27.053
<v Speaker 3>my intercostal nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they severed your intercostal nerve had </v>

2081
01:28:30.141 --> 01:28:30.974
<v Speaker 3>at lh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five to five or six doctors telling me </v>

2082
01:28:32.341 --> 01:28:33.440
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what they did.</v>

2083
01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Only a chest tubes in me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at that point,</v>

2084
01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:38.950
<v Speaker 3>91.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2085
01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:39.933
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to tell you about my gym </v>

2086
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:42.860
<v Speaker 3>and this is why the trade partners I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

2087
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:44.690
<v Speaker 3>I did step in 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever done.</v>

2088
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.823
<v Speaker 3>And this is how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was in intensive care for </v>

2089
01:28:47.661 --> 01:28:51.140
<v Speaker 3>about four days and I was in house with </v>
<v Speaker 3>three more days and I got a,</v>

2090
01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I didn't need a trake I could talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I trained a.</v>

2091
01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:56.360
<v Speaker 3>So they take my throat shut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got ahold of this big.</v>

2092
01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:57.523
<v Speaker 3>I got stitches in my side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take me out of the hospital to the </v>

2093
01:29:00.141 --> 01:29:01.530
<v Speaker 3>gym as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday.</v>

2094
01:29:01.531 --> 01:29:03.990
<v Speaker 3>But then suddenly I go to the gym and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

2095
01:29:03.991 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 3>I'll walk on crutches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got money,</v>

2096
01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:08.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they find out and is you're maxing out,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2099
01:29:11.710 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 3>They laid me down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been street 55.</v>

2100
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's their trading partners?</v>

2101
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:18.290
<v Speaker 3>They're out of their fucking minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2102
01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:20.580
<v Speaker 3>They tried to kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to kill him,</v>

2103
01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:25.260
<v Speaker 3>and that's what you got to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to have people like that.</v>

2104
01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:28.730
<v Speaker 3>They drove me to the point that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they told me that if I,</v>

2105
01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:30.760
<v Speaker 3>if they told me they kicked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm old jump.</v>

2106
01:29:30.761 --> 01:29:34.500
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just tell me male the man.</v>

2107
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:37.170
<v Speaker 3>That's just so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a training.</v>

2108
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:43.690
<v Speaker 1>That is so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2109
01:29:43.691 --> 01:29:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I understand your attitude now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2110
01:29:46.570 --> 01:29:48.190
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have an attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anything.</v>

2111
01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I've had some great results with stem </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>

2112
01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Stem cells are probably going to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>you quite a bit.</v>

2113
01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:54.310
<v Speaker 1>You ever neck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2114
01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2115
01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I just had it in my shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had it in my knee and my hip.</v>

2116
01:29:58.910 --> 01:30:01.030
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big one was my shoulder man,</v>

2117
01:30:01.031 --> 01:30:02.440
<v Speaker 1>my shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hip.</v>

2118
01:30:02.441 --> 01:30:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Was this a minor soreness and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying like do it preventative.</v>

2119
01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:07.083
<v Speaker 1>And it definitely had an impact on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My knee highs have an on and off pain </v>

2120
01:30:10.001 --> 01:30:10.834
<v Speaker 1>for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my knee completely cured that up in </v>

2121
01:30:12.131 --> 01:30:14.470
<v Speaker 1>my shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It healed it like nothing I've ever done</v>

2122
01:30:14.471 --> 01:30:15.370
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2123
01:30:15.530 --> 01:30:16.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I got for the break of needing </v>

2124
01:30:17.441 --> 01:30:22.360
<v Speaker 1>shoulder surgery to no pain at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this shoulder it gives out of place</v>

2125
01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:23.380
<v Speaker 1>every freaking day.</v>

2126
01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:24.213
<v Speaker 1>And they got to put my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I separated my shoulder and say I got a </v>

2127
01:30:25.721 --> 01:30:27.750
<v Speaker 1>big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts it in everyday.</v>

2128
01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:31.050
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping every day I could be put </v>
<v Speaker 1>in everyday.</v>

2129
01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:33.900
<v Speaker 1>What pops it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just strange.</v>

2130
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean just strained the ligaments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendons,</v>

2131
01:30:35.411 --> 01:30:36.244
<v Speaker 1>I think over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not even anything you're doing </v>

2132
01:30:37.991 --> 01:30:38.760
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not,</v>

2133
01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.260
<v Speaker 1>not even lifting weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It constant wear and tear,</v>

2134
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:42.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just like playing pro </v>

2135
01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:45.310
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2136
01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:47.890
<v Speaker 1>But I'd done this for all those years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2137

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was in,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2139
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And then um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and he squad over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just stand up.</v>

2173
01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.113
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're doing your deadlifts and just </v>

2174
01:32:09.911 --> 01:32:10.990
<v Speaker 1>with your neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your neck,</v>

2175
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:11.883
<v Speaker 1>how much weight are you doing that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a on that machine where the machine </v>

2176
01:32:14.411 --> 01:32:15.770
<v Speaker 1>weights?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done about 40 pounds.</v>

2177
01:32:15.810 --> 01:32:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Looks at the whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2178
01:32:17.921 --> 01:32:19.870
<v Speaker 1>40 pounds a lot to be hanging off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your neck.</v>

2179
01:32:19.871 --> 01:32:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus that.</v>

2180
01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:21.333
<v Speaker 1>Plus the cage.</v>

2181
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:25.870
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 95 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety five pounds.</v>

2182
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Are you still doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2183
01:32:27.850 --> 01:32:30.690
<v Speaker 1>it seems to make me feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel better.</v>

2184
01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.020
<v Speaker 1>It makes your neck feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2185
01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.220
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like counterintuitive.</v>

2186
01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:36.093
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people would think that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people think you shouldn't lift any </v>

2187
01:32:37.691 --> 01:32:39.010
<v Speaker 1>weights with your name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your neck.</v>

2188
01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I talked to Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started about it,</v>

2189
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:43.840
<v Speaker 1>you know that eight way neck machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that thing he says,</v>

2190
01:32:43.841 --> 01:32:45.580
<v Speaker 1>don't ever do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad for your neck.</v>

2191
01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:48.580
<v Speaker 1>And then I've talked to other people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are athletes who were fighters,</v>

2192
01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:50.500
<v Speaker 1>so it's one of the best things you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>do for your neck.</v>

2193
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:53.440
<v Speaker 1>You got to in the NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>

2194
01:32:53.441 --> 01:32:54.850
<v Speaker 1>they don't train their nickname or mira </v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

2195
01:32:54.851 --> 01:32:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's neck was Russell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was real big.</v>

2196
01:32:57.881 --> 01:32:58.780
<v Speaker 1>What do you play?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Football.</v>

2197
01:32:58.840 --> 01:32:59.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that anymore.</v>

2198
01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:04.570
<v Speaker 1>It they neck is a the two most bomber of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of jewelry back in your neck.</v>

2199
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:07.660
<v Speaker 1>No one trains them because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to write.</v>

2200
01:33:07.661 --> 01:33:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Well there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I keep hearing that it's bad</v>

2201
01:33:10.061 --> 01:33:10.894
<v Speaker 1>for your neck to lift weights with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems so weird because it's not </v>

2202
01:33:13.241 --> 01:33:15.640
<v Speaker 1>bad for your lower back to do dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifts.</v>

2203
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:16.623
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad for your lower back to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>like reverse hypers or Roman chair </v>

2204
01:33:20.651 --> 01:33:21.820
<v Speaker 1>setups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ups or anything like that.</v>

2205
01:33:21.821 --> 01:33:22.654
<v Speaker 1>And I think a guy called Paul and strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumed never lived way back in the </v>

2206
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:28.210
<v Speaker 1>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he thought the neck was,</v>

2207
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:32.170
<v Speaker 1>was the most neglected muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it shouldn't be the most used muscle</v>

2208
01:33:32.171 --> 01:33:33.280
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens to us,</v>

2209
01:33:33.281 --> 01:33:36.150
<v Speaker 1>we have bad necks because if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything,</v>

2210
01:33:36.151 --> 01:33:38.020
<v Speaker 1>we'll get bad neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think it's,</v>

2211
01:33:38.110 --> 01:33:38.943
<v Speaker 1>it's a real issue with grapplers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like grapplers almost always get served </v>

2212
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:43.530
<v Speaker 1>cervical herniations.</v>

2213
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:44.663
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that a lot of that could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevented if you just strengthened up </v>

2214
01:33:46.271 --> 01:33:48.280
<v Speaker 1>your neck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2215
01:33:48.370 --> 01:33:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know my print John Sader,</v>

2216
01:33:49.951 --> 01:33:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>67,</v>

2217
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:52.143
<v Speaker 1>he gets out and does neck bridges for </v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes and does $500 dollars </v>

2218
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:59.320
<v Speaker 1>qualities in 6,500 Hindus squats in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>row at time.</v>

2219
01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:00.580
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2220
01:34:00.581 --> 01:34:02.370
<v Speaker 1>that's what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he gets out of bed.</v>

2221
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:03.223
<v Speaker 1>He does it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes at neck bridge and $500 </v>

2222
01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:07.900
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing that I could do them in a</v>

2223
01:34:07.901 --> 01:34:09.730
<v Speaker 1>row and I could do $200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2224
01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:13.750
<v Speaker 1>my fucking legs turned a rubber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to step up my game.</v>

2225
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.570
<v Speaker 1>500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2226
01:34:16.571 --> 01:34:18.670
<v Speaker 1>And how old is he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say 62 years.</v>

2227
01:34:18.671 --> 01:34:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Sixty three busy on the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2228
01:34:22.150 --> 01:34:23.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't ask him.</v>

2229
01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:25.113
<v Speaker 1>Don't talk to older guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to about other bds to coach for </v>

2230
01:34:27.731 --> 01:34:28.400
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>

2231
01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.233
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2232
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:30.263
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a big one for grappling a </v>

2233
01:34:32.021 --> 01:34:32.854
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of old school grad course in </v>

2234
01:34:34.241 --> 01:34:35.870
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love the Hindus Quans.</v>

2235
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.473
<v Speaker 1>But that's amazing that they can still </v>
<v Speaker 1>do neck bridges and everything like </v>

2236
01:34:39.071 --> 01:34:40.750
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's at that age.</v>

2237
01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a black belt in judo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samo Jujitsu,</v>

2238
01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.340
<v Speaker 1>black belt in Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More time.</v>

2239
01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:50.470
<v Speaker 1>He still trains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He trains all the time.</v>

2240
01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

2241
01:34:52.690 --> 01:34:54.630
<v Speaker 1>He just had some miniature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's but he's back now,</v>

2242
01:34:54.631 --> 01:34:56.050
<v Speaker 1>but I think he can roll around a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

2243
01:34:56.051 --> 01:34:57.040
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2244
01:34:57.230 --> 01:34:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Hip Surgeries and a replacement or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2245
01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:01.990
<v Speaker 1>That's another real common one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Coleman's got a hip replaced.</v>

2246
01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So common,</v>

2247
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:05.130
<v Speaker 1>a hip replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2248
01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:08.990
<v Speaker 1>everything else lasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

2249
01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.940
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Pass everybody.</v>

2250
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:12.343
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're hoping now is that through </v>

2251
01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:13.874
<v Speaker 1>the use of stem cells that your body's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to regenerate tissue </v>

2252
01:35:16.071 --> 01:35:18.980
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of areas where it couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and that's going to prevent a lot</v>

2253
01:35:18.981 --> 01:35:21.560
<v Speaker 1>of replacements and a lot of surgeries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of things.</v>

2254
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:25.720
<v Speaker 1>They think that sometime in the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stem cell based therapies are going</v>

2255
01:35:25.721 --> 01:35:28.890
<v Speaker 1>to eliminate a giant percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeries that people have.</v>

2256
01:35:29.530 --> 01:35:32.300
<v Speaker 1>That's why I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so too.</v>

2257
01:35:32.670 --> 01:35:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious is if anybody's a canary in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the coal mine to you will find that only</v>

2258
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:40.880
<v Speaker 1>time I get.</v>
