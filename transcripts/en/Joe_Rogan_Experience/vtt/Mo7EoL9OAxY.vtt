00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>The stars have aligned.</v>

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>The prophecy has come true.</v>

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo together on episode nine one one.</v>

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>So imagine thousands of emails come out with them talking about,</v>

6
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>we'll have the kids ready.</v>

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.551
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>

8
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>seven and eight in the hot tub at this time and there'd be,</v>

9
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anything like that.</v>

10
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

11
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:22.301
<v Speaker 1>it gets you.</v>

12
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>It gets really great.</v>

13
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Where did it say that it was Jim's emails?</v>

14
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>There's fricking thousands of them,</v>

15
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>but it said,</v>

16
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>we'll get the kids in the hot tub.</v>

17
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I never saw that.</v>

18
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>

19
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>can you see if you could find that Jamie?</v>

20
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>That seems like we are.</v>

21
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>You have to be real careful in how you describe these things in high talk about</v>

22
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>these things because people were looking for any little tiny thing to discredit</v>

23
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

24
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

25
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I always wondered how they're getting away with it.</v>

26
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>It's so out in the open.</v>

27
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>How come there isn't more of a psychic vampires stealing the energy from the</v>

28
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>kids?</v>

29
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.061
<v Speaker 1>Megan Kelly,</v>

30
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:51.541
<v Speaker 1>so pretty.</v>

31
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>She can say whatever the fuck she wants.</v>

32
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 1>She looks like an old trainee.</v>

33
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.223
<v Speaker 1>I love her.</v>

34
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you think she looks like an old tranny?</v>

35
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.193
<v Speaker 1>You're hilarious.</v>

36
00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

37
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't like old trainings,</v>

38
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:01.374
<v Speaker 1>but I think she's hot.</v>

39
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't like,</v>

40
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't think Meghan Kelly's not just one.</v>

41
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I insulted her.</v>

42
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.023
<v Speaker 1>She's a globalist.</v>

43
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>So then site start accusing me of covering up the,</v>

44
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>the Podesta stuff before.</v>

45
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>It's called pizza gate and then I get blamed for being behind pizza gate and I'm</v>

46
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>not even bitching.</v>

47
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm explaining what it's like to really be trying to get at the truth and the</v>

48
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>people take the fact that it's complex.</v>

49
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 1>She'd be better at this to me jokes,</v>

50
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>you know how to put stuff out,</v>

51
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>clear and parse it.</v>

52
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I just know all this crap.</v>

53
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:24.521
<v Speaker 1>When you get crazy,</v>

54
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 1>you still rent.</v>

55
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>People won't listen to me because I've got too much data.</v>

56
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>You imagine what this is like.</v>

57
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>

58
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:30.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm sick of it.</v>

59
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know everything that's going on,</v>

60
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>but I know this,</v>

61
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I have good CIA people and FBI and secret service.</v>

62
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

63
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.451
<v Speaker 1>Telling me.</v>

64
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:37.021
<v Speaker 1>Yes Alex.</v>

65
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:37.441
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than,</v>

66
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.611
<v Speaker 1>keep getting him.</v>

68
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>It's going to come out and it's starting to come out and say,</v>

69
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

70
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>When we started arresting the pedophile networks,</v>

71
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>we're going to roll up the Democrats and the Republicans that are involved.</v>

72
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's why Trump said any speeches at the,</v>

73
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:49.201
<v Speaker 1>at the inaugural.</v>

74
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>This is not about parties.</v>

75
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 1>We're taking these people on.</v>

76
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>We're bringing God back in.</v>

77
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Even somebody that wasn't very religious like Trump has gotten religion learning</v>

78
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>about this because let me tell you something,</v>

79
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Trump's not a devil worshiper and he loves God and he's been briefed on all this</v>

80
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>and he's going to roll their ass up so the pedophiles better get ready.</v>

81
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I foxes totally get anyone no matter what.</v>

82
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

83
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

84
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.253
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

85
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Get one for Eddie Bravo two I did.</v>

86
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh was just tobacco.</v>

87
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

88
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.211
<v Speaker 1>Very.</v>

89
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It's strong tobacco from Mexico.</v>

90
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.901
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

91
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:16.651
<v Speaker 1>I am in California.</v>

92
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:17.461
<v Speaker 1>This was for medical reason.</v>

93
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>100% medical reasons and legal.</v>

94
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.281
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

95
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:20.911
<v Speaker 1>Buzz Aldrin.</v>

96
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I do no buzz Aldrin.</v>

97
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Buzz Aldrin said,</v>

98
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to come on your show and I and I,</v>

99
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna get into all the heat.</v>

100
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I know he lives here in La and one time I ran into him,</v>

101
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:28.494
<v Speaker 1>but let's leave it at that.</v>

102
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.401
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

103
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>I want to come on your show.</v>

104
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:30.631
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

105
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:30.871
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

106
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:31.704
<v Speaker 1>well come on.</v>

107
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's the only interview he said and he goes,</v>

108
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you Alex and your audience alone.</v>

109
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:36.714
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

110
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>there is an obelisk just like 2001 it's on the moon of Mars,</v>

111
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>

112
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>and it's sending a transmission and it's all real and it's all Egypt and there's</v>

113
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>aliens and everything else.</v>

114
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>The word is they got military bases on the other side.</v>

115
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Alex was in the fifties what do you think we got now?</v>

116
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.763
<v Speaker 1>So you think they have no,</v>

117
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.221
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

118
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>They have bases on the moon.</v>

119
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.721
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll never get into all this stuff,</v>

121
00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

122
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

123
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>But let's just say it's super advanced.</v>

124
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>They sent a bunch of people to their company and threatened them.</v>

125
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>The next week after I heard him and he laid it out,</v>

126
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>he said in 1967 we certified at the Stanford Research Institute that he was able</v>

127
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>to control hurricanes,</v>

128
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>

129
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>hurricanes,</v>

130
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>and steer hurricanes,</v>

131
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>all that got black budgeted shutdown.</v>

132
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>And then they got into these arrays where they could use antennas.</v>

133
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.891
<v Speaker 1>And out of that,</v>

134
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>and Westinghouse came,</v>

135
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.021
<v Speaker 1>came the,</v>

136
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

137
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.681
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

138
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>the whole heart program.</v>

139
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>So in the 60s,</v>

140
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>they could create control and steer or kill hurricanes.</v>

141
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>That's why you Google now bill and Melinda Gates bought all those patents and</v>

142
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:34.331
<v Speaker 1>the quote,</v>

143
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates is going to save the world from bad weather.</v>

144
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates wants to stop hurricanes.</v>

145
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:39.244
<v Speaker 1>Google.</v>

146
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.761
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

147
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>in 2005,</v>

148
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>the Department of Energy Program for Aerosol testing was $5 billion a year.</v>

149
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 1>So under us code title 50,</v>

150
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Chapter 32 subsection 1,528,</v>

151
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:49.804
<v Speaker 1>paragraph B,</v>

152
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>

153
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.131
<v Speaker 1>You nailed that,</v>

154
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:51.281
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

155
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

156
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

157
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>We need from Mars under US code.</v>

158
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you live on that obelisk?</v>

159
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>That was fucking insane.</v>

160
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:58.024
<v Speaker 1>Let me just tell you,</v>

161
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I need to remember the time and last time the Cheetah fuck this mother fucker</v>

162
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>listed under us.</v>

163
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Code title finish number 32 1,528 paragraph B.</v>

164
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

165
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:11.651
<v Speaker 1>Under that,</v>

166
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>say it's slow that Jamie write it up,</v>

167
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>but the big secret is once you have a crystal ball and know the future,</v>

168
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions that control the future.</v>

169
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>And so then it's the end of consciousness and freewill for individuals as we</v>

170
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

171
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>And a true 2.0 and a very bad way.</v>

172
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone knowing our hopes and</v>

173
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>

174
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>delivering it to us,</v>

175
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>not in some PKD wire-heads system where we plug in and give up on consciousness</v>

176
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 1>because of unlimited pleasure,</v>

177
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>but because we were already wired in and absorbed before we knew it.</v>

178
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>By giving over our consciousness to the system,</v>

179
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger</v>

180
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

181
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>There's now a human counterstrike taking place to shut this off before it gets</v>

182
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 1>fully into place and to block these systems and to try to have an actual debate</v>

183
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>about where humanity goes and cut off the pedophiles and psychic vampires that</v>

184
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 1>are control of this AI system before humanities destroy humanity is only</v>

185
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 1>controlled of Ai.</v>

186
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>How would they get,</v>

187
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 1>how'd the pedophiles getting controlling the pet,</v>

188
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>the pedophiles it at whatever level,</v>

189
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.951
<v Speaker 1>the devil,</v>

190
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:15.611
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>

191
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>this inner dimensional thing that gives them advanced Offworld technology.</v>

192
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>The fallen one that's not of this world is giving them advanced knowledge.</v>

193
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Top systems have been used before on other populations.</v>

194
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>What that Satan,</v>

195
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.851
<v Speaker 1>but what do you,</v>

196
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

197
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what it does was his rant.</v>

198
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure we're going to go back to that.</v>

199
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely high as fuck.</v>

200
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.140
<v Speaker 1>This is the stuff about buzz Aldrin is telling him some fucking exactly crazy</v>

201
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 1>shit and I'm like,</v>

202
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

203
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm too fucked up.</v>

204
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 1>You fucked up.</v>

205
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I told you we are going to get them all dried.</v>

206
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>We had to get her mind and there is a full out war inside the government of guys</v>

207
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>that like to eat steaks and drink beer and having women versus a bunch of</v>

208
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Potbelly pedophiles.</v>

209
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.733
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

210
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't claim to have all the answers and I'm not here to boost your Trump cause</v>

211
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm tied to his wagon.</v>

212
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>If I attack Trump,</v>

213
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:05.324
<v Speaker 1>I'd make more money.</v>

214
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.291
<v Speaker 1>This isn't about money.</v>

215
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.124
<v Speaker 1>It's about the truth.</v>

216
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Trump really is trying to cut taxes and make people successful and wealthy.</v>

217
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>He really does care about the average person,</v>

218
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 1>the elite of set up a plan to enslave people,</v>

219
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.580
<v Speaker 1>to make folks poor and all I'm asking you to do is get past thinking that you're</v>

220
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>part of the establishment or you're smart because you're anti-Trump.</v>

221
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking you to actually look at what's really been going on and understand</v>

222
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:30.561
<v Speaker 1>that Democrats,</v>

223
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Republicans come and go.</v>

224
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:32.241
<v Speaker 1>Some are good,</v>

225
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:33.074
<v Speaker 1>some are bad.</v>

226
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>The whole power structure has been against Trump for a very serious reason.</v>

227
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Trump is coming after them and really is attempting to bring down this whole</v>

228
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>global system and that's when all hell is breaking loose.</v>

229
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>So I just want your viewers and listeners know I'm not some political hack.</v>

230
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:47.661
<v Speaker 1>Like you said earlier,</v>

231
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I used to be against Bush.</v>

232
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>I wish Obama would have been real.</v>

233
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 1>The point is they got to,</v>

234
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Obama would Trump,</v>

235
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't give a damn.</v>

236
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 1>They admit they're offering and money,</v>

237
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:56.601
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

238
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:57.434
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't listen.</v>

239
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.891
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

240
00:06:57.891 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 1>is he in the middle of an awakening?</v>

241
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

242
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>because he could easily have been a billionaire to me two years ago who?</v>

243
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Who bought all the mainstream shit,</v>

244
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

245
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're interdimensionally connected like why is it always blew?</v>

246
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>You're a loser,</v>

247
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>slap you in the face of the back of the head.</v>

248
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

249
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:15.330
<v Speaker 1>how are they so good at?</v>

250
00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:17.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's not movie deal.</v>

251
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 1>That was the greatest thing you've ever said.</v>

252
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.731
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

253
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.564
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

254
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>You just invited a door for people going who you're a loser and then try to slap</v>

255
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:26.110
<v Speaker 1>you in the back of the head.</v>

256
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen now.</v>

257
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Started turning our brain is able to tune into the lowest dimension,</v>

258
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.473
<v Speaker 1>the highest dimension.</v>

259
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Humans are basically really powerful creatures that can live right close to</v>

260
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:37.604
<v Speaker 1>sons.</v>

261
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 1>They're highly radioactive,</v>

262
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:39.461
<v Speaker 1>nothing else can live.</v>

263
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 1>It's close with very short lives because we're like,</v>

264
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 1>hey hive organism that actually lives second to second in the space time</v>

265
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>continuum.</v>

266
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.261
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hundred years,</v>

267
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:49.094
<v Speaker 1>it's a second.</v>

268
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 1>And we transmit our data up to be able to live next to likely the stargate jump</v>

269
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.110
<v Speaker 1>gates that are,</v>

270
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.943
<v Speaker 1>that are sons.</v>

271
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 1>So because we live so close to the sons,</v>

272
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>we only have like milliseconds to be alive.</v>

273
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.530
<v Speaker 1>So we're actually a hive organism that keeps transmitting up to the next species</v>

274
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.291
<v Speaker 1>in our,</v>

275
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:06.651
<v Speaker 1>in our,</v>

276
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>in a hierarchical system,</v>

277
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.140
<v Speaker 1>and then down below us.</v>

278
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.380
<v Speaker 1>So we're alive right now in this continuum and we're trying to progress and,</v>

279
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

280
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>and make things better.</v>

281
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>And the elites are trying to make sure that we don't dial into that incredible</v>

282
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:23.300
<v Speaker 1>knowledge we've got as a species.</v>

283
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It basically die as a species so that we're not competitors on the next level as</v>

284
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>the Bible says of their dimensional plane.</v>

285
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.833
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

286
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 1>but you don't believe that.</v>
