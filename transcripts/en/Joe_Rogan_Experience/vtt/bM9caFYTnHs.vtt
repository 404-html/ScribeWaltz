00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.790
<v Speaker 1>We give zero fucks.</v>

00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Your Ratha drove Joe Rohde.</v>

3
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>The experience for people who don't understand what you're talking about here at</v>

4
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:10.310
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.310
<v Speaker 2>your premise or a big part of it is that there is somewhere around,</v>

6
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.071
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>

7
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:17.750
<v Speaker 2>10,000 years ago,</v>

8
00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.360
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around then towards the end of the last ice age,</v>

9
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 2>humanity was probably mostly wiped out or wiped out in a big way.</v>

10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.720
<v Speaker 2>And we had to rebuild from there</v>

11
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 3>build.</v>

12
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.850
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

13
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.530
<v Speaker 3>and I believe that we lost,</v>

14
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

15
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.260
<v Speaker 3>a civilization at that time,</v>

16
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.460
<v Speaker 3>the entire civilization,</v>

17
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 3>which is not being recorded by history,</v>

18
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

19
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 3>and that it went underwater with the rising sea levels.</v>

20
00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:43.270
<v Speaker 3>And what led me to this [inaudible] the reason I became interested in pursuing</v>

21
00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 3>that line of inquiry was the Ark of the covenant because it seemed to me,</v>

22
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.680
<v Speaker 3>it seemed to me like a piece of technology that was out of its place in history,</v>

23
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.060
<v Speaker 3>in the way that it was described.</v>

24
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm not wishing to put down the spiritual aspects because they are there.</v>

25
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

26
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 3>but there were definite technological aspects to this device.</v>

27
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Speaker 3>And then I had to ask myself,</v>

28
00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:00.731
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

29
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 3>where could that knowledge have come from?</v>

30
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.060
<v Speaker 3>And through Egypt,</v>

31
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.140
<v Speaker 3>we then start to find that Egypt itself looks back to an older time.</v>

32
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 3>The ancient Egyptians did in regard themselves as the beginning of their story.</v>

33
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 3>They regarded themselves as quite a late point in their story.</v>

34
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.080
<v Speaker 3>And they look back to the time of the gods,</v>

35
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Speaker 3>which they called Zep Tepi the first time when there was a golden age.</v>

36
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:21.611
<v Speaker 3>And they speak,</v>

37
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:22.480
<v Speaker 3>and there are texts,</v>

38
00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:22.841
<v Speaker 3>the head,</v>

39
00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 3>foot building texts,</v>

40
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:25.750
<v Speaker 3>which speak of the guards living on an island,</v>

41
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.850
<v Speaker 3>a gigantic flood coming.</v>

42
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Most of the guards are killed.</v>

43
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Odd thing to happen to gods.</v>

44
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.050
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>

45
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:32.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

46
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.730
<v Speaker 3>come and settle in Egypt.</v>

47
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 3>The survivors come and settle in Egypt.</v>

48
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.393
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

49
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Egypt is the product of an even far earlier civilization,</v>

50
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

51
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 2>but the history of Egypt goes back way,</v>

52
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 2>way further than people think it does.</v>

53
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 2>That's my view.</v>

54
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 2>That's my view.</v>

55
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I support that view.</v>

56
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 2>And I was astonished when you had,</v>

57
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

58
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Robert Schoch and John Anthony West,</v>

59
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 2>when they brought their findings about the erosion on the,</v>

60
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

61
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 2>the temple of the Sphinx.</v>

62
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

63
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 2>They brought these findings to these academics and just the,</v>

64
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 2>the tone of their voice,</v>

65
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 2>the way they were approaching the information,</v>

66
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

67
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 2>the mocking attitude that they had of it.</v>

68
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:09.301
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

69
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 2>where is the civilization you speak up because they're talking about a</v>

70
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 2>civilization that was possibly what,</v>

71
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:15.620
<v Speaker 2>10,000 BC or something?</v>

72
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

73
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

74
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 3>I would put the finger right about 10,500 BC.</v>

75
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.273
<v Speaker 3>What people,</v>

76
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know the,</v>

77
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:21.661
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

78
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:21.961
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

79
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 2>the story behind it.</v>

80
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 2>There's water erosion on the edge of the,</v>

81
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:26.661
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

82
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:26.911
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

83
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 2>the tempo of the Sphinx has done that could only be attributed to thousands of</v>

84
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.073
<v Speaker 2>years of rainfall.</v>

85
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 2>The last time there was rain fall in the Nile Valley was,</v>

86
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:33.871
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>

87
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

88
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 3>breakthrough work that John Anthony West and Robert Schoch did?</v>

89
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Did it the initial observation,</v>

90
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

91
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 3>what came through John,</v>

92
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.281
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

93
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:41.881
<v Speaker 3>who is,</v>

94
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:42.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

95
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 3>an astonishingly knowledgeable man about ancient Egypt.</v>

96
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 3>He's not a official Egyptologist,</v>

97
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 3>but he spent his whole life working in ancient Egypt.</v>

98
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 3>And through his research and his background,</v>

99
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:52.441
<v Speaker 3>he came to,</v>

100
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 3>he came to realize that the erosion patterns on the Sphinx are really odd.</v>

101
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 3>And he then went to shock a Robert Schoch at the University of Boston who is a</v>

102
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 3>geologist and an open minded one.</v>

103
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.421
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

104
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 3>would you come to Egypt with me and give me your geological opinion on this</v>

105
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:08.091
<v Speaker 3>monument?</v>

106
00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:09.510
<v Speaker 3>So shock went there and,</v>

107
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 3>and it was immediately clear to him that this monument had been subjected to</v>

108
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years of heavy rainfall at some point in its history.</v>

109
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 3>And that's where the mystery begins because the study of ancient climates is</v>

110
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 3>quite well advanced.</v>

111
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 3>And we know that 5,000 years ago,</v>

112
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 3>four and a half thousand years ago,</v>

113
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 3>when the Sphinx is supposed to have been built,</v>

114
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Egypt was as bone dry as it is today.</v>

115
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 3>And you have to go back some thousands of years before that,</v>

116
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.480
<v Speaker 3>at least to about 9,000 years ago to get the very heavy rainfall that would have</v>

117
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 3>caused the erosion of the Sphinx.</v>

118
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 3>But that only means that the Sphinx was standing there 9,000 years ago to be</v>

119
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:47.104
<v Speaker 3>rained on.</v>

120
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

121
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 3>it may be much older than that.</v>

122
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 3>A shock is cautious and he will not,</v>

123
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 3>he will not push the date back beyond what the hard evidence suggests.</v>

124
00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:57.761
<v Speaker 3>He's willing to,</v>

125
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 3>he is what he does except that the Sphinx may well have stood there,</v>

126
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

127
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 3>before the heavy rains began.</v>

128
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 3>But how long before is a,</v>

129
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 3>is a matter that he cannot be certain on.</v>

130
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:07.894
<v Speaker 3>And that's where,</v>

131
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

132
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Robert Bovard and I were able to take the matter on a little further with the</v>

133
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.620
<v Speaker 3>astronomy of the Giza plateau.</v>

134
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 3>And you find there's this,</v>

135
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 3>just this stunning thing that happens in the sky.</v>

136
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

137
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 3>this is one of,</v>

138
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

139
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.241
<v Speaker 3>the great things.</v>

140
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 3>I have some problems with technology,</v>

141
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 3>but I have to say one of the great things about computer technology is the way</v>

142
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 3>that it can speed up access to information in an incredibly efficient way.</v>

143
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 3>And there are computer programs now,</v>

144
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 3>which we'll show you exactly how the stars were positioned at any time in the</v>

145
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 3>last 30,000 years over.</v>

146
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 3>At any point on the earth's surface,</v>

147
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 3>you can literally wind back the ancient skies and see them.</v>

148
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 3>And this skies do change because the earth is the viewing platform from which we</v>

149
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 3>observe the stars.</v>

150
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.300
<v Speaker 3>There's a wobble on the axis of the earth course session.</v>

151
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.221
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

152
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 3>And the wobble takes 20 to 26,000 years to complete a cycle.</v>

153
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 3>So it's a cyclical process.</v>

154
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Eventually the stars will all return to starting point and begin the cycle</v>

155
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

156
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>

157
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.070
<v Speaker 3>we can say that the Sphinx was gazing at his own celestial counterpart,</v>

158
00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 3>the Constellation of Leo at dawn on the Spring Equinox in 10,000 BC,</v>

159
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 3>while 90 degrees away,</v>

160
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Jews south or Ryan was lying on the Meridian in exactly the pattern of the</v>

161
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 3>pyramids on the ground.</v>

162
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.081
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

163
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 3>John Anthony West go even deeper.</v>

164
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 3>He believes it's like 30,000 BCE.</v>

165
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 3>John John thinks it might be pushed back another processional cycle.</v>

166
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.201
<v Speaker 3>See the we,</v>

167
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 3>we take it back to,</v>

168
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 3>to that 12 and a half thousand years ago.</v>

169
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

170
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 3>but you would have the same alignments and now they're 26,000 years earlier.</v>

171
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 3>So 38,000 years ago,</v>

172
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 3>you would have the same alignments as you had 12 and a half thousand years.</v>

173
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't he based it on actual hieroglyphs to depict the inches of the pharaohs?</v>

174
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.701
<v Speaker 3>And absolutely.</v>

175
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

176
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 3>There's the,</v>

177
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.381
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

178
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 3>this is the area where the Egyptologists,</v>

179
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 3>the academic Egyptologists are incredibly annoying because they will not listen</v>

180
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 3>to what the ancient Egyptians themselves have to say.</v>

181
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.351
<v Speaker 3>It's as though they,</v>

182
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 3>the academics know more about ancient Egyptian history than the ancient</v>

183
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians did themselves.</v>

184
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 3>And the ancient Egyptians were really very clear.</v>

185
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.830
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

186
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 3>they push their history back,</v>

187
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:19.260
<v Speaker 3>well plus 30,000 years offensive.</v>

188
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they,</v>

189
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

190
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.940
<v Speaker 3>why won't they buy a dryer?</v>

191
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.111
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

192
00:06:22.111 --> 00:06:22.944
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>

193
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 3>I wondered that myself.</v>

194
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

195
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 3>when I first got into this,</v>

196
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 3>I initially couldn't understand it,</v>

197
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:28.701
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>

198
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a problem with science in general.</v>

199
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

200
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.413
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

201
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 2>was it a late discovery?</v>

202
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Did they have an established timeline?</v>

203
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.800
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

204
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready.</v>

205
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Just the timeline.</v>

206
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.890
<v Speaker 3>The timeline was set literally in stone,</v>

207
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

208
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 3>over the last sort of last 50,</v>

209
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 3>50 years of the 20th century.</v>

210
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean really burdened by the beginning of the 20th century,</v>

211
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 3>a timeline had been worked out and by the 1950s it was</v>

212
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.290
<v Speaker 2>very much set.</v>

213
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.240
<v Speaker 2>So they are just not willing to consider any previous day.</v>

214
00:06:57.241 --> 00:06:59.460
<v Speaker 2>There would anything goes the whole timeline out.</v>

215
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.140
<v Speaker 2>And because they've been teaching it for so long,</v>

216
00:07:01.141 --> 00:07:02.770
<v Speaker 2>they're reluctant to open up to new ideas.</v>

217
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.741
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

218
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

219
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 3>but also they themselves,</v>

220
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:05.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

221
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.821
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

222
00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not suggesting any dishonesty on their part.</v>

223
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 3>They themselves absolutely believe their version of the past.</v>

224
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.060
<v Speaker 2>And in all fairness,</v>

225
00:07:12.061 --> 00:07:12.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:12.991
<v Speaker 2>Robert Shocks,</v>

227
00:07:12.991 --> 00:07:14.520
<v Speaker 2>depiction of the erosion,</v>

228
00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:15.750
<v Speaker 2>there have been dissenters,</v>

229
00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:16.584
<v Speaker 2>and I've read some,</v>

230
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.760
<v Speaker 2>some different people's pavers,</v>

231
00:07:17.761 --> 00:07:19.530
<v Speaker 2>but they seem very logical.</v>

232
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

233
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I looked at it myself,</v>

234
00:07:21.301 --> 00:07:22.830
<v Speaker 2>I know what water erosion looks like.</v>

235
00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I'm not a geologist,</v>

236
00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:26.340
<v Speaker 2>but when I look at it and you say that that's wind and sand,</v>

237
00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:29.610
<v Speaker 2>and then they showed extreme examples of wind in Santa Rosa.</v>

238
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

239
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.840
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look the same.</v>

240
00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:31.290
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

241
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.030
<v Speaker 2>it looks like there's crevices.</v>

242
00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:34.410
<v Speaker 2>It's been created by water.</v>

243
00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:35.460
<v Speaker 2>It's really obvious.</v>

244
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.353
<v Speaker 2>It really does.</v>

245
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.690
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

246
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.450
<v Speaker 2>and then there's so much else,</v>

247
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

248
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.480
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

249
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.340
<v Speaker 2>that adds to that.</v>

250
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this thinks is not alone there.</v>

251
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.461
<v Speaker 2>There are other,</v>

252
00:07:44.461 --> 00:07:48.450
<v Speaker 2>whether it's structures out there on the Giza plateau or the ones under deep and</v>

253
00:07:48.451 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 2>they find ones that are underground that are these old style construction ones</v>

254
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.140
<v Speaker 2>that were built much like this,</v>

255
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:55.710
<v Speaker 2>the temple,</v>

256
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.220
<v Speaker 2>the Sphinx,</v>

257
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.690
<v Speaker 2>but not like the later stuff.</v>

258
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Then it looks like two different areas of construction.</v>

259
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.101
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

260
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 3>It looks like two phases of construction.</v>

261
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 3>One very ancient,</v>

262
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:07.030
<v Speaker 3>one more recent and they've got muddled up in the academics mind</v>

263
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 2>watching doctor shock.</v>

264
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Try to talk to the Egyptologists about that was,</v>

265
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 2>it was a fascinating thing because the guy got super defensive and he was like,</v>

266
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:18.201
<v Speaker 2>where?</v>

267
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Where is this civilization you're speaking of this 10,000 Polo?</v>

268
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Quick Glance,</v>

269
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:21.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

270
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.823
<v Speaker 2>It was like this,</v>

271
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Marx was mark Laner who's an Egyptologist at the Oriental Institute in Chicago</v>

272
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.830
<v Speaker 3>and one of the lead Western archeologists working in Giza,</v>

273
00:08:31.831 --> 00:08:32.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

274
00:08:32.071 --> 00:08:32.791
<v Speaker 3>and his remark,</v>

275
00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:33.780
<v Speaker 3>which we call it often was,</v>

276
00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:34.614
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

277
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.180
<v Speaker 3>show me the pot shirt,</v>

278
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.800
<v Speaker 3>whereas the pot shit from this,</v>

279
00:08:37.801 --> 00:08:38.970
<v Speaker 3>from this lost civilization.</v>

280
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

281
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:44.660
<v Speaker 3>the argument was at that time that the Sphinx cannot possibly be of that age</v>

282
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.130
<v Speaker 3>because there's nothing else in the world of that age.</v>

283
00:08:47.131 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 3>How could it just be this one unique thing,</v>

284
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.410
<v Speaker 3>which is 12 and a half thousand years old or maybe older?</v>

285
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

286
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.480
<v Speaker 3>there's amazing the monument.</v>

287
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.580
<v Speaker 3>How can that alone then?</v>

288
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 3>So show me the pictures of the rest of that civilization.</v>

289
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

290
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 3>some years later those poachers have started to turn up and they've turned up in</v>

291
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:04.644
<v Speaker 3>Turkey,</v>

292
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.041
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

293
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 3>in the form of a Jaguar,</v>

294
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 3>the a gigantic megalithic circle,</v>

295
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

296
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 3>which dates back to precisely 12,000 years ago</v>

297
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.610
<v Speaker 2>and even has carvings of animals that don't exist anywhere near Turkey on the,</v>

298
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.623
<v Speaker 2>on this thing.</v>

299
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 2>And they're trying to attribute it to hunter gatherers,</v>

300
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.270
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious.</v>

301
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:23.761
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

302
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 3>it's really hilarious.</v>

303
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.050
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

304
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.401
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

305
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:28.130
<v Speaker 3>these were people who had a,</v>

306
00:09:28.131 --> 00:09:30.390
<v Speaker 3>an organized and systematic,</v>

307
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 3>a civilization,</v>

308
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 2>and it was somehow or another intentionally covered up,</v>

309
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

310
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.000
<v Speaker 2>They buried it.</v>

311
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.750
<v Speaker 2>They buried these gigantic,</v>

312
00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 2>like 12 foot tall,</v>

313
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 2>beautiful stone carvings were like lizards on them and stuff.</v>

314
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.920
<v Speaker 3>By the way that the ancient Egyptians themselves decommissioned some of their</v>

315
00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:50.260
<v Speaker 3>temples when they knew their system was going down.</v>

316
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.060
<v Speaker 3>They knew it was going down.</v>

317
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.220
<v Speaker 3>The Romans were the end of it for Egypt.</v>

318
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Egypt thrived through the Greek period.</v>

319
00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.950
<v Speaker 3>When the Greeks arrived in Egypt,</v>

320
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.690
<v Speaker 3>what happened was the Egyptians colonize the Greek mind and the Greeks became</v>

321
00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:05.524
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians,</v>

322
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.970
<v Speaker 3>but when the Romans took over,</v>

323
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.260
<v Speaker 3>it was a different story.</v>

324
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.190
<v Speaker 3>That's my people.</v>

325
00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:10.750
<v Speaker 3>They fat everywhere still.</v>

326
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.681
<v Speaker 3>We're still,</v>

327
00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:12.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

328
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:17.020
<v Speaker 3>That when the Romans made this alliance with Christianity and the the,</v>

329
00:10:17.021 --> 00:10:17.311
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

330
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:17.561
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

331
00:10:17.561 --> 00:10:20.200
<v Speaker 3>the Christian Church pulled on the Jackboot of Rome.</v>

332
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.350
<v Speaker 3>It was Christians who really wanted to take Egypt apart.</v>

333
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.680
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to destroy everything and the Egyptian priests themselves rather</v>

334
00:10:26.681 --> 00:10:29.260
<v Speaker 3>than let their temples fall into their hands in that way,</v>

335
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.010
<v Speaker 3>they went around and destroyed certain things in the temples and they did so</v>

336
00:10:33.011 --> 00:10:33.341
<v Speaker 3>quite,</v>

337
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:37.540
<v Speaker 3>quite deliberately to remove that power from the others who were going to come</v>

338
00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 3>and take it in.</v>

339
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.140
<v Speaker 3>I sit down,</v>

340
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I've only been to a couple places.</v>

341
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I've been to teach an EATSA.</v>

342
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

343
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.020
<v Speaker 2>I've never been to Egypt,</v>

344
00:10:45.021 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 2>but I've been to a,</v>

345
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:46.461
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

346
00:10:46.461 --> 00:10:46.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

347
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.540
<v Speaker 2>one of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston had an Egyptian exhibit.</v>

348
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.050
<v Speaker 2>They had all this amazing old shit and the,</v>

349
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 2>it is so hard to wrap your head around even the established timeline of 2,500 BC</v>

350
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.270
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at the structures,</v>

351
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.010
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to wrap your head around.</v>

352
00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're looking at a beautiful gold and covered sarcophagus that you</v>

353
00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:07.730
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

354
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.260
<v Speaker 2>had king tut inside of it.</v>

355
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.041
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

356
00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:10.610
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

357
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.410
<v Speaker 2>what was that like?</v>

358
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.041
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

359
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:16.430
<v Speaker 2>what kind of a weird alternative way to live.</v>

360
00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:21.431
<v Speaker 2>Did these guys figure out where they [inaudible] ends of years ago figured out</v>

361
00:11:21.471 --> 00:11:25.670
<v Speaker 2>how to build these almost perfect geometric structures of 2 million,</v>

362
00:11:25.671 --> 00:11:30.170
<v Speaker 2>300,000 stones where if you fuck up just a little bit here or there,</v>

363
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.000
<v Speaker 2>by the time you get to the top it's done.</v>

364
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.451
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

365
00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:32.571
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

366
00:11:32.571 --> 00:11:33.770
<v Speaker 2>they did screw up a few of them.</v>

367
00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:34.311
<v Speaker 2>There's a few of them.</v>

368
00:11:34.311 --> 00:11:34.970
<v Speaker 2>The lopsided.</v>

369
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:35.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

370
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:35.361
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

371
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:35.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

372
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.770
<v Speaker 2>But they got them right to who knows who the hell was doing the screw up ones</v>

373
00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:41.030
<v Speaker 2>that could have been imitators hands</v>

374
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.020
<v Speaker 3>were done later.</v>

375
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.700
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

376
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.070
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

377
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.180
<v Speaker 3>by um,</v>

378
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.133
<v Speaker 3>the copiers.</v>

379
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

380
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.310
<v Speaker 3>Basically that's the mystery of Egypt is that that a,</v>

381
00:11:49.311 --> 00:11:50.960
<v Speaker 3>and John West makes this point,</v>

382
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.940
<v Speaker 3>but that it's perfect at the,</v>

383
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 3>and it slowly declines.</v>

384
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 3>This is not what we expect.</v>

385
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 3>We expect to see civilizations slowly rise.</v>

386
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 3>We don't expect to see them perfect,</v>

387
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 3>fully formed at the beginning and then take 3000 years to end.</v>

388
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

389
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Well even when you push back the established timeline and you know,</v>

390
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

391
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.430
<v Speaker 2>we can't even wrap our head around a thousand years.</v>

392
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:11.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

393
00:12:11.761 --> 00:12:14.010
<v Speaker 2>a thousand years is very difficult to wrap her head around.</v>

394
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think it's so difficult for them to embrace the pretty obvious</v>

395
00:12:19.051 --> 00:12:21.780
<v Speaker 2>possibility that things get wiped out?</v>

396
00:12:21.781 --> 00:12:21.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

397
00:12:21.961 --> 00:12:23.700
<v Speaker 2>there's the craters all over the moon.</v>

398
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.550
<v Speaker 2>We know there's all sorts of spots all over,</v>

399
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:26.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

400
00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:28.520
<v Speaker 2>you'll go drive by the giant crater,</v>

401
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:28.921
<v Speaker 2>Nevada,</v>

402
00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:29.910
<v Speaker 2>it's a mile wide,</v>

403
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.331
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

404
00:12:30.331 --> 00:12:31.164
<v Speaker 2>something hits,</v>

405
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.310
<v Speaker 2>everybody gets fucked.</v>

406
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.670
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that easily could have happened over and over again throughout</v>

407
00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:36.260
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

408
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.140
<v Speaker 2>And just the s that seems to me to be way more likely then we made it all the</v>

409
00:12:40.141 --> 00:12:42.150
<v Speaker 2>way from caveman to here without a hiccup,</v>

410
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.190
<v Speaker 3>without a single hiccup.</v>

411
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.173
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

412
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.380
<v Speaker 3>And this leads,</v>

413
00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:45.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

414
00:12:45.651 --> 00:12:45.891
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

415
00:12:45.891 --> 00:12:46.161
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

416
00:12:46.161 --> 00:12:47.360
<v Speaker 3>this leads to,</v>

417
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

418
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.880
<v Speaker 3>it's an,</v>

419
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.250
<v Speaker 3>it led me to conclude that that academic history,</v>

420
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

421
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.961
<v Speaker 3>is part of,</v>

422
00:12:53.961 --> 00:12:54.794
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

423
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.970
<v Speaker 3>this sounds a bit paranoid,</v>

424
00:12:55.971 --> 00:13:00.320
<v Speaker 3>but part of an overall system of kind of mind control that that operates.</v>

425
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:04.010
<v Speaker 3>There are certain things that we're allowed to think and certain parameters that</v>

426
00:13:04.011 --> 00:13:06.200
<v Speaker 3>we are allowed to think within in our society.</v>

427
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.531
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

428
00:13:06.531 --> 00:13:08.090
<v Speaker 3>and when it comes to the past,</v>

429
00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:11.480
<v Speaker 3>those parameters I set by academics and they'd get so territorial,</v>

430
00:13:11.481 --> 00:13:14.180
<v Speaker 3>it's so defensive when you try to break out of that,</v>

431
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:14.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

432
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:15.141
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

433
00:13:15.141 --> 00:13:16.260
<v Speaker 3>and suggest other parts.</v>

434
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:16.401
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

435
00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I thought naively,</v>

436
00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:20.140
<v Speaker 3>when I got into this at first that,</v>

437
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:20.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

438
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.260
<v Speaker 3>those who were specialists in this field would welcome some new ideas.</v>

439
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:24.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

440
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.390
<v Speaker 3>they might throw them out in the end,</v>

441
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.090
<v Speaker 3>but they would want to see whether there was any merit to the ideas.</v>

442
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.060
<v Speaker 3>And so initially I was really shocked that the attitude is,</v>

443
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.241
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

444
00:13:32.241 --> 00:13:33.530
<v Speaker 3>this idea doesn't agree with us.</v>

445
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.900
<v Speaker 3>We are going to destroy this idea in any way we can add.</v>

446
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Not only that we're going to destroy the individuals associated with this idea.</v>

447
00:13:40.281 --> 00:13:42.020
<v Speaker 3>We will attack the man and the idea.</v>

448
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

449
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.391
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

450
00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:45.860
<v Speaker 3>And a very dirty tricks kind of way.</v>

451
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.970
<v Speaker 3>It's only later on actually that I came to realize that academic soul treat each</v>

452
00:13:49.971 --> 00:13:50.930
<v Speaker 3>other this way as well.</v>

453
00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:51.764
<v Speaker 3>They're all there.</v>

454
00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.750
<v Speaker 3>They're all very at very territorial.</v>

455
00:13:53.751 --> 00:13:54.830
<v Speaker 3>They are all ego driven.</v>

456
00:13:54.831 --> 00:13:59.420
<v Speaker 3>They have their power base in a particular view and they defend that view to</v>

457
00:13:59.421 --> 00:13:59.900
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

458
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.600
<v Speaker 3>to the death.</v>

459
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Now when you say the doctor's shock is a very conservative,</v>

460
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:04.220
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

461
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.260
<v Speaker 2>you're not joking around about that and I always wonder when I hear some of the</v>

462
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.660
<v Speaker 2>things that he says about other ancient structures,</v>

463
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.401
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering,</v>

464
00:14:10.401 --> 00:14:10.591
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

465
00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he took too much heat from the Sphinx and now he like backs off on</v>

466
00:14:14.101 --> 00:14:14.720
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

467
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 2>He's very,</v>

468
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.930
<v Speaker 2>the Bosnian pyramid and even the Japanese structure.</v>

469
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:18.330
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

470
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:18.851
<v Speaker 3>I went there.</v>

471
00:14:18.851 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 3>I went there with shock.</v>

472
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.100
<v Speaker 3>He's crazy and shock would not,</v>

473
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

474
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.430
<v Speaker 3>He shut when the shark,</v>

475
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:27.500
<v Speaker 3>a shark would not accept that it was a,</v>

476
00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:29.070
<v Speaker 3>a manmade structure bed.</v>

477
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 3>But I have to say that at that point,</v>

478
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

479
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] is a very difficult dive.</v>

480
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.090
<v Speaker 3>It's a very difficult diet.</v>

481
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 3>The seas are wild.</v>

482
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a huge current flows right in front of the monument and you have to be</v>

483
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 3>an accomplished diver to do any work.</v>

484
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:43.600
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

485
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.600
<v Speaker 3>shock was on his second open water dive at this point and a on those initial</v>

486
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:50.870
<v Speaker 3>dives that we did on Yana Goonie.</v>

487
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

488
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.140
<v Speaker 3>he was largely fighting for his life.</v>

489
00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.600
<v Speaker 2>You guys are balls.</v>

490
00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.823
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

491
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.113
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

492
00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:02.843
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

493
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.130
<v Speaker 3>My wife Santha who's a photographer and I sent this right here with us,</v>

494
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.440
<v Speaker 3>have done um,</v>

495
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:07.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

496
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.740
<v Speaker 3>more than 200 plus dives on the Yana Goonie monument.</v>

497
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:16.210
<v Speaker 3>We went through the process of learning to dive and really getting the skills to</v>

498
00:15:16.211 --> 00:15:17.860
<v Speaker 3>be able to handle that kind of current,</v>

499
00:15:17.861 --> 00:15:21.490
<v Speaker 3>which is literally going to rip your mask off your face and take your regulator</v>

500
00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:22.324
<v Speaker 3>out of your mouth.</v>

501
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

502
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:23.520
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

503
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.590
<v Speaker 3>it's like swimming in a river against the current actually.</v>

504
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.610
<v Speaker 3>So what I would say is that I think shock was a little premature with that</v>

505
00:15:30.611 --> 00:15:31.960
<v Speaker 3>conclusion and I think,</v>

506
00:15:31.961 --> 00:15:32.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

507
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:32.401
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

508
00:15:32.401 --> 00:15:32.651
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

509
00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I have huge respect for Robert Schoch.</v>

510
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.630
<v Speaker 3>I have huge respect for his openness of mind at his geological acumen,</v>

511
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.170
<v Speaker 3>but it not enough time was spent on the monument to reach that decision.</v>

512
00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just one monument.</v>

513
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:43.930
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole complex of monuments.</v>

514
00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:48.670
<v Speaker 3>And further north of settles it for me off a Okinawa,</v>

515
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 3>which is about four or 500 miles north of yonder.</v>

516
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Goonie dairy's a majestic stone circle,</v>

517
00:15:54.551 --> 00:15:56.590
<v Speaker 3>110 feet beneath the water.</v>

518
00:15:56.591 --> 00:15:57.041
<v Speaker 3>Which again,</v>

519
00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:59.290
<v Speaker 3>something I've dived on extensively,</v>

520
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.420
<v Speaker 3>which shock has not seen a,</v>

521
00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:05.520
<v Speaker 3>which is there's just no way on earth that that monument could have been two</v>

522
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.550
<v Speaker 3>photos of this online.</v>

523
00:16:06.551 --> 00:16:06.881
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

524
00:16:06.881 --> 00:16:07.241
<v Speaker 3>we do.</v>

525
00:16:07.241 --> 00:16:08.170
<v Speaker 3>We have photos on my words.</v>

526
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.023
<v Speaker 3>What I look for.</v>

527
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

528
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.121
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

529
00:16:10.121 --> 00:16:12.270
<v Speaker 3>You go onto www dot.</v>

530
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure if I just Google it,</v>

531
00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:15.010
<v Speaker 3>go to Graham hancock.com.</v>

532
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:15.993
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

533
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.590
<v Speaker 3>And then go to gallery.</v>

534
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.813
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

535
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.750
<v Speaker 3>And then go to underwater.</v>

536
00:16:22.751 --> 00:16:24.130
<v Speaker 3>We have underwater on the gallery</v>

537
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.973
<v Speaker 4>underwater.</v>

538
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.880
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

539
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.930
<v Speaker 3>And in the underwater section you're going to see a stone circle somewhere there</v>

540
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.500
<v Speaker 3>with uh,</v>

541
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.660
<v Speaker 3>with somebody above it holding a video camera.</v>

542
00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:38.950
<v Speaker 3>That's me holding the video camera.</v>

543
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

544
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.021
<v Speaker 3>And down on the,</v>

545
00:16:41.021 --> 00:16:44.950
<v Speaker 3>down below you is a stone circle and there's probably some more shots of it.</v>

546
00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:46.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just come around and see what you're looking at there.</v>

547
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.940
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at this right here.</v>

548
00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:49.391
<v Speaker 3>Is that okay?</v>

549
00:16:49.391 --> 00:16:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

550
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.680
<v Speaker 3>that's the stone circle.</v>

551
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:55.950
<v Speaker 3>This is the central upright and these are the surrounding uprights that somebody</v>

552
00:16:56.321 --> 00:16:57.610
<v Speaker 3>made that get out of this thing.</v>

553
00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.080
<v Speaker 3>This thing is 12 feet high.</v>

554
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

555
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.190
<v Speaker 3>And it's 110 feet beneath the sea.</v>

556
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.240
<v Speaker 3>That's so cool.</v>

557
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.080
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

558
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:05.980
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

559
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.660
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

560
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.190
<v Speaker 3>It's the most extraordinary thing.</v>

561
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

562
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
<v Speaker 3>and 110 feet beneath the sea tells us that it was made at least 13,000 years ago</v>

563
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:20.560
<v Speaker 3>because that's the last time that 110 foot level was above sea level.</v>

564
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:21.321
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

565
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:22.101
<v Speaker 2>Well that makes sense.</v>

566
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 2>With Robert Schoch about these ruins,</v>

567
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.050
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese ruins cause there's one of them that really freaked me out.</v>

568
00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I watched a documentary on it where they showed this,</v>

569
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.370
<v Speaker 2>these two monolith,</v>

570
00:17:30.371 --> 00:17:30.611
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

571
00:17:30.611 --> 00:17:31.251
<v Speaker 2>we talked earlier,</v>

572
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I described them as pizza boxes there with the giant stone pizza boxes.</v>

573
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 2>There were so perfectly cut and laying right next to each other.</v>

574
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.520
<v Speaker 2>I would just think you would look at that and you'd have to throw everything</v>

575
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:40.971
<v Speaker 2>else away.</v>

576
00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:41.700
<v Speaker 2>You look at that anyway.</v>

577
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 2>That's not a natural phenomenon.</v>

578
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Somebody,</v>

579
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.160
<v Speaker 2>there's right angles everywhere that sends off.</v>

580
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.250
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

581
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:47.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

582
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

583
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:47.730
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

584
00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:47.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

585
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.110
<v Speaker 3>the beauty and the perfection.</v>

586
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.771
<v Speaker 3>The thing is,</v>

587
00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:50.880
<v Speaker 3>is is part of it,</v>

588
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 3>but part of it which needs to be needs to be taken into account.</v>

589
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.660
<v Speaker 3>I can understand why some geologists feel that it must be natural and this is</v>

590
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:01.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

591
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 3>this is the reason that the stone is a sedimentary stone is laid down in layers</v>

592
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.910
<v Speaker 3>and some of the layers are soft and some of them are hard.</v>

593
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:13.470
<v Speaker 3>And their argument is that the sea battering against these less selectively</v>

594
00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:17.850
<v Speaker 3>removed the soft layers and left the hardware's producing this step defect.</v>

595
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.240
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is that if that happened,</v>

596
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 3>then you would expect to see the very large amount of rubble which was created</v>

597
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 3>by removing all these layers.</v>

598
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 3>You would expect to see it lying in a disorganized mass down at the bottom of</v>

599
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:32.454
<v Speaker 3>the monument,</v>

600
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.061
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

601
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 3>which the tea from top to bottom,</v>

602
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:36.870
<v Speaker 3>the monuments about 70 feet high.</v>

603
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.310
<v Speaker 3>So 70 feet down and all of it's underwater because the,</v>

604
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 3>it's the bottom is about 110 feet below the sea.</v>

605
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.920
<v Speaker 3>So you would expect to find that rubble lying at the base of the monument.</v>

606
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Actually what you do find is a beautiful path cut out of solid rock at the base</v>

607
00:18:51.391 --> 00:18:56.391
<v Speaker 3>of the monument and all the rubble cleared to the side pushed away a forming a</v>

608
00:18:56.461 --> 00:18:57.270
<v Speaker 3>bank,</v>

609
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.330
<v Speaker 3>which is no way on earth that could have been done by nature.</v>

610
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.470
<v Speaker 3>It had to be done by men.</v>

611
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:01.911
<v Speaker 3>That's what peer,</v>

612
00:19:01.911 --> 00:19:02.790
<v Speaker 3>that's what people do.</v>

613
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.661
<v Speaker 3>They clear away,</v>

614
00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 3>rubble,</v>

615
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.940
<v Speaker 3>tidy it up and leave a nice looking site.</v>

616
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.870
<v Speaker 3>And that's what,</v>

617
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:07.560
<v Speaker 3>that's what is,</v>

618
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.191
<v Speaker 3>that's what is there.</v>

619
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:09.600
<v Speaker 3>So it's little details like that.</v>

620
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Plus the fact that there isn't just one monument,</v>

621
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 3>there's actually about five,</v>

622
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.521
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

623
00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Speaker 3>along a good four miles of the coast,</v>

624
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

625
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.690
<v Speaker 3>makes it impossible for me to accept that it's a natural phenomenon.</v>

626
00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.640
<v Speaker 2>And I guess the question comes up when you,</v>

627
00:19:24.641 --> 00:19:29.320
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about ancient monuments are ancient civilizations for 14,000 plus</v>

628
00:19:29.321 --> 00:19:29.950
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

629
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.780
<v Speaker 2>how much really would be left?</v>

630
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.041
<v Speaker 2>It's a long time.</v>

631
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:34.860
<v Speaker 2>The sole long aren't.</v>

632
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.730
<v Speaker 2>We are to put it in perspective,</v>

633
00:19:36.731 --> 00:19:40.330
<v Speaker 2>the House that we're in and 14,000 years will absolutely not be here.</v>

634
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Now if we leave,</v>

635
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:42.910
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be completely gone.</v>

636
00:19:42.911 --> 00:19:44.050
<v Speaker 2>There'll be almost no evidence.</v>

637
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.270
<v Speaker 2>The earth will devour these computers.</v>

638
00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:49.990
<v Speaker 2>It will devour the leather and the table and the chairs to rueful cave in and</v>

639
00:19:49.991 --> 00:19:51.280
<v Speaker 2>we'll all go into dirt,</v>

640
00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:51.551
<v Speaker 2>dirt.</v>

641
00:19:51.551 --> 00:19:52.540
<v Speaker 2>We'll fill it over.</v>

642
00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Lava will come.</v>

643
00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:54.491
<v Speaker 2>Earthquakes,</v>

644
00:19:54.491 --> 00:19:55.750
<v Speaker 2>we'll shift things.</v>

645
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:56.530
<v Speaker 2>He'll be gone,</v>

646
00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.363
<v Speaker 3>will be forgotten,</v>

647
00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:57.881
<v Speaker 3>forgotten,</v>

648
00:19:57.881 --> 00:19:58.630
<v Speaker 3>forgotten.</v>

649
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

650
00:19:59.170 --> 00:19:59.921
<v Speaker 3>it would be very,</v>

651
00:19:59.921 --> 00:20:01.120
<v Speaker 3>very easy for that to happen.</v>

652
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.700
<v Speaker 3>So then consider the effect of ice,</v>

653
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:04.661
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

654
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:05.201
<v Speaker 3>considered it.</v>

655
00:20:05.201 --> 00:20:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Consider the fact that,</v>

656
00:20:06.341 --> 00:20:06.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

657
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.990
<v Speaker 3>during the last ice age,</v>

658
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:13.350
<v Speaker 3>North America and northern Europe were covered with these gigantic ice caps that</v>

659
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.531
<v Speaker 3>you're talking ice,</v>

660
00:20:14.531 --> 00:20:16.300
<v Speaker 3>which is two to three miles deep.</v>

661
00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Your website's getting crushed right now.</v>

662
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Generally do it on your website.</v>

663
00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

664
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.300
<v Speaker 3>what were up to you?</v>

665
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.420
<v Speaker 3>It's getting smashed.</v>

666
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Could use.</v>

667
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:27.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

668
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.630
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people on that soccer.</v>

669
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.493
<v Speaker 3>Glad to hear it.</v>

670
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

671
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

672
00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:31.331
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

673
00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:32.410
<v Speaker 3>so I'm sorry,</v>

674
00:20:32.411 --> 00:20:33.244
<v Speaker 3>I lost my thread there.</v>

675
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:36.803
<v Speaker 3>North America.</v>

676
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:42.220
<v Speaker 3>So the ice forms on the continental land mass of the u s end of Europe,</v>

677
00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.030
<v Speaker 3>it builds up to a depth of two miles and it's in motion.</v>

678
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Consider what's to anything underneath that under two miles of ice.</v>

679
00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.320
<v Speaker 3>It's being ground to a powder to a fine powder.</v>

680
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:53.651
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

681
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:54.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

682
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.110
<v Speaker 3>it's like just wiping out,</v>

683
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.030
<v Speaker 3>literally wiping out the past.</v>

684
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:05.850
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
