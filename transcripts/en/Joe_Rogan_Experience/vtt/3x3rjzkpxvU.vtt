1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>The general good experience for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to win again.</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think for sure he wins again</v>

3
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>because is that because whoever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats decide to put in,</v>

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>is it going to be an equal turd?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandwich again,</v>

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>you're a super smart dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also a bruton.</v>

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Your big giant savage motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>So how many people have underestimated</v>
<v Speaker 1>you because you're a big giant savage</v>

8
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker planning talk stupid to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and acted like you were a moron.</v>

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I'd say equal street fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two fights in the UFC.</v>

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people.</v>

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just people in general,</v>

12
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>like they'll get snotty and take stevie</v>
<v Speaker 1>at tree.</v>

13
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I'm going like my men.</v>

14
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's a certain part of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be doing that with him.</v>

15
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's really good at winning.</v>

16
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>This is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a,</v>

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>not an like an endorsement of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>no caveats necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm horrified by this immigration policy</v>

19
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>of separating children from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

20
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that subhuman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife came out and said that was</v>

21
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His wife's an immigrant bro.</v>

22
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>His wife barely speaks English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos,</v>

23
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

24
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate all that stuff.</v>

25
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>These are just families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just.</v>

26
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>People love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep them together.</v>

27
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>If they break the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep them together.</v>

28
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Get them out of here if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

29
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>if you want to send them back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever they came from,</v>

30
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hell bent on that.</v>

31
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>But taking them from their kids is</v>
<v Speaker 1>subhuman.</v>

32
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not us.</v>

33
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not what we're doing in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That aside all that aside,</v>

34
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>he's probably gonna fucking win again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

35
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I think he's probably gonna win again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he.</v>

36
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>He gets in these confrontations with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they think he's adult.</v>

37
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's.</v>

38
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he can be as successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he bent.</v>

39
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I know he's had his ups and downs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like that,</v>

40
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>but like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just just the way he was able to</v>

41
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>dismantle all those guys in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican debates,</v>

42
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>we told them to fuck apart from apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no business.</v>

43
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>They had no business doing that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

44
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>They just were too emotionally tied up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his responses.</v>

45
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>There was so much negativity and energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

46
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

47
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>There's all this anxiety like a fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>where a guy's in a full panic,</v>

48
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen it like street fights,</v>

49
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>especially guys just go into full panic</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even just talking shit and the school</v>

50
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:29.544
<v Speaker 1>yard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>one guy's getting bullied.</v>

52
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Bullies got the crowd watching them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guys will,</v>

53
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.620

<v Speaker 1>that ain't gonna work.</v>

56
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Kinda,</v>

57
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>that's what the rest of them look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ted Cruz,</v>

58
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>that's what they all looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just been doing this his whole</v>

59
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been talking shit his whole life,</v>

60
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's got a lot of fucking</v>

61
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the economy keeps doing good,</v>

62
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be a hard sell to put some</v>

63
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>guy in there like Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>all the right wing people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wants to give away all your money,</v>

65
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>give away all your money to welfare</v>
<v Speaker 1>brats.</v>

66
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Even the left was protecting against</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

67
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's still money left on the</v>

68
00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should point out,</v>

69
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I know Jack Shit about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very important to point out 100</v>

70
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read all of the works,</v>

71
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them.</v>

72
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>And he is brilliant trainer that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that 100 percent outside of</v>

73
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's explain it to people.</v>

74
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.193
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so me.</v>

76
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say for instance,</v>

77
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.880
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in never being sore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should train the next day she'd wake</v>

79
00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:32.280
<v Speaker 1>up feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

80
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:32.630
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

81
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>How's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

82
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.240
<v Speaker 1>because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

83
00:03:35.241 --> 00:03:35.811
<v Speaker 1>if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

84
00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:36.920
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good example.</v>

85
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

86
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.420
<v Speaker 1>let's see your energy levels of second</v>
<v Speaker 1>about fit people by the way,</v>

87
00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:42.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you met every human being,</v>

88
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>every guy has never worked out before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

89
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.450
<v Speaker 1>they never called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible to work out and not be</v>

90
00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:48.284
<v Speaker 1>sore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

91
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.160
<v Speaker 1>You okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

92
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.540
<v Speaker 1>So let's say there's something called cr</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate of perceived exertion.</v>

93
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say I make you do pull ups and</v>

94
00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:00.890

<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>

95
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.080
<v Speaker 1>The maximum amount of bullet is 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep a nice round number at 11.</v>

96
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.940
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't do 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I put a pointed a gun at you,</v>

97
00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:08.774
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't do 11.</v>

98
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Should I make you do 10 pull ups on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>workout?</v>

99
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:15.520

<v Speaker 1>five and then we're gonna do six.</v>

103

<v Speaker 1>You've only done 10 pull ups.</v>

108

<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

111
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.980
<v Speaker 1>if you add up at the end of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who trained more,</v>

112

115
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.180

<v Speaker 1>but you kill yourself.</v>

116
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.100
<v Speaker 1>You do five rounds each day you kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push yourself.</v>

117
00:04:58.101 --> 00:04:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Those last two rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you burn yourself out.</v>

118
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I still did 15 year at 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the year I've done</v>

119
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>countless rounds and what I may have had</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much more training than you.</v>

120
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.590
<v Speaker 1>So how much training can we pack in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>week?</v>

121
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much volume can you expose your</v>

122
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:16.440
<v Speaker 1>athlete too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I always tell people,</v>

123
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.640
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

124
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.950
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise can produce energy.</v>

125
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.760
<v Speaker 1>So let's say I'm feeling like a seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of 10,</v>

126
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.980
<v Speaker 1>10 being I'm really energized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

127
00:05:24.981 --> 00:05:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like really lethargic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling like I need to lay down and</v>

128
00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:29.810
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling good.</v>

129
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I get up and I do a right amount of</v>

130
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.300
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right amount,</v>

131
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I can feel like an eight point five</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise can give me a tonic effect,</v>

132
00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:41.600
<v Speaker 1>like drinking this coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say I just do some jumping</v>

133
00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:43.040
<v Speaker 1>jacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit the back for a couple rounds.</v>

134
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you get that high,</v>

135
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go into the phase where your</v>

136
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>body's beat up tight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken up,</v>

137
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.410
<v Speaker 1>don't redline the body that's only for</v>
<v Speaker 1>training camps for pe for a small period</v>

138
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:56.231
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

139
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Because you get a little bit more from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system,</v>

140
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>but in the long run you get less in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>long run.</v>

141
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>You've tax the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you do that regularly,</v>

142
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.160
<v Speaker 1>by the time you actually get good</v>

143
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.290
<v Speaker 2>broken up is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

144
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.920
<v Speaker 2>a realm of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a realm of knowing that these things</v>

145
00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:16.930
<v Speaker 2>give access to that's normally close to</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

146
00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a trivial statement of</v>

147
00:06:18.971 --> 00:06:20.310
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

148
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.060
<v Speaker 2>but then you get down to questions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>how verifiable is that?</v>

149
00:06:25.061 --> 00:06:26.890
<v Speaker 2>How real is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

150
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:06:28.751 --> 00:06:33.751
<v Speaker 2>and people get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the term is hung up,</v>

152
00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:37.450
<v Speaker 2>but they can get baffled when you start</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

153
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality of say the entities you</v>

154
00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:44.530
<v Speaker 2>encounter on dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>

155
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.560
<v Speaker 2>this is some people I know are obsessed</v>
<v Speaker 2>with trying to verify the reality of the</v>

156
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:55.090
<v Speaker 2>entities that you find on dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

157
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:57.130
<v Speaker 2>it comes down to if you experienced</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

158
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.180
<v Speaker 2>they're real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If anything you experienced is real</v>

159
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.330
<v Speaker 2>because you've experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it have a corresponding existence</v>

160
00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:09.720
<v Speaker 2>in the external world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

161
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's external?</v>

162
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Let's eating turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

163
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.140
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

164
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 2>we throw around these terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

165
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.280
<v Speaker 2>these epistomological metaphysical terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite carelessly without really thinking</v>

166
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean when you say,</v>

167
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm in here and you're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 2>and then you take a psychedelic and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that's an artificial boundary.</v>

169
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all one.</v>

170
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 2>There is no separation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's separate in normal consciousness</v>

171
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:40.250
<v Speaker 2>though it's separated in normal</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious.</v>

172
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.820
<v Speaker 2>But then what is normal conscious if not</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reflection of year,</v>

173
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 2>neurochemical brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

174
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you experience is an altered</v>

175
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 2>state because it's filtered into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

176
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.060
<v Speaker 2>processed by the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the brain is a biochemical engine</v>

177
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>

178
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 2>often were made out of drug,</v>

179
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.760
<v Speaker 1>but it seems that our normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is the best state to</v>

180
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:10.240
<v Speaker 1>propagate biological life and to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>our Aes,</v>

181
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.040
<v Speaker 1>our whatever we've created in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our community structures and</v>

182
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.300
<v Speaker 1>relationships and friendships and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to build structures and houses</v>

183
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:20.830
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

184
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.950
<v Speaker 1>all of these things are done best when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're here and present.</v>

185
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Whereas when you're on a psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

186
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:27.970
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

187
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:32.770
<v Speaker 1>the way I've always described it as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a meeting with God and you went</v>

188
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 1>and God gave you all the answers to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and you,</v>

189
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.740
<v Speaker 1>you experienced undeniable beauty in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most extreme form possible where you</v>

190
00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:44.860
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have imagined it and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>came back.</v>

191
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Whether you hallucinated it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the exact same experience.</v>

192
00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't put it on a scale right way</v>

193
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.000
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we've stretched the tape measure</v>

194
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>and God is 47</v>

195
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 2>inches across like just because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

196
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Just because you can't measure it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we term our,</v>

197
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.543
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

198
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our metrics for reality.</v>

199
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is exactly the thing.</v>

200
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about whether it's real and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we would define real.</v>

201
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 2>Is it good information or is it bad or</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it not?</v>

202
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter where it comes from,</v>

203
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.540
<v Speaker 2>it's such a good information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it has its own internal validity of</v>

204
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.300
<v Speaker 2>whether it came from some part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that is normally obscurity you</v>

205
00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:36.770
<v Speaker 2>or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from the teacher or the aliens</v>

206
00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:38.210
<v Speaker 2>transmitting it through.</v>

207
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little wet,</v>

208
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.750
<v Speaker 3>but I just remember being a kid and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>my uncle like wasn't married or had</v>

209
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:45.670
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always like,</v>

210
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.680
<v Speaker 3>what's up with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>

211
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.600
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's partying.</v>

212
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Seems a go on the bill Maher route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you burp?</v>

213
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 3>But without getting me into the alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a Bill Maher character?</v>

214
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.760
<v Speaker 3>You do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw you did it.</v>

215
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 3>You went to those people who didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people.</v>

216
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.040
<v Speaker 3>You're not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

217
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 3>There is no god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

218
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know everything.</v>

219
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I kind of do agree with a lot of what he</v>
<v Speaker 3>says.</v>

220
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart guy that shows a weird</v>

221
00:10:24.231 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody talking over each other.</v>
