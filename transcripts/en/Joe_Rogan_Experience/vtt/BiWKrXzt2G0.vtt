<v 0>and we're back</v>

19
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.700
<v 2>from the depths from a very controversial podcast yesterday.
Brian Reichel.
Yeah,</v>

20
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.720
very controversial.

21
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.720
A lot of people were upset that I cut you off a bunch of times.

22
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.000
Well you know,

23
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.180
I love y'all but y'all is the king of the ear beatings and I was just trying to

24
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:42.060
keep everything moving in retrospect.
Um,

25
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.510
having you on the podcast is a good idea because people will be introduced to

26
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:49.260
his work because he's got a lot of interesting research that he's done.
But,
uh,

27
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.970
the,
the best way to do yawns podcast is to do his podcast,
you know,

28
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.790
to do ours.
We try to make an entertaining with his,

29
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.880
I don't have a worry about it being entertaining and can just be myself and just

30
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.670
kick back and relax.
But when it's mine,

31
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.070
I feel a certain responsibility and I love yawn,

32
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.220
but I'll talk to him on the phone and he gives me fucking ferocious ear beatings

33
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.070
for row.

34
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.790
He called me up the other day for 20 minutes talking to me about Gordon Wasson

35
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:18.990
and how Gordon Wasson is in the CIA and he was in the CFR and you know,

36
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:22.680
and he is responsible for the whole mushroom movement and how much of it is

37
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:25.560
filled with disinformation and all these elites know about this and see,

38
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:29.580
he hits me with this,
which is,
you know,
it's kind of interesting information.

39
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.380
It's definitely interesting information,

40
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.900
but it's the way this information is distributed.

41
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:38.520
He's the reason why he's such a good researcher is because he's a kind of an

42
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:41.910
obsessed guy.
He gets nutty about shit and it's the right way to be.

43
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.910
If you're going to be looking up documents all day cause you are high but

44
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:46.380
fucking add out of it.

45
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.250
And we would just be playing video games an hour later we would totally give up.

46
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:52.970
This fucking guy is not having a TV for years,
you know,

47
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.490
and he's been living up in the woods.
He lives up in a cabin.

48
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.140
I mean he's the real deal.
You know,

49
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:03.141
he's a fascinating cat and but for an interview for a guy like tried to get them

50
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:07.570
to just hang out with us and he wanted to do a lecture,
you know,

51
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.630
he wanted to like go over all of his sources and cite all it.

52
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:14.080
And I understand that he's done a lot of work and he's trying to cite his

53
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:17.200
sources because a lot of that stuff,
you know,
it's very controversial.

54
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.530
The subject matter and people want to know that you've actually done the work

55
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:24.580
and researched,
you know,
the actual,
the actual history of a,

56
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:26.860
of what you're talking about.
But God damn,

57
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:29.200
it's hard to listen to it and a podcast when you just trying to have a

58
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:31.300
conversation with a dude.
Right.
Some people,

59
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.500
some people have a hard time with the concept of a conversation on the podcast,

60
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.210
but because it's on television or rather,
uh,
on the Internet and because it's on,

61
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.020
you know,

62
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.890
you can watch it on Ustream because it's being watched all of a sudden it

63
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.470
becomes like this formal thing.
You know what I'm saying?

64
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.590
Like it becomes like something where you're,
you know,

65
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.290
because so many people are there looking at it,

66
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:57.360
you want it somehow or another to be stayed and professional and respectable.

67
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.910
<v 4>Yeah.
I think he doesn't leave that world that much.</v>

68
00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:06.490
I almost feel like that he's in it 100%.
Okay.

69
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.380
The fact that he over a obsesses about it and the only entertainment he has,

70
00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:12.750
his maybe planking or something like that.

71
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.350
What does planking exactly cause I keep hearing about this planking it,

72
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.490
it's this weird thing,
uh,

73
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.560
that where you just lay and a straight stiff as a board in places like you go

74
00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:29.670
outside in the middle on sunset and you just lay down on your back stiff as a

75
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:33.960
board and it almost looks like everybody knows people doing.
Yeah,
I know.

76
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:35.130
I think had a lot of people are like,

77
00:04:35.131 --> 00:04:38.360
what the fuck's going on over there doing this right?
Yeah.

78
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.020
People I've like tried to do really crazy planking planks.
What?
Yeah,

79
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:47.670
they try to plank off of like nine storey balcony the fuck up.
Yeah.

80
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:48.540
I meant to their death.

81
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.500
I've seen people plank where they climb up one of those light poles in a parking

82
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:56.680
lot and lay on top of one of those and playing for a couple of hours.
Yeah.

83
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.040
Jesus fucking Christ would have done way to die.
Die.

84
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.520
I planked at that hotel the other day that last that that is your planking down

85
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.830
into Haiti's and just thinking about what an idiot you are.

86
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:14.010
That your last few moments as you go plunging of the sidewalk.

87
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.250
So dumb for an Internet joke.
Yeah.
It's just,
I don't,

88
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.630
I,
I,
I don't,
I guess it's,
what is it?

89
00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:24.750
Is it a form of performance art or something like that or it's just,

90
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.270
to me what it looks like is broken people.
Like,

91
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:30.120
like if you look at a video game and there's like a glitch and there's like a

92
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:33.090
person laying sideways,
that's what I consider it as.

93
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:36.410
That's why I love it cause I'm just like,
yeah,
it's broken people,
you know,
it's,

94
00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:40.470
it's like the,
our system as a is like,
you know,
it's like a lecture,

95
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.740
<v 2>a buggy system.
It's like when we used to get those Beta releases a video games.</v>

96
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.010
Yeah.

97
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.310
And that'd be like clipping problems where you can walk through walls and shit.

98
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.240
That's what it is.
Yeah,
absolutely.
I did not know about this.
There's,

99
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.300
there's so many goddamn people and there's so much information out there that

100
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:58.580
it's impossible to know about every fucking weird thing people are doing.

101
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.721
It's literally,

102
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:04.370
you think you've got a good catalog of people's behavior until you run it.

103
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:07.760
A furries.
Are you talking about?
Do you run into planking or you know,

104
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:11.420
you hear what?
Some new thing.
It's so great when you find a new thing too.

105
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:15.320
I remember when I found out about furries,
that was like the past two weeks.

106
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:17.420
You should've been here.
When I came back from Pittsburgh,
man,

107
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.920
there was a convention of them in Pittsburgh.
I got a lot of information.
Did you,

108
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.500
you say you went to the convention?
I saw them.
I didn't go to the convention.

109
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:27.050
It was coincidental that there was a UFC in town,

110
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:30.860
the furry same weekend as this big furry convention.
I think it was planned.

111
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.820
I think UFC fighters are,
and to know the UFC fucked up,

112
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.730
they had to get people's hotels way outside of the city.

113
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.700
It was a real pain in the ass for the fighters because,
because,
yeah,

114
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.640
because the furries,
I'm not bullshitting.
I'm not bullshitting.

115
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.450
So the idea with furries is you're just taking on an alternate identity as a

116
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:52.100
stuffed animal or like a mascot and you don't talk.
You use grunts.

117
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.970
We talked about it in depth when I got back because I was so amazed that this

118
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.270
was a real thing and I didn't know about because I thought,
you know,

119
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:02.920
I'd heard the term furries man and it just,
it was like symbol,

120
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.690
a distant thing like oh you know furries.
Oh yeah,

121
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:08.120
they're under wearing rubber or something like that.
You know what I mean?

122
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:09.880
Like one of those things where you,
what?

123
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.660
What is that called when people are under wearing rubber,

124
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:14.260
the rubber latex and shit.
Some,
some people,

125
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.450
there's people that are like really into like really tight latex rubber shit.

126
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.800
So I thought it was kind of like that.

127
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:22.820
Just some weird freaky thing that a just a small group of people are into,

128
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.210
but I did not know they had their own fucking language and they have like

129
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:27.950
meetings at the meet at several times.

130
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:30.710
Do you have any shit and litter boxes and they eat food out of bowls.

131
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.110
Like animals,
like the deep man,

132
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.260
they don't wash and chase each other around like animals.

133
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:38.540
That was the weirdest thing when we were driving or watching these two people

134
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.060
chase each other around.
I think I was sniffing the other guys,

135
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:45.950
but I run it around trees.
I mean they're acting literally like animals.

136
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:48.620
It's so fucking strange.
I want to say planking furries.

137
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.420
That's what I think they should do.
They do it.
I bet if you take off the,

138
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.730
the mass of first,
you're going to find a planker really,

139
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.350
surprisingly normal group of people.
You think.
I think,

140
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.750
I think people,
there's a lot of people out there.

141
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:07.751
I think it's that Thoreau quote that many men live lives of quiet desperation at

142
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.310
the row.
So yeah.
Um,

143
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.570
I think there's a lot of people out there that are so disenchanted and

144
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:19.490
disenfranchised with whatever boring existence they might have stumbled into it

145
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:21.090
and are now stuck.
You know,

146
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.190
there's a lot of us that live like that stack and they're fucking bored man.

147
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:29.240
And they want something else.
And even if it's dressing up like a fucking mascot,

148
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.740
like a giant Fox and running around grunting with people,
fuck it man.

149
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.590
It's like at least you can be free of the programming for a little bit.
I mean,

150
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.300
if you're a guy who works in an office,
all right,

151
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:46.510
for eight hours a day meant this podcast is a way more accurate representation

152
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:50.600
of how most men sit around and bullshit and talk.

153
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.350
Then the kind of conversations you're allowed to have in the office,
right?

154
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:57.420
When you're allowed to have something,
when the office,
you have to be respectful,

155
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:00.640
you have to be business like you have to be.
And I totally appreciate it.

156
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.820
All that.
And if you know,
if your wife is working in some office,

157
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.940
you don't want cock jokes flying left and right and you know,

158
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.840
everybody being uncomfortable.
This one guy,

159
00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:09.620
he's always telling dirty jokes and you know,

160
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.020
I totally get the idea of the working environment where people are,

161
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.380
but the idea that you have to not be you for eight hours a day,

162
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:24.640
I think he's terrible for you to like put yourself in a little box like you know

163
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.860
was a,
hello Mr. Johnson.
Good to see you sir.
And the one part is just being nice,

164
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.470
but when you want to say something fucked up,
I fucked up.

165
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.020
Thought crosses your head and you've got to squash that thought.

166
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.430
You've got to put it away like,
oh,

167
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:37.810
this person's not going to be able to handle this Joe,

168
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.830
or this subject is off limits.
That's not good.

169
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.610
<v 1>Well,
no,
it's terrible for you.
It's,
and what it is is it's a,
it's a game.</v>

170
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.960
It's like the office is a game and there's very specific rules where this,

171
00:09:49.961 --> 00:09:52.240
and when the game starts in the beginning of the day,

172
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:57.400
there's a boss and suddenly this person who's just like you has authority over

173
00:09:57.401 --> 00:10:02.110
you and can control,
basically controls your life and the food for your kids.

174
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.100
And so you have to speak in a certain language dictated by the corporation.

175
00:10:06.101 --> 00:10:11.101
It's this terrible fucking game that people forget is a game and they begin to

176
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:14.410
think,
oh no,
this is the way you're supposed to act.
This is real life.

177
00:10:14.411 --> 00:10:18.640
And that's when you get like that B of a song.
Did you ever see that B of a song,

178
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.710
that Bank of America Song,
do you ever see that?

179
00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:24.000
And it's like somebody filmed this corporate Ma uh,

180
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.600
announcement of a merger between B of a and a and another bank and it's a guy

181
00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:31.750
sang to youtube is one,
uh,

182
00:10:31.751 --> 00:10:34.150
this song that he wrote about Bank of America.

183
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.150
And it is what it will make your eyeballs roll back into your head with such

184
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.770
existential horror.

185
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:46.250
It's seeing these brainwashing drone who's obviously spent like a week writing

186
00:10:47.531 --> 00:10:51.280
the lyrics to this song and is passionately,
oh my gosh,

187
00:10:51.281 --> 00:10:56.281
minutely I'm singing the lyrics to how Great Bank of America is as a

188
00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:59.770
corporation.
I think we should be able to play this on the pile.
You absolutely,

189
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.440
I believe it was a corporate video that was made by Bank of America,
right?

190
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.080
That was sent out to his employees,
know it.

191
00:11:08.081 --> 00:11:13.081
Somebody had a camera out during this like moment where some kiss ass who know

192
00:11:13.151 --> 00:11:14.320
how to play guitar

193
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.070
and everybody in the audience is clearly like,
they seem uncomfortable to me.

194
00:11:21.071 --> 00:11:23.860
They're just like,
oh fuck.
You know what it reminds me of?

195
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.400
It reminds me of a cult.
It,
it's like a cult.

196
00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:32.401
The feeling there is that of a people who've gotten absorbed into a colt to,

197
00:11:32.511 --> 00:11:33.580
that's the only way to put it.

198
00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:38.581
It's like they believe crazy shit that is only even known by a relatively small

199
00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:45.121
group of people and it's their entire lives banking the bank of America way,

200
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.830
the way that we do business.

201
00:11:47.831 --> 00:11:51.190
He's singing about the way they do business and it's kind of obscure banking

202
00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:53.990
terms in the song.
Really,
really want to hear about

203
00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.590
<v 5>it.
It sounds fucking awesome.</v>

204
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.080
This can be found on youtube under bank of America's things.
Youtube is one.

205
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.640
I just want to say before you press play,

206
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.030
I'm looking forward to this almost as much.
I'm looking forward to the new Conan,

207
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.290
<v 6>um,</v>

208
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:16.290
some guests who have been so impressed with your results to date and they've

209
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:22.981
listened to the plans being described today and I continue to be excited about

210
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:27.790
what's going to be the card business today and beyond.

211
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.220
And that is Jim Dubois,

212
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.550
who is the consumer market exact for the Manhattan market.

213
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.320
<v 5>What's odd?
Why would listen to all this nonsense?</v>

214
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:41.070
Who is one of our banking center manager is a long winded fellow,

215
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.400
whole song together for you.
So we'll sign together for you.
Oh,
we,

216
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.030
we miss those guys' names,
which is probably for the best.

217
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.860
We don't want to diss them.

218
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.280
<v 0>Whoa.
Is this real?
Go full screen.</v>

219
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.170
<v 5>Yeah,
it is.
Huh?</v>

220
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.733
<v 0>Oh No.</v>

221
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.650
<v 5>Now that we're the same.</v>

222
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.200
Two great companies come together.

223
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.563
<v 0>No</v>

224
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.890
<v 7>MBN.
Hey is Beagle Bay.
Oh No.</v>

225
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.990
And this one bag.

226
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.460
One con one name that's no,
no.

227
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.180
<v 5>Whoa.
One spirit.</v>

228
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.880
We can't the Sherry

229
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.400
<v 7>pleading a salt to highest,</v>

230
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.740
<v 3>eh,</v>

231
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.040
<v 5>by the way is also like a 40 year old bald guy that doesn't look anything like</v>

232
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:54.350
hipness at home.
Yeah.
He's like Larry David younger brother.
Yeah.

233
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.810
Can going to do the whole thing.
Yes,
please.
Do you get that?
The cowboys,

234
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.610
cowboys,
all you.
Are you nervous at sea?

235
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:11.620
This is amazing.
Incredible example.
Yeah.

236
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:12.380
Or is it

237
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.310
<v 7>Nasscom or your speed,
but he's got to bring that got coffee.</v>

238
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.950
<v 5>Meanwhile,
the guy's got a good voice.
He's got a real good voice.
Right.</v>

239
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.080
He doesn't have a soul.

240
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.980
This is the kind of songs that you say when you don't have weed in your life.

241
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.350
When they look regularly,
piss testing,

242
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.710
you see this guy gets pissed tested on the regular.

243
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.570
This is what sobriety gets here.
He can sing.

244
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.970
<v 3>Aw,</v>

245
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.150
<v 5>I can't do that.
No,
I can't sing like that.
It's great in his church choir.</v>

246
00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:47.600
I bet he kills it in the church choir.
Do you think he wants deck?

247
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.540
You already had it.
You come to me.
I don't know.

248
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.380
I feel like I feel like I'm going to be honest.
I feel like someone could,

249
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.830
his wife come to mainly in the field,
like there's an opening there,

250
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.850
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Probably have.
You know he's got more,

251
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:05.930
I live in looking into this.
He's got more of a BTK killer,
right?

252
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.040
What is it?
A BTK killer throws on underwear.
It strangles,

253
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.940
boy grows on women's underwear.
Whoever.

254
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:17.810
This guy isn't it that whoever this guy is,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:19.760
With dyspnea and we don't mean it,

256
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.570
you're really would like to do is we will offer you a hug and some weed and

257
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:27.590
you're very pixelated.
On the video.
So we're just judging by pixilations mostly.

258
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.820
Well,
I mean,
I don't know.
I mean,
I think you got,
maybe I'm just an asphalt,

259
00:15:30.821 --> 00:15:34.090
but we're totally assholes.
I don't feel empathy for that guy.
Oh,

260
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.390
he's just a guy now.
He's a banker.
He's got a job.
It's supporting his kids.

261
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.470
Listen,

262
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.510
<v 1>satanist,
he's a member of the church.</v>

263
00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:43.690
If quote of the Corporate Church of Lucifer,

264
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.490
he's singing him idols.
Some devil,
I don't fuck him.

265
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.060
Please.
Just think of the people he's exploiting.

266
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.450
Just imagine working in a cubicle next to that cock sucker.

267
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.620
He's riding his shitty song and he's bringing you in and running it by you all.

268
00:15:59.621 --> 00:16:03.550
Like,
Ooh,
hearts is Tom Fart.
You're having a smell.

269
00:16:03.551 --> 00:16:07.840
That guy's this cause thing.
Emissions.
Ooh,
Ooh.

270
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.380
He's like,
I hate that.

271
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.270
I just know he torments people.
I know.

272
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.980
I just know he torments underlings.
That's,
and that's why I haven't no computing.

273
00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:23.490
So yes,
I see.
I saw him

274
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.190
<v 8>as like a fatherly figure in the office,
gives out a lot of hugs,</v>

275
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.720
but always had a desire to be a singer.
And then this is a,

276
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.450
this is what he put together and then a few people,
if his office,

277
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:37.520
we're proud of them.
A bunch were very embarrassed.

278
00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:40.640
It's very embarrassing and it's going to be a lot of talking behind closed
doors.

279
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.520
But there's a few girls,
like if you chubby secretaries,

280
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.660
the thought he did awesome.

281
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.630
<v 1>Oh yeah.
I mean I,
I don't,
I,
I'm sure that there is other brainwash drones.</v>

282
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.020
Carl did such an excellent job.

283
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:58.540
I really felt are higher standards coming through his songs.

284
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.120
He really represents the B of a higher standard.

285
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.650
The moment where he starts singing one day,
you know,

286
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.250
like coming together where he's like,

287
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:14.170
when you realize that he's really doing this is really going full of emotions

288
00:17:14.171 --> 00:17:18.070
about a bank passion.
It's his life and he's,
it's his team.

289
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.340
Passionate about being on team B of a,
yeah,
and they made a merger.

290
00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:24.500
You didn't even eat,
he gets kind of nasty later on in the song where he kind of,

291
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:29.770
this is another bank.
Wells Fargo.
No,
no.
One of the lists,

292
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.480
one of the lyrics is what's in your pocket.
It's not capital one.

293
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.450
Capital one.

294
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:43.040
<v 8>How does capital one,
what'd you yeah,
fuck capitol.
Fuck all of them,
right?</v>

295
00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:44.870
Yeah.
We need a system.

296
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.660
<v 1>I don't have a PR.
I mean,
whatever.
What the coins Bro.</v>

297
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.160
Big sorta here works on online,

298
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 8>right?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't,
I still don't,</v>

299
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:53.790
I don't understand what bitcoin is.

300
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:57.920
Some shit used to by dod characters online is a dod.
Nice.
So I wasn't caring.

301
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.880
What's dod?
Dungeons or dragons.
Like dragons.

302
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.330
What do they old if fucking playing dungeons and dragons.
Okay.
Hey,

303
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:09.290
let's trade coins guys.
Just bitcoin thing is a,

304
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.420
an online currency that they're experimenting with.
Kids are doing these days.

305
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.610
<v 9>Yeah,
I know.
I know.</v>

306
00:18:13.611 --> 00:18:17.710
Cause it's the only way you can give money to Julian Assange just with bitcoin

307
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.070
and it's kind of complex.

308
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.590
<v 8>He's so cutting edge.
I want to hang with him.</v>

309
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.850
I bet he would say embarrassing shit.
The chicks though.
Julianne?
Yeah,

310
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.260
he'd get a little cocky.
You did.

311
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:31.750
You get a little cocky and let's say something embarrassing.
Like what?
Oh,

312
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.040
I dunno.
Well,
I dunno.
[inaudible] wants to be that guy.
You know,

313
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:37.440
he's that guy because he wants to be that guy,
you know,

314
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.770
I mean even his an non emotional response to everything,
you know,
stayed.

315
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.500
It's all calculated.
You know there's a,

316
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:50.501
this is the real Julian Assange is a video of him dancing if you ever seen it.

317
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.110
Yeah,
but that's what I was just thinking.
You got to see it.
Pull up the video,

318
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.790
pulled the video.
Juliet asage dancing.
What's he doing?

319
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.910
He's just a dude.
Okay.
He's dancing off freaking crazy.

320
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.430
And there's nothing wrong with dance and freaking crazy.
Don't get me wrong,

321
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.330
but when I see you do that,
I know you got some personality in there.
Yeah.

322
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:14.010
This whole,
you know,
this,
this thing that you're doing this,
this,
this weird,

323
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.400
you know,
stayed response to everything and dancing.
You know,
it's like,

324
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.210
it's like this just chosen plain of emotionless.

325
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.110
You know this and now you know,
this house arrest in the hall.
I mean,
he's like,

326
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.800
he's that guy.
You know what I'm saying?
He's a celebrity.
No,
fuck.
Yeah,
he is.

327
00:19:28.801 --> 00:19:31.860
He's giant too personal and,
and you know,
and he's doing some good things.

328
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:34.960
Don't get me wrong.
A lot of good things.
Yeah.
Not,

329
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.880
not criticizing any of his work.
I'm just saying it's a,
he's a character,

330
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.600
you know,
he's fascinating.
Well know what it is.
Is there

331
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:46.110
<v 9>is a,
um,
when you,
it's the showmanship.
Yeah.</v>

332
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.560
It seems kind of weird when,

333
00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:50.650
when it's placed in such a close proximity to activism,

334
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:55.060
it's when it's like those two things never mix well together,

335
00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:58.570
which is why anonymous is so fucking cool because they don't have,

336
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.580
you don't know who it is,
you never see them.

337
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.110
It's just this robotic voice talking and so their egos don't get into the mix

338
00:20:05.111 --> 00:20:09.640
and it makes them so much more powerful than when you've got a human being and a

339
00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:12.420
human being's ego and who and,
and,

340
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:17.430
and the ego when it gets put into the spotlight always is magnified.

341
00:20:18.161 --> 00:20:21.940
Even if you have a very refined personality that you've been working on.

342
00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:27.070
Once you get into the moral realm of things that your ego just really sticks

343
00:20:27.071 --> 00:20:29.530
out.
And I think that's what you're seeing.
That's what everybody sees.

344
00:20:29.531 --> 00:20:34.120
I posted is mastercard commercial.
Then you wiki leaks,
mastercard,
commercial.

345
00:20:34.121 --> 00:20:37.420
I don't know if you saw it or not.
No,
it's,
it's cool.

346
00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:42.160
But somebody posted on my Twitter,
they were like,

347
00:20:42.161 --> 00:20:44.440
why does he always got to put his face on everything?

348
00:20:44.441 --> 00:20:48.010
Why does he always have to do that?
Isn't Wiki leaks bigger than him?

349
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.770
Isn't the movement bigger than him?
As the mascot

350
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.280
<v 2>said in the cult of personality days that we're living in,</v>

351
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:55.540
I'm just gonna assume he thinks this.

352
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.200
I don't really know that he thinks is and the cult of personality days that we

353
00:20:59.201 --> 00:21:04.120
live in today,
that maybe it would be a good thing to have a figure head.

354
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.690
Someone who people get attached to and follow them around and you know,

355
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.740
you get invested in what's going on in their life like,
or Kim Kardashians,

356
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.600
but for information.

357
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:18.570
<v 9>Yeah,
Steve Jobs.
I think that Steve Jobs,
well,
no,
I know.
Absolutely.
I mean,
listen,</v>

358
00:21:18.571 --> 00:21:22.500
it's,
I,
it's,
I think it's a very desirable place to be.
It's,

359
00:21:22.501 --> 00:21:24.390
it's for a human being.
It's,

360
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.390
<v 2>I don't even just think that.
I think maybe he thinks it helps you think</v>

361
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.280
<v 9>get,
there's this,
I'm just playing devil's advocate.
No,
I know.
It does allow,</v>

362
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.410
<v 2>when you do have some sort of cult of celebrity type thing going on,</v>

363
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.510
it does allow you to have a certain amount of guaranteed attention to a subject.

364
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.150
<v 9>This is why I think a non of the model that anonymous is using for Hacktivism as</v>

365
00:21:45.151 --> 00:21:45.984
they call it,

366
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:51.140
is so much better than the model wiki leaks is using is because when someone

367
00:21:52.171 --> 00:21:56.820
from anonymous gets arrested or they say they caught someone from anonymous,

368
00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.730
it doesn't seem to affect anonymous at all.

369
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.940
If someone from supposedly from anonymous,
you know,

370
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.220
got caught doing some shitty thing,

371
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.960
it doesn't really affect anonymous because they,

372
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.320
no one knows how many people are in the organization.

373
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:16.130
There meaning like the people that are there are a nominee.
I'm a Nissen,

374
00:22:16.131 --> 00:22:19.470
isn't it?
But yeah,
that's what's so cool about all connected.

375
00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:23.730
They communicate with each other.
And when the
band,

376
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.730
what's your name?
Voodoo there.
I'm sure that they,

377
00:22:26.731 --> 00:22:30.900
I mean obviously there's gotta be some organizing force in,
in that group,

378
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.470
but we don't know what it is.
And so because of that,

379
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.280
it makes them a million times more powerful because if one of them gets taken

380
00:22:38.281 --> 00:22:40.110
out,
it's like,
think of al Qaeda,

381
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.220
Al Qaeda is this network of terrorists and um,

382
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.630
the face of al Qaeda for awhile as a Sama bin Ladin so when you have a face to

383
00:22:48.631 --> 00:22:49.860
your organization,

384
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:54.240
now you've got to target and people can attack that target.

385
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.240
It's like when they,
now you know,
and the mainstream news,

386
00:22:57.241 --> 00:23:02.070
they always say like there's a new face to al Qaeda and at some other guy and

387
00:23:02.071 --> 00:23:05.550
you just feel so bad for that guy because you know he's going to get killed.

388
00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:08.910
Like that guy is next to get shot by a drone or whatever.

389
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.740
But that weakens al Qaeda.

390
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:15.000
Al Qaeda would be so much more powerful if nobody knew who their leader was.

391
00:23:15.001 --> 00:23:15.160
Right.

392
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.240
<v 2>No,
dude,
you're giving out a good plan to the enemy right now.</v>

393
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:23.930
<v 9>The enemy.
Yeah.
Right.
The bank and ruin our way of life.
Yeah.</v>

394
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.930
Like al Qaeda,
I bet.
Allocate it tunes into the Joe Rogan experience.

395
00:23:27.931 --> 00:23:32.430
They never know bro.
We're in a national son.
I got downloads from New Zealand.

396
00:23:32.431 --> 00:23:34.560
Holla at your boy.
You know this man,
they're pretty smart.

397
00:23:34.561 --> 00:23:38.880
Maybe they just put these like figureheads out there just for like just for fun.

398
00:23:38.881 --> 00:23:43.110
Maybe bin Ladin was just like at somebody's maintenance guy and they're like,

399
00:23:43.111 --> 00:23:46.040
hey,
would you mind playing the part of the leader of my organization?

400
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.380
<v 4>Who knows?
The problem I had,
by the way,
going back to the Bitcoin,</v>

401
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.690
the problem I have with Bitcoin is that I heard that recently it was actually

402
00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:57.770
hacked and so that's just right there.
It shows you that you don't want your,

403
00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:59.630
you wouldn't be able to have your currency in your hand.

404
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:03.550
While it's great in theory and everything like that,
it's,
it's still like,
do you,

405
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.380
are you going to invest in Bitcoin or you're going to put really real money in

406
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:09.290
the vague bitcoin and actually that's a gamble.

407
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.200
<v 8>Well,
right now I think there's,</v>

408
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.940
there's no real way to completely secure anything.

409
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:17.140
Right,
right.

410
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:22.140
You mean the hackers eventually figure out almost anything if there wasn't any,

411
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:26.080
is there weren't any criminal penalties for hacking into systems?

412
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.860
Imagine what more that would accomplish if we didn't arrest the best ones.

413
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.580
You know,
I mean like get him jobs,
get a job,

414
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.750
but you're now CEO of Facebook minute character.
He got arrested,

415
00:24:37.751 --> 00:24:42.070
legit and when he got out he wasn't even allowed to go online for a certain

416
00:24:42.071 --> 00:24:46.560
amount of time.
That would suck.
You detach yourself from the,

417
00:24:46.561 --> 00:24:50.530
the cultural experience.
How do they make sure you're not going online though?

418
00:24:50.531 --> 00:24:53.560
How do they keep you from doing that?
It's a good question.
I Dunno.

419
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.940
They might just say it and if they find evidence that you did during your

420
00:24:57.941 --> 00:25:01.760
violation of parole,
they probably put a chip in.
Yeah.
Oh,

421
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:05.670
you're a hacker while you get this chip.
A chicken dog.
Like a dog.
Yeah,
it's,

422
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.840
I could follow you around.
Yeah,
I bet.
If some people,

423
00:25:07.841 --> 00:25:10.330
if you ask them that you want to be let out early and you have a chip that you

424
00:25:10.331 --> 00:25:11.620
keep for the rest of your life,

425
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.500
we'll let you out a year early and put this chip in there and keep it for the

426
00:25:14.501 --> 00:25:17.080
rest of your life so they always know where you are.
A lot of people would say,

427
00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:19.840
okay,
yeah,
but whole fucking year out of jail.

428
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.700
But people would just cut that chip out.

429
00:25:21.701 --> 00:25:25.090
So you have to put it somewhere like inside your penis,
your penis.

430
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.430
Cause he wouldn't fucking try this dude's,

431
00:25:27.431 --> 00:25:31.030
it would peel open their declicker catfish that would open the deck up like a

432
00:25:31.031 --> 00:25:35.560
cat first.
Try to find,
I don't think they're not,
go go to BME.

433
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.550
Go to the body modification.
Extreme.
Yeah.

434
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:44.050
Fucking this dude's do all kinds of horrible shit to the decks.

435
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.420
There's dudes that there a guy out there somewhere.
If uh,
if uh,

436
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.340
you came up to him and go,
hey man,
I want to eat your cock,

437
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.530
put it on a hot dog roll for me.
Chop it off.

438
00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.590
This guys that would chop off their jacket put out just because that's the

439
00:25:56.591 --> 00:26:00.310
ultimate,
I don't give a fuck move.
You want to go hardcore on me,

440
00:26:00.311 --> 00:26:01.960
I'll go hardcore for you.
You know,

441
00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:06.370
if you're working or rather you show up and there's a a bar and the guy who was

442
00:26:06.371 --> 00:26:10.690
working as nose rings and lip rings and his ears are stretched out and he's got

443
00:26:10.691 --> 00:26:14.080
a tattoo on his face and he's got,
I don't know.

444
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.620
But if you saw that guy with all knows things and ear things and lift things and

445
00:26:17.621 --> 00:26:20.960
he said chop it,
took off and put it on a bun from me,
he might go,
yeah batch.

446
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:25.660
He might just slice off his cock for you.
Then you're back to hacking Facebook,

447
00:26:25.661 --> 00:26:28.570
raise back,
back to hacking Facebook.
What do you mean?

448
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.990
Cause we were talking about putting the chip and the Dick.
Yeah,

449
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.520
well yeah you wouldn't,
you wouldn't,
you wouldn't allow that.

450
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:38.790
I heard some story about in Serbia there is this a bar that had,

451
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.040
was having like every week they're having to see

452
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.290
<v 9>who would be,
who is the most bad ass.</v>

453
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.820
And so they were doing stupid shit like punching each other and then burning

454
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:52.800
each other and was getting really intense.

455
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.650
And one of the guys said to the other guys,
like,

456
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.950
I'm going to go outside and I want you to cut off my fucking head.

457
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.760
And he went out there and the guy chops his head off.
Yeah,

458
00:27:01.761 --> 00:27:05.870
I asked them to do it and it was like the ultimate,
he won basically.

459
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.860
Cause he went,
yeah.
Yeah,
I think it was in Serbia.

460
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.670
Now this,
by the way,
that story,
I did not verify

461
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:21.790
<v 5>Google that one.
Let's pretend that's the one thing that I hate about Google.</v>

462
00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:23.650
I don't want to lose stories like that.

463
00:27:23.651 --> 00:27:26.080
Like there's certain stories that I won't Google.
No,
no,
no.

464
00:27:26.081 --> 00:27:30.740
I'm keeping that one fiction real.
It might be about Sasquatches.

465
00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.610
I don't give a shit that one.
I'm not even googling.

466
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.240
Well it's like fairy tales back in the day.

467
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.010
Somebody told you about the legend of Johnny Appleseed and or just like I,

468
00:27:37.011 --> 00:27:40.060
I have no idea to know if this is real.
So it's real to me.

469
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.030
Nobody thought Johnny Appleseed was real,
but you know,

470
00:27:43.031 --> 00:27:47.500
apple sits real nobody son who actually was the only one I got to come out and

471
00:27:47.501 --> 00:27:50.780
say that I've kind of thought Johnny Appleseed,
there's a real,

472
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:55.600
he's a real person.
It's based on historical facts as we have the documents.

473
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.960
Let me get my documents.

474
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:03.270
<v 9>Uh,
there wasn't it,
I thought there was a guy went around.</v>

475
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.620
<v 5>No,
it was a real all,
I don't,
I don't think it's real,
but um,</v>

476
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.440
I'm going to never look into the chop the head off story.

477
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.550
I can kind of see it though.
I can chop the head off stores super drunk.

478
00:28:13.551 --> 00:28:14.384
You've been eating,

479
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:19.490
drinking a shitload of Serbian vodka and you probably want to end your life

480
00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:23.640
anyway.
Your life sucks.
You're crazy.
It's like the ultimate,

481
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.250
I don't want a bunch of people every week you stabbing each other and fucking

482
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:29.670
burning each other and you're like,
let's just end this by the way,

483
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.600
and this and I win.

484
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.170
It's the ultimate like flipping over the table when you're playing cards and

485
00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:36.600
you're losing,
you know,
Johnny Appleseed is real by the way.

486
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.470
You introduced apple trees to Ohio and Indiana and Illinois.

487
00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:44.400
I don't even know what they're talking about.
[inaudible] story as to what is it,

488
00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:46.110
what is the Johnny Appleseed story?
Uh,

489
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.050
he became an American Legion while still alive large it because,

490
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.910
because of his kind and generous ways,

491
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:55.260
he had great leadership in conservation and he was like,
he pretty much had,

492
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.780
was really important to apples and back then,

493
00:28:57.781 --> 00:29:01.830
you know like a lot of people use apples were way more popular back then because

494
00:29:01.831 --> 00:29:04.770
we didn't have to read those,
you know,
so he was like a pioneer for apple.

495
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:09.550
So you actually pretty much brought apples to different parts of the country
and,

496
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.300
Huh.
Wow.

497
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.220
And I know this because Ohio was one of the bigger parts that grew apples and he

498
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:15.210
brought two and stuff like that.

499
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.350
The name Johnny Appleseed to me sounds so cartoonish that for some reason I

500
00:29:19.351 --> 00:29:23.850
always thought it was like a Disney cartoon story.
Born John Chapman,

501
00:29:23.851 --> 00:29:25.470
Johnny appleseeds,
what they call it.
I'm kind of like,

502
00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:27.350
cause he was like a superhero of Apple's since.

503
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.650
Was there ever a movie and they made a movie?
I'm sure there was.

504
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.170
I'm sure there were really a Johnny,
I'm sure.
Well,
he was,

505
00:29:34.171 --> 00:29:38.490
became more of a legend in really boring schools and stuff like that.
You know,

506
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.220
whenever we talked to them,
all the legendary figures,
he is pretty fucking

507
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.880
<v 9>boring.
I mean,
he's never wasn't exciting figure.
He went around planning APP.</v>

508
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.190
<v 5>Yeah.
It's like getting behind those superheroes that don't have powers.</v>

509
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:53.240
It's like what?
Oh,
back then it was like,
wow,
you're bringing me a really good,

510
00:29:53.241 --> 00:29:55.490
delicious food I've never had before.
You know,
it's great.

511
00:29:55.491 --> 00:29:58.370
It becomes to your neighbor and that didn't have an apples for your first time.

512
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.030
Like,
Hey,
I'm so tired of eating poop and stuff.
And then they're like,
oh,
apple,

513
00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.830
what dessert?
I'm saying what?
He's doing it

514
00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.590
<v 9>awesome.
No doubt about it.
I just didn't think it was a week.</v>

515
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.570
I didn't know what the story was.
I thought it was like,
uh,
you know,

516
00:30:11.571 --> 00:30:14.360
I thought it was like a Winnie the pooh thing.
Can I change the subject?
Sure,

517
00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.853
please do.

518
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:17.843
<v 5>It's cause you mentioned,</v>

519
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:24.360
I don't know what it is about Johnny Appleseed,
man.
Fucking conversation killer.

520
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:29.840
<v 9>Um,
uh,
have you,
did you order the walking dead comic books yet?</v>

521
00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.670
No.
No.
I just finished the entire series.

522
00:30:32.671 --> 00:30:34.820
Is that I have never gotten addicted to a comment.

523
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.870
I think I did when I like years and years ago.
But did you tell me this already?

524
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:42.320
Did we talk about this already?
I know somebody else did.
I,

525
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.140
we talked about on the phone,
right?
Because that was how long ago was this?

526
00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.870
This is a few weeks ago.
Okay.
But might've been you.
It probably was.
Yeah,

527
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.960
it is the,
if you,
if you read the,

528
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.650
<v 5>you told me about it.
I actually haven't,
I,
I forgot to download it.</v>

529
00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:59.560
<v 9>So what's awesome about this series is,
and the,
in the,
um,
the,</v>

530
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.450
the show is cool to the show that came on.
What was the IFC AMC,
I can't remember.

531
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.740
That was awesome too.
But these comics mat,

532
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:12.210
they are such an accurate portrayal of what it would be like to try to survive

533
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:18.331
during a Zombie attack with society collapsing that you become engrossed in

534
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.590
their struggle for survival much more than just,
you know,
zombies biting people.

535
00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:28.030
It's not like a Gore novel or Gore Comic Book,
even though it is gory,

536
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:33.180
it's more of like the character arcs are so fucking cool because you just see

537
00:31:33.731 --> 00:31:37.030
these different characters go from being,
you know,

538
00:31:37.031 --> 00:31:39.880
thinking that they're going to get through it or things are going to end or

539
00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:40.840
things are going to get better.

540
00:31:40.841 --> 00:31:43.030
And then realizing that things are never going to be better.

541
00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:46.090
And watching the way personalities change it kind of,

542
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.680
it focuses on the idea of how society collapsed.

543
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.740
People would go crazy pretty fucking fast.

544
00:31:53.741 --> 00:31:57.370
Like there'll be some people who maintained ethics and morality,

545
00:31:57.371 --> 00:32:02.260
but there'd be a lot of other people who immediately just discarded those things

546
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.620
and put their survival first no matter what.
And it's awesome.

547
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.210
<v 5>It's like it's a free application too.</v>

548
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:09.790
Is it just like the first issues is free and then you can download the APP?

549
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.190
Probably.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's called the walking dead on the APP

550
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.720
<v 9>story.
It's so good,
man.
I,
I,
in the last two weeks,</v>

551
00:32:15.721 --> 00:32:17.580
I think I've spent over 200 bucks.

552
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.950
<v 5>Serious,
serious.
I got hooked.
I couldn't stop.
So there's a lot of issues.
Yeah,</v>

553
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.160
there's
bad.
I got hooked.

554
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:27.890
Stop.

555
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.970
<v 9>It's the best it turned off.
Yeah.
If you,
you will.</v>

556
00:32:31.971 --> 00:32:36.860
It's one of the best gifts you can give yourself because it is fucking brutal.

557
00:32:36.861 --> 00:32:40.880
They don't pull any,
it's just like they don't to soften anything.

558
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:45.140
There's no attempt to do the thing that movies do where it's going to,
you know,

559
00:32:45.141 --> 00:32:48.650
it Kinda gets better.
There's no attempt in not,
there's no attempt at that.

560
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:53.330
It's just realistically any more about how the stories go?
Ah,
yeah.
Yeah.

561
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:56.010
That's not really a spoiler.
There's a load of issues.

562
00:32:56.510 --> 00:33:01.090
<v 8>Damn.
They all have like five stars.
Yeah.
Wow.
This is awesome.
Well,
is it a,</v>

563
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:04.220
does it follow the same plot as the TV show or is it completely

564
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.900
<v 9>different?
Uh,
it Kinda,
I mean there's,
yeah,</v>

565
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.570
and the TV show and this,
I don't want a spoiler alert.
What do you say?
No,
no,
no,

566
00:33:12.571 --> 00:33:15.220
no.
I don't want to hear it.
You see the CV show?
No,
you haven't seen it.
Yeah,

567
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.250
<v 8>I just haven't seen it all.
I've only watched one episode.
Okay.</v>

568
00:33:17.251 --> 00:33:20.040
Well then I won't say anything,
but it kind of one episode I watch and I'm like,

569
00:33:20.041 --> 00:33:22.620
this show's good man.
I'm going to fucking start watching this.

570
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:23.370
And then I stopped.

571
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.890
<v 9>It's,
it's vaguely,
it is similar.
They added some characters that are,</v>

572
00:33:26.891 --> 00:33:30.640
the comic book is more brutal a million times and really at times better.

573
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:31.960
This is a million times better.

574
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:35.350
1 million times better be in a million's a big number.

575
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.580
A quadrillion times better.
But is that how many Zeros?
I just looked that up.

576
00:33:39.581 --> 00:33:42.740
It's like,
Oh man,
I had a hundred billions or something like that.

577
00:33:42.741 --> 00:33:45.220
I just looked it up and like a thousand trillion.
Is that what it is?

578
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.440
It's so funny that you should ask that because I was on Wolfram Alpha yesterday

579
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:55.680
trying to calculate how much money it would take to give everyone in America $1

580
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.050
million.
And it was something like $1,000,000,000,000,000.
Cause I thought,

581
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:04.200
I was thinking that if we took the Forbes magazine billionaires and we took all

582
00:34:05.411 --> 00:34:09.100
their money away and just gave it to everybody in the United States,

583
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.630
there'd be like the entire population of the United States.

584
00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:15.100
It'd be happy and they'd be like 20 pissed off rich guys.
Like who cares?

585
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:16.360
But as it turns out,

586
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.950
it's not that much money when you break it up among all those.

587
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:22.060
<v 8>Yeah.
And the real,</v>

588
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:27.310
the real problem with given everyone $1 million is that within a week,

589
00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.660
half of them we broke.

590
00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:35.680
If you gave everyone $1 million,
like you said,
this is life.
Okay,

591
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:41.080
we are going to absolve all money and all debts and everyone on the planet is

592
00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:45.430
going to get $1 million if that was the new money.
If like we've said,

593
00:34:45.431 --> 00:34:48.490
we're all going to start equal and then we'll barter from there within two

594
00:34:48.491 --> 00:34:49.240
months.

595
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.810
Should it be people that will have giant corporations where they have billions

596
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.300
of dollars and there would be people that were totally broke and there'd be

597
00:34:55.301 --> 00:35:00.210
people sucking Dick for fucking rent money
systems.
Corolla.

598
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.830
Yeah.
I didn't get your break.
You caught a break.

599
00:35:02.831 --> 00:35:05.890
You lucky piece of Shit fucking come after you.

600
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.920
And there's gonna be people that blow it all in Vegas and it's going to be

601
00:35:08.921 --> 00:35:12.220
people that blow it all on fudge.
You know?

602
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:16.890
<v 9>It's true.
Man that there are,
uh,
people who are just seem like,</v>

603
00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.560
well,
no,
it's not even that crazy.

604
00:35:19.561 --> 00:35:23.160
It's like if you have a canoe and the,

605
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.390
the rider on the canoe or the rudder on the ship is fucked up,

606
00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.140
the ship's going to go in circles.
That's just the way it works.
And some people,

607
00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:35.700
they have this psych,
psychological rudder that's fucked up in their lives.

608
00:35:35.701 --> 00:35:39.840
And so they always,
why you see people always going through the same patterns?

609
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.580
Like you know,
I have friends where I've watched them,
you know,

610
00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:47.970
again and again and again and again basically just to repeat the identical

611
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:51.030
mistakes over and over again,
but with different variables.

612
00:35:51.031 --> 00:35:52.950
But it's the same failure equation,

613
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.070
but they're always just plugging in the same shitty variables,
you know,

614
00:35:56.071 --> 00:36:00.120
like buying a house,
buying a car without getting it checked out first.

615
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.670
And what do you know the car broke down and what do you know?

616
00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:05.550
The car dealer won't give me any money back cause I signed a contract when I

617
00:36:05.551 --> 00:36:08.070
bought the car.
Yeah.
You know,
that kind of shit was weird.

618
00:36:08.071 --> 00:36:09.300
They don't fix themselves.

619
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:12.540
They keep on doing the same shit and they're not learning from their mistakes,

620
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:16.260
which seems so odd.
I know so many people like that also just blows my mind.

621
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:19.680
I think that's what Karma is.
When you know,
they talk about someone's Karma.

622
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.440
I think that's what it is.
It's like this series.

623
00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:26.400
It's a combination of genetic factors,
the way they look,

624
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:31.260
mixing in with some thought constructs,
the way they perceive reality.
And,

625
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.710
and those two things kind of meet together to make them always just repeat the

626
00:36:34.711 --> 00:36:36.300
same weird fucking cycle.

627
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.610
<v 10>I can't imagine what it's like to be in the mind of a schizophrenia.</v>

628
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:41.690
I can't imagine what it's,

629
00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:46.100
what it's like to be in the minds of anyone with any like real serious,

630
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:50.060
debilitating or a disease,
mental disease.

631
00:36:50.061 --> 00:36:53.120
Anything that makes you delusional or see life from a weird,

632
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:58.100
so whenever I see someone in a real bad pattern,
I,
there's parts of me that says,

633
00:36:58.101 --> 00:37:02.750
well,
I wonder if they have a,
a very slight mental illness,
you know,

634
00:37:02.751 --> 00:37:05.750
or a mental illness that's,
you know,
I mean,

635
00:37:05.751 --> 00:37:08.180
there's gotta be grades of mental illness.
You know,

636
00:37:08.181 --> 00:37:12.650
there's gotta be a spectrum from really completely bat shit,
Charles Manson too,

637
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.560
you know.
Whoa,
you're just a little,
you've got,
I know,

638
00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:20.590
we all know people that have like a distorted perception of reality and they

639
00:37:20.991 --> 00:37:24.830
twist reality up to kind of suit their purposes for the here in the now,

640
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.870
you know,
I think there's,

641
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.130
there's a spectrum of crazy and a lot of people that repeat things over and over

642
00:37:31.131 --> 00:37:35.030
again and repeat it.
There's a little crazy there.
It's maybe not a lot,

643
00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.930
but there's some crazy,
there's,
there's some disconnects,
you know?

644
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.070
And how does that lead into,
you know,
full blown,
completely insane,

645
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.440
fucking shooting up a post office?
I mean,
is it,

646
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:49.100
is it the same path or is there different paths from when the one,
you know,

647
00:37:49.101 --> 00:37:52.960
the ones a few steps of crazy,
but I think a lot of us have mental illnesses.

648
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:54.181
<v 9>Well,
that,</v>

649
00:37:54.181 --> 00:37:59.181
that's the concept of mental illness is all right.

650
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.280
Sometimes I'm skeptical about certain things that people in this society,

651
00:38:04.471 --> 00:38:08.790
common mental illness,
because it gets really confusing.
Where you know,

652
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.790
for example,
take depression,
um,

653
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:17.520
the diagnosis of depression,
uh,
what goes along with it as a,
you know,

654
00:38:17.521 --> 00:38:21.030
environmental factors are you under stress is something shitty happening in your

655
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:21.301
life.

656
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:25.950
But then also it apparently has something to do with a serotonin deficiency and

657
00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:26.521
your brain.

658
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:30.420
And so you take these antidepressants and they're called serotonin uptake re

659
00:38:30.421 --> 00:38:30.961
inhibitors,

660
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:35.310
and they make it so that that serotonin kind of accumulates in your brain,
it a,

661
00:38:35.311 --> 00:38:36.144
um,

662
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.560
<v 1>uh,
so that it doesn't,
so that you have more serotonin,</v>

663
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.380
then you start feeling better.
Um,

664
00:38:40.381 --> 00:38:43.210
and that's all based on this diagnosis of depression.

665
00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:45.860
But it seems to me that there,

666
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.980
even the label depression is fucking up.
What it really is,
what's route,
what,

667
00:38:51.981 --> 00:38:54.370
what's happening with these people is not depression.

668
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:59.520
Depression makes it sound like it's like you got a cold or poison ivy or the flu

669
00:38:59.591 --> 00:39:04.090
or uh,
or,
or a rash or something like that.
I don't think that's it.

670
00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:05.470
I think that depression is,

671
00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.810
you're not interfacing with reality in the right way.

672
00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:14.560
You're not seeing how beautiful reality really is.

673
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:19.340
You're not understanding the potential that you have.
And that's resulting in a,

674
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.810
and not wanting to wake up in the morning and wanting to escape by sleeping all

675
00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:25.870
the time.
So when doctors start saying,
no,
no,
no,

676
00:39:25.871 --> 00:39:29.680
you have an endogenous depression and I'm going to prescribe to you

677
00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:34.570
antidepressants.
It's like they're avoiding the real thing that's happening.

678
00:39:34.571 --> 00:39:38.410
Not now.
People who are on antidepressants,
if it's helping you,
it's great.

679
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:43.210
But I think that in a way,
well,
I'll just admit it.

680
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:45.790
I was on antidepressants once when I was in college.

681
00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:50.290
I got on antidepressants and because I was fucking depressed,
obviously

682
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:55.780
I fucking hated life.
Everything.
I mean,
it was worse than hating life.

683
00:39:55.810 --> 00:40:00.340
It was like I couldn't feel anything.
I literally could like feel no emotion.

684
00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.330
Was it because of a girl or was it because of a reason of any kind?
You know?
Uh,

685
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:07.390
I don't think it was because of a girl and I'm sh definitely it was because of

686
00:40:07.391 --> 00:40:11.170
her or reason.
And you know,
I don't know how deep I want to get,
get into that,

687
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:13.180
but I'm sure it has a lot to do with like family shit.

688
00:40:13.181 --> 00:40:17.980
And just the model that I grew up in and not understanding,
um,

689
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.160
you know,
not understanding a lot of the stuff that I understand now,

690
00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:25.300
things just seem kind of grim beyond grim.
So they put me on a future scene,

691
00:40:25.301 --> 00:40:29.170
grim or life,
not even,
you don't even,
you don't even enjoy your life.

692
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.120
It's like when somebody puts a rubber band around your finger and you can't feel

693
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:37.540
it.
It's like somebody has done that to your instincts.

694
00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:41.690
<v 10>Before we go any further,
I just want to stop right here for a second and say,</v>

695
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.900
you know that we're not passing any judgment on how your mind works and no,

696
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.710
no one can ever say what's going on in this person's mind.
I don't know.
I mean,

697
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:56.120
I have a thyroid problem and I take a,
I take thyroid pills for it.

698
00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.370
It's called a hypothyroidism.
It's genetic,
it's runs in my family.

699
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:04.610
My mother has it.
Um,
so there's a part of me that doesn't work right.

700
00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.640
How do we know?
I don't know how your brain works.

701
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:10.580
There could be a part of your brain that's not working correctly and

702
00:41:10.581 --> 00:41:14.390
supplementing it with certain chemicals that they treat antidepressants with

703
00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.433
could help you.

704
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.980
So the idea that we're saying that everyone is depressed for the same reasons I

705
00:41:18.981 --> 00:41:22.860
think we should write and no careful about that.
Sure.
I didn't,
I,

706
00:41:22.861 --> 00:41:26.240
I'm sorry if it's no,
but you're talking from your own personal experience,

707
00:41:26.241 --> 00:41:30.620
which is,
it's true for you,
but I know people who need it.
I know,

708
00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:33.470
I know quite a few people who it's changed life.

709
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:38.060
So I don't know how his brain works.
I would like to be him for a day.

710
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:39.710
I'd like to figure out what the fuck that's all about.

711
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.530
I would like for you to be me for a day and figure out what the fuck this is all

712
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:47.420
about.
You know,
I think,
um,
I was trying to,
you know,
in part our,

713
00:41:47.421 --> 00:41:51.170
our,
our thoughts on antidepressants,
it's very easy to say,

714
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.840
you got to pull up your fucking boots and you know,

715
00:41:53.841 --> 00:41:57.200
tighten that belt and fucking get to work and stop being such a pussy.

716
00:41:57.201 --> 00:41:59.150
And I think there's,
there's some people,

717
00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:01.520
there's a legit chemical issue is an imbalance.

718
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:06.470
<v 1>Well,
I'll tell,
I'll tell you what I did.
Well,
I was on the shit called,
so loft,</v>

719
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.540
right?
Couldn't come it like made it to the eye,

720
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.040
<v 10>couldn't fucking calm.
That's the shit that Phil Hartman's wife was on,</v>

721
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:15.500
which killed him.
I didn't know that they want a lawsuit.

722
00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:16.600
I don't know how much one or they got,

723
00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:21.320
but she was on Zoloft and cocaine apparently,
which makes you completely crazy.

724
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:25.970
Zoloft and cocaine together apparently incite some sort of a psychotic reaction.

725
00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.400
<v 1>Well,
what happened?
Allegedly,
I didn't know.
Dot like psychotic,</v>

726
00:42:30.401 --> 00:42:32.020
but it was definitely put me in this like,

727
00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:36.400
I don't wouldn't call it a better place,
but a more tranquil place.
It was like,

728
00:42:36.401 --> 00:42:37.510
there was some tranquility.

729
00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.770
But what ended up happening is I went on like a week and a half long camping

730
00:42:41.771 --> 00:42:46.600
trip out in the woods,
uh,
and just,
and,
and stop taking the antidepressants.

731
00:42:46.601 --> 00:42:51.370
And it was out,
you know,
way out in the fucking woods with,
you know,

732
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.640
which is the coolest thing about going on a really long camping trip is no

733
00:42:54.641 --> 00:42:55.450
mirrors.

734
00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:58.960
You don't have a mirror to look at yourself and you forget how important mirrors

735
00:42:58.961 --> 00:43:03.730
are or how like looking at yourself is this fascinating thing that people do all

736
00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:04.360
day long.
That kind of,

737
00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.180
you look at yourself to see how you look or where you're at or you look tired or

738
00:43:07.181 --> 00:43:11.680
you look happier,
your hair's fucked up when that's gone,
it's awesome.

739
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.830
You're not looking now,
you're now the reflection is in other people.

740
00:43:14.831 --> 00:43:18.370
The way that the people you're hanging out with are reacting to you.

741
00:43:18.371 --> 00:43:22.270
Their reflection is in nature instead of in the mirror.
And anyway,

742
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.590
I like by the end of that camping trip,
I felt happy.

743
00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:31.210
I felt stable and like good and like connected and the world seemed beautiful.

744
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:34.910
It was like I just needed to get outside.
I just needed to get,

745
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:39.670
get out of the environment that I was in and like be in the presence of like

746
00:43:39.671 --> 00:43:43.960
real nature with like with hawks flying in the air.
I uh,

747
00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.950
he really did.
I mean,
I don't want to say it fixed me,

748
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:52.660
but it definitely the effect of just being a nature for eight days exceeded the

749
00:43:52.661 --> 00:43:57.661
effect of being on Zoloft for six months by a hundred times.

750
00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.990
And so what I'm saying is yeah,
definitely people have,

751
00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:07.260
I mean think of is the fucking very complicated computer floating around in our

752
00:44:07.691 --> 00:44:08.560
skulls here.

753
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:13.560
And you can't think that everyone's computer is just going to function correctly

754
00:44:13.571 --> 00:44:18.370
or there aren't going to be some wires that are mixed up.
But I,

755
00:44:18.371 --> 00:44:22.570
I'm not certain that psychiatrists when they prescribed these antidepressants

756
00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:28.890
are also suggesting alternate ways to live in ways that to,

757
00:44:29.231 --> 00:44:31.830
and I know that some people take the antidepressants conjunction with

758
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.230
psychologist,
but again,

759
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:38.070
to me it seems like it,

760
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:41.370
it seems like when you go to a psychologist while you're on an antidepressant,

761
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:46.290
maybe you're distancing yourself a little bit from some emotions that you really

762
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:51.060
need to be feeling.
Some places that you really need to be.
Now I agree with you.

763
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:55.080
If you're on antidepressants out there and they're helping you keep taking the

764
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:56.250
fucking antidepressants,

765
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.770
but if you're on antidepressants and you just kind of feel

766
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.150
like you're putting a bandaid on something or Numb,

767
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:08.420
there are other ways to escape from the evil grip of depression,

768
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.100
which is the worst man.
I do have some like depressed friends and it's,

769
00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.050
it's like being in a quick sand pit.

770
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:19.020
Emotionally you don't how to get the fuck out and it's a nightmare.

771
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.510
It's a nightmare.
But there are,
you know,

772
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.940
nature is a very powerful thing and we're,

773
00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.670
that's where we're supposed to be anyway.
You know?
That's where we,

774
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:30.510
our ancestors came from and it's been a very short time that we haven't been out

775
00:45:30.511 --> 00:45:30.820
there.

776
00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.080
<v 10>What do you think it is though,</v>

777
00:45:32.081 --> 00:45:37.081
that the causes people to get in that if it's not a chemical issue,

778
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:42.470
if it's a truly just a behavioral issue or a thought process issue that causes

779
00:45:43.271 --> 00:45:45.610
people to become depressed and get caught in that funk,

780
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:49.500
what purpose do you think that serves?
Like why is that there?
You know,

781
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:53.090
do you look at things like that?
Like I look at addictions,
you know,

782
00:45:53.091 --> 00:45:56.440
and I'm always like,
well,
why is that there?
I look at compulsive behavior.
Why,

783
00:45:56.441 --> 00:45:59.050
why the fuck is that there?
There's,
there's gotta be an issue for that.

784
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.040
Like I think,
I mean,
but whatever,
regardless of what I think,
what do you,

785
00:46:03.041 --> 00:46:06.690
why do you think that's there?
The depression.
Yeah.
Why is depression there?
Why,

786
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.481
why is there this,

787
00:46:07.481 --> 00:46:11.720
this thing that's like a consistent thing amongst groups of people and it's,

788
00:46:11.721 --> 00:46:15.740
it's very common.
Like what,
what would be the purpose of that nature?

789
00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:19.040
I don't know if there's a purpose to it too,
right?

790
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:20.680
It's a symptom of the way we're living.

791
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.350
<v 1>It's called,
there's this,
um,
uh,</v>

792
00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:28.020
idea called the gunas and it's the modes of material,
the material universe,

793
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.160
the uh,
in Hinduism,
in some forms of Hinduism,

794
00:46:31.161 --> 00:46:35.010
in the material universe gets broken up into three forms and it gets simplified

795
00:46:35.011 --> 00:46:38.760
into these three forms called the Gunas,
which is the mode of ignorance,

796
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:43.610
the mode of passion and the mode of goodness.
And so everything,

797
00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:47.460
everyone is experiencing some version of these modes of being.

798
00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:51.870
So these modes,
they attribute them to a certain till like,
you know,

799
00:46:51.871 --> 00:46:56.790
parts of the world.
So cities are considered to be in the mode of passion.
Um,

800
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.840
places where things are rotting like junk heaps and places where there's a lot

801
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:05.340
of deaths are considered to be in the mode of ignorance and nature is considered

802
00:47:05.341 --> 00:47:08.200
to be in the mode of goodness.
So,
uh,

803
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:11.130
there are symptoms of each of people who are in each of these modes.

804
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:14.550
So people who are in the,
uh,
mode of ignorance,

805
00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:19.020
the symptoms are very similar to the symptoms of depression.
They are attract,

806
00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:22.710
they sleep too much,
they sleep all the time.

807
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.030
They eat shitty food the way they put it.
As they eat dead,

808
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:29.620
they eat dead things.
But what that means is they eat,

809
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.870
they're not eating things that are good for them.
They're literally,

810
00:47:31.871 --> 00:47:35.890
they're just eating things that are poison and or the way they put it as they

811
00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:40.750
eat things that taste bad and make you feel bad.
That's how they say it.

812
00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:41.080
Now,

813
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:45.850
the mode of passion is the symptoms of the motor passion are you want to fuck,

814
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.640
you want to make money.
Um,
you're out there,

815
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:52.420
you're working your Mike Tyson in his prime.
You're fucking like,
you're,

816
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:54.490
you're just fully into the universe.

817
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:59.670
And the way they put it is you eat things that taste good but that make you feel

818
00:48:00.281 --> 00:48:01.480
bad is the way they put it.

819
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:06.280
So you eat like people you're drawn to like shit that like in that initially is

820
00:48:06.281 --> 00:48:09.820
like rich food.
Yeah.
Rich food and stuff like that.
Or even,
you know,

821
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:14.080
experientially,
you know,
you're like doing like crazy share eating ecstasy,

822
00:48:14.081 --> 00:48:15.880
you know,
that makes you feel good in the moment.

823
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.540
But then the end result is you kind of like are hung over for half a week.

824
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:24.440
If you take impure non pharmaceutical grade MTMA or just awesome to have then,

825
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:32.290
then uh,
the mode of goodness is,
um,
the way they put that is,

826
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.281
um,
you'll,

827
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:37.720
you eat things that maybe don't taste so great initially but then make you feel

828
00:48:37.721 --> 00:48:40.900
really good that are really good for you.
You know,
like,
um,

829
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.110
some people would say initially when you start exercising,

830
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:47.560
it's in the mode of goodness because when you are fucking convince your body to

831
00:48:47.561 --> 00:48:50.490
get out of bed and go for a jog,
sometimes it's like be,

832
00:48:50.491 --> 00:48:53.980
it's the best feeling on the planet.
But when you first get going,

833
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.060
it doesn't feel that great.

834
00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:59.110
You've got to like get your body to low lumbar limber again and get out there

835
00:48:59.111 --> 00:49:00.250
again.
But man,

836
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:04.150
when the afternoon rolls around after a morning run and you feel your muscles

837
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:07.960
are aching in,
your bodies are more relaxed and it's been,
you feel great.

838
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.930
So that's because you did something that could be considered in the mode of

839
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:13.090
goodness.
So to answer your question,

840
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:18.130
I think depression is the modern terminology for people who have gotten

841
00:49:18.131 --> 00:49:23.020
themselves primarily in the mode of ignorance.
And um,

842
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:26.380
and they,
you know,
they need to,

843
00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:31.540
a way to get out of the mode of ignorance is to,
um,
it sounds kind of obvious,

844
00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:34.900
but to begin to engage in things that are more in the mode of passion or the

845
00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:38.050
mode of goodness.
So,
you know,
people will tell you if you're feeling depressed,

846
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.430
go jogging,
go jogging,
eats,
drinks some smoothies,

847
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:46.840
take vitamin,
start taking care of your body,
clean your house.
Depressed.

848
00:49:46.841 --> 00:49:50.240
People have filthy houses.
They inevitably cause they're white.

849
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:52.240
They're literally laying in dead shit.

850
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:57.190
You go to a depressed person's house and there will inevitably be rotting food

851
00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:01.300
there.
They hit late,
leave rotting food out and they,
they're,
they're filthy.

852
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:03.880
And that's,
that's like what the motive ignorance is.

853
00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:07.720
And the reason they're doing that is because they're avoiding taking care of

854
00:50:07.721 --> 00:50:09.670
things.
They can't push themselves out of it.

855
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.970
<v 10>Is it possible that being in a pattern like that for a certain period of time</v>

856
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:16.060
can alter your brain chemistry to the point where it's actually measurable,

857
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:20.050
where they can say,
oh,
you have a deaf deficient,
you know,
blah,
blah,
blah.

858
00:50:20.051 --> 00:50:20.890
This is part of your brain.

859
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.550
And it's because the real reason is because of your pattern of thinking.

860
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.980
But it's diagnosed as a chemical issue.

861
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.040
<v 1>Yeah.
Just like your</v>

862
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.560
<v 10>pattern of eating.
If you eat certain things for a certain amount of time,</v>

863
00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:33.740
you turn it into a fatty,
you know,
it's like,
it's the same thing.

864
00:50:33.741 --> 00:50:38.320
It's just a more of a probably a neurological form of that.
You know,

865
00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:42.860
it's a neurological obesity.
This is where we're just guessing this is for,

866
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.370
you know,

867
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:48.170
this is for very specific types of mental illnesses that the types that you
know,

868
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:49.430
you feel like you had,

869
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:53.930
not for people that have some sort of a congenital issue where their brain's not

870
00:50:53.931 --> 00:50:55.190
functioning correctly from the get go.

871
00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:55.661
<v 1>Well,
I,</v>

872
00:50:55.661 --> 00:50:59.500
I think that for people who are depressed and you have solely been listening to

873
00:50:59.501 --> 00:51:03.430
a psychiatrist there prognosed they can feel like they're in a pretty dire

874
00:51:03.431 --> 00:51:06.130
situation because they've been convinced that their,

875
00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:11.550
their motherboard is fucked up and the only cure for his corporate created

876
00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.460
chemicals that they have to take for the rest of their lives.

877
00:51:15.461 --> 00:51:16.450
And if they get off of it,

878
00:51:16.451 --> 00:51:19.540
then they get dizzy and fucked up and they'll just end up cutting their wrist.

879
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:24.190
Now I think that that's a pretty sad state of being to be in.

880
00:51:24.191 --> 00:51:29.080
Where the only way that you think you can feel normal is by enjoying these,
uh,

881
00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:33.940
uh,
corporate manufactured synthetic forms of happiness.

882
00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:36.160
You know,
you,
that's the only way.
It's like,

883
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:41.250
imagine only being able to smell a synthetic flower smells like shitty Paris

884
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.720
Hilton perfumes.
Well,
I think that's what Andy,
no,

885
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.460
that's how you could smell flowers.
Well,

886
00:51:45.461 --> 00:51:47.980
I think that's what I think that's what some antidepressants are.

887
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:52.720
I think a corporation came up with a way to cook your brain in a certain way

888
00:51:52.721 --> 00:51:57.400
with these chemicals to allow you to experience a synthetic version of happiness

889
00:51:57.550 --> 00:52:02.260
is opposed to an authentic version of happiness.
And I think that for many,

890
00:52:02.261 --> 00:52:05.020
many,
many people who are depressed,
not antidepressants,

891
00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:07.780
and perhaps this is naive and again,

892
00:52:07.781 --> 00:52:11.080
if your antidepressants are really making you happy,
then you're fucking happy.

893
00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:16.270
But I think that there are ways to shift your vibe,

894
00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:20.170
to change your life,
to work on the different things that you,

895
00:52:20.171 --> 00:52:23.920
the loose strings that are hanging out of your life and how,

896
00:52:23.921 --> 00:52:28.450
and start experiencing like real happiness,
which is,
you know,

897
00:52:28.451 --> 00:52:31.120
I think that's a hopeful thing to hear.
If you're super depressed,

898
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:32.320
I think you're putting down a great guy.

899
00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:35.350
<v 10>All I'm saying is that I don't think it applies to everyone.</v>

900
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:39.400
And I think there are people that have a serious biochemical issue.
There are,

901
00:52:39.401 --> 00:52:43.450
there are a lot of people that are your way as well though.
You know,
it's just,

902
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:47.020
you know,
some people get real sensitive about this and they're right.
You know,

903
00:52:47.021 --> 00:52:49.390
some people say,
you know,
hey man,
you guys shouldn't be saying that.

904
00:52:49.391 --> 00:52:53.380
You don't know what the fuck it's like,
uh,
you know,
my situation,
I'm not crazy.

905
00:52:53.381 --> 00:52:56.380
I had an issue,
you know,
I'm,
I'll try to be as positive as possible,

906
00:52:56.381 --> 00:52:57.610
but I have an issue.

907
00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:01.240
<v 1>Let me just say one more time so that I don't get like a Shitload,</v>

908
00:53:01.241 --> 00:53:03.130
a angry Facebook messages.

909
00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:07.030
I am in no way advocating getting off your medication.

910
00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:12.130
I'm not saying stop taking your medication,
Bro.
Just go smell a flower.
You know,

911
00:53:12.131 --> 00:53:13.330
I'm not saying that at all.

912
00:53:13.331 --> 00:53:18.331
I'm just saying there is hope that you don't have to pay however much you're

913
00:53:19.181 --> 00:53:22.210
paying a month to take those chemicals.

914
00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.360
I really think that there are,
um,

915
00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:30.570
go there are really like common sense things that people just forget about when

916
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:34.290
they get depressed because when you're depressed you just forget it's sunlight.

917
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:39.360
Yeah,
like sunlight,
cleaning your fucking ass.
Get amazing.
Get a maid.

918
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.390
Just get a maid to clean your house.
If you're two down to clean your house,

919
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:44.250
just get a maid,
go,
go,

920
00:53:44.251 --> 00:53:49.251
like go find a nice library that's air conditioned and like sit in the library

921
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:52.410
and read or write while a maid cleans your house and come back to your clean

922
00:53:52.411 --> 00:53:55.830
house and see how good that makes you feel.
Simple little tiny,

923
00:53:55.831 --> 00:54:00.000
tiny little things that you can try that will alleviate some of the

924
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:04.410
environmental things that are keeping that the,
the depressive cycle going.

925
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:09.150
You should be a life coach.
I got a bachelor's degree in psychology,
Joe.

926
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.110
Yeah,
I do,
but that's,
I mean that doesn't mean anything.

927
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.840
That's why I always call it Dunkin for advice.
Meaningless.

928
00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:19.060
<v 8>Do you remember when you were dating a particular girl and she was trying to get</v>

929
00:54:19.061 --> 00:54:21.210
you to quit comedy and you're going to go work on your

930
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:24.480
<v 1>phd?
I certainly do.
He should have done that.</v>

931
00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:30.170
[inaudible]

932
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:38.230
<v 8>little Hobo is going to visit you in the middle of the night right now.</v>

933
00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.350
The next bad trip.
You have little little hope.

934
00:54:41.351 --> 00:54:44.110
I was going to be there to hold your hand and take you on a walk.

935
00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:49.420
<v 1>Oh Man.
Yeah,
I remember.
I remember those days though.</v>

936
00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:54.290
So crazy man.
There is some part of me that like that to this day,

937
00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:59.630
you know,
thinks about what,
what,
what that kind of life would be like.

938
00:54:59.631 --> 00:55:03.500
Like I for that the show that I was working on for comedy central that didn't

939
00:55:03.501 --> 00:55:05.790
get picked up.
Um,

940
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:11.520
<v 8>I a video is hilarious by the way.
It's on the web.
The stoned ape theory.</v>

941
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:15.030
I think people want to Google what's the best way to find that video?

942
00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:18.990
Google search stoned ape theory on Youtube.
It pops up.
Does it?
Right.
A lot of,

943
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.630
there's a lot of articles on the stoned ape theory too,
right?

944
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:26.080
Right under you talking about the stoned ape theory on Youtube.
I see.

945
00:55:26.081 --> 00:55:29.310
What's the other video you?
The body surfing one you did with Tim and Eric.

946
00:55:29.311 --> 00:55:33.900
That was fucking hilarious.
That's called legend of the pipers.
The second one,

947
00:55:33.901 --> 00:55:35.340
if you Google it,
there's a second one.

948
00:55:35.341 --> 00:55:37.800
The second one shows a little monkey and an animation.

949
00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:41.550
It's an animated says clip from comedy central's pilot,
thunder brain.

950
00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:44.730
You got to see it cause it's fucking awesome.
It's really fun.

951
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:46.620
But when we are doing that,
we were

952
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:51.020
<v 1>hang some B roll of,
um,
of like scientific just me,</v>

953
00:55:51.021 --> 00:55:53.360
like around super crazy scientific shit.

954
00:55:53.361 --> 00:55:58.361
So we were in like a laboratory that was working on solar panels and there was a

955
00:55:58.791 --> 00:56:00.830
doctor there is working on,
you know,

956
00:56:00.831 --> 00:56:04.910
trying to lower the cost of producing solar panels that it becomes a feasible

957
00:56:04.911 --> 00:56:09.710
option for people and we can get off our addiction to oil.
Strangely,

958
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:13.730
his study was being funded by BP,
which was really confusing to me.

959
00:56:13.731 --> 00:56:17.600
Like I didn't understand that.
And,
uh,
I asked him like,
BP,

960
00:56:17.601 --> 00:56:20.420
why are they trying to like get solar panels going?
Doesn't that hurt them?

961
00:56:20.421 --> 00:56:24.010
And he's like,
corporations are,
there's so many different,

962
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:25.271
<v 9>you know,</v>

963
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:28.660
wings and parts of a corporation that some of them don't even agree with each

964
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:33.460
other with what they're doing.
But anyway,
uh,
I said,

965
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:37.990
wow,
man,
it must feel really good to be working on something that if you like,

966
00:56:37.991 --> 00:56:39.490
figure out what you want to figure out,

967
00:56:39.491 --> 00:56:44.290
it will transform the planet for the better.
And He,
like,
in all seriousness,

968
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:47.650
no hint of irony or anything.
We already looked at me and he's like,
well,

969
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:51.910
it's our sacred duty to help humanity.
And it was like,
ah,

970
00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:55.330
fuck man,
that is really cool because this isn't like some book,

971
00:56:55.570 --> 00:57:00.040
this guy's not bullshitting.
He's not just like,
it's some bar leaning over.

972
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:04.870
He's not on a podcast slurp and back.
Coconut waters stoned out of his mind.

973
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:10.170
He's in a laboratory fucking working on solar panels because he believes it's a

974
00:57:10.171 --> 00:57:15.010
sacred duty to help humanity.
You know,
he's pushing it to the nth degree there,

975
00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:17.920
you know?
And,
and I found that like,
um,

976
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:22.090
there's something about something real about it,
you know,
to this day I think,

977
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:25.330
well,
you know,
I know that standup helps people.
It makes them laugh.

978
00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:29.680
And I think it's a very potent art form.
But still I think,
man,
I wonder,

979
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.330
you always kind of wonder like,
what if I,

980
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.250
what if I had become like a psychologist?

981
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:37.960
You know what if I had done that and like really gone deep into understanding

982
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:42.190
the inner workings and the mechanisms that make human beings get into these

983
00:57:42.191 --> 00:57:45.520
shitty patterns.
You know what,
I maybe I would've come up with some,

984
00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:47.710
some great way to help people,
you know,

985
00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:52.260
something more than a joke about spraying calm on the Pentagon or like,
you know,

986
00:57:52.261 --> 00:57:56.130
and I mean it's that it's,
but I do,

987
00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.110
I really love my life.
So it's a

988
00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:00.960
<v 10>bad thing to,
if as long as you're enjoying yourself,</v>

989
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:04.740
I think it's a bad thing to question.
What if,
what if,
you know what,

990
00:58:04.741 --> 00:58:09.000
I'd be happier.
What if this,
what if that,
I think if you find something,

991
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.960
it could be anything.

992
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:13.050
But if you find something that agrees with your personality and you're

993
00:58:13.051 --> 00:58:16.900
passionate about it and you pursue it,
there's,
there's goodness in that.

994
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:17.610
There's goodness,

995
00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:21.360
there's certainly goodness and creating new solar panels that are more efficient

996
00:58:21.361 --> 00:58:24.550
and allow us,
there's certainly goodness to get away from the grid.
And Get up,

997
00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:27.990
get away from the,
the,
the need for foreign oil and all that jazz.

998
00:58:27.991 --> 00:58:30.210
But there's also good in everything,
man.

999
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.450
There's good and being a badass soccer player,
right?

1000
00:58:32.451 --> 00:58:36.150
People want to watch some fucking Diego Maradona motherfucker who kicks the

1001
00:58:36.151 --> 00:58:38.640
Golan when,
you know,
it's not supposed to,
you know,

1002
00:58:38.641 --> 00:58:42.750
it's like a really close game and this fucking guy manages to wiggle through and

1003
00:58:42.751 --> 00:58:44.490
knock one in.
Or when someone,
you know,

1004
00:58:44.491 --> 00:58:47.580
some of Michael Jordan character shoots that three pointer to win the game.

1005
00:58:47.581 --> 00:58:51.510
And you know,
when,
when when you,
when you see things like that,
any anything,

1006
00:58:51.511 --> 00:58:54.280
you see what it is a beautiful painting,
whether it's,
you know,

1007
00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:57.210
some book that you've read that really fucking,
it was gripping,

1008
00:58:57.211 --> 00:59:01.350
he couldn't put it down.
All those things enhance life.
They all create energy.

1009
00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:05.340
They all create burst of energy.
You know what I mean?
Some definitely,
I mean,

1010
00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:08.520
you look in the,
the,
the,
in terms of the greater good for humanity,

1011
00:59:08.521 --> 00:59:10.920
some will definitely be better.
You know,

1012
00:59:10.921 --> 00:59:14.670
it's much better to create a great solar panel on the right,
a Dick joke,
but,

1013
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:19.380
but the,
you know,
as long as you're doing what you want to do,
that's the,

1014
00:59:19.381 --> 00:59:20.161
I think if we,

1015
00:59:20.161 --> 00:59:24.230
if there's one thing that you can harp on in this life is it don't,

1016
00:59:24.231 --> 00:59:27.830
don't do a bunch of shit that you don't really want to do because you're not

1017
00:59:27.831 --> 00:59:31.010
sure if she can do what you want to do.
Because if you do what you want to do,

1018
00:59:31.011 --> 00:59:34.520
it's hard and you might not make it and fuck,
man,
that's just,

1019
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.900
you're going to live a life of second guessing and,

1020
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:42.140
and failure and just,
you never got to believe in yourself.
He never got it.

1021
00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.230
You're going to know that you never went after the one thing they really,

1022
00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:48.440
truly wanted.
That's whether,
whether whatever the fuck it is,
man,

1023
00:59:48.441 --> 00:59:52.550
whether it's being a solar panel scientist or whether it's being a guy writes

1024
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:55.520
fucking classical music,
whatever the fuck it is,
man,
what,

1025
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:57.470
you just got to find what that thing is.

1026
00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:01.950
<v 9>Yeah.
There's a,
um,
I always do this.
I'm sorry.</v>

1027
01:00:01.951 --> 01:00:06.600
I always quote the Bhagavad Gita,
the most awesome things to quote ever.

1028
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:09.240
There is a quote in the Bhagavad Gita that goes,

1029
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:12.960
it's better to be an honest street sweeper,

1030
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:16.650
then a dishonest king or,
and uh,

1031
01:00:16.651 --> 01:00:20.310
it's very dangerous to follow another man's path is what,
what it,

1032
01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:24.870
and so the ideas,
you know,
it just what exactly what you said.
Um,

1033
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:27.610
you know,
you should do,
you know,

1034
01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.190
you should do what you're drawn to,
not what you think you should be doing.

1035
01:00:32.191 --> 01:00:35.190
You should do the thing that you're attracted to doing.
That's what,

1036
01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.400
that's what you're meant to.
That's who you are.
That's what you're meant to be.

1037
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.470
You know,
if,
if,
uh,

1038
01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:44.250
if you saw a dog that was trying to act like a horse,

1039
01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:48.120
it would be hilarious,
but it would be kind of sad and fucked up.
You know?

1040
01:00:48.121 --> 01:00:48.960
It's like you're,

1041
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:52.380
you're supposed to be what makes a thing beautiful is when it's in its purest

1042
01:00:52.381 --> 01:00:56.120
form,
not when it's trying to create an alternate version of what it is.

1043
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:58.920
<v 10>It's like when that lady was dressing her chimp up and putting diapers on him</v>

1044
01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:01.440
and shit.
And then one day just ripped her face.

1045
01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.090
I let everybody know what the fuck is up.

1046
01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:08.100
<v 9>God,
that's so fucked up when people put lipstick on a champ.
Oh,
lots.</v>

1047
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:10.220
The champs suite,
your own Dunkin to each your own.

1048
01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:14.390
Unless you're drawn to putting lipstick on champion,
in which case go for it.

1049
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.720
Yeah.
If that's your thing,
man.
Yeah.
You never know.

1050
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.700
<v 10>Yeah.
I think you're absolutely right though.
You got to,</v>

1051
01:01:24.701 --> 01:01:27.030
you got to find it and whatever the fuck it is.
For some people though,

1052
01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:29.490
it's hard to find.
You're stuck in some shitty fucking town.

1053
01:01:29.491 --> 01:01:33.030
There's nothing to do.
Everybody around you is retarded and I was like,

1054
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.130
this is the,
that becomes an issue.

1055
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:37.850
<v 9>Well,
you got to start.
You know the thing you got to start with doing,</v>

1056
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:41.000
you got to start.
Even if you're not a comedian,

1057
01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:44.540
this is the thing I realize you've got to start carrying a notebook around with

1058
01:01:44.541 --> 01:01:46.580
you or a little piece of whatever,

1059
01:01:46.581 --> 01:01:50.360
something to write your thoughts down on because throughout the day you have

1060
01:01:50.361 --> 01:01:54.170
really cool thoughts.
You have really interesting.
Some people don't.
Well,

1061
01:01:54.171 --> 01:01:55.004
I think that,

1062
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:59.630
I think it's like fishing and I think that your notebook or your pad of paper as

1063
01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:02.710
your fishing net for thought for ideas and if you're,

1064
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:05.930
if you haven't been fishing for a long time,
yeah,
you don't have a lot of ideas,

1065
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.180
but if you just start getting in the habit of,

1066
01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:13.181
even if you don't think you're gonna like have amazing ideas every day,

1067
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:17.810
you just have sometimes really low level idea's really simple basic ideas or

1068
01:02:17.811 --> 01:02:20.070
even something you needed to take care of.
If you start

1069
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.320
<v 8>writing that shit down,
uh,</v>

1070
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:26.030
then I think the bigger ideas start coming,
you know,

1071
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:29.090
<v 11>because we know your nets out.
That's a great point.
I like that idea.</v>

1072
01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.870
I like the way you describe it,
that it's a net.
That sounds cool,

1073
01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:33.531
<v 8>but let's face it,</v>

1074
01:02:33.531 --> 01:02:36.900
some of those nets are going to be like mountain dew code red is good.
Sure.

1075
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:40.160
Why people's Twitter feeds,
man.
Yeah.

1076
01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:43.760
The Twitter feed is 140 character net,
you know,
I mean there's,

1077
01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:46.020
there's certain people on Twitter that I just had to stop following.

1078
01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.050
I had to stop falling when I sign a hug.

1079
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:51.410
If you're following me on Twitter and you see that thing that Joe Rogan daily

1080
01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:53.180
and people go,
Hey,
put me in your daily,

1081
01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.300
I have no say over who goes in that I don't,
this is what it is.

1082
01:02:56.301 --> 01:02:58.560
It's just a program that I signed up for it.

1083
01:02:58.561 --> 01:03:01.910
And what it basically does is I follow a lot of interesting people and Twitter

1084
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:06.800
and it'll take links from their stories that they put up on Twitter and then

1085
01:03:06.801 --> 01:03:10.280
it'll put together like a little newspaper of the top things.

1086
01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:13.540
I don't know how it categorizes them.
I have no idea how it does it.
Yeah.

1087
01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.020
What people are probably saying.
No,
it's put,

1088
01:03:15.021 --> 01:03:16.490
when they say put you in their daily,

1089
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.840
there is the option to put certain people in your daily so it will the same

1090
01:03:20.841 --> 01:03:24.680
thing.
Focus onto him.
So really?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh,

1091
01:03:24.681 --> 01:03:26.120
so you can actually program it.

1092
01:03:26.121 --> 01:03:29.030
You could kind of do a little tweaks here and there like having like,

1093
01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:32.780
you know like group of friends that it grabs from more than other groups of

1094
01:03:32.781 --> 01:03:37.760
friends.
But wow.
I played around with fucking cares.
That's cool.
Yeah,
man.

1095
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:38.810
I might have to look into it.

1096
01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:42.470
But you can't specifically pick an article or anything.
I don't think so.

1097
01:03:42.471 --> 01:03:45.200
And that's what sucks.
So you pick a group of friends and then you know,

1098
01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:48.110
Dunkin says,
Hey,
look at my penis.
You'd like to my penis.

1099
01:03:48.111 --> 01:03:50.160
And then it looks like you picked it out.
Yeah.

1100
01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:54.680
The ones where I get for Paul following Dunkin to look at my penis.

1101
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.060
[inaudible] want people to look at my penis.
It's important to me.

1102
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.540
But you haven't been here since then.
Anthony Wiener Guy,
he mean?

1103
01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.410
<v 11>Yeah.
Anthony Lincoln.
Yeah,
we really,
I mean,</v>

1104
01:04:05.411 --> 01:04:10.400
is this a real life thing or is this a movie?
It really does.
It's as,

1105
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:12.010
as things go on,
you know,

1106
01:04:12.011 --> 01:04:15.880
the concept of life as a hologram or life is some sort of a computer simulation.

1107
01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:20.470
It sounds great and funny and you know,
like,
well it's crazy.
We would if,

1108
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:24.670
but every now and then and the thing like this,
Anthony Wiener,
Andrew Wiener,

1109
01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:28.120
what was his name?
Anthony or Andrew?
Anthony.
It was Anthony,

1110
01:04:28.121 --> 01:04:30.940
I think it was Anthony Wiener.
Whatever the fuck his first name is,

1111
01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:35.860
his last names in mistaken will unmistakable,
unmistakable.

1112
01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.810
And the idea that that guy would get into some dick situation,

1113
01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:44.650
it almost feels like we're being fucked with it feels like a prank.

1114
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:47.500
It feels like,
like as you know,

1115
01:04:47.501 --> 01:04:50.460
whatever the end of time rolls closer and closer.

1116
01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:55.530
Reality is getting so fucking weird that it almost is.

1117
01:04:55.900 --> 01:05:00.720
It's begging us to not take it seriously anymore.
It's almost like awesome.

1118
01:05:00.850 --> 01:05:03.940
It's almost like,
but have you seen Michelle Bachmann?

1119
01:05:03.941 --> 01:05:07.450
Do you knew who Michelle Blah.
I know about the gay Gaf.

1120
01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:12.400
How bout her fucking husband is gay shit,
I didn't know that dude.

1121
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:17.430
Dave Foley tweeted this about Michele Bachmann's husband being this who performs

1122
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:23.260
<v 8>these anti gay things,
uh,
where they fix gay people.</v>

1123
01:05:23.261 --> 01:05:27.280
Antigay counseling.
Always gay.
Yeah.
Oh the fuck dude.

1124
01:05:27.281 --> 01:05:29.980
Please pull up the guy.
Pull up,
pull up.

1125
01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:34.790
I think Marcus Bachmann is his name.
Allegedly homosexual.
Well,

1126
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:38.950
I'll let the people decide,
but uh,
my God,
he seems gay.

1127
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:41.800
Holy Shit.
He seems gay.
You know about her John Wayne Gate,

1128
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:43.750
the things you do with John Wayne Gacy?
No,

1129
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:48.040
she was in the town where Gacy killed a lot of people and she said something on

1130
01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:51.600
the lines of like,
well you know,
I believe in the words of John Wayne or I,

1131
01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:51.881
you know,

1132
01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:55.960
I believe in the spirit of John Wayne because she thought John Wayne was in that

1133
01:05:55.961 --> 01:05:58.150
town and didn't know is John Wayne Gacy.

1134
01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:04.180
He confused one of the most it seller serial killers ever with uh,

1135
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.670
one of the most loved movie story cowboy.
And she goes,

1136
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:13.660
and she was like saying that she's such an idiot cause she,
what's her deal man?

1137
01:06:13.661 --> 01:06:16.750
Is she running for president?
I was like,
yeah,
she is.
Yeah,
check,
check this out.

1138
01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:19.510
That this is from like two years ago,
right?
Is that the original thing?

1139
01:06:19.511 --> 01:06:21.640
Two years ago he came loose.
So his voice,

1140
01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:24.970
I mean it's hilarious when you hear this.
You got to hear him.
He's,

1141
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:28.800
he's as gay as the day is long man.
I mean he's just as good.
Yeah.

1142
01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:32.460
<v 12>Winning the GOP nomination.
But what about the man that's backing her,</v>

1143
01:06:32.461 --> 01:06:33.294
her husband,

1144
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:37.890
a doctor Marcus Bachmann is drawing heated criticism for is highly questionable

1145
01:06:37.891 --> 01:06:41.160
stance on homosexuality.
Just take a listen to this.

1146
01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:43.560
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1147
01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.760
<v 13>You have to understand barbarians need to be educated.</v>

1148
01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:50.550
They need to be,
um,
disciplined.

1149
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:55.440
And just because someone feels it or thinks it doesn't mean that we're supposed

1150
01:06:55.441 --> 01:06:58.830
to go down that road.
That's what's called the pen from nature.

1151
01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.660
And we have a responsibility as parents and as authority figures not to

1152
01:07:03.661 --> 01:07:06.620
encourage such,
um,

1153
01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:09.540
thoughts and feelings to move into the action step.

1154
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:14.870
<v 8>Whoa.
First of all,
the guy has this look about him like,
hi,</v>

1155
01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:19.830
how about hot dog?
Yeah.
He like,
like one of those southern guys who,
uh,
owns a,

1156
01:07:19.831 --> 01:07:21.530
a barbecue place.
Yeah.

1157
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:25.880
He's got like sat face and it's slippery.
Yeah.

1158
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:29.450
He looks like the guy's always sweating.
Like everywhere he goes,
he's like,

1159
01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:32.960
there's a munch or going to his head.
Hope nobody knows I'm gay.

1160
01:07:32.961 --> 01:07:34.040
I hope nobody knows I'm gay.

1161
01:07:34.041 --> 01:07:37.280
I hope nobody knows I'm gay and it's causing him to pee profusely.

1162
01:07:37.281 --> 01:07:40.220
Sweat Rosie sweaty all the time.
He's like shiny.

1163
01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:42.440
And every picture you see of him,
he's like shiny and sweaty.

1164
01:07:42.441 --> 01:07:43.780
It sounds like a key.

1165
01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:48.790
Sounds like a disciplinary and like he sounds like he would be into like bald

1166
01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:53.510
head butt plugs and like really like cause he's talking about educating

1167
01:07:53.511 --> 01:07:56.730
barbarians and disciplining people as,

1168
01:07:56.810 --> 01:08:00.090
I would love to see what techniques you use.
[inaudible] his calling.

1169
01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.450
He's calling gay dudes barbarians.

1170
01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.590
You are a barbarian and let me tell you my friend all the way they were going to

1171
01:08:06.591 --> 01:08:10.910
get your desire for cock out of you is by putting as many Cox into your mouth as

1172
01:08:10.911 --> 01:08:15.080
we can.
Yeah,
yeah.
Those guys are fucked up man.

1173
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.980
Of those guys.

1174
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.740
<v 9>You know there was this,
this kid just committed suicide.</v>

1175
01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:20.810
You know about that story.
This kid committed suicide.

1176
01:08:20.811 --> 01:08:25.760
He was going through one of these anti gay programs that these sadomasochistic

1177
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:30.260
Christian freaks or ramble through,
but he killed himself.

1178
01:08:30.261 --> 01:08:33.410
He committed suicide and they caught up with a doctor who had been behind the

1179
01:08:33.411 --> 01:08:37.280
study.
Exact same thing.
Or is it doctor was clearly gay.

1180
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:42.380
This is a doctor that had an ad,
a escort who they caught him with in Europe.

1181
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.090
Who this guy who he said he just hired to carry his bags.
Oh,
I remember that guy.

1182
01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:47.900
Yeah.

1183
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:52.900
He's like one of these mad scientists who are like super oppressed homosexuals

1184
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.720
and it's coming out in the form of trying to transform gay kids into straight

1185
01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:04.040
kid.
Took a gay hustle with him on vacation.
Yes.
To carry blood carries luggage.

1186
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.590
Yeah.

1187
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:06.630
<v 4>Would you see the Bruno movie?
Remember Bruna?
They had,</v>

1188
01:09:06.631 --> 01:09:08.770
they went to that guy that didn't see Bruno.
You.

1189
01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:12.220
You never saw fucking Bruno Bruno.
I have it on DVD.
Oh,
you got it there.

1190
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.590
They went to one of these guys that turns around and he is like Super Gay.

1191
01:09:16.591 --> 01:09:19.230
You can tell the guys like now that's debts wouldn't be the,
you know,

1192
01:09:19.231 --> 01:09:22.770
like it's just exactly looks gay.
Axa Gay

1193
01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:25.260
<v 10>counselors this,
they're just trolling.
They're just looking for Dick.</v>

1194
01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.060
That's all they are and they get together.

1195
01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:29.040
They get to figure all these guys are gay too.

1196
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.540
Everybody just shuts up and counsel each other and suck each other's cocks and

1197
01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:36.600
<v 9>yeah,
just go about your business.
Yeah,
they stumble.</v>

1198
01:09:36.601 --> 01:09:40.090
That's how they think of it when they up Shane.
That I did it again.

1199
01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:43.000
<v 10>Dale's coming home.
I couldn't wait.
I,
I sucked at [inaudible] home.</v>

1200
01:09:43.001 --> 01:09:45.790
Don't worry about it.
You're still with the Lord and you still want the Lord.

1201
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.700
What about my cock?
You suck.
That guy's cocky.
Let's talk more.
I call it.

1202
01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:53.910
<v 9>I mean,
it's a,
that's a fuck.
Talk about a weird job.
That's a weird job.</v>

1203
01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:55.440
It'd be up to be a gay guy.
And

1204
01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:59.200
<v 10>why is there so much sustain for homosexual people?
That's the real question.</v>

1205
01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:03.360
What is it?
Is it a fear that you're one too?
Is it,
I mean,
what,

1206
01:10:03.361 --> 01:10:05.950
what the F I grew up around gay people.

1207
01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:09.820
I grew up in San Francisco from the time I was seven until I was 11 I was

1208
01:10:09.821 --> 01:10:13.810
constantly around gay people.
My neighbors were gay and flamboyant,
you know,

1209
01:10:13.811 --> 01:10:17.260
to me it was normal.
It was just,
yeah,
it was just,
just,
they're just different,

1210
01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:21.100
you know,
it's a different thing.
I don't get where the hate comes from.

1211
01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.080
I don't understand it.
It doesn't make sense.

1212
01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:25.270
I don't think there's anything wrong with making fun of them.

1213
01:10:25.271 --> 01:10:27.730
Cause I think they're funny and I think you should be able to make fun of

1214
01:10:27.731 --> 01:10:30.670
everything.
Everything is funny.
I'm funny.
You're funny.
We're all stupid.

1215
01:10:30.671 --> 01:10:34.670
We're all do dumb shit and that shit should be made fun of,
you know,
so Gabe,

1216
01:10:34.671 --> 01:10:38.080
you ball or not off limits when it comes to humor,
but the hate,

1217
01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:40.900
where the fuck is it coming from?
Is it a,
is it a war,

1218
01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.300
a fear that you're one of them as well?
What is it?

1219
01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.830
<v 9>Ah,
I mean I think it's primarily a result of,
uh,</v>

1220
01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.210
people who are in fucked up Christian cults is what I think it is.

1221
01:10:51.211 --> 01:10:55.020
I think these people have been conditioned from when they were a child to have

1222
01:10:55.021 --> 01:10:59.760
these bizarre oppressed libidos that have their roots in some kind of terrible

1223
01:10:59.761 --> 01:11:02.540
interpretation of the New Testament.
And,

1224
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:05.550
and that ends up coming out with seeing,
you know,

1225
01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:09.990
a gay people is an abomination because of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.

1226
01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:12.300
Look at what God did.
Sodom and Gomorrah,

1227
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:14.280
<v 10>he's like 5,000</v>

1228
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.850
<v 9>years ago,
10,000 years ago,
they all had their Andy Dicks.</v>

1229
01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.110
They all had like gay dudes are just completely out of control,

1230
01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.620
just grabbing Cox and pissing on police officers and shit.

1231
01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:27.630
It was just like that was,

1232
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:32.140
that was the norm when it came to gay dudes and that was only a few Andy Dicks.

1233
01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:35.870
Right.
That's nice.
A few leftover.
I mean the truth is if you look up,
uh,
you know,

1234
01:11:35.871 --> 01:11:40.300
read Socrates,
those guys were all fucking gay as fuck.
They were all gay and,

1235
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:44.340
and so I think more likely what it is.
Is that right?

1236
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:48.510
<v 10>Um,
when I story and say that they're gay or would historians say that the times</v>

1237
01:11:48.511 --> 01:11:52.770
were different and that heterosexual men had sex with boys on a regular basis

1238
01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:54.870
back then?
I think they would say that.
All right,
well,

1239
01:11:54.871 --> 01:11:58.820
I mean you call it whatever you want.
They were Gung Ho,
whatever you want,

1240
01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:00.660
you get all those Romans were gay.

1241
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:05.290
Do you think there was just like when the Romans were fucking young boys and w

1242
01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.010
<v 9>so let's say I said to you,
Joe,</v>

1243
01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:11.970
yesterday I had sex with four teenage boys.

1244
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.640
What would you think I was?

1245
01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:14.250
<v 10>I would say,</v>

1246
01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:18.300
well you were experimenting because as far as I know you weren't gay until
today.

1247
01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:24.250
<v 9>You got any drawings of it and give you one day free pass and queer them?
Well,</v>

1248
01:12:24.251 --> 01:12:28.270
I think,
I think it,
it's just that it at the time,

1249
01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:31.860
at that time then it just wasn't,
it was considered like a fetish.

1250
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:32.850
<v 10>Well,
here's the question.</v>

1251
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.530
When when guys go to jail and they're in jail for a long time,

1252
01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.780
they have sex with men.
Are they gained,

1253
01:12:36.781 --> 01:12:40.320
did they become gay if they weren't gay before they went in?
Are they gay now

1254
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.450
<v 9>forever.
So what's,
so what's gay?
Is Gay being attracted to guys?</v>

1255
01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.340
Is that what gave you this as the question?

1256
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:49.760
Is it a guy who has sex with guys or is it a guy who's actually attracted to

1257
01:12:49.761 --> 01:12:51.770
guys?
Like what if you're a gay porn starting like,
I'm like,

1258
01:12:51.771 --> 01:12:55.820
whatever I want to fuck wait,
go ahead.
Yeah.
Gimme that Shrek.

1259
01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:59.290
<v 10>There's been a lot of those guys.
By the way,
the claim straight,
you know,</v>

1260
01:12:59.291 --> 01:13:03.450
there was a fucking VH one special on one guy.
There was a special,

1261
01:13:03.451 --> 01:13:05.140
and I believe it was VH one,

1262
01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:08.320
but it was one of those cable channels where it's like real fast cuts back and

1263
01:13:08.321 --> 01:13:11.080
forth.
Can I remember one of them,
the guy looks at the camera and goes,

1264
01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:12.970
anal sex is the bomb.

1265
01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.330
And the guy was straight and he had a girlfriend and the him and his girlfriend.

1266
01:13:16.331 --> 01:13:19.660
I mean it could have been a gigantic troll,
but it didn't seem like a troll.

1267
01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:23.050
It seemed like she really believed that he was straight and he was just doing

1268
01:13:23.051 --> 01:13:26.590
this for the money and you know,
and he's like,
my girlfriend,
she was like that.

1269
01:13:26.591 --> 01:13:30.280
I do it,
but the money's awesome,
so I just do it,
you know,
but I'm not gay.

1270
01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:34.150
And then he seen him in the scene going,
anal sex is the bomb.
And you're like,

1271
01:13:34.151 --> 01:13:35.950
Whoa,
what?
What?
What does it go?

1272
01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:40.270
Well that guy's gay guys in denial and he's using that jobs and excuse to bang

1273
01:13:40.271 --> 01:13:44.770
dudes.
But if you go to jail and you have sex with a guy,

1274
01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:45.613
are you gay forever?

1275
01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.450
<v 4>No,
I think that's desperation.
I think if you,</v>

1276
01:13:47.451 --> 01:13:50.120
if you were in there for life and you start getting fucked and stuff like that

1277
01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:53.210
and start acting gay and stuff,
I think that's just desperation.

1278
01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.700
But if you take fucking the hottest chicken the road,

1279
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:58.310
put them in the room with that guy,
that guy will still go,
holy shit,

1280
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:59.700
I can't wait to fuck.
You know,
like,

1281
01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.660
I think you'd be immediately fucking that girl with,
you know,

1282
01:14:02.661 --> 01:14:04.670
where a gay person be like,
Ooh,
boobies.

1283
01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:08.590
<v 9>There was this anthropologist and my college is your amazing way of describing</v>

1284
01:14:08.591 --> 01:14:09.740
it.
Yeah.

1285
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:14.080
There's this in my college who was talking about how in some parts of the world

1286
01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:19.570
being gay means that you are the one receiving the cock.

1287
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.250
So if you're like having anal sex with,
like if you're penetrating someone,

1288
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.750
you're strict,
as long as you're penetrating,
whatever it is,
you're penetrating,

1289
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.330
whether it's,
um,
a,

1290
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:34.510
a vagina or a brown vagina,

1291
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:37.710
your still straight.
But if you're,

1292
01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:40.810
if you're being penetrated,
then you're gay.

1293
01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:44.710
If you're taking the submissive position,
then you're gay.
Wow.

1294
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:48.880
So there's,
there's a lot of different cultural,
it's a,
it's,
I think it's,
uh,

1295
01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:49.571
it's a,

1296
01:14:49.571 --> 01:14:54.571
it has a lot to do with the culture and I think our culture is possibly one of

1297
01:14:56.561 --> 01:15:01.510
the most sexually repressed cultures out there.
We are fucked up,
man.

1298
01:15:01.511 --> 01:15:05.110
We,
people get so weird about sex in our culture.
They're just,

1299
01:15:05.111 --> 01:15:08.120
they get creepy and weird and they start acting strange.
Like what?

1300
01:15:08.121 --> 01:15:11.650
Remember that show?
Real sex.
Yeah.
And you see these people,

1301
01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:13.750
whatever it is that they're into,
whatever they're talking about,

1302
01:15:13.751 --> 01:15:18.700
whenever sex comes up,
they get real fucking squirmy and weird.
And like,

1303
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:23.170
we don't t the way we teach it in schools is really fucked up.
And you're not,

1304
01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.100
I've got this book that I just bought called,
uh,
shit,
I can't remember,

1305
01:15:27.101 --> 01:15:30.440
but it's this assemblage of all these,
uh,
uh,

1306
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:32.770
articles on sex from the 18 hundreds.

1307
01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.940
And it's like serious articles on masturbation and how to keep your kid from

1308
01:15:36.941 --> 01:15:40.540
jerking off because it drives you insane is what they used to say.

1309
01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:44.470
If you masturbated too many times it would send you on this downward spiral that

1310
01:15:44.471 --> 01:15:46.900
would just end in complete insanity.

1311
01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.080
And that was like in the 18 hundreds that wasn't that long ago.

1312
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.580
And that's because our,
you know,

1313
01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:55.540
our culture has its roots in the Protestants who are these who came from England

1314
01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:59.920
with the idea of worshiping God in a pure environment and the way that they were

1315
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.310
thought that you were supposed to worship God was in this bizarre sexually

1316
01:16:03.311 --> 01:16:06.100
repressed,
whipping yourself in the back,

1317
01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:10.480
super monogamy you,
you,
you,
you,
if you did have sex,

1318
01:16:10.481 --> 01:16:14.050
it should be really quick.
Get it over with fast,
don't enjoy it,

1319
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:17.410
don't enjoy sex.
It's evil and bad.

1320
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.560
And so the whole reproductive cycle got this awful taboo attached to it and

1321
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:24.230
that's what we're the descendants of.

1322
01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:28.330
So now people are going like running in the opposite direction,
you know,

1323
01:16:28.331 --> 01:16:31.840
and doing crazy shit like,
you know,
dressing an animal,

1324
01:16:31.841 --> 01:16:35.410
costumes and fucking dolls or whatever.
But it's all,

1325
01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:39.730
I think it's all at all a result of like awful sexual repression because someone

1326
01:16:39.731 --> 01:16:42.640
who isn't sexually repressed is not going to be able to hate a gate.

1327
01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.950
<v 10>It's amazing the idea that something that happened just you know,
300,</v>

1328
01:16:46.951 --> 01:16:49.650
400 years ago,
whatever it was and the first settlers arrived.

1329
01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:54.030
That's something that happened back then.
Like the,
that attitude that,
that,

1330
01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:59.090
that beginning of pattern of behavior could manifest itself in 2011.

1331
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.920
It's kind of crazy.
We get,

1332
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:06.270
it's obvious that other things have adopted it along the way like corporations

1333
01:17:06.271 --> 01:17:10.310
because they found that if you have this pure tin,
you know,
like you know,

1334
01:17:10.311 --> 01:17:13.880
no swearing and no sex.
If you,
if you have it too,
you know,

1335
01:17:13.881 --> 01:17:17.930
you have that to a certain extent.
You can kind of,
uh,
you know,

1336
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:19.640
you make yourself look better.

1337
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:23.150
It makes it look nicer and cleaner and you know,

1338
01:17:23.151 --> 01:17:26.060
it's like all having its roots in that original thing.

1339
01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.270
<v 9>Well it's like,
yeah,
it's,
it's got,
it's all got its roots in that.</v>

1340
01:17:29.271 --> 01:17:33.090
It's like if you go to,
I know you've never gone to a strip club,
but if you go,

1341
01:17:33.730 --> 01:17:35.700
I'm just kidding.
If you go to a strip club,

1342
01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:39.900
the energy in a strip club is always dark.

1343
01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:44.070
Like it's a dark place.
Yeah.
And it's,
you're in there.
It's kind of like hiding,

1344
01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.820
hiding in the dark as you watched the naked form.

1345
01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:50.730
It's like what the fuck?
Why is it set up like that?

1346
01:17:50.731 --> 01:17:55.670
Why is it set up like your urine?
Some Dank cave.
My boner.

1347
01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:59.220
You've got to hide.
Yeah.
Like why is it like that?
It's because it's still,

1348
01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:03.090
we're still sexually repressed and look at,
look at guys at a strip club,

1349
01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:04.950
look at the mode they go into.

1350
01:18:04.951 --> 01:18:08.560
It's not like guys go there and suddenly they like are feeling free,
if you will.

1351
01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.710
It's one of my favorite things in this drip club.

1352
01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:15.920
It's so fucking funny to watch some dudes getting a lap dance cause they try to

1353
01:18:16.141 --> 01:18:20.070
not have any facial expression.
Have you ever seen that?
What is that?

1354
01:18:20.071 --> 01:18:23.130
Where their face freezes like in this bizarre paralyzed coma.

1355
01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:27.150
They're almost trying to act like they're used to it.
Oh yeah.

1356
01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:32.010
Naked girls are always grinding against me while I drink a Budweiser and their

1357
01:18:32.011 --> 01:18:36.690
phases are frozen.
It's hilarious.
It's like react to that shit,
man.

1358
01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:41.790
You've got a super hot girl with breast implants rubbing against you.

1359
01:18:41.791 --> 01:18:45.380
Why are you in an emotional coma right now to exactly why?

1360
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:49.130
Why the other people watching?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
You don't want us,

1361
01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.450
you know what the fuck the environment is is unnatural as humanly possible,

1362
01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:52.890
right?

1363
01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:56.640
You put a guy in a warehouse with a bunch of other guys with folding chairs and

1364
01:18:56.641 --> 01:18:59.520
girls sitting on people's laps and you know everything else,
the bar.

1365
01:18:59.521 --> 01:19:02.970
And I love it.
I mean,
what,
what is it?
It's,
it's a fucking,
it's a little room.

1366
01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:06.780
It's a room where people are unnaturally sitting on other people's labs for

1367
01:19:06.781 --> 01:19:09.840
money and you feel like a fucking Weirdo,
you know,

1368
01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.660
club cause should be like a back of the seven 11.

1369
01:19:12.661 --> 01:19:15.510
They should just look like one what,
you know,
like,

1370
01:19:15.511 --> 01:19:19.370
she'd be like creepy places like that,
you know,
like,
like private little,
oh wait,

1371
01:19:19.371 --> 01:19:22.260
it's like a van.
Oh yeah,
well then

1372
01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:26.560
<v 10>girl,
the problem is the girl has to worry about safety.
You know,
you can't think,</v>

1373
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:30.860
look,
the whole idea of a strip club was kind of a,
it's kind of a crazy idea.

1374
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:32.060
You know you're going to go in there,

1375
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:33.800
especially if you're actually going to touch the guys.

1376
01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:37.490
It used to be they were just allowed to do table dances.
But uh,
you know,

1377
01:19:37.491 --> 01:19:41.540
Eddie Bravo has a great story about the progression of the lap dance about

1378
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:42.560
starting out in a,

1379
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:45.590
in a strip club where there wasn't a lap dancing and then all of a sudden

1380
01:19:45.591 --> 01:19:47.990
they're allow lap dancing and how everything changed.

1381
01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:49.850
And one girl was the only girl was willing to do it.

1382
01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.280
The first day of their goals were like,
fuck that,
I'm not doing it.

1383
01:19:52.281 --> 01:19:55.550
But this one girl just meet,
I'll fuck load of money.
And the next day they,

1384
01:19:55.551 --> 01:19:58.160
all of the rest of them were doing it too.
It was like sprinkling here and there.

1385
01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:01.880
Once you enter into that sort of a situation,
I mean you,

1386
01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:06.881
you got a naked girl who's rubbing up against a guy and it's every instinct

1387
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:11.340
<v 11>is to fucker,
you know,
and especially to a lot of these guys,</v>

1388
01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:14.700
some of these girls are hot as shit and then they would never get this girl in

1389
01:20:14.701 --> 01:20:17.730
real life and all of a sudden this girl was touching them and actually rubbing

1390
01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:20.500
their cock with her leg and shit like that.
I mean it,

1391
01:20:20.501 --> 01:20:23.790
you need that girl to be protected,
you know their,
their girls did that.

1392
01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:27.270
Everything has to be out in the open,
you know,
maybe even the VIP section,

1393
01:20:27.271 --> 01:20:28.950
there has to be a dude who's like,
you know,

1394
01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:31.800
near the door listening for screams of scuffles.

1395
01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.950
I mean it's fucking scary shit.
If you were a chick man,

1396
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.050
I really can't have a van for that.

1397
01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:41.030
When I was 15 I the first strip club I ever went to,

1398
01:20:41.031 --> 01:20:43.710
it's in New Orleans and I,
I will,

1399
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.320
I went to this strip club in the day,

1400
01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.660
15 in a day and the day,
and they let me in New Orleans is,

1401
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:53.640
I don't know if it still is,
I spent a lot of time,
but for a 15 year old,

1402
01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:56.340
it's an awesome city.
They just let you in.
They didn't care.

1403
01:20:56.490 --> 01:21:00.000
And I'm getting this feeling.
They don't check ids or anything.

1404
01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:02.940
It was just a long time ago.
I think they thought it was funny.
It was,

1405
01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:04.740
I don't know.
But I got into a strip club.

1406
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:09.930
I'm sitting in this chair with a,
the first dripper I'd ever encountered.

1407
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:13.920
In fact,
I think this is the first naked girl that I'd ever encountered.

1408
01:21:13.921 --> 01:21:18.810
Like a flow.
Yeah.
So like I'm sitting in this chair.
Before I even saw that girl,

1409
01:21:18.811 --> 01:21:23.510
I had a
raging erection just from being in a strip club.

1410
01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:25.860
My God,
this,

1411
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.030
this girl starts a dancing in front of me and like,

1412
01:21:30.031 --> 01:21:34.440
my heart's like my heart's pounding and I'm like holding the side of the chair

1413
01:21:34.441 --> 01:21:38.310
of my hand and I just watch my hand reach out and grab her ass.

1414
01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:43.140
I couldn't stop it.
It was like just an adrenaline rush.
I had to touch her.

1415
01:21:43.141 --> 01:21:47.250
I was so super horny and she slapped my hand.
I was like,
you can't touch me.

1416
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:51.150
Which I,
you know,
I guess at the time I had,
I wasn't clear on the rules,

1417
01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:55.500
but that's,
that's what sexual repression does.
That's what it does.
It's like,

1418
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:59.280
well,
that's not sexual repression.
That's teasing.
You're 15 years old.

1419
01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:02.550
You could have easily found a girl that's 15 years old and played doctor.

1420
01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:03.900
That's what a lot of people did.

1421
01:22:04.050 --> 01:22:07.530
What's weird about your first experience being in a strip club was at a strip

1422
01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:10.260
clubs.
Completely unnatural.
I mean,

1423
01:22:10.261 --> 01:22:13.830
you want to talk about wiring your situation absolutely incorrectly.

1424
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:17.460
You're attractive to a girl who you absolutely should not be attractive to.

1425
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:20.250
You know,
she should not find you attractive in any way,
shape or form,

1426
01:22:20.251 --> 01:22:22.290
but suddenly she's fucking a namerd by you.

1427
01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:26.910
She wants to spend time alone with you and touch you.
Holy Shit.
Oh,

1428
01:22:26.911 --> 01:22:29.940
but she wants money.
She wants money and you can't touch her back.
Well,

1429
01:22:29.941 --> 01:22:33.180
what is this trap I'm in?
Am I going to get to come?
No,
you can't come.

1430
01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.440
He just sort of sit.

1431
01:22:34.441 --> 01:22:39.300
There was girl dances around you in every instinct of your bodies raging to

1432
01:22:39.301 --> 01:22:41.800
stick your penis inside of her body,
but you can't.

1433
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.400
Sounds like most relationships though.
Honestly,
I don't like him.

1434
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:51.240
I hate him.
I don't like strip clubs,
man there I never could get any of that.

1435
01:22:51.241 --> 01:22:51.991
I get sad.

1436
01:22:51.991 --> 01:22:54.600
I mean even when I went to at the beginning I would always like try to talk to

1437
01:22:54.601 --> 01:22:56.320
the girl and cause I was just like,
so what are you doing?

1438
01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:00.420
I was always the talker again.
I just want to talk to you baby.
Well,

1439
01:23:00.421 --> 01:23:03.360
I feel bad for all of them.
I was like,
wow,
I can't believe you're doing this.

1440
01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:06.000
I never felt sad.
Were very nice,
boring.
Some of them are

1441
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.800
<v 8>nice and they're just stuck in this the best way they can make money.</v>

1442
01:23:09.190 --> 01:23:12.490
I mean if you look at it about exporting the system is a great way to make a lot

1443
01:23:12.491 --> 01:23:16.450
of money.
It was Casey.
Anthony is stripper.
Well she,
I don't know.

1444
01:23:16.451 --> 01:23:19.870
She seems like it.
I Dunno.
I'm so glad I did not follow any of that.

1445
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:23.890
I have no idea what anyone I wrote on Twitter that they should have a a TV show,

1446
01:23:23.891 --> 01:23:28.891
a reality show where it's her an optimum and you be the first to find a sober

1447
01:23:30.341 --> 01:23:34.630
guy to shoot a load inside of you.
It's like a competition and the show,

1448
01:23:34.631 --> 01:23:39.580
the name of the show is the apocalypse.
It's just Casey,

1449
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:43.210
Anthony Octomom and see how many straight dudes will shoot loads in them and

1450
01:23:43.211 --> 01:23:45.130
they have to get like blood tests before they go in and

1451
01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.070
<v 1>Casey Anthony's guide to raising a child.
How about that?</v>

1452
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:52.310
That's so imagine man,
I will take,

1453
01:23:52.311 --> 01:23:56.180
I would take 5,000 Casey Anthony's over one.

1454
01:23:56.181 --> 01:23:58.250
Nancy grace any day of the week.

1455
01:23:58.310 --> 01:24:01.250
Nancy grace is a fucking foul.

1456
01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:06.440
Necrophiles I think she is so much more disgusting than some strippers kid

1457
01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:10.580
gotten to her ecstasy or whatever happened.
It's like,
who,
who like,
yeah,

1458
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.000
a dumb girls kiss.
She left the kid in the backseat of the car.

1459
01:24:14.001 --> 01:24:16.520
It fell on the Kiddie pool cause she's negligent or whatever.

1460
01:24:16.521 --> 01:24:18.650
It's like sad and terrible.

1461
01:24:18.651 --> 01:24:23.651
But Nancy Grace's get like clearly getting off on the whole situation.

1462
01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:28.250
I hate those,
uh,
those tabloid death.

1463
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:30.130
Hags like Gracie,
I,

1464
01:24:30.150 --> 01:24:34.070
there's some other woman I saw too is like on the view and she was like,

1465
01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:36.890
we just got the verdict,
the Casey Anthony Verdict.

1466
01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:43.370
<v 14>I'm gonna need your help here.
She said,</v>

1467
01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:45.960
Oh God,
you,

1468
01:24:46.710 --> 01:24:47.820
<v 1>no,
it was just disgusting.</v>

1469
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.780
You're weeping because this one mother got off the hook.
Meanwhile,

1470
01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.970
every year in Afghanistan and Iraq,

1471
01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:57.450
the UN is dropping bombs on neighborhoods.

1472
01:24:57.630 --> 01:25:00.300
Kids are getting blown to smithereens.

1473
01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:05.510
Kids are getting transformed into hamburger meat on a daily basis in the Middle

1474
01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:09.930
East because of our fucked up drones that keep accidentally bombing weddings and

1475
01:25:09.931 --> 01:25:12.210
neighborhoods and these death murder,

1476
01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:17.140
these death hags are freaking out over one dead child.
I mean,

1477
01:25:17.141 --> 01:25:21.250
it's sad.
It's very sad.
That cake Caylee Anthony died.
I mean,

1478
01:25:21.251 --> 01:25:25.330
I think that's terribly sad,
but when you hear Nancy grace being like Kaylee,

1479
01:25:25.331 --> 01:25:27.640
Anthony's bleach bones were found,

1480
01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:31.540
but cable repair operator and all those honor.

1481
01:25:31.541 --> 01:25:35.080
Nick was one fabric,
one bit of her t shirt.

1482
01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:38.020
It's like there's a grow,
there's a disgusting,

1483
01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.570
there's something perverse behind it.
Thank you.
Sorry about that

1484
01:25:41.810 --> 01:25:46.040
<v 8>dude.
You don't have to.
I'm a big fan of bashing Nancy grace.
What up pig?</v>

1485
01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.410
There's something gross about when I,

1486
01:25:48.411 --> 01:25:51.080
whenever I see someone who's angry and they're fat like that and I'm like,

1487
01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.780
maybe you need to go on a diet and you won't be so fucking angry.

1488
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:58.160
That's getting dogged about,
I see someone with his big jowls in this big,

1489
01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:02.420
you know,
I've,
I'm like exercise,
eat right.
Take some yoga classes.

1490
01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:04.190
You'll approach all totally different

1491
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:09.170
<v 11>from where the devil is dancing tonight.
The top mom's off the hook.</v>

1492
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.070
Tiger Woods.
That's a another one.
She went after.

1493
01:26:13.071 --> 01:26:16.220
She went off to tiger woods for like,
you guys need to stop watching me so much.

1494
01:26:16.221 --> 01:26:16.830
Slide.

1495
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:20.340
<v 1>Brilliant.
I wish I had.
I don't want cable.
I'd fucking watch her every day.</v>

1496
01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:25.200
I like you guys don't have cable.
We don't have cable.
I can't do it man.

1497
01:26:25.201 --> 01:26:29.040
I turned in cable on and your house is like opening a fucking portal to hell

1498
01:26:29.041 --> 01:26:31.620
with all those advertisements.
I love the shows dude.

1499
01:26:31.621 --> 01:26:35.370
You just DVR everything don't mean,
yeah,
I've got apple TV,

1500
01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.810
I've got Netflix,

1501
01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.950
I can watch any show I want to watch and I know that you can DVR stuff,

1502
01:26:40.951 --> 01:26:44.550
but inevitably it's just those commercials,
man,
they make me depressed.

1503
01:26:44.551 --> 01:26:48.870
It's every time.
Cause like though I watch TV at the hood when I'm on the road,

1504
01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:53.871
I watched TV and hotels and every time I turn on the TV it seems like things

1505
01:26:54.271 --> 01:26:59.160
have gotten exponentially stupider.
Things have gotten exponentially worse.

1506
01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:02.880
And,
and I kind of like having those spaces in between watching TV.

1507
01:27:02.881 --> 01:27:06.660
Cause I think if you watch TV every day,
you don't realize how,
it's just,

1508
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:09.290
it's just as co imploding.

1509
01:27:09.450 --> 01:27:12.540
<v 11>Every now and then I'll watch something that makes me think like I haven't been</v>

1510
01:27:12.541 --> 01:27:14.730
paying attention and something's been going on.
Did I did?

1511
01:27:14.731 --> 01:27:16.620
I'm not aware of like two and a half men.

1512
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:20.580
Like I'll watch two and a half men and you know and hear the laugh track and

1513
01:27:20.581 --> 01:27:20.970
find out.

1514
01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:23.640
That's a number one show in the country and I'll start scratching my hand.

1515
01:27:23.641 --> 01:27:26.190
I'll go,
okay,
what's going on in Miami?
Did I miss something?

1516
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.240
Has there been just an invasion of stupid that I wasn't here for?
You know,

1517
01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:31.650
is there something going on?
Right.

1518
01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.220
And then you'll watch a commercial and the commercial would be really
ridiculous.

1519
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.690
Like a BP commercial.
Have you seen those BP commercials?
No.

1520
01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:42.770
We've cleaned up the Gulf and they showed people eating seafood and Jordan and

1521
01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:45.900
like sitting there and to deliver in Nice shrimps to the table and everything

1522
01:27:45.901 --> 01:27:49.310
like that.
And bps making it sound like,
oh,
there's no issues at all anymore.
Yeah,

1523
01:27:49.410 --> 01:27:50.100
there's nothing,

1524
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:54.030
it's almost better that the golf and the golf has back the golfers' back like

1525
01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:57.390
Jesus fucking Christ.
How many people committed suicide because of that thing?

1526
01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.610
Many.
How many dolphins were killed?
How many,

1527
01:27:59.611 --> 01:28:01.770
how much leakage do you guys still have?

1528
01:28:01.771 --> 01:28:05.040
That's being unreported because people are still finding slicks out there all

1529
01:28:05.041 --> 01:28:05.710
the time

1530
01:28:05.710 --> 01:28:08.260
<v 1>and also,
you know,
a lot of those fishermen,
they,</v>

1531
01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:12.490
they were doing everything under the table so it wasn't like they could report

1532
01:28:12.491 --> 01:28:17.050
their business and in a way that they could get the relief funds that was given.

1533
01:28:17.051 --> 01:28:20.020
Yeah.
I mean how many,
I mean a lot of it's just like anything else.

1534
01:28:20.021 --> 01:28:24.580
A lot of those fishermen had businesses that weren't like operating according to

1535
01:28:24.730 --> 01:28:25.300
Code.

1536
01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:28.360
<v 11>How about they were using prisoners to clean up the fucking oil and they</v>

1537
01:28:28.361 --> 01:28:32.650
wouldn't let people film it and then making people sick.
It's fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1538
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:36.130
You're in jail for pot and they can make know.
Did they use that though?

1539
01:28:36.131 --> 01:28:38.500
Was in the lid on using dangerous criminals.

1540
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:43.030
How have you awesome murderers to clean up oil?
Yeah.
Yeah.
People bring it back.

1541
01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:44.500
Shanking people with oil.
Yeah.

1542
01:28:47.770 --> 01:28:52.770
My uncle told me how to boil oil and turn it into plastic and make a hard ass

1543
01:28:53.171 --> 01:28:57.520
plastic knife making oil bomb shank some to get mad at me as a few people.

1544
01:28:57.521 --> 01:29:02.090
There's many discussions online.
Someone got mad at me for a black

1545
01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:04.790
<v 10>voice that I shouldn't use all black.
Why would he get mad?</v>

1546
01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:08.320
Talking about like a black man when I like with the way I just had an Emr,

1547
01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:12.080
boiled his shit up and that was a black voice.
That was black.
Yes.
I know.

1548
01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:16.050
I can tell black Holland voices,
guys who are black and Holland.
What is it?

1549
01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:19.990
Is it just the voice?
It's an interesting thing how black people have their,

1550
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.490
their voices sound slightly different.
Like the,
the way,
not all of them.

1551
01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:26.820
Cindy party a is a perfect example of someone who doesn't,
or there's,
you know,

1552
01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.830
obviously Obama doesn't sound like he's black,

1553
01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:32.110
but there's a certain even like really,
um,

1554
01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.400
Morgan Freeman man,
I wonder if she could tell,

1555
01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.980
but it's interesting when you're talking to a guy on the phone,
here's the point.

1556
01:29:37.981 --> 01:29:41.220
I'm not generalizing here,
I'm just,
I'm just being honest about,

1557
01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.660
you can tell many,

1558
01:29:42.661 --> 01:29:46.260
many times whether or not the person you're talking to is black and it doesn't

1559
01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:49.860
mean they're not super articulate are superintelligent is not,
it's a,

1560
01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.240
a tonal quality.

1561
01:29:51.730 --> 01:29:53.440
<v 9>You know what I'm saying?
I think it's the,
uh,</v>

1562
01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:58.240
the name for that tonal quality is fucking cool.
I love the black voice.

1563
01:29:58.241 --> 01:30:01.180
It's the best man.
I wish I talk like that and me all your money,

1564
01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:04.540
it sounds cooler.
It's done so much better than it does.

1565
01:30:04.810 --> 01:30:08.920
It sounds so much better than our dialect.
That dialect is,
it's just cool.

1566
01:30:08.921 --> 01:30:13.390
It's like,
it's what is it as a more relaxed?
It's what is it?
It's moral waxed.

1567
01:30:13.391 --> 01:30:17.050
It's got just cooler more.
Yeah,
just cooler.
I don't know how you put it,
but like,

1568
01:30:17.290 --> 01:30:21.940
you know,
when you hear black comedians talk like white people,

1569
01:30:22.090 --> 01:30:25.270
right?
That's how they hear us.
Like I think we,
we've

1570
01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:26.221
<v 10>the really,</v>

1571
01:30:26.221 --> 01:30:30.150
that's sort of what they're doing is sort of reiterating what Richard Pryor did,

1572
01:30:30.670 --> 01:30:35.080
you know,
back in the 70s kind of piss man.
I'm sorry.
Just dropped.

1573
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:39.360
No waters.
Insane.
And that full synergy,
you drink the full Kombucha.
We got,

1574
01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:42.240
we got him end coffee,
we're filling Dunkin up with liquids.

1575
01:30:42.241 --> 01:30:46.500
We know that they're crucial to mind functioning,
cleaning out his UTS.
So,
um,

1576
01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:49.650
tell me your story about your friends,
your friends,
a little brother.

1577
01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:53.210
<v 4>Oh yeah.
Uh,
so this is pretty interesting.
My,
uh,
friend's little brother,</v>

1578
01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:58.090
he was 21,
so he's a little bit older,
but a real nice guy.
Plays video games,

1579
01:30:58.091 --> 01:30:59.080
has autism,

1580
01:30:59.081 --> 01:31:02.890
but he's got it where he can actually live and he can drive a car and stuff like

1581
01:31:02.891 --> 01:31:06.610
that.
But he's very,
very shy,
very quiet,

1582
01:31:06.611 --> 01:31:09.370
very like when he's out in public,
the first time I met him,

1583
01:31:09.371 --> 01:31:12.520
you would like wear sunglasses for a couple minutes and take them off and put

1584
01:31:12.521 --> 01:31:14.770
them back on.
Like he was just very uncomfortable,

1585
01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:17.350
didn't really ever make conversation.

1586
01:31:17.351 --> 01:31:20.710
It was always like answers like two questions,
you know,
like,
so,
hey,

1587
01:31:20.711 --> 01:31:23.790
how you doing?
Good,
you know,
kind of thing.
Right.
So,
uh,

1588
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:26.950
we were hanging out recently and,
uh,
he,

1589
01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:30.730
he drinks here and there and he'll drink like vodka straight and he'll just chug

1590
01:31:30.731 --> 01:31:31.630
it real quick as he,

1591
01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:35.890
in the past he would drink vodka and he felt more comfortable,
like relaxed,

1592
01:31:35.891 --> 01:31:39.490
like he's not so intense and stuff.
So last night or a couple of nights ago,

1593
01:31:39.491 --> 01:31:43.960
I was like,
Hey,
so,
uh,
do you,
uh,
have you ever smoked weed?
And he goes,

1594
01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:45.550
I was really against it.

1595
01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.940
But then I saw that movie documentary with Joe Rogan in it.

1596
01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:51.730
And now I'm thinking different about it.
And I'm like,
Oh,

1597
01:31:51.731 --> 01:31:55.610
you're talking about the drug war movie or whatever,
the Union,
the Union Django,

1598
01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:57.940
cause he just watches Netflix all day.
That's all he does.

1599
01:31:57.941 --> 01:32:01.240
He doesn't work just pretty much cause it's very hard for them to work.

1600
01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:04.930
They said he just,
you know,
lives with his mom and stuff and uh,
and I'm like,

1601
01:32:04.931 --> 01:32:08.140
well if I got some,
would you want to try it?
And he goes,
yeah,
I think,

1602
01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:11.560
I think I would.
So we went to the store and uh,

1603
01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:16.290
we got allegedly,
we got a,
uh,
you know,
they didn't have any joints left,

1604
01:32:16.291 --> 01:32:18.250
so they had these pre roll blunts,
you know,

1605
01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:21.740
like these humongous cones and it looks like a cone,
but you know,

1606
01:32:21.741 --> 01:32:25.570
like an oil co cone and it's filled with weed.
And so I got him at a,

1607
01:32:25.571 --> 01:32:28.040
I didn't know what to get him.
Like I didn't think I like sativa would be a,

1608
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:31.960
I got him a hybrid.
And,
uh,
I told them to take a couple hits.

1609
01:32:31.961 --> 01:32:35.350
I told him to take one hit and I taught them how to inhale and stuff like that.

1610
01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.020
And uh,
he took one hit and you know,
and I was like,
all right,

1611
01:32:38.021 --> 01:32:41.050
maybe one more and we'll just sit here and watch some TV for a while and see how

1612
01:32:41.051 --> 01:32:42.110
it goes.
And it went,
why?

1613
01:32:42.111 --> 01:32:45.800
And he was kind of like smiling or giggling a little and he goes,
you know,

1614
01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.250
Tim is layer goes,
can I have some more?
And I'm like,
yeah,
sure.

1615
01:32:48.251 --> 01:32:51.850
And gave us more this time he took like five,
Hugh Mungus,

1616
01:32:51.851 --> 01:32:55.300
his strong hits and shit like that.
Next thing you know,

1617
01:32:55.301 --> 01:33:00.040
he was giggling and laughing and talking and he was making sentences and it was

1618
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:04.540
most amazing thing I ever saw.
It was amazing.

1619
01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:08.690
<v 10>Well there was a story on the news from northern California about a family who</v>

1620
01:33:08.691 --> 01:33:11.600
had a son with autism and they try to,
everything with this kid,

1621
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:14.420
they just could not get him to come out of a shell.
They tried therapy,

1622
01:33:14.421 --> 01:33:15.470
they tried,
you know,

1623
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:18.800
all these different methods to try to get him to communicate.

1624
01:33:18.801 --> 01:33:22.340
And then they started giving them weed and they started feeding him hash.

1625
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:25.670
He would eat the hash and he'd put it in fruit and he would eat it and the kid

1626
01:33:25.671 --> 01:33:28.400
became a normal kid.
It's like,
it all just went away.

1627
01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:31.490
Like he figured out how tuned in.
It's fucking incredible.

1628
01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:35.960
Anybody who says there's no medical use for marijuana,

1629
01:33:35.961 --> 01:33:40.400
you're a Goddamn anti human.
You know,
you,
you're a fucking criminal.
You're,

1630
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:42.050
you're a criminal.

1631
01:33:42.170 --> 01:33:44.930
You run around saying that these people that can't actually benefit from it.

1632
01:33:45.230 --> 01:33:47.390
I don't think what we,
what we do with marijuana,

1633
01:33:47.391 --> 01:33:50.810
when I talk about how I'm on the medical marijuana program,
like as a,
you know,

1634
01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:55.670
and,
and people that go,
oh,
you're scamming the system.
Maybe.
No,
maybe.
No,

1635
01:33:55.730 --> 01:34:00.110
maybe.
No.
Maybe it is medicine.
Just like aspirins,
Madison,
you know,
it is,
isn't,

1636
01:34:00.111 --> 01:34:02.690
it is,
it isn't a fucking,
I mean when you,

1637
01:34:02.691 --> 01:34:06.080
when you're having a cold and you take cough medicine and it makes you go to

1638
01:34:06.081 --> 01:34:08.690
sleep and feel better,
isn't that medicine?
Well guess what,

1639
01:34:08.691 --> 01:34:12.620
that medicine is in fucking fixing anything that medicine is just curing your

1640
01:34:12.621 --> 01:34:15.320
symptoms a little bit or concealing your symptoms,

1641
01:34:15.321 --> 01:34:17.510
still allow you to get a good night's sleep.
Well,

1642
01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.260
marijuana is actually making you feel better.
That is medicine.

1643
01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.150
It's medicine for everybody,
man.
You know,
it's,

1644
01:34:24.151 --> 01:34:28.910
it's something that makes you more connected and more sensitive and more

1645
01:34:28.911 --> 01:34:29.690
relaxed.

1646
01:34:29.690 --> 01:34:34.310
<v 4>Well,
I,
I just,
I stopped smoking pot for a month cause I was smoking every day,</v>

1647
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:39.370
all day.
And,
and uh,
this is what happened.

1648
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.460
What happened to me the next day after having probably for a year,

1649
01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:46.940
smoke constantly smoked pot the next day.
You don't happen to me.

1650
01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:51.290
<v 10>Well,
nothing.
I mean I stop.
Listen,</v>

1651
01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:55.850
doctor drew says that the marijuana today is much stronger than the marijuana

1652
01:34:55.851 --> 01:34:58.000
overreaction.
No withdrawn

1653
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.610
<v 9>to juice has,
there's serious withdrawal symptoms.
No anxiety attack.
You know,</v>

1654
01:35:01.611 --> 01:35:03.350
what happened the next day?
Nothing.

1655
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:07.400
You know what happened the next day when I saw flowers,
I wasn't thinking,
oh,

1656
01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:10.160
these are expansions of the mind of God.

1657
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:13.130
I was just seeing flowers and then that's it.
Great.

1658
01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:17.320
Thanks.
That's great.
It really helped.
And I,
and I've done it.

1659
01:35:17.321 --> 01:35:20.160
I've done it for actually today was the first time I smoked pot and I'll let you

1660
01:35:20.161 --> 01:35:20.840
suggesting

1661
01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:25.660
<v 11>doctor drew is a lying whore.
I am suggesting that I am as well.
Yeah.</v>

1662
01:35:25.661 --> 01:35:27.540
I think him and Nancy Grace,
you're going to yep.

1663
01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.280
<v 9>Burn and a specific part of whatever.
Hell,</v>

1664
01:35:30.281 --> 01:35:33.760
there may be one baby that gets eaten by Florida.

1665
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:36.460
Florida will turn into a mouth and eat that baby.

1666
01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:41.060
I think the swamps will open up and you'll see teeth come out of the ground.

1667
01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:44.890
Snatch up the child.
Man,
I would love to dead babies.

1668
01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:48.760
It wasn't even before Laura.
And uh,
you know,
it'd be so fun.

1669
01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:52.810
This is a weird thought that I've had.
Wait a minute,
you,
yeah,
I know.
Get Out.

1670
01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:58.000
But if Nancy grace as a full grown thing is disgusting and foul,

1671
01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:58.390
right?

1672
01:35:58.390 --> 01:36:02.230
But if you could shrink Nancy grace down and have like a pocket Nancy grace that

1673
01:36:02.231 --> 01:36:05.610
lived [inaudible]
best ever,

1674
01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:10.080
some little judgemental death kind that you had an a in an aquarium that was
just

1675
01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:14.500
a little show to the right.

1676
01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.030
Hog or woods.
Yeah.
Charles.

1677
01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:23.490
Those girls that he loved them.
We'll go to the next caller.

1678
01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.350
Is it a dead baby in Florida?

1679
01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:30.370
It is the semen stains on the mattress.

1680
01:36:30.371 --> 01:36:33.000
Can we zoom in on those same,
it's fine.

1681
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:36.700
Let's get dog the bounty hunter and here to dirty nails.

1682
01:36:36.701 --> 01:36:41.300
Scratching or click gone.
Pumpkin,
Siemens diamond.

1683
01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:45.530
The men's style.
That's her mantra when she walks.
She chance.

1684
01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:47.400
Same in Stein.
Nancy grace holds.
Yeah.

1685
01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:50.250
<v 11>World record for the longest squirt ever by a female vagina.</v>

1686
01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:56.760
<v 9>Yeah.
One squirt like 18 feet.
Yeah.
I think that that's where it happened.</v>

1687
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:59.940
It didn't,
that square happened when she saw Jon Benet.
Ramsey is death picture.

1688
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:09.470
<v 11>We were a,
we were at a club in Pittsburgh and um,
we went to see,
um,</v>

1689
01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:14.840
I went with Mark Della Grotta and my Golberg went to see Bella,
Donna Bella.

1690
01:37:14.841 --> 01:37:17.300
Donna had like a little shit.
We didn't go to see her and specifically,

1691
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:20.640
but she just so coincidentally happened to be reforming there.
Sure.

1692
01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:22.650
And they were telling us that we had a girl last week.

1693
01:37:22.651 --> 01:37:25.620
It's squirt all the way from one table to another table.
Wow.

1694
01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.180
This girl could squirt nine feet.

1695
01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:31.650
Apparently she would finger blast yourself and whatever that female ejaculate
is,

1696
01:37:31.651 --> 01:37:34.770
it would literally launch itself through the sky,
like nine feet

1697
01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:39.150
<v 9>it now that female ejaculate.
Isn't there some controversy about that?</v>

1698
01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:42.430
Like there's a mixture of urine and uh,
and yeah,

1699
01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:46.230
<v 11>calm or whatever and creations supposedly.
Yeah.</v>

1700
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.330
Yeah.
I think it's a lot of urine.
I don't know what do I know,

1701
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:53.240
but it just seems crazy that someone could just shoot that shit

1702
01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:56.040
<v 9>am feet.
I mean even,
I mean,
even</v>

1703
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.280
<v 8>shooting urine nine feet is no small feat.
That's a,</v>

1704
01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:01.790
<v 10>yeah.
Apparently the longest distance.
Some guy,</v>

1705
01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:04.490
some guy shot a load like 18 feet or something crazy like that.

1706
01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.670
That's like the world record.
But that might be a lie too.

1707
01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.050
They might have had a fan behind them.

1708
01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:10.150
<v 8>Yeah.
I want to see video of it.</v>

1709
01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:18.430
They didn't tell you that he shot that load and an air tunnel test cars for

1710
01:38:18.431 --> 01:38:22.390
their aerodynamic capabilities.
Boom.

1711
01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.460
18 feet.
Mom

1712
01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:31.170
doesn't specify whether or not there's a tailwind.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,

1713
01:38:31.171 --> 01:38:34.000
squirting is a,
is a fascinating phenomenon.

1714
01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:37.750
Joey Diaz used to date a girl had that issue and he goes,
it's inconsistent.

1715
01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.690
That's what you get mad about it.
One day it's like the Morag Pi.

1716
01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:47.850
The next day it's like gunpowder.
It's inconsistent.

1717
01:38:48.370 --> 01:38:52.120
It's a,
a
gusher,

1718
01:38:52.121 --> 01:38:56.940
but she never really scored it.
But after sex it was seriously like a bucket.

1719
01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.380
<v 10>Yeah.
My high school,</v>

1720
01:38:58.381 --> 01:39:01.710
I was like that when I had a girlfriend in high school who would drip down her

1721
01:39:01.711 --> 01:39:05.700
legs.
It was crazy.
Like we would,
uh,
you know,
just be hanging out in her,

1722
01:39:05.701 --> 01:39:09.000
in her bed and kissing her and all sudden like her legs would be wet.

1723
01:39:09.001 --> 01:39:11.670
It would drip down her posts down the inside of her thoughts.

1724
01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.020
<v 8>Dirty bench.
Now when,
when that happens,</v>

1725
01:39:14.021 --> 01:39:18.280
they have to drink more water because that's from you mean they do,
right.

1726
01:39:18.281 --> 01:39:21.280
Cause like no more than you do if you have to take a leak,
you know?

1727
01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:22.240
I mean if you have to take the leak,

1728
01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:24.460
do you have to immediately get water in your system?
When you die?

1729
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:29.200
They get dehydrated faster.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm sure.
Yeah.

1730
01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:35.080
Yeah.
I bet squirters can die.
Yeah.

1731
01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:37.120
Maybe it's one of the tests they take you.

1732
01:39:37.121 --> 01:39:40.360
If you're gonna go on a fucking engine on a hike in the Mojave [inaudible].

1733
01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:41.710
Anybody here a squirter

1734
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:47.770
inhibitor is imperative that you do not masturbate during this journey.

1735
01:39:47.771 --> 01:39:52.420
Are we clear what not at all?
You'll need to conserve your water.

1736
01:39:52.421 --> 01:39:55.510
Girls do not score it in the desert and to keep pushing,
drawing,

1737
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:59.080
keep your mind clean.
Keep your mind clean of impure thoughts.

1738
01:39:59.081 --> 01:40:02.380
Any girls leak out of their panties if you are in an but if you are in the

1739
01:40:02.381 --> 01:40:06.390
desert with a squirter.
Okay.
Do you drink for sure.

1740
01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:09.160
Guys have lived on boats for days,

1741
01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:13.240
<v 10>uh,
and not dehydrated because they drank their own piss,
not dehydrated.</v>

1742
01:40:13.241 --> 01:40:15.860
The death of course they had some dehydration,
but um,

1743
01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.200
you can drink your own urine.

1744
01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.870
You can recycle your own urine like apparently over and over again.

1745
01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:22.720
<v 8>Yeah,
that,
I knew that.
But it keeps you alive.</v>

1746
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:25.240
There's people that have done it when other people wouldn't do it and those

1747
01:40:25.241 --> 01:40:28.450
people,
they wouldn't do it.
Start,
they died.
Well,
that's an idiot.
Yeah.

1748
01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:32.170
It's like I'd rather die than drink something that was already in my body.

1749
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:33.783
What a moron.

1750
01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:38.390
<v 10>Yeah.
Well think about the dude wanted to get his head cut off.
There's,</v>

1751
01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:42.100
it takes every kind of people that make this crazy world.
It takes it sing.

1752
01:40:42.101 --> 01:40:44.170
Brian took civic canopy.

1753
01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.150
You a couple of years younger than me,
son.

1754
01:40:49.650 --> 01:40:53.110
You missed out on some great references.
This temple in India.

1755
01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:54.100
Let's talk about that

1756
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.140
<v 11>cause it's fucking fascinating.
And Dunkin,</v>

1757
01:40:56.141 --> 01:40:58.960
you are a man who all the people I know.

1758
01:40:58.961 --> 01:41:03.961
You know more about ancient India and in the Bhagavad Gita and the all the

1759
01:41:04.781 --> 01:41:06.470
different ancient text.
Sure.

1760
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:09.180
<v 9>Maybe,
I don't know.
I don't know that that might right.</v>

1761
01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:14.020
<v 11>First of all,
try and pronounce this fucking name.
This is the place in India.</v>

1762
01:41:14.021 --> 01:41:17.730
Are you ready for this?
They use they,
they'll throw some fucking words into us,

1763
01:41:17.770 --> 01:41:19.540
into a name.
They don't give a fuck.

1764
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.360
They'll throw some letters rather than her name in India.
I mean they,

1765
01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:25.180
they're really not trying to be brief and all that.
They're not,
this is the,

1766
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:27.940
this is the real name of this place where they found this.

1767
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.560
What it is is a giant temple.

1768
01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:34.650
And under this temple they found a vault that hadn't been open for over 150

1769
01:41:35.621 --> 01:41:38.230
years,
actually six volts that hadn't been opened.

1770
01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:43.260
Some of them for 150 years and there's at least $20 billion where the treasure

1771
01:41:43.541 --> 01:41:46.240
in there and now they're saying that it's probably going to be closer to a

1772
01:41:46.241 --> 01:41:48.160
trillion because what they're counting on us,

1773
01:41:48.161 --> 01:41:49.840
how much these things are actually worth,
you know,

1774
01:41:49.841 --> 01:41:51.850
as far as like the gold and you know,
the,
the,

1775
01:41:51.851 --> 01:41:56.170
the emeralds and all the jewels and stuff.
But they're saying,
well,
just the,
the,

1776
01:41:56.171 --> 01:41:58.330
the,
you know,
if you wanted to auction this stuff off,

1777
01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.420
you know what the real worth would be.
It would be much higher than that.

1778
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.580
You know,
you're,
you're looking at something,
it's just the,
you know,

1779
01:42:03.581 --> 01:42:06.790
what it's worth mineral wise,
you know,
but you know,
just the,

1780
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:09.820
the historical value of these things would bring it through the roof.

1781
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:11.980
This is the name of the place.
This is fucking crazy.

1782
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:17.550
T H I r U v a n a n t h a p.

1783
01:42:18.581 --> 01:42:23.410
U r a.
M.
India
say that,

1784
01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:29.730
say Reuven through Brrrum non super rumbles

1785
01:42:33.670 --> 01:42:37.090
for through Rovana through bro.
Can you,
can you read this?

1786
01:42:37.091 --> 01:42:39.760
Come over here and read this.
I can't read.
I don't read Sanskrit.

1787
01:42:39.761 --> 01:42:44.740
I'd stumble it Sanskrits English.
Do you know what that would say?

1788
01:42:45.130 --> 01:42:47.560
Well,
you're,
you're pretty good at this shit.
What would that say?

1789
01:42:48.250 --> 01:42:52.590
That's the place where it happened in India through via

1790
01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:57.520
their Evana stopper.
It's like Burke,
Chrysler's,
Twitter,

1791
01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.710
[inaudible] van and super remember,

1792
01:43:02.711 --> 01:43:07.090
imagine if you were fucking landed on a plane flight in India and you had to get

1793
01:43:07.091 --> 01:43:07.241
to a,

1794
01:43:07.241 --> 01:43:10.480
through a van on Super Rum and you only saw it written down and you're trying to

1795
01:43:10.481 --> 01:43:11.260
talk to the driver.

1796
01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:15.610
[inaudible] can you take me to throw van hook through Vana no soup around.

1797
01:43:15.611 --> 01:43:16.560
Please copy

1798
01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.050
<v 9>that and put.com and see if I,
somebody actually has that domain.
Hey,
right,</v>

1799
01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:25.890
I want through rob.
That's that the thing about that,

1800
01:43:25.891 --> 01:43:28.360
finding all that treasure under that temple,
it goes,
oh,

1801
01:43:28.361 --> 01:43:32.580
I'm reading this awesome book,
um,
about,
you know,

1802
01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:35.730
how religion is designed to take people's money.

1803
01:43:36.150 --> 01:43:40.020
And I think that's a really good example of,
um,
of,
uh,

1804
01:43:40.050 --> 01:43:42.570
of that use temple having so much money.
Yeah.

1805
01:43:42.571 --> 01:43:46.380
Because people get this book that I'm reading and it's so funny that I can't

1806
01:43:46.381 --> 01:43:49.830
believe I hadn't considered this,
but it talks about how in the Old Testament,

1807
01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:53.480
you know,
they say asks for a,
an an offering of a,

1808
01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:58.590
a lamb or a burn offering of an unblemished cow and all those things,

1809
01:43:59.350 --> 01:44:03.440
they're just priests saying what they want to eat.
It's like,

1810
01:44:03.441 --> 01:44:07.670
obviously God doesn't want a cow.
God doesn't want to burn offering of a sheep.

1811
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:12.770
God doesn't want $20 billion worth of jewels.
It's the priests saying,

1812
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:16.960
God wants these things and people bring it to the priests.
That's what it is.

1813
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:17.923
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1814
01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:22.190
They had sacks filled with diamonds piled next to tons,

1815
01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.520
tons of gold coins and jewelry.

1816
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:27.860
Apparently it's fucking credible.

1817
01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:33.220
The vaults of the 18th or the 16th century Shri Pod Mun uh,

1818
01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:39.020
but why me?
Hmm,

1819
01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:43.400
maybe a temple.
The world chapter of the former rulers of a,

1820
01:44:43.401 --> 01:44:47.000
this area of a Corolla state.
Wow.
What?

1821
01:44:47.001 --> 01:44:50.840
It's kind of weird to think that you have all these vaults under your temple and

1822
01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:53.310
you never open them up.
Yeah.
I mean how the fuck did,

1823
01:44:53.311 --> 01:44:55.900
did people just die and not tell people about the show?

1824
01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:57.470
You go under your temple ever.

1825
01:44:57.670 --> 01:45:02.060
Well now the issue is none of the people know this is just a little temple in a

1826
01:45:02.061 --> 01:45:05.080
small town and now they have like a few cops there that a guardian.

1827
01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:08.060
But guess what?
Fuck face.
That's not enough.
You dummies.

1828
01:45:08.061 --> 01:45:13.061
Just one on nbc.com and talked about something that might be worth trillions of

1829
01:45:13.101 --> 01:45:17.730
fucking dollars.
Not,
you know,
not millions.
Not Billions really.

1830
01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:21.470
I think it could be worth,
it may be worth 1,000,000,000,009.
You know what?

1831
01:45:21.471 --> 01:45:22.700
I have a feeling of the United States.

1832
01:45:22.701 --> 01:45:25.190
He's going to find some impress people over there and need frame.

1833
01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:30.230
They found a 15 foot long gold chains.

1834
01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:32.600
<v 9>Wow.</v>

1835
01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:36.740
<v 11>15 foot long gold chains.
Holy Shit Man.</v>

1836
01:45:36.850 --> 01:45:39.790
<v 9>It's just like,
man,
when I was a kid,</v>

1837
01:45:39.970 --> 01:45:43.510
if there was any kind of like hidden tunnel anywhere,

1838
01:45:43.511 --> 01:45:46.660
like I'd go into a sewer when I was at,
it's like how has,

1839
01:45:46.661 --> 01:45:48.600
how has no one gone down into that

1840
01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:51.250
<v 11>vault for so long?
There's a four foot tall,</v>

1841
01:45:51.251 --> 01:45:54.470
solid gold statue studied with emeralds.

1842
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:58.070
<v 4>We used to have the sewage system that went through our whole neighborhood that</v>

1843
01:45:58.071 --> 01:46:01.430
we used to call candy land as a kid and we would like go,

1844
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.360
it was like a drainage sewage.
Thank well how the fuck did you call it?

1845
01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:09.830
Well one thing is ever somebody spray painted the entrance so it looked like

1846
01:46:09.831 --> 01:46:12.860
you're walking into like Alice in wonderland or Candyland or something like that

1847
01:46:12.861 --> 01:46:16.850
and you walk through it and I mean somebody dragged a couch in there.

1848
01:46:16.851 --> 01:46:18.970
Somehow in the end people would sit in there and hanging.

1849
01:46:18.971 --> 01:46:20.030
It was like a underground.

1850
01:46:20.031 --> 01:46:24.080
So we'd go through these streets in the sewage system and pop out these little

1851
01:46:24.081 --> 01:46:25.820
sewage pipe things and was kind of like,

1852
01:46:25.821 --> 01:46:28.430
we have like this underground tunnel throughout the whole neighborhood.

1853
01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.050
It's pretty bad ass until it rained.

1854
01:46:30.051 --> 01:46:32.740
And then it was just disgusting cause Shit and Poop.

1855
01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:37.600
Well it was all rainwater and stuff like that.
But uh,
it's still had growth.

1856
01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:38.713
Incredible.

1857
01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:41.700
<v 11>2011 that they're finding this and this and this temple.</v>

1858
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:45.270
It makes you wonder what the fuck they found in Egypt.
You know,

1859
01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:48.930
what kind of cool shit was pillaged many,
many years ago because you know,

1860
01:46:48.931 --> 01:46:53.040
by time Western explorers started tapping into those temples in the 18 hundreds

1861
01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:57.270
so much of that stuff has already gone.
Thousands of years of,
of grave robbers,

1862
01:46:57.271 --> 01:46:57.810
right?

1863
01:46:57.810 --> 01:47:01.290
People got into temples and stole things and it's one of the more impressive

1864
01:47:01.291 --> 01:47:03.900
things about when they found like two ton comments is that they actually

1865
01:47:03.901 --> 01:47:06.810
discovered it and nobody had gotten to it yet and they were able to do it,

1866
01:47:06.811 --> 01:47:08.010
you know,
within,
you know,
this,

1867
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:12.360
this scent generation and open this up and expose it to everybody.
You know,

1868
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:14.790
I wonder how many of those things are still out there a ton.

1869
01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.750
She imagined time manage if they got to one and it was like the fucking scene in

1870
01:47:18.751 --> 01:47:21.180
alien,
you know,
I remember seeing an alien,

1871
01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:24.330
the first movie where they sound the one giant alien with his chest,

1872
01:47:24.331 --> 01:47:26.130
exploded the hall.

1873
01:47:26.131 --> 01:47:29.160
It's the best when they're looking at this dead alien trying to figure out what

1874
01:47:29.161 --> 01:47:29.994
the fuck killed him.

1875
01:47:30.330 --> 01:47:33.780
How dope would that be if we got into some underground temple and it was the

1876
01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:38.430
bones of some fucking dead alien dead aliens on a spaceship thrown like,
yeah.

1877
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:42.810
<v 9>And what's your title at Dead End?
Inaki I just went to uh,</v>

1878
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:47.190
uh,
the Metropolitan Museum in New York and they had these ancient,

1879
01:47:47.191 --> 01:47:50.400
this ancient Sumerian temple that they've rebuilt their,
wow.

1880
01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:54.840
It is fucking awesome,
man.
It's so cool.
And like

1881
01:47:56.740 --> 01:48:01.440
beat the woman.
The museum was telling us that all of it was just stolen.

1882
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:05.610
Like all that stuff was stolen from like Iran I guess.

1883
01:48:05.611 --> 01:48:08.530
Or I guess that stuff came from Iraq,

1884
01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:11.190
but like it was really a minute.

1885
01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:14.510
<v 11>Ron,
you have to say rock.
Really?</v>

1886
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:16.200
<v 9>Yeah,
I rack,</v>

1887
01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:20.420
I get confused about everything I pronounced when I'm about to pronounce

1888
01:48:20.421 --> 01:48:23.210
anything.
It goes through this weird filter.
I'm like,
you're on Iraq.

1889
01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:27.210
I always say I ran.
I always say I ran because that's how I heard it.
Yeah,

1890
01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:31.230
<v 11>it was on TV.
I don't even have this.
I don't know.
I'm just kidding.
Kidding you,</v>

1891
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:34.750
but I'm just saying that people always give me a hard time about it.

1892
01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.210
<v 9>No,
it's,
yeah,
it's the worst.
Like I have no,</v>

1893
01:48:37.211 --> 01:48:39.270
I don't know that that plays to not hang out with us.
No,
those

1894
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:42.030
<v 11>people,
by the way,
Chile.
It's not people I know in real life.</v>

1895
01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:46.320
It's messaged work people,
Chile,
Chile,
Sheila,
Sheila,

1896
01:48:47.610 --> 01:48:51.600
Sheila,
Sheila and sea bass.
It's delicious.
That's on last night.

1897
01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.780
It's very yummy.
I could see myself good.
So good.

1898
01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:57.460
It's supposed to be in danger though or something.
Not supposed to eat it.
Why?

1899
01:48:57.710 --> 01:49:00.870
It's delicious.
It's a reason why it's endangered.
Yeah,

1900
01:49:00.871 --> 01:49:02.850
but this stuff was really cool to see,
man.

1901
01:49:02.851 --> 01:49:05.250
They have like the way they wrote is they have these,

1902
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:08.730
you know about the little rollers with Cuneiform Cuny?
Yeah,

1903
01:49:08.731 --> 01:49:13.600
that's what that's called and they roll it into clay and it's really fun.
Yeah.

1904
01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:18.360
I went to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
I believe it's museum fine arts,

1905
01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:20.810
whatever the museum and is.
There's a one museum that has a,

1906
01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:25.270
an ancient Mesopotamian collection,
ancient Egyptian,
ancient Iraq,
Iraq,

1907
01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:29.130
Iraq,
Iraq,
Iraq,
Iran,
Iran,
all do the,

1908
01:49:29.150 --> 01:49:32.670
although that area ship,
they have a lot of that cuneiform script.

1909
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:34.530
It's really cool to think that,
you know,

1910
01:49:34.531 --> 01:49:39.030
you're sitting here in this air conditioned room staring at some piece of clay

1911
01:49:39.210 --> 01:49:43.200
that someone had written on 6,000 years ago.
You know,

1912
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:44.370
and that's how they wrote.

1913
01:49:44.371 --> 01:49:48.190
They wrote in these little up and down little squiggles,
a little lines rather.

1914
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:50.890
<v 2>It looks like,
you know what they look like,
they look like old nails.</v>

1915
01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:54.790
If you go to a,
an old house,
like when I do construction,
Boston,

1916
01:49:55.090 --> 01:49:58.450
Boston is so fucking old that a lot of times you would get houses and you would

1917
01:49:58.451 --> 01:49:59.920
do demos on these houses.
Like,

1918
01:49:59.921 --> 01:50:02.410
you don't have to tear down a wall or something like that and you would have to

1919
01:50:02.411 --> 01:50:06.820
pull nails out and they would be these fucking ancient nails where it wasn't

1920
01:50:06.821 --> 01:50:10.780
like made by a machine where there was like a round flat top and then a,

1921
01:50:10.781 --> 01:50:14.890
a tubular,
you know,
pointy part on the bottom.
You know,
that's like,
you know,

1922
01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:18.130
straight and no,
it wasn't like that.
It was like there were these weird,

1923
01:50:18.131 --> 01:50:20.370
like almost handmade fucking nail looking things.

1924
01:50:20.371 --> 01:50:23.570
So like cast into some cast iron like pigs.

1925
01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:27.880
They're like old ass fucking,
that's what,
that's what this cuneiform looks like.

1926
01:50:27.881 --> 01:50:30.220
It looks like all these old nails,
you know,

1927
01:50:30.221 --> 01:50:32.620
like next to each other and sideways and shit.

1928
01:50:33.170 --> 01:50:36.290
<v 9>Yeah,
it's a,
it's,
it's crazy to see that and to see how,</v>

1929
01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:41.690
how beautiful those statues are and how perfectly sculpted they are and to think

1930
01:50:41.691 --> 01:50:45.920
about how old that civilization was and that somehow we think of them as

1931
01:50:45.921 --> 01:50:50.290
primitive.
You know,
we judge that.
Anything,
uh,

1932
01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:55.730
that old,
we just think of it as,
oh,
they were crazy.
They,
they're not crazy.

1933
01:50:55.731 --> 01:50:56.151
But you know,

1934
01:50:56.151 --> 01:51:00.980
they had these myths where they believed in these winged like bird headed

1935
01:51:00.981 --> 01:51:02.720
creatures that they were shipped.

1936
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:07.100
And it was some kind of a hallucination that they were all having.
Right?

1937
01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:11.410
<v 2>So much controversy about that whole part of the world in that time of the world</v>

1938
01:51:11.411 --> 01:51:14.820
because a of Zechariah ascension,
there's so many,
uh,

1939
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:19.110
of those guys who studied that Sumerian texts don't agree with him.
So it's,

1940
01:51:19.111 --> 01:51:22.420
it's real hard to figure out who's right and who's wrong.
You know,

1941
01:51:22.421 --> 01:51:27.160
there's like a whole website called Cichon is wrong.com and it all breaks down

1942
01:51:27.410 --> 01:51:31.420
all the stuff about the Annunaki and all this shit that's such and said such and

1943
01:51:31.421 --> 01:51:35.970
looked at all those pictures of these,
um,
giant people from a,
you know,

1944
01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:38.710
these reliefs and looked at all the,

1945
01:51:38.711 --> 01:51:43.450
the Sumerian texts and his deduction after all this years of studying it was

1946
01:51:43.451 --> 01:51:46.960
that there was some great planet,
you know,
3000,

1947
01:51:46.961 --> 01:51:50.830
600 year elliptical orbit that comes between us and,
and Jupiter,

1948
01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:53.350
Mars and Jupiter every 3000,
600 years.

1949
01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:58.600
And they come over to earth and then they fucking deal with us every 3,600

1950
01:51:58.601 --> 01:52:00.640
years.
And this was like,
you know,
this,

1951
01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:03.310
everybody else thought that this was the most ridiculous,

1952
01:52:03.311 --> 01:52:07.030
outlandish science fiction.
Ridiculous depiction.

1953
01:52:07.031 --> 01:52:11.020
But the bottom line is if you look at all those clay tablets,

1954
01:52:11.021 --> 01:52:14.470
there's so much weird shit to them.
There's a,
why are these people so big?

1955
01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:17.290
And then there's small people that they're holding in their hands and some of

1956
01:52:17.291 --> 01:52:21.310
these small people have a monkey tails and why,
you know,
they have,
they have the,

1957
01:52:21.311 --> 01:52:24.360
the or the actual solar system of,
of our,

1958
01:52:24.361 --> 01:52:28.870
our sources to make a drawing of it with the planets and the correct order and

1959
01:52:28.871 --> 01:52:33.280
the correct size,
including Pluto.
Yeah.
You know,
when people dispute that man.

1960
01:52:33.281 --> 01:52:37.810
But look,
I've,
I've seen the,
the images and I've seen people,
you know,

1961
01:52:37.811 --> 01:52:41.710
compare the images to the actual orbits of earth and for an artist to
Pictionary,

1962
01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:46.010
pretty God damn clothes.
You know,
whether it's a,
an absolutely or not just

1963
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:50.240
<v 11>looking at it and saying,
how the fuck did they even know about any of this shit?</v>

1964
01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:53.060
How did they know that there were all these planets out there?

1965
01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:56.300
How could they distinguish between the stars and those planets?

1966
01:52:56.570 --> 01:53:00.680
How were they doing that 6,000 years ago?
Cause I know you and I can't.
Yeah,

1967
01:53:00.690 --> 01:53:02.870
we wouldn't be able to do it if you don't have a telescope.

1968
01:53:02.871 --> 01:53:05.510
How the fuck are you seeing all that shit?
If,
what is it?

1969
01:53:05.511 --> 01:53:08.960
Just dumb luck that they had this dispatch depiction of the sun.

1970
01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:13.220
Clearly the sun a circle with even like the little flame marks around it and

1971
01:53:13.221 --> 01:53:17.030
then they have these depictions of all these planets in an obviously in orbit

1972
01:53:17.031 --> 01:53:18.500
around the sun.
Sure.

1973
01:53:18.590 --> 01:53:22.610
In big and small that directly represent what is actually out there.

1974
01:53:22.611 --> 01:53:25.790
Here's Jupiter.
Look how big it is.
Here's Mars.
It's smaller than us.

1975
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:29.840
I mean it was all there.
It's,
it's as far as an artist's depiction.

1976
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:33.230
It's an artist's depiction of someone who knows what's out there and did think

1977
01:53:33.231 --> 01:53:36.020
that they knew what's out there.
6,000 years ago,
it was pretty trippy.

1978
01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.180
<v 1>I don't understand.</v>

1979
01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:41.560
I have never had a problem believing that aliens came by here at one point and

1980
01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:43.660
had a little conversation with our DNA.

1981
01:53:43.661 --> 01:53:46.810
And I don't know why people have a problem believing that I,

1982
01:53:46.811 --> 01:53:48.700
it it seems just so clear.

1983
01:53:48.701 --> 01:53:53.170
Every single religion talks about something coming down from the sky.
I mean,

1984
01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:54.550
we're fine.

1985
01:53:54.690 --> 01:53:59.260
[inaudible] religion that talks about an earth based deity,

1986
01:53:59.261 --> 01:54:00.940
something that comes up out of the ground,

1987
01:54:00.941 --> 01:54:05.290
something that comes out of the ground.
It's uh,
the,
the,
you know,
the Greek gods.

1988
01:54:05.291 --> 01:54:09.400
They lived on Mount Olympus,
Om the all gods,

1989
01:54:09.401 --> 01:54:12.130
all the great,
the great spirit and the different,
um,

1990
01:54:12.370 --> 01:54:17.320
visitors that the native Americans talk about.
They came from space,
they came,

1991
01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:19.000
we got visited

1992
01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:22.700
<v 11>there,
a mushrooms,
Dunkin.
It could be that or it could be,</v>

1993
01:54:22.701 --> 01:54:25.890
what is it possible that,
what's going on is that these people are,

1994
01:54:25.891 --> 01:54:30.891
are all survivors of a civilization that crashed because of some sort of a

1995
01:54:31.101 --> 01:54:35.420
natural catastrophe back when the world wasn't as connected as is today.

1996
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:38.480
Like say what's going on in Japan right now,
which is going on in Japan,

1997
01:54:38.481 --> 01:54:40.990
is this crazy,
terrible situation to tsunamis.

1998
01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:43.850
Take away the nuclear power thing because obviously we're talking about at a

1999
01:54:43.851 --> 01:54:45.200
time where there was no nuclear power,

2000
01:54:45.330 --> 01:54:49.460
so everything gets crushed and falls apart in that part of the world gets

2001
01:54:49.461 --> 01:54:51.560
destroyed.
Or what if the rest of the world,

2002
01:54:51.561 --> 01:54:55.190
like they had to rebuild but the rest of the world survived independently and

2003
01:54:55.191 --> 01:54:58.400
then people came over and helicopters and shit and these people were still

2004
01:54:58.401 --> 01:55:01.210
living like people lived,
you know,
10,000 years ago because of their,

2005
01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:04.940
their collapse and their civilization was destroyed by natural catastrophe.

2006
01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:09.320
Maybe they see people landing in jets,
an airplanes and shit,
and they think,

2007
01:55:09.321 --> 01:55:14.120
Holy Shit,
these are aliens,
right?
Is that possible?
Yes.
Yeah.

2008
01:55:14.121 --> 01:55:18.320
It's probably,
I mean it's one of those things where we can never answer it,

2009
01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:21.080
but yeah,
that is the problem,
right?
That's the big problem.
But my,

2010
01:55:21.081 --> 01:55:24.050
my theory socks though,
my theory is not fun.
It's not fun and,

2011
01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:27.590
or sexy helicopters landed and those are the CFOs that's gay.

2012
01:55:27.650 --> 01:55:30.470
I just think there was this what,
why?
Here's what happened.

2013
01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:33.770
I'll tell you what happened and I do know you do.
Yeah,

2014
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.100
<v 1>we are.
We came from Mars,</v>

2015
01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:41.440
Mars got attacked by aliens and we had to escape from Mars to come here and we

2016
01:55:41.441 --> 01:55:41.951
landed.

2017
01:55:41.951 --> 01:55:46.890
And there were some ecological that made us forget all the technology that we

2018
01:55:46.891 --> 01:55:47.580
learned,

2019
01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:52.380
that technology got all fragmented up and turn it into like religions and

2020
01:55:52.381 --> 01:55:57.240
magical systems and the Kabbalah and all that stuff is just based on like very

2021
01:55:57.270 --> 01:56:02.010
ancient metaphysical circuit boards were the descendants of these,

2022
01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:06.170
um,
I don't know,
survivors from another planet.
We,
you know,

2023
01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:10.680
have some vague race memory of something bigger and we try to translate it in

2024
01:56:10.681 --> 01:56:14.670
the form of all of our religions and we all squabble and fight over it.

2025
01:56:14.671 --> 01:56:19.300
And the squabbling and the fighting is keeping us from reassembling the

2026
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:22.890
spaceship that we were building in the,
uh,
beginning.

2027
01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:26.520
And if we could just get back to work on that guide,
damn spaceship,
then we can

2028
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:30.380
<v 11>dangit back to Mazda.
Dude,
Mars doesn't exist anymore.
Maurice died off.</v>

2029
01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:33.980
Joe With this is,
it's inside Mars is like lost.

2030
01:56:34.230 --> 01:56:38.930
It's like our show last step.
We are,
you know,

2031
01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:43.960
100,000 generations of people living on this island and we've completely

2032
01:56:44.811 --> 01:56:48.680
forgotten that it's an island.
That's it.
That's what it is.
Mars.
That's it.

2033
01:56:48.710 --> 01:56:53.090
You got to get back to Mars.
But inside Mars,
inside Mars,

2034
01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:54.680
that's where it is.
There's all this.

2035
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:59.030
Have you seen those pictures of those giant holes in the side of Mars?
No.

2036
01:56:59.690 --> 01:57:03.770
It's in the volcanoes.
Dunkin was volcanoes on Mars.
Yes.
New Information.

2037
01:57:03.771 --> 01:57:07.450
It's invisible.
Richard Hoagland.
Richard Hoagland.
We'll connect there.
It looked,

2038
01:57:07.451 --> 01:57:11.570
this rock connects exactly 15 meters from that rock,

2039
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:15.180
which goes over to here,
which is this multi sided pyramid like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,

2040
01:57:15.181 --> 01:57:17.060
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
multi-sided.
What?

2041
01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:20.510
And you've got to look at it sideways and squint and what are you seeing that

2042
01:57:20.511 --> 01:57:24.770
I'm like,
those guys are crazy.
We will never know.
It's a big mystery.

2043
01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.240
That's the idea though,

2044
01:57:26.241 --> 01:57:29.450
is the New Orleans believe that the Nubians believe they came from Mars.

2045
01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:32.510
That was a lot of the ancient,
the ancient Nubian folklore.

2046
01:57:32.511 --> 01:57:37.190
Is that something that happens part of Africa?
Yeah,
that is what happened.

2047
01:57:37.191 --> 01:57:37.610
There was a,

2048
01:57:37.610 --> 01:57:42.170
we got attacked by the fucking Surg or we can start karate or maybe we just,

2049
01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:44.060
maybe that was the,

2050
01:57:44.090 --> 01:57:48.770
the real ancient civilization that we got attacked by asteroids and know that we

2051
01:57:48.771 --> 01:57:52.370
lived on Mars and Mars got hammered by asteroids.
We lost our environment.

2052
01:57:52.610 --> 01:57:55.990
And so we had,
we just took a spaceship and flew here,
you know,

2053
01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.110
20,000 years ago and mingled with apes that,
and then we forgot about everything.

2054
01:58:00.111 --> 01:58:03.800
We forgot about our spaceship.
Yeah.
That's how we got here.
Yup.
I,

2055
01:58:03.801 --> 01:58:04.880
that's what I think it is.

2056
01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:08.480
Now you've got these weirdos parading around as the priests of religion.

2057
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:10.580
How long would it take?
Imagine this,

2058
01:58:10.610 --> 01:58:14.900
imagine if you have a spaceship and the space ship can carry 4,000 people.
Sure.

2059
01:58:14.930 --> 01:58:15.350
Leave.

2060
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:19.730
Take these 4,000 people from Earth and because of some shifting of the solar

2061
01:58:19.731 --> 01:58:22.820
system and the balance,
all of a sudden earth becomes uninhabitable.

2062
01:58:22.821 --> 01:58:26.280
But Mercury is,
or you know,
Venus is,
or there's another planet.

2063
01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:29.080
Let's just say we go back to Mars.
We terraform Mars.
Yeah.

2064
01:58:29.150 --> 01:58:32.390
Let's say we terraform Mars and they've done it successfully to the point where

2065
01:58:32.391 --> 01:58:36.290
they show you like Mars isn't habitable and so people fishing on Mars and having

2066
01:58:36.291 --> 01:58:37.124
a good time,

2067
01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:42.160
vacationing and tailgating and shit and 4,000 people get get on a ship to avoid

2068
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:45.370
Earth's disaster and they land on Mars.
How long would it take?

2069
01:58:45.371 --> 01:58:47.950
How many generations before we completely forgot what happened.

2070
01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:52.750
Cause it's like the 4,000 generations or 4,000 people,
right?

2071
01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:54.280
If you get 4,000 people,

2072
01:58:54.281 --> 01:58:58.960
you'd have to get scientists and educators and philosophers.

2073
01:58:58.961 --> 01:59:03.130
You'd have to like mix it up really carefully because you would want as much of

2074
01:59:03.131 --> 01:59:05.620
our civilization to carry on as possible.

2075
01:59:05.710 --> 01:59:08.530
But how many generations would it take before we completely forgot what
happened?

2076
01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:11.930
Well you maybe,
maybe like you know it,

2077
01:59:11.931 --> 01:59:14.020
it depends on the how we're storing our information.

2078
01:59:14.610 --> 01:59:19.040
What are we storing our information on and these things,
man,
you know,

2079
01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:22.360
if you're doing it on little SD cards,
you're doing at least the last e cards,

2080
01:59:22.361 --> 01:59:27.130
right?
Yeah.
You can lose these dude,
shit can go wrong.
Look how tiny that is.

2081
01:59:27.250 --> 01:59:31.150
What if,
what if you have this and then you know,
we have to start from scratch.

2082
01:59:31.151 --> 01:59:34.480
There's some sort of Mad Max situation and you have to invent some new way to

2083
01:59:34.481 --> 01:59:35.350
read these things.

2084
01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:40.630
If you and I had all the time in the world to come up with a way to read this,

2085
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:42.290
we would never solve it.
So what,

2086
01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:46.660
so what you would do after the information device has start getting wiped out,

2087
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:49.300
something happens where the information device has get wiped out.

2088
01:59:49.301 --> 01:59:50.320
So then you're going to start,

2089
01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:56.170
I suppose trying to encode the information on things that will last,

2090
01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:58.750
you know,
and that's where you stone,

2091
01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:03.010
that's what those Georgia Guidestones yeah,
right.
That kind of stuff.

2092
02:00:03.011 --> 02:00:05.200
Could you imagine if you just,
so when you sit in code,

2093
02:00:05.201 --> 02:00:08.950
I thought for a second I said wow,
in code is an interesting way of putting it.

2094
02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:12.070
Can imagine if it's actually encoded in DNA,
you know,

2095
02:00:12.071 --> 02:00:15.250
we know that we can embed things,
we can embed,
you know,

2096
02:00:15.251 --> 02:00:19.470
I mean if a human being or an animal or anything,
it's really just a information,

2097
02:00:19.471 --> 02:00:20.830
the chemicals,
you know,

2098
02:00:20.831 --> 02:00:23.920
all these different materials that are interacting with each other.

2099
02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:26.740
If we can introduce something into that system,

2100
02:00:26.741 --> 02:00:30.430
whether it's in a biological system or a plant or something,

2101
02:00:30.570 --> 02:00:32.710
or you can actually encode information.

2102
02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:37.740
Intuit's genetics where you could pull that information out almost as if it's

2103
02:00:38.111 --> 02:00:40.840
like a USB clubs.
Yeah,
ones and Zeros.

2104
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:44.770
You can inject information like maybe that's what the FIBONACCI code is.

2105
02:00:44.890 --> 02:00:47.890
Maybe the,
the FIBONACCI code,
the golden ratio,
the,
the,
you know,

2106
02:00:47.891 --> 02:00:52.840
the universal golden ratio.
Maybe.
What,
what,
what things like,
oh,
those nature,

2107
02:00:52.890 --> 02:00:53.091
you know,

2108
02:00:53.091 --> 02:00:56.950
like things that w w what makes us sunflower seeds so beautiful and it's this

2109
02:00:56.951 --> 02:00:59.440
exponential sort of mathematics that's involved in at all.

2110
02:00:59.710 --> 02:01:02.860
Maybe that really is like the code of the universe and coded into everything in

2111
02:01:02.861 --> 02:01:03.280
nature.

2112
02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:07.960
Maybe that's a signature designer that's a signature of whatever software

2113
02:01:07.961 --> 02:01:10.900
designer came up with this virtual universe.
That's how he signs everything.

2114
02:01:10.901 --> 02:01:13.960
Or it's signs everything with like some kind of like ratio.

2115
02:01:13.961 --> 02:01:17.200
That's how you know who made this stuff.
That's his shit signature.

2116
02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:19.690
This is his dimension.
Yeah.
This is his dimensioning.

2117
02:01:19.691 --> 02:01:23.380
I sign everything with the FIBONACCI sequence is you imagine that if maybe

2118
02:01:23.381 --> 02:01:27.730
there's an infinite number of universes.
Well we should.
We sure have.

2119
02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:32.140
We sure how.
There's no doubt about that.
But could you imagine if,
if there are,

2120
02:01:32.141 --> 02:01:32.980
is the possibility,

2121
02:01:32.981 --> 02:01:35.530
we were talking earlier about this guy Wayne are getting busted for pulling his

2122
02:01:35.531 --> 02:01:40.010
dick out and how weird.
It seems that as time goes on,
things seem more and more

2123
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.843
<v 2>like a movie.</v>

2124
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:44.840
Like this is Michele Bachmann character or so many things that are going on in

2125
02:01:44.841 --> 02:01:47.170
the hypocrisy of this great world.
You know,
the,
the,

2126
02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:48.860
the fall of the free market system,

2127
02:01:48.861 --> 02:01:51.500
the interjection of tax dollars into it and the fucking,

2128
02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:55.250
the scandal that erupted left and right over every single aspect of it.

2129
02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:57.770
It starts to look more and more like a movie.
Well,

2130
02:01:57.771 --> 02:02:00.710
could you imagine if as time goes on,

2131
02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:04.250
the things that you can do right now with second life and the things that you

2132
02:02:04.251 --> 02:02:05.810
can do right now with some sort of a,

2133
02:02:05.811 --> 02:02:08.870
a simulator game online are pretty God damn spectacular,

2134
02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:12.110
but nothing compared to what they're going to be able to accomplish.
1,000,

2135
02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:15.620
a hundred thousand a million years from now.
All right?
A million years from now,

2136
02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:19.100
there could be architects of their own universe and there could be a built in

2137
02:02:19.101 --> 02:02:23.000
humor built into these universes that as the game gets closer and closer to

2138
02:02:23.001 --> 02:02:23.571
being over,

2139
02:02:23.571 --> 02:02:27.230
it becomes more and more ridiculous to the point where it forces you to

2140
02:02:27.231 --> 02:02:30.500
recognize that,
oh my God,
this is all fake.

2141
02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:35.360
This is all the figment of someone's imagination and computer program.

2142
02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:38.750
<v 1>Well,
or,
or,
or how about this?
Instead of saying it's fake,</v>

2143
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:43.430
how about it's just a form of university getting you ready for something and as

2144
02:02:43.431 --> 02:02:47.120
you get closer and closer to graduation,
things become more and more absurd.

2145
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:52.130
And waiting at the end of this thing is this hilarious surprise party with all

2146
02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:55.530
your friends you like put you under.
So that you could experience this thing.

2147
02:02:55.740 --> 02:03:00.740
<v 2>You had a really interesting point once a theory and idea that you had the about</v>

2148
02:03:01.050 --> 02:03:06.050
the universe being your own life and that as you get closer and closer to your

2149
02:03:07.111 --> 02:03:08.040
mortal death,

2150
02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:12.390
more and more cuff hat catastrophe starts to take place in the world.
Though the,

2151
02:03:12.391 --> 02:03:15.090
the,
the news is constantly filled with,
you know,

2152
02:03:15.450 --> 02:03:19.230
just carnage and horrible things and what this really is,

2153
02:03:19.231 --> 02:03:22.050
is your own mortality surely slipping away.

2154
02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:24.910
<v 1>And I think that's one,
I always think about that like when the,</v>

2155
02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:29.320
when the simulator fades out and you blink back into your true existence,

2156
02:03:29.590 --> 02:03:32.620
I think it's this weird sense of like,
oh wait,

2157
02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:34.840
you mean that if I just focused,

2158
02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:38.080
I could have turned the entire planet into a paradise now?
Like,
yeah,

2159
02:03:38.350 --> 02:03:41.140
that was totally one of the things you could've done if you want it to.

2160
02:03:41.410 --> 02:03:42.940
And you'd focused and you'd like,

2161
02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:47.950
you used the strength that was inside of you and you'd manage to project all of

2162
02:03:47.951 --> 02:03:49.600
your positivity out into the world.

2163
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:54.750
You could have transformed this particular planet into a new garden of Eden,

2164
02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:59.920
but you decided to write some jokes.
It were just a cool,
hey,

2165
02:03:59.921 --> 02:04:02.650
next time we'll do it next time.
Maybe it'll work next time.

2166
02:04:03.190 --> 02:04:07.500
<v 2>Doing more than writing jokes.
Do it.
Just doing this podcast,
having this,
uh,</v>

2167
02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:10.500
these conversations,
you know,
putting this kind of information now,

2168
02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:14.520
like the way we do it every week.
Um,
I think we're,

2169
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:19.380
we're letting people in on a different way of thinking and people get invested

2170
02:04:19.381 --> 02:04:23.490
in it and they get involved in it and it,
it,
it helps their fucking life,
man.

2171
02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:28.470
I get messages from people all day about it and when I see when I do the podcast

2172
02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:32.010
or do a comedy shows rather,
and people come out to me over and over again,

2173
02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:36.150
they tell me how much they love the conversations and about how much they love

2174
02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:41.100
the opportunity.
Kind of relook at life to look at life through a different Lens.

2175
02:04:41.250 --> 02:04:45.300
You're not just by doing just doing this podcast.
You're not just writing jokes.

2176
02:04:45.301 --> 02:04:50.301
You're allowing people to look at an a possible other path and to be inspired by

2177
02:04:51.061 --> 02:04:53.400
a group of people that are like their friends that are in their ear.

2178
02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:57.690
Like all you people listening right now,
we are like your online friend.
We are,

2179
02:04:57.700 --> 02:05:01.050
we're in your ear right now and we're going to continue to do this and we'll be

2180
02:05:01.051 --> 02:05:05.300
a part of your life and it will enhance your life,
you know,
and it'll help you.

2181
02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:06.740
You're doing more than that,
dude.

2182
02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:07.880
<v 1>Well,
and also there's a,</v>

2183
02:05:07.890 --> 02:05:11.970
there's the awesome thing is there is a reciprocity because I d I keep getting

2184
02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:14.540
these like awesome,
uh,

2185
02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:19.140
posts from people who hear stuff I saying.
They're like,
oh,
this is like,
this is,

2186
02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:22.440
this is what you were talking about.
Like I,
I've been thinking about this thing,

2187
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:26.430
uh,
talking about this thing when Natasha called interpersonal environmentalism,

2188
02:05:26.431 --> 02:05:30.450
which is this idea that true environmentalism is not going out into the war,

2189
02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:33.030
ended like way out in the world that try to make it better.

2190
02:05:33.031 --> 02:05:36.420
But it's like dealing with what's happening with you and your closest circle of

2191
02:05:36.421 --> 02:05:40.380
friends in what's happening in your ecosystem.
To try to clean that up first.

2192
02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:41.790
And um,

2193
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:46.590
I had this idea of how a large enough group of people,

2194
02:05:46.591 --> 02:05:49.230
if a collective of consumers got together,

2195
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:52.170
then they could shut down any corporation they want it to,

2196
02:05:52.171 --> 02:05:55.440
if it reached a big enough number of people that could instantaneously do

2197
02:05:55.441 --> 02:05:56.460
boycotts and stuff.

2198
02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:00.210
And someone facebooked me this thing about something called collective

2199
02:06:00.211 --> 02:06:01.260
consumerism.

2200
02:06:01.530 --> 02:06:06.530
And this guy did this weird experiment and it's some group called carrot mob I

2201
02:06:06.901 --> 02:06:10.740
think.
And the,
the view youtube video I made was Kinda cheesy,

2202
02:06:10.741 --> 02:06:14.190
but the experiment itself was bad ass,
which is he went to all,

2203
02:06:14.191 --> 02:06:18.870
he wanted to see what would happen if he could organize people on a local level.

2204
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:21.420
And he went to all these different liquor stores and he said,
Hey,

2205
02:06:21.421 --> 02:06:24.600
if I get a giant group of people to come in here and buy a shitload of stuff,

2206
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:29.870
will you donate 20% of the proceeds to turning your liquor store into a more

2207
02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:32.340
ecofriendly liquor store with better lights,

2208
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:36.420
better whatever wiring so that you don't burn as much energy and it's better for

2209
02:06:36.421 --> 02:06:37.254
the environment.

2210
02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:40.950
So like you went to all these liquor stores and one liquor store said,

2211
02:06:40.951 --> 02:06:44.700
we'll give 20% of whatever you make us from this mob.

2212
02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:47.790
You're talking about to making it more ecofriendly.

2213
02:06:49.170 --> 02:06:52.860
So they ended up getting at this little liquor store.

2214
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:58.340
They ended up getting a giant fucking around the block line of people waiting in

2215
02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:03.360
line to buy shit from this liquor store as a form of activism.

2216
02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:05.370
The place made in three hours,

2217
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:09.240
$10,000 and ended up donating like you know,

2218
02:07:09.241 --> 02:07:12.780
a big percentage of that and now it's an ecofriendly liquor store and this is

2219
02:07:12.781 --> 02:07:15.900
all because of one guy.
This is August one guy came up with this experiment.

2220
02:07:16.110 --> 02:07:20.000
What happens if we organize consumers?
Because his theory is a great idea too.

2221
02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:24.270
<v 2>He's not asking them to do anything with that money that's bad for the business.</v>

2222
02:07:24.450 --> 02:07:25.920
It's only going to help their business.

2223
02:07:26.050 --> 02:07:29.530
<v 1>How was his logic?
That's brilliant because corporations just want to make money.</v>

2224
02:07:29.770 --> 02:07:33.280
So if you could organize people at a big enough level and you go to corporations

2225
02:07:33.281 --> 02:07:34.050
and say,
hey,

2226
02:07:34.050 --> 02:07:39.050
we're going to swarm and buy a shitload of stuff from you on this day on the

2227
02:07:39.101 --> 02:07:41.740
condition that you make these changes in your corporation.

2228
02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:43.930
That's the theory behind it.
It's pretty cool.

2229
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:46.660
<v 2>That's a brilliant idea.
And you picked us up on Twitter,</v>

2230
02:07:46.661 --> 02:07:47.590
someone twittered this year,

2231
02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:50.810
<v 1>someone popped it on my Facebook page and it's like that.</v>

2232
02:07:50.811 --> 02:07:53.450
That helps me a lot in like,
you know,

2233
02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:56.660
philosophies that I'm developing and things I'm thinking about right now,

2234
02:07:56.661 --> 02:07:58.370
which is,
that is the cool thing,
man.

2235
02:07:58.630 --> 02:08:02.050
<v 2>Every day,
every day I get Twitter messages,
Facebook messages,</v>

2236
02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:06.190
I get messages from people who are interesting.
They send me interesting links.

2237
02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:10.090
You create sort of a likeminded group of humans,
you know?

2238
02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:14.560
And that's something that you're a part of man.
You know?
And when we're,

2239
02:08:14.561 --> 02:08:19.561
when we're talking about the possibility of making the world a better place,

2240
02:08:20.050 --> 02:08:22.840
you can make your world a better place and you are,
you know,

2241
02:08:22.841 --> 02:08:25.300
and we were all making our world a better place.
You know,

2242
02:08:25.301 --> 02:08:29.200
we're all by being cool to our friends by surrounding ourselves with positive

2243
02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:32.890
and interesting,
creative,
inspiring people.
You make your world better by,

2244
02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:33.341
you know,

2245
02:08:33.341 --> 02:08:36.190
having good times all the time because you're always around people where you

2246
02:08:36.191 --> 02:08:39.070
enjoy each other's company and you feel energized by each other.

2247
02:08:39.071 --> 02:08:42.940
And by doing that and creating your own immediate small world,

2248
02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:47.740
and then by doing what we're doing and then broadcasting this ideal and showing

2249
02:08:47.741 --> 02:08:51.460
your success with this and showing,
you know,
inspiring people with this thing,

2250
02:08:51.461 --> 02:08:53.860
this is not something that requires money.
This is not this some,

2251
02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:57.840
this requires focus and intelligence,
honesty and objectivity.
But,

2252
02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:01.420
but it just requires your energy.
It requires you to do it.
And we can all do it.

2253
02:09:01.421 --> 02:09:04.840
We can all surround ourselves with people that are cool and be cool to the

2254
02:09:04.841 --> 02:09:07.990
people that are around us all the time.
And,
and don't take anything less.

2255
02:09:08.110 --> 02:09:09.700
Some people need religion for that.

2256
02:09:09.850 --> 02:09:12.100
And that's one of the things that religion does a good job of,

2257
02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:15.340
of programming people to be a good Christian to be.

2258
02:09:15.490 --> 02:09:17.680
If you're a true Christian who followed true Christianity,

2259
02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:20.770
which most people call themselves a Christian,
sadly,
don't.
You know,

2260
02:09:20.771 --> 02:09:24.530
most people are crying out for fucking death.
Do Osama bin low.

2261
02:09:24.531 --> 02:09:27.670
They hate fags and I'm a cruise gene.
We don't tolerate that.

2262
02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:31.900
They're not really listening to the actual words you know,
during in the Bible,

2263
02:09:31.901 --> 02:09:32.350
but,

2264
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:37.240
but to be a good Christian is to subscribe to an ideology that is going and

2265
02:09:37.241 --> 02:09:40.270
moving your life in the direction of the positive at all times.

2266
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:43.360
To look out for your neighbors,
to be a good person,
all those things.

2267
02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:46.630
These are guidelines to live a happy,
productive life.

2268
02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:49.600
To put yourself in the right frequency like you were talking about with the,

2269
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:51.730
in terms of your own personal depression,

2270
02:09:51.731 --> 02:09:55.090
that you weren't in the right frequency and in the right state of mind because

2271
02:09:55.091 --> 02:09:58.630
of nutrition,
because of health,
because of your own way of looking at the life.

2272
02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:00.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2273
02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:02.430
<v 1>Yeah,
and you can put that together.
Bitches.
Yeah.</v>

2274
02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:05.560
Get it together because this is the thing,
man.
Aye.
You,

2275
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.860
we really,
I really believe that if enough people organize using the internet,

2276
02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:16.070
this is rudimentary nervous system that's springing up around a planet.

2277
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:18.560
If enough people really start using it in the right way,

2278
02:10:18.561 --> 02:10:22.760
like this guy did and a very micro level at this carrot mob idea.
If,

2279
02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:26.240
if people start using it in the right way,
I think you've,

2280
02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:31.330
you could turn this fucked up simulator into some kind of amazing new world

2281
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:35.770
<v 2>like you could.
And you know what,</v>

2282
02:10:35.771 --> 02:10:39.410
people complain sometimes that this issue gets brought up more than once on the

2283
02:10:39.411 --> 02:10:41.870
podcast.
But I'll give you a reason for that.
You know,

2284
02:10:41.871 --> 02:10:45.890
and there's a quote that someone bread,
I don't know who it was,
it wrote it,

2285
02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:46.460
but uh,

2286
02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:49.190
someone had it on their Twitter recently and so genius quote that I've heard for

2287
02:10:49.191 --> 02:10:53.750
years,
but I always forget the inspiration is like bathing.
It's effective,

2288
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:55.340
but only for a short period of time.

2289
02:10:55.341 --> 02:10:58.100
That's why we recommend recommended every day.
Ah,
that's cool.
Yeah.

2290
02:10:58.101 --> 02:11:00.320
And inspiration,
you know,
in this form of,

2291
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:04.100
of reiterating things that you and I already believe in and already know if we

2292
02:11:04.101 --> 02:11:05.870
were just sitting here having this conversation alone,

2293
02:11:05.871 --> 02:11:06.950
even if there wasn't a microphone,

2294
02:11:06.951 --> 02:11:10.970
even though this is some shit that we have talked about maybe 50 fucking times

2295
02:11:10.971 --> 02:11:11.510
in the past,

2296
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:14.300
we would still be talking about it again because it's important to keep

2297
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:15.980
ourselves on this frequency.

2298
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:19.010
<v 1>Yeah,
and it's the main,
I mean also,
yes,
exactly.</v>

2299
02:11:19.011 --> 02:11:21.700
You got to stay on this frequency and it's,
it's,
it's a,

2300
02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:26.710
it's what's more exciting than continually reminding yourself that you are part

2301
02:11:28.941 --> 02:11:30.080
of,
you know,

2302
02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:34.700
some what some people call the apocalypse or the singularity and you're part of

2303
02:11:34.701 --> 02:11:38.840
that.
You're hopefully part of what's helping,
you know,

2304
02:11:38.841 --> 02:11:43.250
human beings evolved to a place that's,
that's better.
That's,
that's,

2305
02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:48.080
and I don't mean me or you as individuals.
I mean as we represent,

2306
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:50.780
you know that the carrot mob thing,
I didn't think of that,

2307
02:11:50.781 --> 02:11:55.390
that came from someone tuning into what we're doing and then we're turning,

2308
02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:59.660
tuning into what they're doing and it's the beginning of some big idea.

2309
02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:00.531
That's what it is.

2310
02:12:00.531 --> 02:12:03.530
This is the beginning of some amazing idea that's going to come out of all this

2311
02:12:03.531 --> 02:12:08.420
technology and all and this kind of dialogue that that I think will,
um,

2312
02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:11.900
you know,
I don't know what I'll do it.
I don't think he's something amazing

2313
02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:16.300
<v 2>things people can find things that resonate with them and create things that</v>

2314
02:12:16.301 --> 02:12:19.750
resonate with them as opposed to looking for something that's already

2315
02:12:19.751 --> 02:12:22.480
established.
It's a part of the mainstream that's already,

2316
02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:24.760
it's already out there that you can tune into.
You know,

2317
02:12:24.761 --> 02:12:28.600
if you don't have a means of broadcasting to other humans and letting people

2318
02:12:28.601 --> 02:12:32.150
know,
which was the norm for most of the world for,
you know,

2319
02:12:32.650 --> 02:12:36.070
the last fucking x amount of thousands of years up until recently,

2320
02:12:36.190 --> 02:12:38.980
the best you could do is write a book and God knows how long it takes for your

2321
02:12:38.981 --> 02:12:42.640
fucking book to get read by people,
right?
It takes a long ass time.
Nowadays,

2322
02:12:42.730 --> 02:12:46.750
you could write one fucking true Twitter post and it gets retweeted to a million

2323
02:12:46.751 --> 02:12:50.530
people and that idea is out there,
man.
You know,
one blog entry,
one,

2324
02:12:50.531 --> 02:12:53.950
one Twitter post to a blog entry that gets retweeted and that the idea becomes

2325
02:12:53.951 --> 02:12:54.730
out there.

2326
02:12:54.730 --> 02:12:59.260
You never had the opportunity to organize people before like you can today.

2327
02:12:59.350 --> 02:13:01.510
So now someone could come up with an idea like this,

2328
02:13:01.511 --> 02:13:04.750
like getting this group activism thing going on where you just support

2329
02:13:04.751 --> 02:13:08.000
businesses that are more ecofriendly and encourage them to be more ecofriendly.

2330
02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:09.730
Thursdays you never had the opportunity to do that,

2331
02:13:09.731 --> 02:13:13.570
but for right now people can do things and find things that resonate with them.

2332
02:13:14.690 --> 02:13:18.610
Speaking to resonate and this weekend we're at resonated like a motherfucker at

2333
02:13:18.611 --> 02:13:21.790
the Irvine Improv.
Come on down.
It's me,

2334
02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:25.880
Joey dos and we would love to have Ari or a Dunkin rather.
But talking about it,

2335
02:13:25.890 --> 02:13:26.970
go to fucking see it.

2336
02:13:27.230 --> 02:13:32.220
<v 1>I'm resonating at the parlor live.
I'm going to be resonating at the parlor</v>

2337
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:36.150
<v 8>live in Seattle and I think that's in Bellevue.
But you can look up parlor,</v>

2338

Yeah.
I keep hearing awesome from comics to keep hearing that.

2341
02:13:48.991 --> 02:13:52.590
It's like the spot to go to like so many comics I know that have been there

2342
02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:56.520
every time.
Apparently it also has a pill,
a billiards hall next to it.

2343
02:13:56.521 --> 02:14:00.450
It's connected to a pool hall,
which to me is crack.
So I'll be all been there.

but I would do it totally.

2346
02:14:08.821 --> 02:14:10.200
I would do that Paul or live man.

2347

I keep hearing great things about it and I know every shot,

2348
02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:16.860
