<v Speaker 1>Well again,</v>

<v Speaker 1>my wife's a psychiatrist,</v>

63
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:51.900

<v Speaker 1>she's dealt with all this kind of stuff</v>

64
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 1>and she laughed.</v>

65
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.850
<v Speaker 1>She just cracks up because she sees it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She sees it immediately.</v>

66
00:02:56.851 --> 00:03:01.851
<v Speaker 1>And just like her way of dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>insanity is laughter and is she works</v>

67
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>with what she's worked with all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

68
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:09.121
<v Speaker 1>but her sort of specialization is loony</v>
<v Speaker 1>bin like one flew over the cuckoo's nest</v>

69
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:11.420
<v Speaker 1>kind of scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

70
00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember going in with her the first</v>

71
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>time I visited her at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was running a mental hospital with</v>

72
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>like double doors and bars over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>windows,</v>

73
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>these criminally insane people who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed their kids and you know,</v>

74
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>like crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

75
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>And we went in there and I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared,</v>

76
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went in and it was just like lunatics</v>

77
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>and there was this woman like must've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in her mid fifties lying on her</v>

78
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>back in a little nightgown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No underwear her with her,</v>

79
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:42.840
<v Speaker 1>like arms and legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.880
<v Speaker 1>like a crab doing a crab thing and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk in like this,</v>

81
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy in the whole scene.</v>

82
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Just scared the shit out of me and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>started laughing like,</v>

83
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>yo crazy old lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

84
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Get up from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just like last.</v>

85
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that I didn't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I,</v>

86
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>I hung out with her is that people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are psychotic,</v>

87
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're psychotic.</v>

88
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>And so they kind of know how ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

89
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>And as a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she laughs,</v>

90
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>she laughs in such a loving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting,</v>

91
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I get you kind of way that it creates</v>
<v Speaker 1>this instant rapport and they start</v>

92
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

93
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>So it relieves a little tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Like it's all okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're just another crazy person.</v>

98
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.750

<v Speaker 1>sort of be so laid back that you kind</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

106
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.780

00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:40.371
<v Speaker 3>and I'm watching it and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden I see this shadow and then I turn</v>

120
00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:44.730
<v Speaker 3>my head and I see another shadow and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>look up and there's a bat flying around</v>

121
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.710
<v Speaker 3>the apartment and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

122
00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:50.280
<v Speaker 3>And I'm scared shitless of bats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

123
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 3>it's like my thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever since I was a kid,</v>

124
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:57.180
<v Speaker 3>my aunt had this bar near her and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had bats and they would be me.</v>

125
00:05:57.181 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 3>They were fruit bats and if they bite</v>
<v Speaker 3>you you'll get rabies and you'll die.</v>

126
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:01.200
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

127
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 3>and we would always be outside playing</v>
<v Speaker 3>tag at night and I would fucking,</v>

128
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 3>bats would fly by and I'd freak out.</v>

129
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I'm alone in the apartment and as</v>

130
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 3>a bat flying around and Batman is on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

131
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all I knew is they go in your hair,</v>

132
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:20.111
<v Speaker 3>which I think is like not even true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I put on a baseball cap backwards and</v>

133
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.480
<v Speaker 3>I had on sunglasses and a tennis racket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some glad I didn't want them going in my</v>

134
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:28.140
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to go for.</v>

135
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 3>So I'm running around the apartment</v>
<v Speaker 3>swinging at him.</v>

136
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 3>He's taken off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

137
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just,</v>

138
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 3>they're erratic the way they fly it on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're fucking going and this</v>

139
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 3>goes on for like 10 minutes and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a standoff and I'm waiting</v>

140
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 3>and then I hear you coming up the stairs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you came in and you open the door</v>

141
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 3>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

142
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 3>You do bad in here and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just grabbed the tennis racket out</v>

143
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 3>of my hand and he walked up and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the window and you just bashed him</v>

144
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 3>once and he just went down and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just walked over and you had taken your</v>

145
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 3>hand and just went into the kitchen.</v>

146
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 3>Start eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm stay on sunglasses and I remember</v>

147
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

148
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably wouldn't even killed it if</v>

149
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 3>you weren't already trying to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you,</v>

150
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 3>you might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call the animal people to come get it</v>

151
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 3>because it looked like it was stunned if</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was actually dead,</v>

152
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 3>had been sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

153
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:23.130
<v Speaker 3>you mean once I hit it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

154
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

155
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.540
<v Speaker 3>It was probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I told him.</v>

156
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember.</v>

157
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to have this thing suffer.</v>

158
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember it was some hitting</v>

159
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it was the tennis racket</v>

160
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.920
<v Speaker 3>could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

161
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 3>you were fearless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

162
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like.</v>
