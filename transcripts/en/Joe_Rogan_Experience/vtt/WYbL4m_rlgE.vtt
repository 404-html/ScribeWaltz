00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck man?</v>

3
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>We're weird.</v>

4
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.003
<v Speaker 1>So weird.</v>

5
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>What a stupid culture.</v>

6
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.531
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

7
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop thinking about the guy.</v>

8
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>The farted at the sink.</v>

9
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>The airport.</v>

10
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>We talked about it for 10 minutes afterwards.</v>

11
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Dudes fart when they go to the bathroom.</v>

12
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Dudes are constantly far to in public restrooms.</v>

13
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:23.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>But we were at the sink and the dude was washing his hands and he cut a monster</v>

15
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>fart and I told Tommy about it and I was like,</v>

16
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:30.751
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

17
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:31.584
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

18
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>he broke.</v>

19
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.200
<v Speaker 1>He broke the rule.</v>

20
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I walked out just before this happened.</v>

22
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I unfortunately missed the incident,</v>

23
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>but you said it immediately and I was.</v>

24
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I kept wrapping my head around it and I think what I've come to the conclusion</v>

25
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>is that if you do that,</v>

26
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>all I'm looking for is for you to acknowledge it.</v>

27
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>You need to say something.</v>

29
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I want you to say something about that because I was thinking about how an old</v>

30
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:58.761
<v Speaker 1>guy one time farted next to me in like on a tram in the airport and I was like,</v>

31
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

32
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>he led a fucking pretty big fart.</v>

33
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at him and he goes,</v>

34
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.993
<v Speaker 1>snuck out of me.</v>

35
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.561
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

36
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>

37
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>And I kind of took away.</v>

38
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.203
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

39
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

40
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>well thank you for acknowledging your fart right now.</v>

41
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>This guy was just washing his hands and he just.</v>

43
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>The sink is not the year.</v>

44
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you'd get a pass there.</v>

45
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

46
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>it was definitely who does that?</v>

47
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely a gray area.</v>

48
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely a greater people fart all the time at the urinals.</v>

49
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>That's so common.</v>

50
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.933
<v Speaker 1>I heard a lot of parts.</v>

52
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>But if you get done zip up,</v>

53
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>walk all the way around and wash your hands in the middle of Washington,</v>

54
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>you just unload and no one said a word.</v>

55
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Everyone just just let it go.</v>

57
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>And then we got outside.</v>

58
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.961
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

59
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Yo Dude,</v>

60
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel about this?</v>

61
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop thinking about it.</v>

62
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>And then we're trying to figure out what kind of farts girls cut when they're in</v>

63
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom and whether or not they wash their hands before nine each other.</v>

64
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Probably not as much.</v>

65
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:55.651
<v Speaker 1>Not as much,</v>

66
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>but they definitely drop heat in there for sure.</v>

67
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Once they close that door or then they allow themselves.</v>

68
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

69
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>they allow themselves to fucking farted up.</v>

70
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.153
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>there was a time when it was,</v>

72
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was like my leg</v>

73
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>was like 23 I guess.</v>

74
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.253
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

75
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.113

76
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.740

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.910

82
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>She was engaged and,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We had a good time and it was one of those things where,</v>

89
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.981

<v Speaker 1>Well then you're playing with my heart.</v>

96
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>And so it was Kinda like dangerous at the same time.</v>

97
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>And then her fiance found out,</v>

98
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>her fiance actually found out when I was going down on her and her bedroom.</v>

99
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.833
<v Speaker 1>He walked in.</v>

150
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And she's in the background and she's just like,</v>

151
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:00.611
<v Speaker 1>he's lying.</v>

152
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:01.211
<v Speaker 1>He's lying,</v>

153
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

154
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking faggot.</v>

155
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't listen to them that a year.</v>

156
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

157
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.990
<v Speaker 1>She threw you down down under the bus and that was the last time.</v>

158
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>And this was somebody that I was like,</v>

159
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

160
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>we had like,</v>

161
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:18.901
<v Speaker 1>I thought we had something and when she said that I was like later,</v>

162
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>like I couldn't like that was it.</v>

163
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

164
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>how old were you at the time?</v>

165
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I was 22 or 23.</v>

166
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>You had already come out,</v>

167
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>you'd come out and so when you were,</v>

168
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 1>when you were her,</v>

169
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 1>you told her that you were gay?</v>

170
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

171
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>like everyone knew.</v>

172
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Like it was just one of those.</v>

173
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>But then you get those girls were like,</v>

174
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to turn you.</v>

175
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:38.314
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

176
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.831
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

177
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>I get it all the time.</v>

178
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 1>You get it all the time trying to turn you straight.</v>

179
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

180
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of fear involved in being in the actual.</v>

181
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Or wild</v>

183
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.550
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

184
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.220
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>

186
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.080
<v Speaker 2>they worry about stuff they make up stuff to worry about.</v>

187
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean just to,</v>

188
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.960
<v Speaker 2>just to give them a way out.</v>

189
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.510
<v Speaker 2>And so that was,</v>

190
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.230
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

191
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.340
<v Speaker 2>that was true for me too.</v>

192
00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

193
00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:01.110
<v Speaker 2>it was overwhelming for me.</v>

194
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go back in there in the mountains for a 10 day solo right out of the</v>

195
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:05.430
<v Speaker 2>gate.</v>

196
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I went for like one night,</v>

197
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.870
<v Speaker 2>like I went on a scouting trip and then stayed one night,</v>

198
00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:14.871
<v Speaker 2>then came out and it was just kind of baby steps into it because it's,</v>

199
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

200
00:05:16.281 --> 00:05:16.590
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

201
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 2>if you pull,</v>

202
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

203
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many people there are here in la,</v>

204
00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:24.120
<v Speaker 2>but how many people have stayed out overnight in the mountains by themself.</v>

205
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be very many people.</v>

206
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

207
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.363
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

208
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.203
<v Speaker 2>Five.</v>

209
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

210
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:31.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

211
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

212
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.110
<v Speaker 2>it's just not something people do in this day and age.</v>

213
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.910
<v Speaker 2>And so it's because it's,</v>

214
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

216
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.610
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your comfort zone.</v>

217
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.110
<v Speaker 2>But if you can do that.</v>

218
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

219
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

220
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I became good at that.</v>

221
00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:43.284
<v Speaker 2>And actually then I,</v>

222
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

223
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

224
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

225
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.673
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

226
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.401
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

227
00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:48.234
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

228
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.853
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

229
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.300
<v Speaker 2>let me think what,</v>

230
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

231
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

232
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.011
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the year,</v>

233
00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:58.011
<v Speaker 2>but I killed a six by six bull elk by myself and it was my best bowl and I got</v>

234
00:05:58.791 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 2>out of the wilderness,</v>

235
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 2>has little Toyota four wheel drive.</v>

236
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I had this,</v>

237
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 2>this bowl loaded up and I was just so pumped.</v>

238
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Finally got cell service out on the highway and I'm driving home.</v>

239
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

240
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.240
<v Speaker 2>I called my wife and I was like,</v>

241
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

242
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.713
<v Speaker 2>hey trace,</v>

243
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I killed a six by six bowl and she's like,</v>

244
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Princess di died.</v>

245
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

246
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.653
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

247
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.493
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

248
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Princess Di died.</v>

249
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.623
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

250
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.733
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

251
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Killed a six by six bull.</v>

252
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 2>It was just like you are.</v>

253
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.430
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

254
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 2>to everybody else,</v>

255
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Princess Diana,</v>

256
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Diane was like,</v>

257
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

258
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 2>the world's going to stop,</v>

259
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 2>but when you're back in the wilderness and you killed a six by six bull elk,</v>

260
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 2>nothing else matters.</v>

261
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.593
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

262
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 2>I just remembered.</v>

263
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:44.441
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference between living back there where it's just about am I going</v>

264
00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 2>to find a place to sleep tonight?</v>

265
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to be warm and we'll have food?</v>

266
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.453
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

267
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.443
<v Speaker 2>That's all you care about.</v>

268
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.120
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

270
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>my parents actually didn't want me to do martial arts because they were</v>

271
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>terrified that I was going to become this angry kid who knew how to fuck people</v>

272
00:06:58.641 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

273
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Whereas before it was just angry kid who really couldn't do anything.</v>

274
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

275
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.261
<v Speaker 1>wasn't dangerous.</v>

276
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:04.094
<v Speaker 1>I was 11,</v>

277
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 1>and then this 11 year old became 12 and the 12 year olds like,</v>

279
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:07.331
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

280
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be like Bruce Lee and the fuck,</v>

281
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:09.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:10.544
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

283
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.440
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

284
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.480
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want me to.</v>

285
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Evan didn't chucks.</v>

286
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.530

287
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 1>People are just taking shit away from me.</v>

288
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.040

289
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I would tell them that I was making a chair legs fucking my chair.</v>

290
00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Scrub two broken legs.</v>

291
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Funny that they look exactly like chuck's</v>

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Of course the Bruce Lee movies.</v>

296
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Man there were dope.</v>

297
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:34.870
<v Speaker 1>See Him swinging around us.</v>

298
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I had a really funny story that happened there.</v>

299
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:38.481
<v Speaker 1>So there was a kid,</v>

300
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like seven.</v>

301
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.281
<v Speaker 1>And as a kid,</v>

302
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 1>neighbor kid who was 12 and he was big way bigger than me and he would kind of</v>

303
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 1>pick on me a little bit just because he was bigger,</v>

304
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 1>but I had a bunch of older brothers so they would always keep them in line or</v>

305
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

306
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.410
<v Speaker 1>One day he did something fucked up to me again.</v>

307
00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 1>That's seven versus 12.</v>

308
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,</v>

309
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:55.690
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

310
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>we got a plan and I had,</v>

311
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:56.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

312
00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>those foam nunchucks that you could get,</v>

313
00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.211
<v Speaker 1>like playing around.</v>

314
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>They had a hard center and foam on the outside.</v>

315
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>So I had those hidden behind my back and my brother was holding me back and</v>

316
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:05.570
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

317
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.080
