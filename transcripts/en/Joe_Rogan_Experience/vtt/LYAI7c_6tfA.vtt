00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.510
Hello Freak pitches.
That's right.
My back.

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.800
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you.

3
00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.180
Buy naturebox.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.130
Naturebox is a great way to get yummy food sent to you.

5
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.510
Yummy snack food.
You know,
a lot of us.
Um,

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.990
if I get hungry I will fuck up and I'll eat a snickers bar.
I will,
you know,

7
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:26.450
if I'm going to get an airport,
I don't like it,

8
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.300
but I'll do it every now and then.
I'd fucking hate myself.

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.740
I'll see something disgusting.

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.780
But when you have healthy stuff around that you could snack on your way more

11
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:39.410
likely to eat the healthy stuff.
As long as it's good healthy stuff.

12
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.420
The problem is usually options for me at least.
And this nature box stuff.

13
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.590
What I like about it is it gives you really good options and they're fucking

14
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:51.710
delicious.
Like I actually do choose them cause I like them.

15
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.310
The blueberry almonds,
all good googly Mowgli.

16
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.460
They're fucking delicious man.
They have this,
um,

17
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.720
these big apple pineapples I'm addicted to.
It's like there,

18
00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:05.270
it's like just dried pineapple you can get,

19
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.690
you can get all sorts of like different food options.
Like,
if you,

20
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.830
if you're gluten free,
you can get gluten free,
you can get low sugar,

21
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.900
you can get a lot of different options too.

22
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:18.890
They've a lot of different stuff to choose from over a hundred different snacks

23
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.160
to choose from.
And um,
you know,
you can get like,

24
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.030
like if you need low sugar content,

25
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:30.680
if you have like dietary needs and whenever possible they try to use non GMO

26
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:34.550
food as well.
Uh,
there's no hydrogenated oils,

27
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:39.410
no high fructose corn syrup.
No Trans fats.
Which Brian,
what'd you say?

28
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:40.244
It was

29
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.460
<v 1>fats with dicks.
Exactly.</v>

30
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780
So there's no trans fat,

31
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.730
<v 0>no artificial sweeteners,
no artificial flavors,
no artificial colors.</v>

32
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.980
It's actually like,
you know,
you could,

33
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.580
you don't have to feel bad about eating it.
The planting chips.
Oh my goodness,

34
00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:02.360
they're good.
Woo.
Look,
uh,
you know,
people will be like,
oh,

35
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:04.880
they also have pretzels.
Yeah,
he could have pretzels too.

36
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.030
Pretzels and never good for you.
There's the news.
Okay.

37
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.300
It's not bad for you though.
It's not like,

38
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:15.050
you know all the other shit that I said.
All that stuff's bad.

39
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.310
Hydrogenated oils,
hydrogenated rather high fructose corn syrup.

40
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:22.340
That shit's terrible for you.
It Trans Fat.

41
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.870
<v 1>It is all about options.
Honestly,
I don't ever go grocery shopping.</v>

42
00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:26.770
I go out to eat all the time.

43
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.320
So like when you're hungry at two in the morning at my house you got like

44
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.490
strawberries and cream,

45
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.200
oatmeal and chocolate syrup and and like edibles with weed and I'm so I usually

46
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:36.100
just go with the edibles that,

47
00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:39.520
that we didn't fuck myself up on that you could hurt yourself and get injured.

48
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.040
There's a lot of good options.

49
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.150
They send me a new box every week and I'm pleasantly surprised that all the new

50
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:50.020
stuff,
the spicy pistachios are good too.
Those are very yummy.

51
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:51.250
You know what they have to do that they'll get the,

52
00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:53.020
get the pistachios outside of the shell.

53
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.960
I know you can take him out of the shell bitch.
Okay.

54
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.010
Why are you playing games with me?
Why are you pretending that getting so many

55
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.850
<v 0>pistachios?
Cause we both know that is a fucking pittance.</v>

56
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.880
It's a pittance of pistachios in a pistachio back.

57
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.960
The could get all that extra shit.
You did get that fucking shallow off.

58
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:13.270
You know how to do it.
That's your fear.
Shit.
Doing that.

59
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.630
Trained to do that shit like open these little nuts.
I just want to eat them.

60
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.580
Yeah,
I'll pay for it.
I'll pay for it.

61
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.300
I'll pay for you to open those nuts and cut the shit cause each one of those

62
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.840
takes a second of my life that I don't have time for.

63
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.280
I know I bought it before.
I've bought them in the fucking store.

64
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:33.240
Outside the shell and once you do that,
you go,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,

65
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.150
wait,
wait.
What the fuck are we been doing all these years?
So yeah,

66
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.450
you can eat the shit out of some pistachios if you get a big bag.

67
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.100
I got a bag of them the other day at the supermarket.
It was like a pillow.

68
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.630
I was like,
this is incredible.
That's what's been holding pistachios back.
Yeah.

69
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:51.430
Those stupid shells.
The flavors.

70
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.570
Sensational Pistachio in the th the nature box flavors.
Even better.

71
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:59.800
They have this spicy,
like a peppery pistachio.
Oh,
this is a limit.

72
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.650
Pucker pistachio.
They have Sriracha cashews to the Serratia.

73
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:07.780
Serratia.
How do you say that?
Saracha the stuff that,
uh,

74
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:10.450
that hot sauce with the chicken on it,
that delicious hot sauce.

75
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.260
They have cashews with that shit on it.
Oh my goodness.
It's good.

76
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.570
Anyway,
you go,
you'll go.
Now.
It's good for you,
my friends.

77
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.090
Good for you.
Every time we go to the UFC,

78
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.750
ra always gets like sunflower seeds or these kind of nuts and then by the time

79
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:29.530
we leave,
there's just a huge pile by his feet of these like,
yeah,

80
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:32.440
he's ridiculous.
He's like a bird.
When you get addicted to them,
man,
they're,

81
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:34.360
and they're actually very good for you.
They're high in protein.

82
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.370
Star shows are actually a guilt free snack,
believe it or not.
Anyway,

83
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.430
go to naturebox.com/rogan that's naturebox.com/rogan and you will get 50% off of

84
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:54.340

That's naturebox.com forward.
Slash.

85
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.670
Rolling.
We're also brought to you by Squarespace.

86
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.850
Squarespace is an all in one platform that allows you to easily create

87
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.010
professional websites online in literally minutes.

88
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.460
People say you're not supposed to say literally.
Yeah,

89
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.530
it's supposed to be figuratively,

90
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.060
but apparently they've actually changed the definition now because so many

91
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:23.530
idiots like me,
we use it incorrect.
They're like,
we give up,
right?

92
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.720
Because ultimately at the end of the day,
you know,

93
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.320
language only means what people want it to mean for people.

94
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:31.990
Agree that literally is a good way to say it.

95
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.890
It just gets beaten down and then people get upset.
The poor grammar,

96
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:40.150
it's not the poor grandma is that the grammar is growing.
Okay.
It's evolving.

97
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:44.540
You fucks and literally is a good way to say it,
but it's still hot.

98
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.480
It's figuratively,
eh.
Anyway,

99
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.033

What the fuck man?
You know,

123
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:18.440
you could tell someone their ears are small to get a little touchy.
You know,

124
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.280
like nobody likes ears.
Big Ears are too small.

125
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.630
I want to hear about all that.
Yeah,

Like okay.

126
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.470
100% church out last night sitting outside looked over neighbor second floor up

127
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.760
place next to my house.

128
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.050
I was taking a shower and that it's an old windows old windows and the shower

131
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.460
So I'm sitting at and I turned my chair around because it's dark outside and I

132

142
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.400
we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o n n I t m on it is a

143
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:33.020
human optimization website.
We sell shit that whatever it is,

144
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:34.790
whether it's a strength and conditioning equipment,

145
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:37.610
whether it's vitamins and nutrients,
we don't really sell vitamins.

146
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:42.590
We saw plant based nutrients more than we sell vitamins and we still have,
um,

147
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.580
we'd have like a,
a vitamin C and lysine supplement.

148
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:51.581
But I think pretty much everyone who is involved in a health and nutrition

149
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.010
recommends that if you're going to take any sort of vitamin,

150
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.310
<v 0>you should definitely take something that's food based,</v>

151
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.640
meaning not something that's artificially synthesize,

152
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.340
but something that has extracted from plants.

153
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:08.280
It's probably one of the best ways to go about supplementing nutrients,

154
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.950
but the very best way is always your diet.

155
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.900
And people don't like to hear that shit.

156
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:16.080
They want to just be able to pop some pills and eat a cheeseburger.

157
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:21.290
But the reality of just most of our diets is most likely were nutritionally

158
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:26.240
deficient.
It sucks.
It's not the way to do it.
You're,

159
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.050
you're definitely better off if you eat healthy food.
But my reality,

160
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:34.350
and I bet your reality too,
is that sometimes you don't have time for that shit.

161
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.750
If you're a busy person,

162
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.660
sometimes it's hard to eat correct and things like this,

163
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:44.340
the earth grown nutrients that we uh,
we have that we sell is,

164
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.300
it's a great way to supplement just to make sure that you're kind of covering

165
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:52.560
your nutritional basis.
Because if you don't,

166
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:55.500
shit goes wrong and that's just how it works.

167
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.610
The human body is just like a fucking machine,
new net man.

168
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.750
It's a series of organisms all boring together in one ecology that's called your

169
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:08.550
life for us.
But whatever it is,
it needs fuel.
And if you give it the shit fuel,

170
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.270
it works.
Shitty and shitty things break and they go wrong.

171
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.490
And that's just the way it is.
I mean,
that's the way it is.

172
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:15.660
If you don't take care of your body,

173
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.230
the more you can do to give your body the building blocks,

174
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.100
the very things that extracts from food to make itself.
I mean,

175
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.670
the reason why we have cells at all,

176
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:28.680
the reason why your body works at all,

177
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.820
it's getting something from food that gives it the fuel to grow.

178
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.610
And the better that fuel without a doubt,

179
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:40.080
the better the quality of the body it's able to construct and whether it's

180
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:44.700
health or wellbeing or just even how your brain works,
man,
try eating.

181
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.640
If you don't know,
man,
you just eat.
If you're a healthy eater,

182
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.340
eat shitty food every fucking day,

183
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.260
all day for a month and see how stupid you feel.
Just feel dumb.

184
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.370
All slowed down,
caked up and clogged up with shit.

185
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.530
But if you eat healthy,
you get addicted to it.
Um,
that's my on it.

186
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.840
Inspirational message about food for the day.
I'll email.

187
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.850
The reason why I say this is I wish someone said it to me when I was younger.

188
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:14.820
I wish I,
I wish someone had made sense out of it.

189
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.370
So if I feel like I'm harping on it too much,

190
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:18.570
I feel like I'm harping on it to me too.

191
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.600
But if one person hears that and just stops and thinks about what they're doing

192
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:25.800
to their meat wagon,
you know,
I mean,

193
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.950
so many people treat their meat wagon like shit,

194
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.350
get that bitch and shape,

195
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.980
give it some nutrient and give it a good workout.

196
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.960
Let that fucking thing express itself.
Pump out some hormones.
Just do it.

197
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.800
Blow it out of your system.
Get that,
get rid of that stress.

198
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:47.100
You're not supposed to be in a fucking cubicle.
Dude,
I got news for you.

199
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.450
That shit ain't normal.

200
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.140
You're not supposed to be sitting in the same chair all fucking day staring at

201
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:56.260
an artificial light that shit's dot normal.

202
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.800
And if you don't give your body som primal shit,

203
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.360
some throwing some weights around some grunting or running up hills to simulate

204
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:08.500
being chased by predators and I bang the sex count,
sex counts,

205
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.250
especially if you do it the way you do it.
Right?

206
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:17.730
Brian's letting those why looking at a man that wasn't I.

207
00:12:17.731 --> 00:12:19.840
So it was a warmup that just makes him,
you know,

208
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:23.350
reconsider his whole stance about,
uh,
trannies and such.

209
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.840
You're not even allowed to say trainings and such,

210
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:30.100
they'll get upset at you if you do that.
Transgender people,
my apologies.
Anyway,

211
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:34.930
go to [inaudible] Dot com o n n I t check out the long line of strength and

212
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:38.260
conditioning equipment that we carry.

213
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:42.520
We carry now I'm two different types of artistic kettlebells,

214
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.830
the Zombie bells in the prime of bells.

215
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.290
But if you're a no nonsense type of motherfucker,

216
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.060
we sell regular kettlebells to redesigned.
Yeah,
well,
you know,

217
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:56.950
um,
we,
uh,
we wanted to have a larger,
uh,
handle gaps.
Um,

218
00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.090
so you could,
uh,
you could really move the,

219
00:13:00.091 --> 00:13:04.450
the bells around a bit better.
I like them with the larger,
like it's,

220
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.820
there's two schools of thought when it comes to these things.
Um,

221
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.880
one school of thought is that the other ones are more difficult,

222
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:12.940
hence better to workout with because they're more difficult to move around.

223
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.850
And the other one is that competition kettlebells,

224
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.600
which have a much larger handle,
meaning more space.
It's still fat.

225
00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:20.590
It's a big fat handle,

226
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:24.160
which is really good too because you want that for like an enhancing your grip

227
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:28.420
strength.
But that I'm with the larger handle,
there's more room for movement.

228
00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:31.960
So you could get your proper technique better.
Your hand sort of slip into the,

229
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.480
uh,
the holes where the Kettlebell handle this better.

230
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.870
So I've heard both schools of thought and I think both have some merit to it.

231
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.770
The kind of user,
not like this.
I use the kind with a smaller opening and uh,

232
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.350
like,
cause I use the,
um,

233
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.440
the original dragon door ones is where I got mine and I have the a on at once

234
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:54.100
too.
And I feel like,
uh,
they're,
they're all important.

235
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.810
It's like,
it's not a bad thing to use the competition ones and uh,
you know,

236
00:13:58.811 --> 00:14:00.130
the competition size handle.

237
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.910
But it's not a bad thing to use like that gorilla either.
You know,
it's awkward.

238
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.770
And I think anytime you're putting yourself in a position where you're doing

239
00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:11.410
strength and conditioning work,
you should do both.

240
00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:14.680
You should do with proper form and you should do also do some awkward shit too.

241
00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:18.910
Like sandbag stuff.
I like doing an awkward shit.
Like it's,
cause it's,

242
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:20.950
it's extra frustrating while you're doing it.

243
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:24.010
And that sounds ridiculous and like,
like I'm a masochist,

244
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.650
but I feel like there's certain workouts,

245
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:31.240
it's good to be able to voluntarily push through discomfort,

246
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.510
you know?
I don't want everything.
They always feel perfect.

247
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.560
I like getting callouses.
I don't wear gloves.
I like throwing sandbags around.

248
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.250
I like,

249
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.660
I don't mind if I'm lifting weights and it ripped skin on my hand.

250
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.990
I feel I'm fucking doing something,
you know,
I'm here to get to work.

251
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:51.830
I'm not scared of getting scratched and uh,
so I like both.

252
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.040
I like doing things with proper form.
That's the most important thing.

253
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:57.320
If you're thinking about working out and you've never done it before,

254
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:01.340
you're like,
this is it.
I'm getting my fucking body in shape.
Go slow.

255
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:04.010
Whatever you do,
get a trainer if you can,

256
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:09.011
if you can afford to have someone show you how to do the move movements properly

257
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:13.310
and if you can videotape yourself,
that's a good one too.
If not,

258
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:14.121
if you can't afford that,

259
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:17.540
if you lived nowhere where there's a trainer that you trust or you maybe have

260
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:20.900
trust issues and you want to work on your own,
you can do it,

261
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:25.850
but please do it slowly.
Um,
there's plenty of goto information,

262
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.020
um,
how to rather information on,
on at.com.

285
00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.270
<v 0>Yeah,
you told me the story.
It's mind boggling.</v>

286
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.740
<v 3>It's bananas.
So I guess I'll kind of repeat it and then we'll,</v>

287
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.030
<v 0>well yeah,
please do.
Yeah,
but people need to hear this.
This is,
this is</v>

288
00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.990
<v 3>odd.
All right.
So,
uh,
I'm in the middle of selling my house.</v>

289
00:17:02.991 --> 00:17:05.850
I had an escrow,
uh,
and uh,

290
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.380
they told me to move out in 45 days,
45,
the 45th days today.
Monday.

291
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.740
So I moved the entire weekend and as I pull up and get out the car to come into

292
00:17:16.591 --> 00:17:17.310
the studio,

293
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:22.200
I get a phone call from the real estate agent telling me that the loan for the

294
00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:26.550
buyer didn't go through.
So I'm,
I'm moved out.

295
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:28.440
My stuff is in storage.

296
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:33.470
I gave half of it away to this Mexican church across the street from me and I

297
00:17:33.631 --> 00:17:38.520
got shit all over the place.
I don't have an address.
Oh my goodness.
You know,

298
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.020
I'm supposed to be staying on a friend's couch.
I'm just scared that I'm just,

299
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.750
I'm just all over the place right now and I'm,
and I'm coming in here,

300
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:51.860
you know,
to have some and do the show and chase shut it down.

301
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.750
<v 1>Oh,
the reason why they shut it down though,
it's fascinating.</v>

302
00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.491
<v 3>Okay,</v>

303
00:17:58.491 --> 00:18:03.491
so they stopped the buyer's loan because they don't like the buyers answer for

304
00:18:07.731 --> 00:18:10.730
where their funds that they are having.
The account came from,

305
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.800
like the buyer has enough money to back the loan,
but they don't,

306
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.640
they think it's fishy.
They don't like where the monies come from,

307
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.850
the answers or where the money's from.
So they said,
well,

308
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:25.760
we're not going to going to sign off on this loan because we don't like your,

309
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:26.360
your money.

310
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.310
<v 1>What?
You know what sometimes people do apparently is a,</v>

311
00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.490
they'll get family members to deposit money in account to make the account look

312
00:18:33.491 --> 00:18:36.850
really big.
Right?
And then they go for a loan.
They check the account and they go,

313
00:18:36.851 --> 00:18:37.960
oh,
there's all this money in there,

314
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.600
but they just move it out as soon as he gets it.

315
00:18:40.601 --> 00:18:42.670
Like the only reason why it's in there is to make the loan.

316
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.430
They're going to give him a little piece of the action to make the loan go

317
00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:49.930
through.
That can get tricky,
you know?
Apparently.
Yeah.

318
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.410
I guess you have to show how much you make.
I mean,
if you make $100,000 a year,

319
00:18:53.411 --> 00:18:57.550
but you got $50 million in the bank,
they're going to go,
fuck's going on dude?

320
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.890
Hey,
saving my money.
Now that that doesn't seem to make sense,
man.

321
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.950
Chase has been in the news a lot lately for a knocking down a lot of anything.

322
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.470
Adult Entertainment,

323
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.580
like even shutting down a condom store that just sold condoms online because it

324
00:19:12.581 --> 00:19:15.430
had something to do with the adult industry.
It's incredible.

325
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:20.890
It's incredible that a condom thing,
like birth control is dirty.

326
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.490
LikeW we will be waiting for 10 and we all fuck.
Is that what's going on here?

327
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.640
Are we pretending we don't have sex and we pretend that we don't like to fuck.

328
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.380
If somebody doesn't like the fuck,
I don't want to talk to you.
All right.

329
00:19:32.381 --> 00:19:33.580
You're a Weirdo.

330
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.510
Fucking is half of what people love to do in life.

331
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.370
They shut down a condom store.
Yeah.

332
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.270
Chase banks do business with me because I run a condom company.

333
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.220
Very few people enter into relationships with men and women not wanting to ever,

334
00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:52.720
fuck.
It's always a part of the thing that they want to do.
Like the happiest,

335
00:19:52.721 --> 00:19:57.430
most in love.
People like still like to have sex with each other,
right?

336
00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.440
Like there's nothing wrong with condoms.

337
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.040
The idea that there's something wrong with birth control is saying that there's

338
00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:07.330
something wrong always with sex.
It's so stupid.

339
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.170
<v 3>Chase.
One day it'd be more people so they can turn down.
Is that,</v>

340
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.240
is that what they're doing?
They want people have more kids and they say,
no,

341
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:16.200
you can't get this loan.

342
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.140
<v 1>Dude,
you're your bit about what's not.
Uh,</v>

343
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.220
I don't want to give it away because if you,

344
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.660
you got to see Ian Live like for folks who don't know,

345
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.030
I think you get slept on man.
I really do.

346
00:20:26.031 --> 00:20:28.980
I think you're one of the best comics in the world.
Appreciate that.
And,

347
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.250
and I've known that for a long time,
man.

348
00:20:31.251 --> 00:20:34.670
You've always been really fucking funny and I think you're,
you're,

349
00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:37.880
you're starting to pick up steam right now and it's awesome to see.

350
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.180
But that bit you have on bankers.
Dude,

351
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.550
I don't want to say anything about the bugs.
I don't want people to go see it.

352
00:20:43.551 --> 00:20:47.060
I fucking love that bit.
God Damn,
that's good.

353
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:51.700
<v 4>I'm going to,
I'm going to be doing it with extra venom
when you see me.</v>

354
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.020
Maybe just going to be really emotional time.
I do it.

355
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.340
Are you around Wednesday night?

356
00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:02.190
<v 1>Uh,
something's going on.
What is the Wednesday?
Oh,</v>

357
00:21:02.191 --> 00:21:06.750
I was going to go to the store for Gerard's thing.
What is it?
Uh,
he's taping.

358
00:21:06.751 --> 00:21:11.610
Is Hbo Album this HBO special?
Oh,
what time is that?

359
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.070
Probably.
Probably at night.
Ish.
At night if sheer like eight ish.
Yeah.

360
00:21:17.071 --> 00:21:21.780
What time you got to do it 10 too.
I haven't even,
I haven't even booked it yet.

361
00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:25.550
How about that?
You can roll like that though.
You got to do is get on.
That's,

362
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.420
that's the beauty of Twitter and all that.
You're just like,
Bam.
Just,

363
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.690
just put out a tweet and Bam.
It's on.

364
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.410
It's also that I get guys like Ian Edwards would come and do the show.

365
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.950
You know DNS is going to be on to,
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
We'll him Z as an,

366
00:21:37.951 --> 00:21:41.370
I had a great time in Santa Barbara.
God Damn Santa Barbara is awesome.

367
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.380
Here we go over there.
Yeah,
I've been over there.

368
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.550
It's like I don't want people to know about it.
I feel about it.

369
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.120
I don't like to talk about Santa Barbara on,
on,
on a podcast,

370
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.120
so they don't want people to hear about it.
I don't want them to hear about it.

371
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.730
I fucked up.
I should have shut my mouth.
Solaris.

372
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.580
I really should've shut my mouth that places.
It's sweet.

373
00:21:59.581 --> 00:22:04.110
It's only like 100,000 so people up there,
it's great.
They're all real cool,

374
00:22:04.111 --> 00:22:07.500
friendly people.
There's no fucking traffic.
There's some on the highway.

375
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.550
You get off the highway

376
00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.090
<v 4>five o'clock everybody's just traveling around like normal</v>

377
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.530
<v 1>damn.
And you go,
oh wait a minute,
this is possible.</v>

378
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.040
You could live somewhere where you could just get somewhere at five o'clock you

379
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:22.900
don't have to.
I was talking to this lady at this,
uh,
this doctor's office.

380
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.620
She told me that she lives in Hollywood and she works in Santa Monica and

381
00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:30.790
sometimes when she leaves at night it takes her an hour and 45 minutes to get

382
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:34.410
home as believable.
I actually think she's lying in it.

383
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.273
<v 4>It takes a long,</v>

384
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:39.620
that's

385
00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.670
<v 1>fucking insane.
That's insane.
And he'd go to,</v>

386
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.200
you ever go like Big Sur?
You ever been in a place like that?
It's up,

387
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.390
up in northern coast,
heard of it,
but I'd never been up there.

388
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.230
A lot of writers like hunter s Thompson lived there,
Miller lived there.

389
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.080
A lot of writers go there because it's so stunning that they just,

390
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.750
it's kind of a little bit dour.
Like the air is wet.

391
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.880
It gets fucking cold sometimes cause it's a lot of like wind and shit from the,

392
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.370
the moist waves and yeah,
there's a lot of moisture,
but it's northern California.

393
00:23:10.371 --> 00:23:14.030
But God damn,
it's fucking beautiful.
And it helps him,
right?
Yeah.

394
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.170
But you go to a place like that where there's not as many people as la and you

395
00:23:18.171 --> 00:23:21.920
realize you could just get anywhere.
You start thinking like,
what am I doing?

396
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.850
Like what,
what is it,
what's the point in living in this cramp spot?

397
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.020
Is it because there's a lot of my friends here,
but why?

398
00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.440
Why do people choose to do this?

399
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.020
I'm trying to think of somewhere I went to do a show.

400
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.580
It's kind of in wine country.
I'll like Sonoma,
like update something like that.

401
00:23:37.581 --> 00:23:39.530
It's just this little,
what's that place you go to?

402
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:44.180
Sylvane Sylvane that's awesome.
It's like east,
uh,
Santa Barbara and she just,

403
00:23:44.181 --> 00:23:46.070
it looks like if Disney,
a town in

404
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.850
<v 5>the middle of nowhere,
like a small little warnings like windmills everywhere.</v>

405
00:23:49.851 --> 00:23:53.450
There's ostrich farms that are this awesome.
And there's tons of wineries.

406
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:56.190
He'd just get drunk and hang out in this creepy little town.

407
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.900
I have to turn it into Brian's.

408
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.320
<v 1>Well that's what does and wine tasting things.
No,
no,
no.</v>

409
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:07.250
We'll gentlemen getting fucked up.
Fancy drunk gentleman.

410
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.060
<v 5>Oh yeah.
He trick your Nigga get becoming drunks.</v>

411
00:24:10.061 --> 00:24:13.920
They even sell it to like buy like these big two liters and these huge course of

412
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.130
things when you go to the winery,

413
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:19.880
<v 1>when she first,
did you see that shit about a Jim Cook?</v>

414
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.720
Jim Cook,
the guy who makes Sam Adams?
No,
he,
he uh,

415
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.080
he was expressing how you can eat brewer's yeast and it keeps you from getting

416
00:24:31.461 --> 00:24:35.990
drunk.
Like yeah,
pull it up,
pull it up,
man.
Jim Cook,
uh,

417
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:39.470
explains how to drink beer all night and not get drunk.

418
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:41.270
It's really kind of fascinating man.

419
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:46.570
Like he figured out some sort of biochemical process that you can sort of create

420
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:51.650
in your body and helps your body process alcohol better.

421
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.780
It's interesting because I'm very yeasty,

422
00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:56.480
it's been proven by many doctors and stuff like that.

423
00:24:56.481 --> 00:24:59.440
So that might be why I can drink so much proven.

424
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.790
It's been proven that I'm very easy.
Here's the studies brings over fucking

425
00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:09.680
things from at Sam Adams founder Jim Koch.

426
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.190
I think it's coke says a spoonful of yeast makes them less drunk.

427
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.990
Jim Classroom Cook is a cook.
Yeah.
Why not spell it?
Cook.

428
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:20.960
Why you making me work so hard?
We can't change it.

429
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.740
Change a little symbols to what we all mutually agree upon.
It looks like coke.

430
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.010
Yeah,
let's change it.
Like,
you know,
they changed literally.
Yeah.

431
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:32.870
They have changed that to coke because it's not coke or good is coke.

432
00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:36.950
It's not cook.
I don't care what your parents call it.
Spelling it wrong dude.

433
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:41.760
That's what I was like.
Oh,
like the Koch brothers,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.

434
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.640
<v 5>Yeah.
Cool.
How does,
you know the Koch brothers that live in that building?</v>

435
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.170
It's spelled the same way as that,
right?

436
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.440
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
K.
O c.
H.
So how come it could be two different things?
Isn't that cook?</v>

437
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:54.850
The cook brothers,
the coke,
the coke,
those uh,
those rich guys.

438
00:25:54.851 --> 00:25:57.970
Billionaires and it's k.
O.
C.
H.
Yeah,
I think so.
You could look it up.

439
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.400
<v 5>I don't,
I don't even know why people argue anymore.</v>

440
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.080
Like people are still having the arguments,

441
00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:08.640
like Google doesn't exist when somebody asks me a question then we saw going

442
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:08.880
back.
Yeah,

443
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.710
<v 1>let's,
let's just Google it.
I've,</v>

444
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.580
I've been humbled by Google many times.
It just,

445
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.530
it forces you to recognize like what are we doing when we argue sometimes about

446
00:26:18.531 --> 00:26:20.300
being right or wrong,
it's so stupid.

447
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.050
So like if you know something and I don't know it,
why should I care?
You know,

448
00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:27.470
why does anybody care?
And if you do,
if somebody asks you something,

449
00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:29.810
you don't know the answer,
why would you bullshit?

450
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.220
It's a greater tendency to d two bullshit.
Like there's something else going on.

451
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.210
It's eagle.
Yeah,
it's really annoying.
Yeah,
you gotta cut it out.

452
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:43.630
So I got to go to and the world and swallow gotta cut it down by Google.

453
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.640
But there's also a lot of ridiculous websites you can get caught up in the mix

454
00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:52.310
and some of them have lives.
It's also like studies,
like,

455
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:54.660
like one study will say it's good for you,

456
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.570
another study we'll say it gives you Dick Cancer.
Like,

457
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.910
can you guys figure this out?

458
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.840
It's like a bunch of different guys claiming to be the welterweight champion of

459
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:06.600
the world.
Like he can't have five different welterweight champions.

460
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.780
Just like you can't have,
you know,
you can't.
You've got to figure it out.

461
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.280
<v 3>Let us know.
Okay,
we'll wait.</v>

462
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.700
And that's when you say welterweight champion meeting boxing.
That's why boxing,

463
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:18.910
it's not what it used to be

464
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.540
<v 1>used to be really ridiculous.
There was like a gang,</v>

465
00:27:21.541 --> 00:27:26.340
I don't know if there's as many now.
You always hear about the big ones,
the WBC,

466
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.010
WBA,
IBF.
Those are the big ones.

467
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:34.240
And then that was the Ibo was an,
that came along.
There was a,

468
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.830
there's a bunch of different ones too.
One time I was welterweight champion

469
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:44.650
<v 3>for my sister.
Did you see the my Donna fight?
Nah,
they were there.
My Donna,</v>

470
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.260
I refuse to watch,
uh,
maybe where the fight until he fights pack out.

471
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.350
I think everyone,
yeah.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm boycotting them doing my,

472
00:27:51.351 --> 00:27:55.910
Donna made a hell of a fight out of it.
A lot of fun.
Yeah.
It was a great fight.

473
00:27:55.911 --> 00:27:56.744
It was a great fight.

474
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.150
<v 1>It was fun if you know how they played on HBO the next week,</v>

475
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.850
if you're fully moved back into wherever you

476
00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:09.630
turned off their cable box on Saturday.
Oh,
that's crazy.

477
00:28:09.631 --> 00:28:13.530
Crazy bananas.
Not know that it could go like me neither.

478
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.240
I thought that once a deal's a deal,
like the paperwork starts getting moving.

479
00:28:18.241 --> 00:28:19.890
I didn't know you could just stop the process.

480
00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.320
<v 3>Yeah.
If the bank,
I thought they were going to close.</v>

481
00:28:22.321 --> 00:28:25.560
They even tried to close early the other day and I said,
I won't be out,

482
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.210
but they had to approve it at one point they had.
They approved it.
Yeah.

483
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.250
And then someone like overside somebody oversized,

484
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.340
<v 1>Eh,
we don't trust these Persians.</v>

485
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.520
I want to find out what they did.
Yeah.

486
00:28:37.521 --> 00:28:40.790
I need to and support it and somehow give him more money.

487
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:45.230
So you got a way to circumvent the system.

488
00:28:45.231 --> 00:28:47.790
You're probably selling something good.
Oh man,

489
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.300
that's the Irene.
It was probably something that would like it probably sell.

490
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.560
I'm awesome.
Maybe it's raw milk.
Marijuana.
It could be marijuana.

491
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.860
Whatever it is.
Fucking let's leave them alone.

492
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.190
It's all the money from those rug stores as millions and millions of rug stores

493
00:29:04.191 --> 00:29:07.790
that you see everywhere in your like how did,
that's a serious crime though.

494
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:12.140
You're trying to hide income hiding incomes is serious crime apparently.

495
00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:17.110
Cause you really think about it like hiding income,
you know,

496
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.090
if you got a lot of cash coming in and how much,

497
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.440
like what a percentage of how much you actually make is like under the table

498
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.440
that you would get taxed on,
you know,

499
00:29:26.441 --> 00:29:28.940
and how much more money would the government get because of that.

500
00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:31.940
And how much of an example can they make out of you to make sure that someone

501
00:29:31.941 --> 00:29:34.910
hears about it so they don't do it right.
It's just fucking

502
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.840
<v 3>in Italy.
Dolce and Gabbana probably going to jail really.</v>

503
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.710
Like right now they got like,

504
00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:46.810
<v 1>uh,
18 months suspended sentence but it's for hiding money offshore.</v>

505
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.760
Ah.
And it's like,
like could you imagine dolce and Gabbana in jail?

506
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.160
That is just bananas.

507
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.860
And that's like the perfect example of what you're talking about.

508
00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:59.970
Like making an example of somebody that everybody knows who you,

509
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.950
you would think never would go to jail.
If they do it to them,

510
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.510
then they,
yeah,
they don't fuck around when it comes to that.

511
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:11.430
That's the most mafia shit in the world is the tax collector.
Yeah,

512
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.260
because they don't treat it like it's money.
They take away your freedom.

513
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:18.550
It's one of the rare times where just it becomes a crime.
Well,

514
00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:23.390
you're not giving someone enough money that'd becomes a crimes,
bananas,
bliss.

515
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.070
But it just,

516
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:28.270
it becomes a crime that they go after you with a fucking fever that's reserved

517
00:30:28.271 --> 00:30:32.500
for terrorism.
Yeah.
I mean they'll put your ass in jail,

518
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.400
could have done everything right all your life and just throw in one extra

519
00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:39.880
receipt in there.
Well then I don't think it's that much,
but if they find out,

520
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:45.060
you're probably pretty fair about finding out whether or not you're actually

521
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.660
being a tax cheat.
But if you are a tax cheat,
they fucking go after you.

522
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:53.530
Like what they did with Wesley Snipes.
He,
they wouldn't even let him pay it.

523
00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.190
They wouldn't even let them pay Lauren Hill in jail.
They're like,
well,

524
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:59.950
you got to go to jail.
No,
no,
no.
You're going to go to fucking jail.

525
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.380
They put Lauren Hill and jail.
She's a menace to society.
Yeah.

526
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.660
The singer songwriter,
she's a mess.
She's out there singing.
She's like,

527
00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:10.480
I'll give you two of the grammys.
She's like,
you didn't even make enough money.

528
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.080
He didn't give me enough money,
so we're going to have to lock you in a cage.

529
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.220
That's crazy.
Especially when you say cage,

530
00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:22.280
we're going to lock you in a cage.
That's what it is.
I'm gonna pay you and I,

531
00:31:22.281 --> 00:31:26.050
I firmly believe that we should all pay taxes firmly believe it.
I really do.

532
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:31.051
I think we need to pay what we didn't figure out what's important for everybody.

533
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:35.710
What's,
what's number one?
Is it healthcare?
What's number two?
Is it,
is it,

534
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.120
is it school systems?
Like what?
What are,
what are our priorities?

535
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.700
Figuring out what the,
and then figure out how much that shit costs.

536
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.250
Like get people who really know what they're doing and everybody should

537
00:31:45.251 --> 00:31:48.250
contribute their part.
At least what you can contribute.

538
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:50.770
It would make the world a better place.
Right?
That's what we all want.

539
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.580
But it gets real squirrely went,
I don't know what you're doing with that money

540
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.470
real squarely within it because it's fucked up on so many ends.

541
00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:03.070
Like some people don't want to dishonest and don't want to pay it into some Po.

542
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.750
When they get the money,
they blow it on shit.
So then that justifies that.

543
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:11.140
The people who don't want to pay,
they're like,
look what they just did with that.

544
00:32:11.141 --> 00:32:14.560
And then there's some people not getting enough of it who needed like for

545
00:32:14.561 --> 00:32:18.330
education,
especially like in the hood and all that Shit.
It's like,

546
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:23.140
and it's like this shit is all fucked up and it's dishonest people in if there's

547
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:26.410
a Pi cutting five and that could make this thing work.

548
00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:28.390
There's this honest people in each slice.

549
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:32.410
Well I think we would all be happy to pay taxes,
but I think,

550
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.880
I think people would be way more likely to pay taxes if we had a better sense of

551
00:32:36.881 --> 00:32:40.040
community and if they know where the fucking

552
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.910
<v 0>mind is going like this.
No receipt.
We don't get a receiver.
Hey,
you know,</v>

553
00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:44.780
you paid Ian,

554
00:32:44.781 --> 00:32:48.650
you paid x amount of money and you know this amount went to school systems.

555
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:50.930
You'd be happy to know that this amount,
one to fix the streets,

556
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:54.590
you'd be happy to know.
That would be beautiful.
If we got a chance to see that,

557
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:58.550
you know,
you'd,
you'd be able to look at it like quantify,
look,
you know,
my,

558
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.920
the fruits of my work have sent x amount of dollars towards public education.

559
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:05.060
That would be a nice feeling.

560
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:08.420
<v 5>And you know why it's not transparent and there's no receipt because it's not</v>

561
00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:12.050
being distributed equally and that would fuck people up.

562
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.540
<v 0>Well,
it's fucked up that it's not art.
It's not only is it not our call,</v>

563
00:33:15.541 --> 00:33:18.270
it's pretty,
we're in the dark about it hardly ever comes up.

564
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.270
When people talk about the budget,
it's always a balancing of the budget.

565
00:33:21.271 --> 00:33:23.280
The president's attempting to balance a budget.

566
00:33:23.281 --> 00:33:25.730
They're adjusting bills and the balancing of the

567
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.770
<v 5>budget.
Very important voice.
I like to important voice that.
Yeah,</v>

568
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.690
that's how they talk.
I'm about to tell you.

569
00:33:33.691 --> 00:33:36.270
So I'm about to tell you nothing that's important.

570
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:40.360
Voice balancing knocked the purchases.
He must be right.

571
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.590
That's not the president addresses the nation this evening.

572
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:48.200
The president's hype,
man,
it's so president.
Well,
all that

573
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.560
<v 0>fake shit that used to exist in like the fucking bicentennial days back in the</v>

574
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.520
17 hundreds and shit.
It's like still going on in that way.

575
00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.690
There's a formal way of communicating like we don't need that anymore.

576
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.760
We don't do.

577
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.120
There should never be a formal time where you communicate because all that means

578
00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.090
is that there's a bunch of shit you're not going to tell me and I'm not going to

579
00:34:09.091 --> 00:34:10.350
know how you really thinking.

580
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:15.620
I'm going to hear some thing that I allow you to do where you go into this fake

581
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:21.210
<v 5>speaker voice and I'll allow you to say a bunch of stupid shit with no,
I don't.</v>

582
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.830
No one gets to talk to you.
You don't have to communicate like that anymore.

583
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.813
It doesn't.

584
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.660
The only reason that used to exist because you had to get like a bunch of people

585
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.040
hear ye hear ye

586
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:33.870
<v 0>your phones.
So the yelling out to some fucking room,</v>

587
00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:37.050
they have to yell it out cause you can't just talk and then people can't talk

588
00:34:37.051 --> 00:34:40.620
back to you who's not.
There's too many of them would take too much time.
Fuck it.

589
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:43.110
But now,
now it doesn't.
Now there's a way like there's,

590
00:34:43.111 --> 00:34:45.450
it's like there's interaction should be,

591
00:34:45.451 --> 00:34:46.920
it should be like this would be some sort of a

592
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.811
<v 5>two way street.</v>

593
00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:52.811
You should be 2014 type of style interaction instead of what they're doing right

594
00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:53.300
now.

595
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:58.300
<v 0>The important thing is that the president has let us know where the money goes</v>

596
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:02.330
back to you.
Who are you?
Why are you talking like that?

597
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.880
<v 5>The president is crazy.
They're crazy.</v>

598
00:35:05.881 --> 00:35:10.210
Everyone's crazy coffee from the guy before you who did that job before.

599
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:14.070
Our country is strong.
Our will.

600
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.710
It's great
magic.
If you're eating and someone started talking,

601
00:35:19.711 --> 00:35:23.220
he like that.
You're in the middle of dinner.
If someone starts to do you like,

602
00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:25.920
what the fuck are you doing?
Dinner on the floor.

603
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.760
Weird asshole talking like this.
This is crazy.

604
00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:32.790
Talk telling me how I feel and how are we gonna make it through this.

605
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.920
You're going to tell me how I'm going to make it through this and you're going

606
00:35:34.921 --> 00:35:38.010
to disappear after the speech go

607
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.540
<v 0>away.
Crazy.
When is that going to go away?</v>

608
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.220
I mean at one point in time they had to get rid of the powdered wigs.
Okay.

609
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.380
So at one point in time those judges were

610
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:49.780
<v 4>wearing those wigs and they're like,
look,</v>

611
00:35:49.781 --> 00:35:53.110
we got to have the wigs were not wearing the web was this shit is no good.

612
00:35:53.111 --> 00:35:54.040
That was bananas.

613
00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:58.800
That's how shit was when a motherfucker,

614
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.730
you know,
when I was telling you what was up here,
Ye hear you.

615
00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:08.860
And he's just like a squire wearing high heels or wearing,
wearing high heels.

616
00:36:08.861 --> 00:36:09.970
That's wear high heels came from,

617
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:14.800
oh I started it and robes at one point in time someone had a look at that and
go,

618
00:36:14.801 --> 00:36:19.290
Yo,
we gotta stop this.
Stop with the wigs.
And they fought.
This is tradition.

619
00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.160
It's always been

620
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.780
<v 0>terrible.
Alvers still a documentary about the fucking,</v>

621
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.490
the revolt to keep the wigs on.

622
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.353
<v 4>Holy Shit.</v>

623
00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.780
Well spoke up in England and court like you get sentenced by more fucking a wig.

624
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:40.600
I was still doing like so crazy.
Oh,

625
00:36:40.601 --> 00:36:42.580
you guys want me to not listen.
Listen,

626
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.000
there's nothing I can do about this or are you going to tell me this shit like a

627
00:36:46.001 --> 00:36:50.230
man?
Take Her fucking Waco for you telling me I got 25 years.

628
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.350
Oh,
I'm not doing it.
I'm going to try to escape.

629
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.470
Take that fucking wig off right now.
What are you doing?
Stupid.

630
00:36:59.471 --> 00:37:01.660
Why are you dressing like you're in a different time era?

631
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:07.390
Show you put on a show for me.
You have a wig on.
This is a show.

632
00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:09.110
This is a God damn play.
Absolutely.

633
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:14.410
Where's the other people in the play experience?
No real.
You're putting on a play

634
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.910
<v 0>Solaris.
So ridiculous.
Can we see some,</v>

635
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:22.950
can you pull up some modern English court Gyn Wig?

636
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.570
What do they call him?
A Barista Barista.
The was a barrister.
A um,

637
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.200
a Gr a lawyer.
There's not a lawyer.

638
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.210
That's the old school.
That's old school.
See if you can find some,

639
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:37.500
that's John Belushi,

640
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:45.300
that weird fucking scene.
So that was one of those scenes.

641
00:37:45.301 --> 00:37:49.620
You can't really,
you can't really do that,
man,
I'll ever,
stone wasn't there.

642
00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:51.150
While that was going down,
like man,

643
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:54.780
you took a little creative license and then need to talk to you about it.

644
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.300
You don't even have any pictures of these guys doing this.

645
00:37:57.301 --> 00:38:00.630
How do you know that then went down like that?
That's what he does,

646
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:06.210
what they did.
Oh,
okay.
All right man.
This is like,

647
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.090
there's a lot of people like have a problem with Oliver Stone because of shit

648
00:38:09.091 --> 00:38:11.850
like that.
Like you know that movie Jfk,

649
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.570
you know with the Donald Sutherland character comes over and tells all the

650
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:18.610
information,
all the details you met,
you know that scene?
Yeah.

651
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.050
Apparently that dude,
he,
he made up that guy.

652
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.020
He made up that guy that wasn't like an historical guy.

653
00:38:25.021 --> 00:38:29.670
He was used as like a tool to sort of propel the story along.
That's,

654
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:34.290
this is what I had heard.
Forget parts of JFK.
I can't even remember that part.

655
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.050
It was an interesting,

656
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.980
I need to pull it up now and make sure Donald Sterling's character because I did

657
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:43.540
just say that now and I'm saying as I said it,
I'm like,
I maybe I'm wrong.

658
00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:48.210
Not Donald Sterling,
Donald Sutherland,
Jonathan,
Donald Sterling,
some braids.

659
00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.300
I saw Donald Sutherland the other day,
man.

660
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:57.301
I was watching the old school invasion of the body snatchers Jeff,

661
00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.720
long time ago.
Jeff gold blooms in it.
He's 20 years old.

662
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.360
Looks like a little kid.
It's crazy.

663
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.190
I just saw him in a hotel,
Budapest or some shit like that.

664
00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.200
While you're here,
if you Google Donald Sutherland and then write scene scene,

665
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.710
JFK comes up and immediately pull it up.
Brian,

666
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.010
he says JFK movie clip.
Yeah.

667
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.330
Yeah.
Donald Sutherland seen JFK movie clip.

668
00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.640
Sit on a bench together.
It's a fee.
It's a fascinating thing because if this,

669
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:38.470
if this guy didn't really exist,
then yeah,
that one right there.

670
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.890
If this guy didn't really exist,
like it's,

671
00:39:40.891 --> 00:39:44.050
it's a vehicle to distribute the truth,
but

672
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:49.380
the truth of special,
I think it's supposed to be as inner dialogue.
No,
no,
no,
no,

673
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:50.980
no,
but listen,
because this is a guy

674
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:56.210
<v 6>who's telling him all this stuff.
One of my routine duties,</v>

675
00:39:56.211 --> 00:39:57.440
if I had been in Washington,

676
00:39:57.441 --> 00:39:59.960
would have been to arrange for additional security in Texas,

677
00:39:59.961 --> 00:40:02.780
so I decided to check it out.
Sure enough,

678
00:40:02.781 --> 00:40:06.790
I found out that someone had told them 112 to military intelligence group,

679
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:11.330
the Fourth Army headquarters at Fort Sam Houston to stand down that day over the

680
00:40:11.331 --> 00:40:14.960
protests of the unit commander Colonel,
I believe it's a mistake.

681
00:40:14.961 --> 00:40:18.200
This is significant because it is standard operating procedure,

682
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:23.540
especially in uno and hostile.
I said just something with the secret service men.

683
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.080
Even if we had not allowed them to be remote,

684
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.500
we would have placed at least 100 to 200 agents on the sidewalk.

685
00:40:30.501 --> 00:40:31.610
Without question,

686
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:35.910
Stevenson spit on him.

687
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.480
I'd already been several attempts under God's life in France.

688
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.910
We would have arrived days ahead of time,

689
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:50.240
never cover the area.
That's just whole clip.

690
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:54.800
They had been on the radio.
We'd been watching.
Just let it go for a couple

691
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:58.640
of

692
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.160
army presence in the streets.

693
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.630
It was a violation of the most basic protection codes.

694
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:22.040
Who could invest gun,
this black ox,
Mr. Garrison.
People in my business,

695
00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:25.640
people like nice very officer could've called Colonel Back and said,
look,

696
00:41:25.641 --> 00:41:29.610
we have another unit coming from so and so providing security.
You'll stand out.

697
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.890
I mean that day.
In fact,

698
00:41:30.891 --> 00:41:35.120
there were some individual in Dallas and still trying to figure out why,

699
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:39.920
but they weren't protecting client.
And of course,
awesome army intel,

700
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:45.230
Ivy Lee Oswald on file,
all those files and destroyed.
Thanks.

701
00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.360
Strange things were happening.

702
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:50.810
<v 0>Anyway,
here's the point.
If that guy didn't really say all that Shit,</v>

703
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.540
are you allowed to just do that?

704
00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:57.850
<v 3>I think that's how all of a stone feels about the situation.</v>

705
00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:00.010
He just wanted to get his shit across.

706
00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.500
<v 0>Well,
you pay.
He says the guy's a real guy.
Oliver Stone says,</v>

707
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:08.060
the guy's name is Fletcher Prouty,
p,
r,
O,
u,

708
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:10.100
t wife,
Fletcher Prouty.

709
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.930
And then he served in the military since World War II and from 55 to 64 who was

710
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:19.450
in the Pentagon working as a chief of special operations.
Hmm.

711
00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.190
So apparently it was a real dude.
According to Oliver Stone.

712
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:30.050
<v 3>I saw a dope JFK movie.</v>

713
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:34.070
I forgot it's called park something.
Did anybody see it now?
What is it?
It's uh,

714
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.580
it came out last year.
It's about an earliest.
It's about,

715
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.690
it's about the assassination,
but it's about everybody around it.
It's about,

716
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:45.170
it's about the,
the secret service.

717
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:50.620
Like said he gets shot and before they show the hospital and the doctors in the

718
00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:55.100
hospitals.
So it's about them operating on JFK.
Parkland.
Yeah.
Parkland,

719
00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:59.990
a fight for his body with the corner in the city to get in the body on the
plane.

720
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:04.700
Then there was a part where the CIA agent agent is like,
uh,
listen,

721
00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:08.150
we got to protect the president and they're looking at JFK.
And the guy said,

722
00:43:08.151 --> 00:43:10.580
okay,
let's do it.
And they said,
that's not the president anymore.

723
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:12.740
Like when they taken his body out of the,

724
00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:16.910
the topless car to put him in the ambulance and the secret,

725
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.670
the secret service guy looked at his brain.
He's like,

726
00:43:19.671 --> 00:43:23.520
that dude's not the president anymore.
And then it was about grabbing,
uh,

727
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:26.510
the vice president and securing him and said,

728
00:43:26.511 --> 00:43:30.380
we got to get him back on the plane and everybody associated.
And then they said,

729
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:32.240
what about the first lady?
And she's like,

730
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.290
the night she ain't the first lady no more.
And it was like ready to just,

731
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.210
it's like those moments like they,

732
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.020
they're like ready to those like catcher to the wall.
It's like,

733
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.960
but it was just protocol and it's just like,

734
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.030
so it was about the shit that they went through.

735
00:43:47.031 --> 00:43:50.750
The doctor's like trying to resuscitate and their day and,

736
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:55.130
and then Sapir Ooda who had to film and then getting the film from him.

737
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.950
And it was,
it was well done.
It was underrated.

738
00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:01.840
<v 0>There was a bunch of witnesses to the assassination,</v>

739
00:44:01.841 --> 00:44:04.900
people that were in the grassy knoll,
people that were in that area.

740
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:10.480
Out of those people in a three years from the time of the murder,

741
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.860
the three year period,
18 witnesses were killed,

742
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.960
six by gunfire,
three by motor accidents too by suicide,

743
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:23.470
one from a cut throat,
one from a karate chop,
the neck,

744
00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:29.040
three from heart attacks.
And two from natural causes.
Wow.
Holy Shit.
I want

745
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.160
<v 3>more info on the karate chop to the name.
Yeah.
How do they know it was a karate</v>

746
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.590
<v 1>chop?
Cried shops are rarely fatal.</v>

747
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.440
Maybe the guy was a bitch to the neck though.

748
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:39.720
I just saw that a myth busters last night.

749
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:43.110
They were talking about how you could I actually be driving on a motorcycle at

750
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:46.500
certain speeds and hit the right kind of bug at the right kind of place on your

751
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:51.480
throat and it could just kill you.
Wow.
Just from politics.
It was that.

752
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:55.440
It was one of those huge like almost beetle bugs that are only in like Africa,

753
00:44:55.441 --> 00:44:59.520
you know?
But they look like like a,
like almost like a dinosaur bug.

754
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.660
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.
They do fly the holy shit.
What am I,

755
00:45:03.661 --> 00:45:08.570
are they pull that up?
I got to tell Dean Darry to look out.
Yeah.

756
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.140
Yeah.
That seems like you get hurt,
man.

757
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:17.460
Other countries do way worse than us when it comes to bugs.

758
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:20.880
We're lucky when it comes to bugs,
especially California.

759
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.761
That's one thing you know,

760
00:45:21.761 --> 00:45:26.220
realize you go back east during the summer and you'd get walked on by
mosquitoes,

761
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:30.330
so you go,
oh yeah,
you guys have bugs everywhere.
Like what country are we in?

762
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:35.850
California?
They killed all their books.
If you go to Florida,
go to Gainesville,

763
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:39.240
Florida in July.
It's like,
good luck.

764
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.120
It doesn't even feel like America southern fucking truck.
Whoa.

765
00:45:45.121 --> 00:45:49.920
That's crazy.
Chaotic,
Goliath.
Beautiful.
I think that's a real bug.
Oh my God.

766
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:52.990
It's a crap.
Is her hand small or is that the room?

767
00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:59.740
That hand?
Yeah.
Here's another one of them.

768
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:05.460
Whoa.
Get the fuck out.
This thing for folks who,
it's like a picture.

769
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:09.390
Your grandfather's flip phone.
Not Not your mom's flip phone,

770
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:13.260
but your grandfather's legacy.
Motorola.
STARTAC.

771
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:19.090
STARTAC.
That's what it's like.
It looks like a bit dazzled phone case,
I think.

772
00:46:19.091 --> 00:46:22.510
What?
Fuck you up.
That's a big bug.
I've got this thing.

773
00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:27.640
I think we'd have to pry her mouth open.
Ooh.
Oh,
that's a ocean creature,
isn't it?

774
00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.593
I don't think at all.

775
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.920
That's the beetle is not a water beetle is the giant a sauce pot.

776
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:40.150
Oh my God.
It's technically not an insect,
but what the fuck?

777
00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:43.330
Technically not an insect.
What is it then?
What do you find those?

778
00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:49.060
I bet that's a delicious lobster to
look like a lobster tail,

779
00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:53.050
didn't it?
Yeah.
Well that's what a bug is,
man.
I mean,
the lobsters are bugs.

780
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.710
There's just bugs in the water.
They can swim.

781
00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.110
They're very similar to cockroaches.
In fact,

782
00:46:59.111 --> 00:47:02.320
we found out on fear factor that if you're allergic to shellfish,

783
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:05.860
you're also allergic to cockroaches.
Oh,
for real.
We found that out the hard way.

784
00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:09.370
Oh,
Shit.
Yeah.
Somebody gets sick.
Yeah.
Well,

785
00:47:09.371 --> 00:47:12.430
we found out that this dude had eaten these,
uh,

786
00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:15.010
cockroaches and his throat started to close up.

787
00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:19.570
You start having allergic reaction.
He can't breathe.
You have to give you,

788
00:47:19.571 --> 00:47:22.330
I think it's a shot of adrenaline or something like that.
Yeah.

789
00:47:22.331 --> 00:47:23.230
If you're allergic,

790
00:47:23.231 --> 00:47:25.480
you got to tell people everything you're allergic to or you can't.

791
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:29.880
He can't hide things just to try to win $50.

792
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.700
I don't know what happened there.
Maybe.
Maybe somebody asks shellfish.
Yes.

793
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:37.820
And they didn't bother asking bugs.
Maybe they didn't know.
Yeah.

794
00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:38.890
That does live in the water.

795
00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:44.020
Is that it looks like an alien thing is crazy.

796
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:47.090
So it lives in the water and not only does it look at alien,

797
00:47:47.091 --> 00:47:49.860
it looks like a spacecraft.
Looks like an alien head look.

798
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:53.200
So really that's so ridiculous that that's a real animal.

799
00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.850
He's got gold it,
it's got gold eyes,
everything.
It's about a hamburger.

800
00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:01.810
I don't know.
No,
it's way bigger than that.
That thing was like a football,
uh,

801
00:48:01.811 --> 00:48:03.490
here.
What I did was holding an earlier,
yeah,

802
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.290
that was more football sized masterclass.

803
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.500
How unprofessional is if I run to the bathroom at all,
dude,

804
00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.980
it happens all the time.
Nobody there's expects to to hang.

805
00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:16.020
<v 7>Oh,
here we go.
The deep sea.
I suppose it's right through there.
Yeah.</v>

806
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.960
Oh my God.
Look at that thing.
And this was all right.
How would you describe her?

807
00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:26.460
And it's not quite a full Mullen,
it looks like a huge lobster tail and huge.

808
00:48:26.461 --> 00:48:29.000
So I've been soaking up pill bug,

809
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.700
remove the formalin since that's kind of nasty.

810
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:37.420
Like the biggest lobster today is size of a football shape of a drying out,

811
00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.890
get it set up to dry out and assessment out of it.
We're so weird though.

812
00:48:40.891 --> 00:48:43.820
Why would that be gross to us?
So the first thing I'm going to do,

813
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.870
why would that be gross?
We eat lobster.

814
00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.890
Like if we were at a restaurant and I ordered lobster,
would you get grossed out

815
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:51.251
<v 5>when it,
when it,</v>

816
00:48:51.251 --> 00:48:54.910
when I'm eating lobster I just went the other day and had it and it's still kind

817
00:48:54.911 --> 00:48:57.760
of freaks me out.
And like I,
it was like I had it for lunch,

818
00:48:57.761 --> 00:49:01.510
I had lobster tail for lunch and I could only eat at poppa doughs in Phoenix and

819
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:06.340
I could only eat half of it.
I just got sick almost like I,
it just hit w wrong.

820
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.580
Like I have to be in the mood after it has to be later in the day and I can't

821
00:49:09.581 --> 00:49:12.030
have any hangover then.
I just won't think about it.

822
00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.330
<v 0>Maybe you just have a weird thing with it cause I just think lobsters.
Delicious.</v>

823
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:16.590
Yeah,
I've never thought about it.

824
00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.640
And then when you see their light and hairs and up here in the head,

825
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.000
I had some shrimp cocktail the other day and uh,

826
00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:26.510
I can't imagine that anybody doesn't like it here.
Yeah.

827
00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.680
I can't imagine that people don't like shrimp cocktail.

828
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.260
But Jamie didn't want to have the shrimp cocktail.
Jamie.
He's like,
no,

829
00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:37.140
I didn't do it.
Wow.
And he's not in any water.
Bugs.

830
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:41.070
Doesn't eat the water bugs.
I'll eat street meat.
I'll eat lobster.

831
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:45.480
Look,
shrimps are delicious.
This,
there's nothing wrong with you,
Jamie.

832
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.580
You're the problem.
Not the shrimps.

833
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:53.060
Shrimps a magical creatures that tastes so good and they're one of those

834
00:49:53.131 --> 00:49:55.560
creatures where you don't feel so bad about killing them and eating them.

835
00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:58.770
You know,
very few.
Like if you,
Karl Malone shot a bear,

836
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.670
there's a photo on Tmz of Karl Malone with it

837
00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:05.020
<v 1>bear that he shot and everybody was getting upset.
Um,</v>

838
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:09.690
shot it with bow and Arrow and,
um,
you know,
that,

839
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:11.940
that freaks people out.
But if he was eating a bowl of shrimp,

840
00:50:11.941 --> 00:50:14.320
nobody would give a fuck.
I'm more weird.

841
00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:19.520
Lately I found out that was it.
Jellyfish.
No,
no,

842
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.210
no,
no octopus.

843
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.860
<v 5>Awkward pauses are almost as smart as a,
yeah.
Dolphins.
And so I'm thinking like,</v>

844
00:50:25.861 --> 00:50:28.500
Shit,
I know people that don't octopus now because of that.
And

845
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:31.600
<v 0>Love Octopus Octopus too.</v>

846
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:35.630
I think the difference between just intelligence and the fact that I think

847
00:50:35.631 --> 00:50:39.740
octopuses are most likely cunts.
Yeah.
They might be smart as fuck,

848
00:50:39.741 --> 00:50:41.270
but it's like crows are smart as fuck.

849
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:44.180
And I'll shoot one of those bitches right in there.
Dirty Cro head.

850
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:48.380
It's not just smart.
I need smart and Nice.
That's why I liked dolphins.

851
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:51.950
They're smart and nice.
That's why like Orcas,
they're smart and nice.

852
00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:54.490
<v 5>Yeah.
But that's just because dolphins are cute and octopuses are ugly.</v>

853
00:50:54.491 --> 00:50:57.460
But if you put like a hat on a dolphin or octopus in might look cute.

854
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:00.920
<v 0>It's possible.
It's just too weird.
They don't even have a skeleton.</v>

855
00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:04.460
They don't sit,
they don't roll over.
If you're so smart,
why don't they do tricks?

856
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:08.610
Yeah.
That was a Goblin shark that they found.
Um,
there were shrimping.
Yeah.

857
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.570
And they found this,
uh,
this is usually a,

858
00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:15.320
apparently they usually find these in Japan and they're very rare.

859
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:19.400
They don't find very many of them at all.
It's essentially a dinosaur fish.

860
00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.280
It's something that really probably shouldn't exist anymore.

861
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.700
It's one of those things that just hasn't quite died out yet,

862
00:51:25.701 --> 00:51:27.830
but it is old as fuck.

863
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:31.790
Harriet is so weird looking fish hair.

864
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.960
I don't think of that as heroin.
What are you talking about?

865
00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:37.860
<v 5>Hanging out with a cat?
It looks like as a bunch of cat hair all over.
I see it.</v>

866
00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:42.930
It's hard to say what that is.
I guess it is a hair.
Is that what it looks like?

867
00:51:42.931 --> 00:51:44.610
It's shrimp have hair.
That's what our lobster of hair.

868
00:51:44.611 --> 00:51:47.100
That's why it freaks me out.
Something.
When I see hair on things,

869
00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.620
it's like when is that a hair?

870
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:53.960
<v 0>Like what is that stuff?
It's not hair.
I don't know.
Lobsters don't have hair,</v>

871
00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:58.000
dude.
They have some weird sort of a fibrous under

872
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:59.410
<v 5>parts.
Yeah.</v>

873
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:02.500
It's kind of like when you catch a girl on the right sign and you never noticed.

874
00:52:02.501 --> 00:52:04.960
You had like those little whiskers and you're like,
oh,
you know,

875
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.790
it's kind of like that when you eat
the whisker slow you down.
Yes,
man.

876
00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:10.840
It really freaks me out.

877
00:52:10.841 --> 00:52:14.860
Especially then that that peach fuzz sometimes when it's too hefty,
then you,

878
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:18.520
I can't,
I can see it when it even at night.
But you get that sunny,

879
00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:22.450
see that fuzz all over your face.
Duct tape.
That shit.

880
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:27.490
Um,
I don't know man.
It just,
it freaks.
I'm like,
oh my gosh,
he's got a beard.

881
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:33.310
Guys are so picky.
That's why like Asians,
they have zero hair.
You know,

882
00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:36.070
guys are so picky when it comes to women.
Like we'll,

883
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:41.160
we'll like any little thing.
Yeah.
And chicks will fuck Donald Sterling.
Exactly.

884
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:44.290
Or we could be the difference right there.
It could be fat,

885
00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:46.810
all kinds of wrong shit going on

886
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.430
<v 0>one,
you know,
that was the most shocking thing.</v>

887
00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.300
It wasn't that an 81 year old dude was racist.
It was,
I wasn't,
you know,

888
00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.180
it was talking about that 81 year old dude is

889
00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:02.010
<v 5>how old is he?
He'll,
he might even not be,
he's at least piano.</v>

890
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:06.000
You know what I'm saying?
He's doing something weird,
telling it up.

891
00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:11.010
He's doing something weird to her and I just didn't appreciate the way she sat

892
00:53:11.011 --> 00:53:14.700
dignified in the interview with her crazy answers.
I didn't watch that.
Oh,

893
00:53:14.701 --> 00:53:17.100
you got to see me.
You don't have any desire.
I feel you.

894
00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:21.910
<v 0>I couldn't care less.
The the,
the thing is to me the,</v>

895
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:26.920
the cultural significance of it is far more than the actual people involved.

896
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:32.310
Well,
the cultural significance of what's going on now,

897
00:53:32.311 --> 00:53:34.990
I think across the board when it comes to,
uh,

898
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:40.250
people representing themselves or saying anything is that things are taken in a

899
00:53:40.621 --> 00:53:45.270
way today.
People are taking a task way quicker,

900
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:49.230
way more,
fewer way easier to transmit information,

901
00:53:49.231 --> 00:53:54.150
way easier for people to know what a person did.
It's at a different level now.

902
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:58.620
I think it's a like a cultural evolution accelerator.
That's what I think.

903
00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:00.420
I think it's situations like this,

904
00:54:00.421 --> 00:54:05.421
like to anyone who is like an objective person,

905
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.280
race is not important.
What's important is the quality of how the,

906
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:14.580
the human being interacts with you,
how they interact with other people,

907
00:54:14.581 --> 00:54:17.460
how intelligent they are,
all the things that we judge a person on.

908
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:20.220
That's what's important.
Race means zero.

909
00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.510
So anybody that's still hung up on race being the number one thing,

910
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:27.900
like he doesn't want her taking pictures with black guys like,
okay,

911
00:54:27.901 --> 00:54:29.400
what are you saying?

912
00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.790
<v 8>I just think that was more jealous than even racist at that point.</v>

913
00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:35.870
<v 0>But he,
he gave her the green light to fuck those guys.</v>

914
00:54:35.871 --> 00:54:36.710
Did you hear the same time?

915
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:40.220
<v 8>I didn't believe him when he said that.
I just,</v>

916
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:42.820
I just felt like he was just saying,
you know?
Yeah.

917
00:54:42.821 --> 00:54:47.160
But like before you were mature,
you have like,

918
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:50.160
it's like somebody having a cheat argument with their daughter.
Like,

919
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:51.480
I don't want you to do this.
Why?

920
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:56.100
But you don't tell him the real reason why you tell him a nother words.

921
00:54:56.101 --> 00:55:00.330
You escalate it.
Like every time I get into it with a girl,
like they'll,

922
00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:04.290
they'll exaggerate something else to get what they want.

923
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:08.760
And to me it's like he was exaggerating,
but bottom line was,
I don't even,

924
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:09.510
I don't,

925
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:14.510
my friends are calling me and teasing me about seeing the girl that I'm fucking

926
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.710
with black guys who are probably fucking the shit out of.

927
00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:23.300
<v 1>And that's embarrassing and that's embarrassing to me</v>

928
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:27.840
<v 8>and so do it on the low,
but don't do it at my face,</v>

929
00:55:27.841 --> 00:55:30.210
but I don't really want you to do it at all.

930
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:34.020
<v 1>Yeah,
he didn't say all those things though.
He didn't,
but that's what I got.</v>

931
00:55:34.021 --> 00:55:38.280
You can fuck them.
I don't believe.
Don't take Instagram pictures.

932
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:42.960
Think of it.
Think of the rationale of that.
It doesn't make sense.
Well,

933
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:46.860
it doesn't make sense to be 81 years old and ever get it to fuck a girl was in

934
00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:48.690
our twenties that shit doesn't make any sense.

935
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:52.560
It's just the fact that that happens.
I believe in it.
He's,
he's a male.

936
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:56.160
He's a brief on the shelf to you.

937
00:55:56.900 --> 00:56:01.080
Like that's where Brian's hoping to get to look at.
It obviously can happen.

938
00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:04.830
It can happen if there are prostitutes,
they don't.
If a guy comes in,

939
00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:07.290
he's 80 years old,
you got to fuck that guy to listen.

940
00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:12.250
<v 8>Driveline is the equivalent of a male dime piece.
He's a billionaire.
The,</v>

941
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:16.670
there's a few of them in the world.
Like if you're,
if you're,

942
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.840
if you're a chick and you can get out of billionaire,

943
00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:24.220
they fee 80 80 doesn't mean nothing.
Why

944
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.350
<v 0>does that about and that fascinating?</v>

945
00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:29.120
I guess it's just like he bought her a lot of shit.
Yeah.

946
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:32.080
Bought her a lot of Nice stuff or some shitty,

947
00:56:32.081 --> 00:56:35.230
she would never be able to get probably Bugatti.
Yeah.

948
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:39.520
Bentley Bentley and two Ferrari's,
the thing it was,
but it's like,

949
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:46.320
okay,
is that prostitution?
What does that,
how does that work?
Is it totally,

950
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:50.110
how do you know?
I mean,
maybe she really did love him.
Come on.

951
00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:53.290
Maybe she loved him because he bought her all that stuff.
Is that prostitution,

952
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:58.420
prostitution?
We,
I don't know if that is man.
I don't know if that is,

953
00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:58.651
<v 8>you know,</v>

954
00:56:58.651 --> 00:57:03.651
what else is prostitution or it's Pimpin like when a successful family,

955
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:05.933
right.

956
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:11.270
Like has a daughter and they tell her they sent her to school educator and tell

957
00:57:12.241 --> 00:57:15.780
her she has to marry a lawyer or somebody successful.

958
00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:20.250
<v 0>Mm.
That's prostitution.
It is the way,</v>

959
00:57:20.251 --> 00:57:25.251
but it's better that than not educating your daughter about the dangers of

960
00:57:26.191 --> 00:57:31.110
marrying a bitch about the dangers of macro,
like a male bit

961
00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.220
campaigns ran.
Right.
So he's like,
you know,

962
00:57:35.221 --> 00:57:37.920
can I just borrow a couple hundred bucks?
Never gets his shit together,

963
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:42.390
never gets a steady job.
And it's always other people's fall and he's,
you know,

964
00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:46.200
if you'd get a deal lawyer,
most likely he's not going to be that.

965
00:57:46.201 --> 00:57:49.080
At least you figured out his way through law schools.
You've got a degree.

966
00:57:49.081 --> 00:57:53.160
Did the tough stuff to get a doctor,
guys,
a smart guy,
you know,

967
00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:56.910
get a guy who's got a respectful position in this community.

968
00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:01.120
<v 8>It's like escort streetwalker I'd rather be an escort if I was a chick.</v>

969
00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:06.040
<v 0>Yeah.
Well it's like girls don't,
we don't require that same shit.</v>

970
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:09.460
Have you like late.
We don't require women to be anything other than Nice.

971
00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:10.690
Like you would,
you,

972
00:58:10.691 --> 00:58:13.770
would you get bummed out if you were dating a girl and you found out that she,

973
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.750
she was a uh,
uh,
like a,
a greeter at a restaurant?
No,

974
00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:22.140
<v 8>I'm single.
So that's who I normally date.</v>

975
00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:26.040
Like somebody,
I'm not making a ton of money by any chance,

976
00:58:26.041 --> 00:58:27.210
but most of the women I date,

977
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:31.830
I make more money than them and it never matters to me.

978
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:37.140
Right.
So it's going to be a waitress or greed or just,
you know,
so you know,

979
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:42.270
<v 0>it's a weird thing man,
where people,
people don't like that.</v>

980
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.610
The changing of the traditional relationships with a woman who makes more money

981
00:58:45.611 --> 00:58:50.350
and the woman has more power than the man has.
When,
when that is unbalanced,

982
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:53.770
it's uh,
it makes for a weird dynamic.
Some people can pull it off,

983
00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.590
but a lot of people can't.
Most people can't.
Most people can't.

984
00:58:56.591 --> 00:58:59.050
And they don't want to admit that.
You know,
like I,
I've,

985
00:58:59.051 --> 00:59:02.600
I've seen some people that are pulling it off and I have a friend,
he,

986
00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:06.550
he only works a little bit and his wife works a lot and he's at home with the

987
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:09.100
kids most of the time,
but they're very happy and it does work.

988
00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:12.160
So you can't say it never works,
but for the most part,

989
00:59:12.161 --> 00:59:15.100
that dude's fall apart and it's usually for the most part,

990
00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:17.290
the woman gets tired of the dude's not making any money.

991
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:19.240
That happens to be honest,

992
00:59:19.241 --> 00:59:22.100
that it depends which restaurant you're your girls greeter

993
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.260
<v 1>at.
Cause if it's like Hooters,
it's like,
Oh God,</v>

994
00:59:24.261 --> 00:59:26.510
she's not eating hot enough to be a Hooters waitress.

995
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:30.950
Maybe she didn't want to be awake.
Maybe she's hot or she's like,

996
00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:34.880
I'm too hot to be walking around carrying drinks.
I need to just be right here

997
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:40.520
with my weird fucking Tan skinned nylons.

998
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:45.920
Yoga and nylons,
yoga pants,
yoga pants.
Those things still turned me on now,

999
00:59:45.921 --> 00:59:49.740
like when a girl like a pair,
she stole from work,
you know,
a pitching stuff.

1000
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:52.430
All I think of and just not a negative thing,

1001
00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:55.430
but it's a little weird is when I see those,
I think sweaty feet,

1002
00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:01.340
those girls have sweaty feet.
They have to work in yoga pants.
Dot.

1003
01:00:01.341 --> 01:00:04.880
Not In yoga pants,
but in those Hooters wardrobes.

1004
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:07.910
Girls or got some sweaty feet.
No,
no way.

1005
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:12.530
They don't heal plastic on your feet and you're walking around,
you heat it up.

1006
01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.760
You know,
we've figured out a long time ago,
you're not supposed to do that.

1007
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:20.150
It's supposed to wear like organic fibers like cotton shit.

1008
01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:24.530
Otherwise your feet stink.
They weird out you fucking dummy.
I got athletes,

1009
01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:27.440
athletes who his feet.
Yeah,
they should be wearing wool.
Wool is,

1010
01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:29.300
it's really good for your feet if you sweat a lot.

1011
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:32.610
This whole Donald Sterling thing that has come to light.

1012
01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:35.030
I think one thing I thought of a great idea for a company,

1013
01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:38.300
if you want to invest Ya,
oh against you.
I don't want to invest in your comms.

1014
01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.980
I think it's going to be,
I think it's going to blow up.

1015
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.000
It's selling these things that what she's been wearing around,
there's like Tron,

1016
01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:48.830
like you're half punk.
It's a daft punk.
Like wow.

1017
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.100
Pfizer thing.
And I guess ever since this whole case visor,

1018
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:55.770
companies are saying that there had been song like ridiculous amounts of,

1019
01:00:55.771 --> 01:00:59.690
of these visors and it seems like that's going to be the next popular thing.

1020
01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:03.620
That's so good,
man.
Visors are a good mood.
Yeah cause it covers your whole face.

1021
01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:06.580
Let's start to have to do this right now that's like today we got to call these.

1022
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:11.090
That's not a bad move dude.
Visors.
It's do it.

1023
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.700
Have a little logo.
Right.
Wear visors.

1024
01:01:13.701 --> 01:01:16.370
Pretending that the is after him.

1025
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:20.360
That would be like the new thing like to fake like you need a visor.

1026
01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:23.310
You know like you show up at a girl's house or word advisor.

1027
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.090
She's like bitch you don't need a buyer.
Like no you don't.

1028
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.820
My last comedy central special just blew the fuck
I need.

1029
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:32.690
You know what's going to happen?

1030
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:35.690
These are going to become popular and then they're going to turn the Google

1031
01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:40.310
glass type shit so this is going to be like a full like 17 inch flat screen in

1032
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:44.960
your face.
I'm a dope idea.
That actually is a great idea and they more star wars.

1033
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:50.540
That's great.
Dan idea is fantastic.
Having one of those as a visor,

1034
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:54.050
one of those,
you just see that new thing that there were a,
Samsung was a,

1035
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:57.980
they were showing some new screen that they have that's a flexible screen.

1036
01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.970
It could roll like a ball parchment and it actually,
uh,
the,

1037
01:02:01.971 --> 01:02:05.270
the image goes around the edge like all the way around the side,

1038
01:02:05.271 --> 01:02:08.390
like say if it's that fat you see part of the image on that side as well.

1039
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:12.380
All the way up until the top.
They can have that on that.
Totally.

1040
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.760
That's exactly what the perfect thing for,
you know,
crash at the float lab.

1041
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.160
He devised a special of screen

1042
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:23.290
<v 0>is pretty fascinating stuff.
The float lab is um,</v>

1043
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:28.170
a sensory deprivation tank place in Venice.
Okay.
The Guy who runs it is this,

1044
01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.730
the super genius,

1045
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.290
crazy dude who's just obsessed with making the very best tanks since I figured

1046
01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:37.020
out how to make up a screen that when you know,

1047
01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:38.790
you know what a whole float tank is.

1048
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:41.040
The whole thing about sitting in a salt water,
do you know it all?

1049
01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:47.490
Do you understand that Michael Jackson had gone?
No,
no,
no,
no.

1050
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:52.030
As I say,
he had a hyperbaric chamber,
hyperbaric chamber,

1051
01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:55.480
which is really good for healing.
Like athletes use hyperbaric chamber,

1052
01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.740
you break a bone or something like that.
Apparently cuts down on the,

1053
01:02:59.741 --> 01:03:03.200
the healing time helps heal injuries.
Um,

1054
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.560
Uriah faber used one when he was,
he got his leg fucked up and one of his fights,

1055
01:03:07.561 --> 01:03:11.550
real bad,
bruising on his leg and he helped heal it up in there.
Um,

1056
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:15.570
but that wasn't it.
What's yours for?
It's a,
it's a sensory deprivation tank.

1057
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:17.180
You float in it and you,

1058
01:03:17.181 --> 01:03:20.050
you don't feel the water because it's the same temperature as your body and it's

1059
01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:24.030
a thousand pounds of salt in the water.
So you lie down,

1060
01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:27.640
you just float like the Dead Sea.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
It's great.
You like,

1061
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.920
you trip out in there,
you have these weird imagery,
visual things.

1062
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:33.360
You don't see anything,
you don't hear anything.

1063
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:36.090
So as you get more relaxed when you're in the tank,

1064
01:03:36.091 --> 01:03:38.370
you start to have these weird hallucinations,

1065
01:03:38.371 --> 01:03:41.220
selfies and occasionally,

1066
01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:46.410
um,
but that's,
uh,
why did I bring that up?
Oh,

1067
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.930
that's not the sensory deprivation tank.
He,

1068
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:53.790
he came up with this screen that hovers just inches in front of your face and

1069
01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:58.230
it's such a low amount of light that's emitted by the screen that you don't see

1070
01:03:58.231 --> 01:04:02.550
the actual screen itself.
You just see the image.
So because the tank is so dark,

1071
01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:04.080
there's no light in there at all.

1072
01:04:04.081 --> 01:04:07.980
You pull the lid shut and it's complete darkness.
You Open your eyes,

1073
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:11.340
you close your eyes,
it looks exactly the same to you.
This screen,

1074
01:04:11.341 --> 01:04:15.540
which is hovering in front of you,
you absorb only the image.

1075
01:04:15.541 --> 01:04:20.541
So it's like the image is floating in the sky above your face and you can watch

1076
01:04:20.701 --> 01:04:24.180
things like documentaries or like,
like a,

1077
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:29.040
like a how to thing like a golf and squash and all or something like that.
Yeah,

1078
01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:31.200
and because you're floating,
you're at,

1079
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:35.610
you have way less distractions.
You have way more resources.

1080
01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:38.910
Your mind has more resources to apply to learning something.

1081
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:43.320
It's like if you were trying to learn something really intense,
like it was hard,

1082
01:04:43.321 --> 01:04:45.390
but some people were arguing right next to it,

1083
01:04:45.391 --> 01:04:47.940
you'd have to get the fuck away from them because you wouldn't be able to pay

1084
01:04:47.941 --> 01:04:49.110
attention to whatever you're reading.

1085
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:53.670
While the idea is that just your whole body just sitting down,

1086
01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:57.960
just your ass touching this chair is all information that you are getting to

1087
01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:00.960
deal with in your brain.
You have to constantly manage it.

1088
01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:04.950
You're constantly so your resources are spent managing distance and touching

1089
01:05:04.951 --> 01:05:08.880
things and you know how your body feels and what you ate today and all that
jazz.

1090
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:11.850
When you were in the tank,
there's nothing.
Nothing.

1091
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:14.970
As long as you go to the bathroom before you go in there,

1092
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.800
once you relax and float,
you just floating.

1093
01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.880
How long are you staying in there for the minimum?
I go in there.

1094
01:05:21.881 --> 01:05:24.730
It's usually an hour the most.
I go in there,
it's like two hours.

1095
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.720
I've done longer,
but I think two hours is the right amount.
You can get printing.

1096
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.840
No,
no,
cause it's salt.
Yeah.
You don't get pruney at all.
Weird.

1097
01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:34.450
It's totally different.
I've got to get one of those at the crib,

1098
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.730
get one at the crib,

1099
01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.920
<v 5>get a crip first.
But as soon as I put this light,</v>

1100
01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:42.420
<v 0>you're floating above your head.</v>

1101
01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:46.420
Makes me think that that's exactly what could these things could be like,

1102
01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.600
like you could just lie back and watch a movie like fuck having a big giant

1103
01:05:49.601 --> 01:05:53.170
screen.
You lie back in the movies like Oculus rift style,

1104
01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:55.390
like completely enveloping your face.

1105
01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:55.940
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1106
01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:59.030
And you got to get like text notifications on the side and so big would be like

1107
01:05:59.031 --> 01:06:03.380
an imax screen and it's lightweight too because you could probably make it

1108
01:06:03.381 --> 01:06:05.570
pretty lightweight and just have it on the little band.

1109
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:09.880
Imagine if he did that and they found out that it enhances your vision because

1110
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:12.140
you're constantly looking at these things right in front of you and your,

1111
01:06:12.141 --> 01:06:16.160
your vision becomes super powerful.
Or Zoom in on your hand,

1112
01:06:16.161 --> 01:06:19.070
like pinch to zoom on your hand and you actually can folk like zoom,

1113
01:06:19.071 --> 01:06:20.900
you're on visiting,
like have a camera in the front.

1114
01:06:20.901 --> 01:06:23.260
So it's like actually recording like Google glass,

1115
01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:27.500
everything and just adding to it.
So then you could zoom in and your own vision.

1116
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.890
<v 0>Well,
if that's going to be the case,
then your interface,</v>

1117
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.940
like what you're gonna be able to do,

1118
01:06:30.941 --> 01:06:34.600
you're gonna be able to do it like minority report style in the air,

1119
01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:39.160
in front of your Lens.
Absolutely.
And because it's your hand like you're,
you'll,

1120
01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:41.170
you'll,
you'll be able to recognize your hand the same way,

1121
01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:44.440
like your fingerprints get recognized by an iPhone,
that kind of same shit.

1122
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:46.090
I bet you'll be able to just start

1123
01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.080
<v 5>pinching reality in front of you.</v>

1124
01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:51.950
And since everyone's going to be having these on all the time,
well one,

1125
01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:54.150
the Paparazzi,
he's never going to take your photo by also,

1126
01:06:54.151 --> 01:06:57.210
your face is going to be like the next tip because you never see the face

1127
01:06:57.211 --> 01:07:00.000
anymore.
So when a girl takes off her offer match and you're like,
oh my God,

1128
01:07:00.001 --> 01:07:04.740
I wanna fuck that.
Employees need to stop talking.
Just stop talking today.

1129
01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:07.080
I'm not even thinking before you saying shit

1130
01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.850
covered,
like you know something up.

1131
01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.710
<v 0>It's not that,
it's just the way you say it.</v>

1132
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:22.800
It hurts people's brains and always leads to pussy blow jobs going to go up.

1133
01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:26.280
It's not,
it's just retarded.
It's ridiculous.

1134
01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:29.630
I think it's possible that we could you have a use for that thing though?
Yeah,

1135
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.020
that totally makes sense that you would be able to use it as a Jew,

1136
01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.190
a big giant screen.
Just pull things in front of you.
Like you said,

1137
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.590
you could like be looking at something at a distance.
Oh I see.
Fire.
What is that?

1138
01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:45.360
Zoom in on it and press Google and it'll fucking get her direct coordination of

1139
01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:48.150
where you are and how far away that is and what that is.

1140
01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.770
They already have range finders.

1141
01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:52.010
They have these things that are these laser range finders,

1142
01:07:52.011 --> 01:07:55.560
so you get pointed at something and it'll tell you exactly how far it is to the

1143
01:07:55.561 --> 01:08:00.360
foot,
which is bananas.
It's crazy.
21 yards.
Like what?

1144
01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.560
Like you could tell exactly how far that thing is.
So if that's the case,

1145
01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:08.490
they're going to be able to incorporate that sort of technology with GPS

1146
01:08:08.491 --> 01:08:11.610
technology.
What's going to really realize where you are,

1147
01:08:11.611 --> 01:08:12.780
where it picks up your signal.

1148
01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.210
Realize the range at which you're looking at something,
factor it in,

1149
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:22.250
zoom in on that location.
Oh,
that fire is coming from the city of Blah,

1150
01:08:22.251 --> 01:08:25.280
blah blah.
And there they had an explosion of the factory.

1151
01:08:25.281 --> 01:08:27.280
You'll be able to watch the Google News Beep,

1152
01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:30.860
the oppressive button in front of your face and it'll play you a video.

1153
01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:33.620
That's the news of all the things that are happening in front of you.

1154
01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.600
<v 1>This makes me one of the,
where the fuck have I been?
Am I in this world?</v>

1155
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:40.300
It's coming,
man is going on.
We've got range finders.

1156
01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:44.590
<v 0>All that.
Oh yeah.
Range finders are important for hunting.
Oh,
okay.</v>

1157
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:47.170
Especially archery when they,
uh,

1158
01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:51.310
like you have to figure out where the thing is,
like how far away it is.

1159
01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:55.600
Cause you're like a bullet shoot straight as an arrow for like a hundred yards.

1160
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:59.410
But an Arrow has more of a dip to it.
Write an Arrow,
doesn't,

1161
01:08:59.411 --> 01:09:01.570
it doesn't have as much power as a gun obviously.

1162
01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:05.690
So like you have to calculate how far the Arrow like dips,
right?

1163
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:09.970
Figure out where it's gonna land.
Here's a trick question.
Sounds crazy.

1164
01:09:09.971 --> 01:09:14.971
But if you take a gun in one hand and a bullet and the other hand and you pull

1165
01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:20.890
the trigger at the same time,
exactly as you drop the bullet,

1166
01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.320
which one hits the ground first
shot the one from the gun?

1167
01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:26.430
It's a trick question.

1168
01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:31.680
They hit exactly same time because gravity is the same for both the bullet and

1169
01:09:31.681 --> 01:09:36.681
for the bolt that you dropped because the bullet is going to go straight for a

1170
01:09:36.991 --> 01:09:41.040
long,
a long time,
but it's going to still drop.
It's still gonna drop.

1171
01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:45.090
Whereas the boat that you're holding is going to drop right in front of you.

1172
01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:47.070
It's good that you're gonna hold it.
You're going to let it go.

1173
01:09:47.071 --> 01:09:48.000
It'll drop right there.

1174
01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:52.110
This bull is going to go like seven miles and then drop in the same amount of

1175
01:09:52.111 --> 01:09:53.820
time.
That's the difference.

1176
01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:57.240
The difference is not the amount of time that it takes.

1177
01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.410
It's not that amount of time that it takes for the bullet to hit the ground is

1178
01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:01.141
exactly the same.

1179
01:10:01.141 --> 01:10:04.170
It's just the distance that the bullet that you shoot we'll go will be the

1180
01:10:04.171 --> 01:10:05.004
difference.

1181
01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.970
<v 1>Isn't that crazy?
Unless you shoot straight up in here,</v>

1182
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.240
why are you making a face dummy?

1183
01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.290
And then there's a calculation if you shoot straight up in the air and it wasn't

1184
01:10:13.291 --> 01:10:16.360
me.
That's an issue.
That's cheap.
That was on my face.
You have to be parallel.

1185
01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:21.310
He's making it only makes sense.
Yeah.
If,
if it's parallel,
right?

1186
01:10:21.311 --> 01:10:23.590
Like you can't spare a little bit.
Exactly.
Exactly.

1187
01:10:23.591 --> 01:10:25.660
That is the look of skepticism right there.
Well,

1188
01:10:25.661 --> 01:10:29.250
it makes sense if you stop and think about it.
I mean think the graph,

1189
01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:33.760
it doesn't defy gravity.
It just defies gravity while it flies straight.

1190
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:35.860
I mean it's just,
it's flying straight.

1191
01:10:35.861 --> 01:10:39.430
So there's some defiance of gravity there,

1192
01:10:39.431 --> 01:10:43.360
but the amount of time that it flies straight is exactly the same as the amount

1193
01:10:43.361 --> 01:10:48.250
of time.
If you just drop a bullet,
this one's got force,
this one does it,
Jamie,

1194
01:10:48.251 --> 01:10:52.130
you know there's no microphone on you.
So the bull you're shooting has forced.

1195
01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.640
Exactly.
It doesn't though.
Yeah.
But it's still,

1196
01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:57.190
it's going to drop in the same amount of time as long as it's,

1197
01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:58.750
as long as it's going straight.
Yeah.

1198
01:10:58.751 --> 01:11:02.800
The only thing I was thinking that there is an explosion so they did it so the

1199
01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:06.440
explosion doesn't like,
I don't know,
like it doesn't,

1200
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:10.960
you would think right drop the same time they did it on this show radio lab.

1201
01:11:10.961 --> 01:11:14.430
They were explaining it and apparently it's

1202
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:18.630
<v 5>a trick question.
They're still using radios.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Do Radio lab is awesome.</v>

1203
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:21.743
I think it's probably,

1204
01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.060
<v 0>I believe there's probably a website that you can go,
okay let's,</v>

1205
01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.480
if you drop a bullet,
drop a bullet or shoot a bullet,

1206
01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.190
which one hits the ground first?

1207
01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:36.130
<v 5>It makes sense if you think about it though,
right?
I see what you're saying but,</v>

1208
01:11:36.131 --> 01:11:37.890
but if it's being pushed out,

1209
01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:41.850
it seems like the drop wouldn't happen the same time as the bullet drop.

1210
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.560
<v 0>Mythbusters did a thing on it.</v>

1211
01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:49.050
<v 5>Did anyone ever find out if that mythbusters photo of that dude naked,</v>

1212
01:11:49.051 --> 01:11:53.160
was that real or fake?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The bald guy.
Crazy.

1213
01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:53.671
My stats.

1214
01:11:53.671 --> 01:11:56.850
There's like a picture of him like naked that was really popular like five years

1215
01:11:56.851 --> 01:11:59.970
ago.
Like true while he's getting fucked in the butt or something.

1216
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.833
Well that's not nice.

1217
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.090
<v 0>Um,
come on.</v>

1218
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:12.720
<v 5>Do you still work on the boondocks seen?
Nah,
I only did the first season.</v>

1219
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:16.190
It's such a good show.
Do you still watch it?
Do you like it?
Uh,
it wasn't odd.

1220
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.100
It just started coming back on and,
uh,
I don't have a TV right now.
Yeah.

1221
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:24.660
I'll people to watch it.
Sorry.
No.
What are you going to do about all that?

1222
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:25.910
Have you even thought about it yet?

1223
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.950
I'd have to like move back into my house that I just moved out of.

1224
01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.170
That would be the crazy,
my neighbors would be looking at me like,

1225
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:34.230
what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
It's all your stuff in storage right now.

1226
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.980
Some of it will just take a blanket and a pillow in it.
A laptop.

1227
01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.030
<v 0>Okay.
The other,
the other factor,
apparently the earth curve of the earth.</v>

1228
01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.430
It seems that this is what they're saying though.

1229
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:50.660
It seems that they're saying that they land at the same time and it might even

1230
01:12:50.661 --> 01:12:53.780
be that the bowl that you drop lands quicker or the,
uh,

1231
01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.640
the bill that you shoot lands.
Corker.
Did you got Siri?

1232
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:04.370
No ass serious.
See what she says?
Who says just Google it for you.
She won't,

1233
01:13:04.371 --> 01:13:04.730
she won't

1234
01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:06.920
<v 5>really answered something like that will fall first.</v>

1235
01:13:06.921 --> 01:13:11.150
A gun shot bullet or bullet drop off from hand.

1236
01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.300
This is what series is gonna say.
Oh my God,
you're retarded.

1237
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:16.423
What the fuck?

1238
01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:18.310
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1239
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:19.960
<v 0>Okay.
I found this on the web.</v>

1240
01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.430
<v 5>Uh,
it says,</v>

1241
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:29.290
<v 0>oh,
okay.
If you shoot a bullet fast enough in the horizontal direction,</v>

1242
01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.110
you can get it to orbit around the earth.

1243
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:36.560
<v 5>Yeah,
yeah.
This is this.
They will hit the grant the same time he told me</v>

1244
01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.260
<v 0>insane the,
yeah,
that's what they're saying.</v>

1245
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:42.130
It would have to be some insane kind of gun.
Well,

1246
01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:45.230
you can conceivably shoot something that's so powerful.

1247
01:13:45.231 --> 01:13:47.990
You can get a bullet in orbit if you shoot at the horizon.

1248
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.410
If you ignore air resistance,

1249
01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:57.280
I guess maybe or or defeated just with sheer force an aiming in the right

1250
01:13:58.161 --> 01:14:00.550
direction,
but because of the curvature of the earth.
See,

1251
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:04.400
I guess it just makes sense that the bullet would have hit the ground.

1252
01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:06.830
Like really is just dropping.

1253
01:14:06.831 --> 01:14:09.860
Like that is the whole idea of grabbing the first place that the spin is what's

1254
01:14:09.861 --> 01:14:12.010
causing everything to pull.
So the spin

1255
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.090
<v 1>would have to be factored in.</v>

1256
01:14:13.091 --> 01:14:16.330
Like when the bullet drops and the earth is spinning because it's been,

1257
01:14:16.331 --> 01:14:18.670
we're spinning a thousand miles an hour,
you know,

1258
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.530
and it's just weird curvature to things.

1259
01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.790
The whole idea just freaks me out that were floating,
you know,

1260
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:29.980
just the fact that this planet is just a float in the middle of some space.
Yeah,

1261
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:30.940
it's a freak out.

1262
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.910
It's a freak out that you don't like to engage in because it's too,

1263
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.160
and we just accepted.
Yeah,

1264
01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:40.180
so bananas that you are forced to watch reality shows just to cleanse your

1265
01:14:40.181 --> 01:14:42.970
palate of any weirdness.

1266
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:47.230
I guess it be like if you were jumping from like two buildings,
two buildings,

1267
01:14:47.231 --> 01:14:48.340
exactly the same.

1268
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.920
If you were to just jumps or false straight from one building,
you would fall.

1269
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:58.540
But if you were to jump up cheating even saying because the bullet doesn't go up

1270
01:14:58.830 --> 01:15:01.840
to bay view viewers somehow just,
yeah,
you can't do it.

1271
01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.280
Your mind to

1272
01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.330
think these things through.

1273
01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:12.370
The people who are listening to this is people on the other end and they have a

1274
01:15:12.371 --> 01:15:15.070
life that they have a mind of their own and they don't want your,

1275
01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.890
your thoughts bouncing around inside their fucking head.
They give,

1276
01:15:17.891 --> 01:15:20.350
you were jumping from building to building,
you'd be going up like,
yeah,

1277
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.950
it'd be like shooting a gun up and exactly.
So yes.
Yes.

1278
01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.860
That's a good way of describing shooting,
shooting a gun straight.

1279
01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:31.120
Still be falling.
It's same way.
Yeah.
It's weird.

1280
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.600
Especially with the curvature of the earth.
Apparently that's what it is.

1281
01:15:34.601 --> 01:15:37.270
It's going really fast,
really far,
really quickly,

1282
01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:40.360
but it still falls to the exact amount of time when those fucking nuts.

1283
01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:43.660
When does the bullet that you shoot stuff falling and when it gets to its

1284
01:15:43.661 --> 01:15:44.230
distance?

1285
01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:49.230
Well it's going straight but it's going super fucking fast and the earth is

1286
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:54.661
curved so apparently it drops like exactly like as if you were dropping the

1287
01:15:56.681 --> 01:15:58.720
bullets.
So if you drop the boat or you shot the bullet,

1288
01:15:58.990 --> 01:16:03.990
this one's going really far but at the same distance or the same amount of time,

1289
01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:05.740
rather they both hit the ground.

1290
01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.160
It seems like a mind fuck and a half,
but if you've ever shot a bullet,

1291
01:16:11.161 --> 01:16:14.760
you realize how quickly it hits the ground.
They hit the ground really quick,

1292
01:16:14.761 --> 01:16:17.340
like you should a bullet and then they just,
they're on the ground.

1293
01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:22.310
Like things go flying.
I mean,
we don't think about it.
Right.

1294
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:25.110
Because we assume that it just keeps going for a long,
long time.

1295
01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:28.260
Probably about an hour or so.
What's,
my bullets aren't usually hitting something,

1296
01:16:28.261 --> 01:16:32.610
so
I don't even think about,
you know,
they just fired them off.

1297
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:38.670
You figure that gone.
That thing's probably still flying.
Yeah.
Meanwhile it's not,

1298
01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:41.490
I mean,
well it's already on the ground,
like just as quickly as if you drop it.

1299
01:16:41.491 --> 01:16:45.000
How about you drop a bullet and the bullet that you fire

1300
01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:49.570
into somebody hits the per ground at the same time.

1301
01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:54.790
The body of the person who shot it's the ground to St dies of bullet.

1302
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:58.480
You dropped.
No,
I don't think that's related.
That's okay.
Just checking.

1303
01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:02.830
That wouldn't be related.
All right.
That's a different experience.
That's a hole.

1304
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:06.130
The gravity itself is a rear real mind fuck.

1305
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:09.620
And the idea that somehow or another it applies to these planets

1306
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:14.450
<v 0>and it has something to do with mass and has something to do with the spin and</v>

1307
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:18.140
that these things can even be applied to some asteroids.

1308
01:17:18.141 --> 01:17:21.830
Some asteroids have gravity,
there's asteroids that are so big,
they have gravity,

1309
01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.320
and then there's,
there's things that,

1310
01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:28.430
there's a whole belt of shit that somehow or another tied together and all

1311
01:17:28.431 --> 01:17:29.540
floating around,

1312
01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.840
and sometimes this causes them to have bands around planets where you just look

1313
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:39.050
out and you can actually see it with a telescope and all that shit is just rocks

1314
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:42.440
spinning around outside of giant gas,

1315
01:17:42.441 --> 01:17:47.150
giant bubble planet fucking thing.
Like,
whoa.

1316
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:51.590
The whole idea of planets and solar systems,
it's just too much,
man.

1317
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.650
It's too much to wrap your head around that.

1318
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:58.610
Anything that we think is significant,
everything you just said makes me think,

1319
01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:03.520
what the fuck are we doing every day?
Oh,
this shit is going took,

1320
01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.150
oh,
that's paying student loans based to the fighting traffic,

1321
01:18:08.151 --> 01:18:11.660
trying to get the new iPhone.
Fuck all this space.
Shit.
I need a bigger screen.

1322
01:18:11.661 --> 01:18:13.970
This is Bull Shit,
eh?
Yeah.

1323
01:18:13.971 --> 01:18:17.720
Everyone's fighting traffic and meanwhile we're spinning in space.

1324
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:22.700
This this lady was telling me today about the rents and Santa Monica just about

1325
01:18:22.701 --> 01:18:25.400
how brutal it is.
Just couldn't get a place in Santa Monica.
She was,

1326
01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:29.570
she was driving from work all the way to Hollywood where she can afford a place

1327
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:35.150
that just the idea of being stuck an hour and 45 minutes just trying to get to

1328
01:18:35.151 --> 01:18:39.740
your house,
which is less than 10 miles away.
That's so crazy.

1329
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:43.400
Yeah,
it's so crazy,
Jesus.
It's insane.

1330
01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.320
A lot of stuff in La is not that far,

1331
01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:48.830
but it does take a monumental amount of time to get there.

1332
01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:53.860
The fact that this is all going on while we're in space lead the great beyond.

1333
01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:59.270
I mean what it's one of the most ironic things ever is that we're running out of

1334
01:18:59.271 --> 01:19:04.010
space while we're flying through infinity and nobody cares.
I mean,

1335
01:19:04.011 --> 01:19:07.700
that is what real estate prices going up is you're running out of space,

1336
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:09.620
so the space becomes very valuable.

1337
01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:13.400
That's why it's really valuable to have a home on the beach.
There's not much,

1338
01:19:13.401 --> 01:19:16.520
it's a very finite amount of space.
You want a house right by the beach?

1339
01:19:16.521 --> 01:19:18.810
Listen Buddy,
you've got to paint,
paint,
paint,
paint.

1340
01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.710
You want a front seat to the tsunami?
Yeah,
I got to pay.

1341
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:24.650
It's quite ironic isn't it?

1342
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.970
That at the same time we're running out of space while we're flying through

1343
01:19:28.971 --> 01:19:32.480
infinity.
That is there is one of the most ironic things about the human race.

1344
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:36.020
That's a clear sign of how crazy we are.
I get it.

1345
01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:38.630
There's certain places that have more resources.
I get it.

1346
01:19:38.631 --> 01:19:41.510
There's certain places that have better climates.
I get it.

1347
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:45.530
California is a good place.
People figured it out.
It's a good spot to stop.

1348
01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:49.730
Not a lot of rain.
Sunny is shit.
People look good.

1349
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.790
They were very little close because it's hot all the time.

1350
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:56.990
It's a good place to get your freak on.
Bam,
I'm staying,
you know,
fuck,

1351
01:19:56.991 --> 01:20:00.770
fuck the rent or fuck the commute and that there.
They charge you for it.
Yup.

1352
01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:02.000
You gotta pay for it.
Yeah.

1353
01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:05.660
It's just so ironic that all this is going on to distract the shit out of us

1354
01:20:05.661 --> 01:20:10.070
while were hurling through infinity and we have no idea what this is all about.

1355
01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.840
<v 8>I will never beat up a nerd again.</v>

1356
01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:18.670
<v 1>They're important.
They're important,
and they into interesting stuff.</v>

1357
01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:20.650
They're going to do the hard work,
man.
You're not going to do it.

1358
01:20:20.651 --> 01:20:22.510
I'm not going to do it.
You can do it.
He ain't going to do it.

1359
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:24.940
What the fuck's going to do it without?

1360
01:20:24.970 --> 01:20:27.040
Without someone out there doing the hard work.
We're doomed.

1361
01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.900
Then we're believing in fire guys and sacrifice our paper.

1362
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:33.250
Fucking snakes with feathers.
This lady,

1363
01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:37.900
this lady did my astrology chart the other day.
Oh Shit.

1364
01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:41.800
They call it these days.
Well here's the crazy,
so

1365
01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:46.970
<v 8>going to get a studio apartment in Hollywood so the lady doesn't do a credit</v>

1366
01:20:46.971 --> 01:20:50.750
check.
She does your charts.
That's your credit check.

1367
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.110
<v 1>So then she was telling me my get the fuck out.
I swear to go away.</v>

1368
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:57.450
Given that lady at nickel

1369
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:04.470
price apartment,
I should have taken it in retrospect.
Yeah.

1370
01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:08.430
I can't live here too crazy.
So what happened once you did your charts?

1371
01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:13.090
<v 8>The first time I've like,
I've never been to a psychic or no shit like that.
So,</v>

1372
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:16.600
and then she wanted to know my time.
I gave him a date of birth,

1373
01:21:16.601 --> 01:21:18.670
but she wanted to know the time.
I was like,

1374
01:21:18.671 --> 01:21:21.520
I don't know the time when I was born.
So I kind of,

1375
01:21:21.521 --> 01:21:24.250
she just kind of dessert.

1376
01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:29.080
There's maybe three types of times and she just gave me one and there was some

1377
01:21:29.081 --> 01:21:33.460
things she would start talking about.
Your Jupiter is lined up with your anus.

1378
01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:37.430
<v 1>This is a good time.
And it sounds funny,
but that's exactly what she said.</v>

1379
01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:38.793
But then she was,

1380
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:43.750
<v 8>there was some things she was kind of accurate about,
says you had a,</v>

1381
01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:49.020
you got a job and so on and so that paid decent amount of money,

1382
01:21:49.151 --> 01:21:52.510
blah blah,
blah,
blah.
So I was like,
oh,
okay.
She's,
she was in the,

1383
01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:54.220
it wasn't far off.

1384
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:58.190
<v 0>Yeah,
but that's,
they just ask you questions and they,</v>

1385
01:21:58.191 --> 01:22:03.191
they start fucking figuring your personality out and then they plot and think

1386
01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:07.020
about,
oh,
this card means this is the joker.
And so you might be a comedian.

1387
01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.480
Come on man.
I mean it's all nonsense.

1388
01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:12.180
All of it's nonsense.

1389
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:17.130
<v 1>She could've googled.
There's something,
there is nothing about science,
right,</v>

1390
01:22:17.131 --> 01:22:17.964
right

1391
01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:22.660
<v 0>to astrology.
Don't get me wrong,
nobody get me wrong.</v>

1392
01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:26.770
I think there is something to it.
I think they'd been doing it for a long,
long,

1393
01:22:26.771 --> 01:22:31.771
long fucking time for a reason and I think that there's probably some sort of an

1394
01:22:31.901 --> 01:22:36.901
effect that the gravity of other planets and the way the lines has on a person,

1395
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:42.100
some sort of an effect.
I don't know how much of it is real though.

1396
01:22:42.101 --> 01:22:44.260
The idea that they could tell your future.

1397
01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:49.150
<v 8>That's the thing that was blowing my mind that she could say she could chart</v>

1398
01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:52.450
chart me as an individual.
I was like,

1399
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:57.280
I don't know if it's a feeling like I don't think I'm that important enough

1400
01:22:57.281 --> 01:23:02.281
where you could like put my date and the time and then check when the moon hits

1401
01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:05.500
wouldn't even,

1402
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.010
<v 0>the problem</v>

1403
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.340
<v 8>I'm having with it,
the big problem is she doesn't even know when you were born.</v>

1404
01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.840
That was the post to me.
Yeah,

1405
01:23:10.841 --> 01:23:13.430
but that's supposed to make a big difference is the most,

1406
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.250
the time in which you're born.
And I do all of it.

1407
01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:20.920
I didn't care enough to like go get it for like,
I could ask my mother,
but I,

1408
01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:25.250
you know,
I was skeptical but she was,
yeah,
she is.
She had a few things.
Right.

1409
01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:30.190
I don't know how much of it was assessed experience of good guessing or you

1410
01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:30.580
know,

1411
01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:34.000
<v 0>most of it's that dude you ever taught here.
Pendula talk about that,</v>

1412
01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:35.430
how they do those things.
No,

1413
01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:40.450
he's pretty enlightening when it comes to a all sorts of scams and confidence

1414
01:23:40.451 --> 01:23:42.220
games and how they can make,

1415
01:23:42.221 --> 01:23:47.221
get you to believe that you know that you're a not revealing anything,

1416
01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:50.620
but they're leading you in certain ways.
And for the average person,

1417
01:23:50.621 --> 01:23:53.530
they're pretty effective.
There's a bunch of effective techniques where they,

1418
01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:57.940
I see your,
there's a woman in your past.
There's a,

1419
01:23:58.090 --> 01:24:02.940
my grandmother is she,
I'm not sure how old she was.
My Mom,

1420
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:05.740
my grandmother died when she was 50 yes.

1421
01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.200
And there's something,

1422
01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:13.240
something she didn't get to do.
Well,
she always wanted to be a dancer.

1423
01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:16.480
This is amazing.
This is amazing.
They just fucking,

1424
01:24:16.481 --> 01:24:20.940
they just started doing and leading you and you talk along with them.
And I'm,

1425
01:24:20.941 --> 01:24:24.550
I'm,
I cannot help me out.
There's an Ar,
is there an are somewhere?
Oh my God,

1426
01:24:24.551 --> 01:24:26.380
her name was Regina.
That's amazing.

1427
01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:31.600
They start doing shit like that and it's just,
people find a reason for that are,

1428
01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:34.810
um,
do you Virginia Yell?
Yes.
That's it.
Five years.

1429
01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:38.170
And for that they find a place for it.
They just look for a place for it.

1430
01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:41.770
<v 8>You know what that's like?
That's like a,
so there was this detective,</v>

1431
01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.120
he quit the force,

1432
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:48.510
but he realized he put this chicken jail based on interrogating her years ago.

1433
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:54.790
Like when he went back and listened to the tapes,
like there was a,

1434
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:59.740
I think it was a robbery and a,
or maybe a murder,

1435
01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:04.270
but he interviewed her and interrogated her for a long time.

1436
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:07.060
And then she kind of confessed to it at the end,

1437
01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:11.140
but she admitted some stuff or gave them evidence along the lines.

1438
01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:16.100
Like they were like,
you had Chinese food.
Right?
And she's like,
yeah,

1439
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:17.080
Chinese food.

1440
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:22.500
And then she told him he but he didn't know or realize that he showed her the

1441
01:25:22.631 --> 01:25:23.464
receipt.

1442
01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.590
So when she mentioned eaten orange chicken or whatever it was on the receipt,

1443
01:25:26.591 --> 01:25:29.800
he thought,
okay,
I got her,
she is involved in this like,

1444
01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:34.360
and there was just a lot of stuff where over the course of hours of

1445
01:25:34.361 --> 01:25:39.250
interrogation the cop gives you a lot of stuff and it becomes your fact and you

1446
01:25:39.251 --> 01:25:44.251
start saying it back and then you think you got her but you gave them all this

1447
01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:46.894
info.

1448
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:48.630
<v 0>I'll go you one crazy [inaudible].</v>

1449
01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.880
They actually use that in India to convict a woman of murder based on the

1450
01:25:54.071 --> 01:25:58.090
results of a brain scan.
What?
Yup.
It's called Fmr.

1451
01:25:58.091 --> 01:26:03.091
I and F MRI is a functional magnetic imagery,

1452
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:05.930
whatever it Mris.

1453
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:10.990
But the idea is that they can detect certain aspects of your mind or certain

1454
01:26:11.961 --> 01:26:16.670
aspects of your thinking and one of them is knowledge of a subject.

1455
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.950
So say if they showed you a photo of the crime scene and then you reacted in a

1456
01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:25.790
certain way that certain way would indicate knowledge of a crime scene.

1457
01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:27.800
But here's the problem.

1458
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.020
We don't know if that knowledge of the crime scene was put into your head during

1459
01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:36.830
the interrogation,
right?
Just putting your head during the,
um,

1460
01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.270
the media discussing,
finding out,
like if you're being charged with murder,

1461
01:26:41.271 --> 01:26:44.290
let's say murder.
You're going to fucking read everything.
Like,
Holy Shit.

1462
01:26:44.291 --> 01:26:47.240
If you're innocent,
let's,
let's pretend.
I mean,
for the sake of let's,

1463
01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:50.540
this is a totally new scenario,
is,
gentleman,
forget about this case in India.

1464
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:51.740
I have no attachment to it.

1465
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:55.250
I don't know the actual s whether it's someone was guilty or not guilty.

1466
01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:58.460
I don't know.
I just know that Fmr,
I was used to come up with a conviction.

1467
01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:02.240
If you were not guilty,
but they thought you were,

1468
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:04.880
they're going to talk to you for a long fuck,
and you're going to be like,

1469
01:27:04.881 --> 01:27:08.270
what is this place like it happened in the kitchen.
What fucking kitchen?

1470
01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:10.520
They'll show you a picture.
Have you ever seen this kitchen?
You're like,

1471
01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:12.530
I have fucking never seen that kitchen.

1472
01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:16.580
And then later they give you the FM Ri and they ask you about the kitchen.
Oh,

1473
01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:20.600
he has knowledge of the kitchen.
It is possible that,

1474
01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:22.820
so this is not an exact science.

1475
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:27.230
It is possible that you can somehow under the give someone a memory and they can

1476
01:27:27.231 --> 01:27:30.740
accept it as their own.
You can actually read it on a,
on a machine.

1477
01:27:31.150 --> 01:27:34.750
<v 5>And that's what happens in law.
Whether they use the,
the,
the what's,</v>

1478
01:27:35.010 --> 01:27:37.680
what's the name of the machine?
F Mrr.
Fmr.

1479
01:27:37.810 --> 01:27:42.080
I'm just shocked that India even has that technology like this,

1480
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:46.250
the place that has water,
doesn't have water running water in most places will,

1481
01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.370
it has a lot of fucking people,
man,

1482
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:54.000
fucking people in India and they're wasting time on a convicting somebody with

1483
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:57.760
like a mind scan and he has a lot of high level technology to man.

1484
01:27:57.761 --> 01:27:59.920
Why do you think when you make tech calls

1485
01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.460
<v 0>in India,
you know,
there's a lot of people over there.
It's just,</v>

1486
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:07.000
it's a completely different sort of an environment and having a billion people

1487
01:28:07.001 --> 01:28:07.960
and your planet and they have,

1488
01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:13.020
<v 5>yeah,
yeah.
I've got to defend themselves against Pakistan.</v>

1489
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:15.340
<v 0>They do both at that beef.</v>

1490
01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.140
They hate each other and they're right there looking at each other.
Tada.

1491
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:20.960
Waiting for one old dude.

1492
01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:27.530
<v 5>They're going out.
I think that's fucked up that day.
So she,</v>

1493
01:28:27.531 --> 01:28:29.990
she's in jail or whatever their version of prisoners

1494
01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.840
<v 0>allegedly.
I mean,
who knows?
I mean,
she might've been a murderer.
I don't know.</v>

1495
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:34.591
I don't know what happened.

1496
01:28:34.591 --> 01:28:39.120
I just know that the idea of being able to read functional memory,
my,

1497
01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.880
I'm completely ignorant about the science behind it.

1498
01:28:41.881 --> 01:28:45.360
So when I talk to people that were scientists,
they said it's very dangerous.

1499
01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:48.180
<v 5>It's very dangerous.
Not It's minority report.
Ish.</v>

1500
01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:52.120
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
not only that,
it's not ready.
It was like,
this is not indicative.</v>

1501
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:57.190
It's like one thing.
If say,
if I could read your mind and you could say,
uh,

1502
01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:58.660
Ian,
we show me your bathroom please,

1503
01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:02.490
and you could show me the image of your bathroom.
I can actually see it.
I go,

1504
01:29:02.491 --> 01:29:05.450
okay.
It till it's like quantified like that,
right.

1505
01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:06.840
You looking at someone's brain,

1506
01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:10.650
they functional knowledge of a bathroom is a fucking murderer.
Oh yeah,

1507
01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:15.460
<v 3>I,
we got him.
Yeah.
Like that's the new swearing on a Bible.
Yeah.
And,
and as,
as,
as,</v>

1508
01:29:15.461 --> 01:29:18.820
as swearing on the Bible isn't shaking off.
Exactly.

1509
01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:24.160
Let's make this thing shaking.
So let's use a brain scan.

1510
01:29:24.370 --> 01:29:27.250
That's so true with no,
no,
no,

1511
01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.380
no factual basis for it.

1512
01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:32.310
<v 0>Well,
memories,
memories,
real weird,
man.
They,</v>

1513
01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.810
they've been able to introduce memories in mice now.

1514
01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.360
They've been able to introduce artificial memories.

1515
01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:42.270
<v 3>Oh yeah,
yeah.
In humans for hundreds of years probably,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1516
01:29:42.271 --> 01:29:44.520
Most of the girls on Sheree and candidate type shit.

1517
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:47.690
Most of the girls updated try to artificial memory.

1518
01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.290
Yes sir.

1519
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:55.150
<v 0>Oh,
those are hilarious.
It's called lying.
It's called lying and pimp game.</v>

1520
01:29:56.130 --> 01:29:56.440
Yeah.

1521
01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.470
Sometimes people will fucking put things in your head and you're pretty sure

1522
01:29:59.471 --> 01:30:00.170
they're right.

1523
01:30:00.170 --> 01:30:03.380
<v 3>Yeah.
Like,
I don't know.
I know,
I don't remember anything.
Like,</v>

1524
01:30:03.381 --> 01:30:06.830
sometimes people say,
I remember the time we did this at me,
you and so and so,

1525
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:11.300
and I said,
Oh shit.
Like we like,
that's happening so much to me now.

1526
01:30:11.330 --> 01:30:16.040
Like I know my memory is unreliable.
That's what the point I'm at.

1527
01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:17.233
That's hilarious.

1528
01:30:17.630 --> 01:30:21.050
<v 0>I know mine,
everybody's memories.
Unreliable people,</v>

1529
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:25.400
they morph their memories to make them more convenient for their knowledge of

1530
01:30:25.401 --> 01:30:26.220
the past.

1531
01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:31.220
Whether it's as them as a victim or as them as the winner or as them as the,

1532
01:30:31.421 --> 01:30:33.950
the,
you know,
oh I didn't get my fair shake.
You know,

1533
01:30:33.951 --> 01:30:37.200
there was some behind the scenes shenanigans.
Meanwhile know it's,

1534
01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:37.990
you are fucking,
yeah,

1535
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:42.770
<v 3>yeah.
Regular memory.
Reliable.
But they're going to use this machine.
Yeah,
exactly.</v>

1536
01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.180
<v 0>They're not ready yet.
But one day they will,</v>

1537
01:30:45.181 --> 01:30:48.210
one day we'll be able to access each other's brains.
Just like you,

1538
01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:49.140
we send each other photos.

1539
01:30:49.141 --> 01:30:51.420
Like if you were somewhere cool and you sent me a photo and get it on my phone,

1540
01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:54.630
we're getting,
you're to be able to see my,
my,
I'm going to be able to,
you know,

1541
01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:59.220
put public.
So all I want to make my,
on my eyesight public,

1542
01:30:59.221 --> 01:31:01.920
cause I'm at Yellowstone,
you know,
and you'd go public with your,

1543
01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:04.140
your vision and you show everybody else.

1544
01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:06.980
And he can put it up on a database where people draw from.

1545
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:09.780
That'll be like the first step.
People will share their experiences.

1546
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:13.860
A few people sneak in porn or them jerking off,
but for the most part

1547
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:20.010
people are going to share experiences and then it'll just go to a,
Hey,
I'm Carl.

1548
01:31:20.011 --> 01:31:23.700
I'm always on.
This is a bit depends.
Motherfuckers always on 24,
seven,

1549
01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:25.950
you can watch him shit.
You can watch them jerk off,

1550
01:31:25.951 --> 01:31:29.370
you can watch them at Sachs and people just start,
they only live their life.

1551
01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:32.540
Can't wait to get home and be Carl is it came with the cross out there.

1552
01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:36.810
Just doing ecstasy and bag and pitches driving the fast lane.
It's a fun animal.

1553
01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.820
If Carl's channel became public,
everybody would want to just be in.

1554
01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:43.990
<v 3>Yeah,
you can be the hottest selling.
Uh,
yeah.</v>

1555
01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.230
<v 0>And people would start complaining.
They would say,
look man,</v>

1556
01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:50.160
nobody is living a real life anymore.
Everybody's living other people's lives.

1557
01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.870
<v 3>He has a game.
Came up with a great concept.</v>

1558
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:56.280
<v 0>Yeah,
because your life is boring as fuck.
But you could just be a Carl.</v>

1559
01:31:56.281 --> 01:32:01.210
Carl is out there.
Baldwin and it gets Carl gets shot.

1560
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:03.520
Boom.
You're used to go back to regular life.

1561
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:07.050
That's the risk because then you'd have to find a new channel to subscribe to.

1562
01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:10.400
All right.
You know Carl's dead Eddie TV

1563
01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:13.460
<v 3>shows that.
Yeah,
exactly.
Let's follow Eddie calls,
best friend.</v>

1564
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:15.730
<v 0>That will be a new art form,
the new art form.</v>

1565
01:32:15.731 --> 01:32:19.870
We'll be living your life in a spectacular manner to which some people would

1566
01:32:19.871 --> 01:32:24.460
want to actually give up being a real person so they can be you and experience

1567
01:32:24.461 --> 01:32:29.461
it directly and you will become a million people they see through you.

1568
01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.590
We're not exactly sure whether or not they influence Carl.

1569
01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:35.380
We think that Carl is acting independently,

1570
01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:39.520
but it is possible if you think about it that all those minds linked up together

1571
01:32:39.521 --> 01:32:43.840
could form one unique and universal direction in which crawl might want to go.

1572
01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:47.720
<v 3>Well,
that's kind of like Instagram right now.
That's bananas,</v>

1573
01:32:47.721 --> 01:32:51.040
but you're talking about taking it to the next level son,

1574
01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:55.700
because if call realizes that he gets a lot of views what he's doing,

1575
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:56.850
he's going great summers,

1576
01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:00.860
then he's going to do more threesomes course if he gets a lot of views when he

1577
01:33:00.861 --> 01:33:03.400
realizes that he's on a plane or in a Jacuzzi or just

1578
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:06.310
<v 0>that look,</v>

1579
01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:10.250
when a guy gets recognized for being a big fat guy and like gets famous for

1580
01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.800
being a fat guy.
If you ever seen one of those guys,

1581
01:33:12.801 --> 01:33:15.260
talked to their agents and the agents will tell you,

1582
01:33:15.261 --> 01:33:19.010
I've seen it happen with my own eyes.
Don't lose weight,
man.
If you lose weight,

1583
01:33:19.011 --> 01:33:21.710
you're gonna lose roles.
Right.
Why is that?
Because,

1584
01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:25.230
because they've locked on to the idea of you as the factor.

1585
01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:28.390
<v 3>Gotcha.
Right.
They just decide,
okay.</v>

1586
01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:31.010
<v 0>They decide.
We still,
it's just of we just keep this going.</v>

1587
01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.970
Don't fuck this up if you will.
In the literal bravery training,

1588
01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:36.680
they just keep eating so they'll stay fat and funny.

1589
01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:41.300
If you told the fat guy like,
hey dude,
people love eating and if you just,

1590
01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:44.750
I just need you to just go fucking crazy.
If you just eat a lot bro,
all day,

1591
01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:47.030
people are gonna just be you.
It's a lot of fat people.

1592
01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:48.890
There's skinny in real life,

1593
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:52.070
but they could live like a fat guy through you and we can make money.

1594
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:54.010
I'm Skechers is it on this?

1595
01:33:54.150 --> 01:33:57.680
Yesterday they wants to sponsor eating show.

1596
01:33:57.950 --> 01:34:00.560
I mean it gets some guy who just all day he does,

1597
01:34:00.561 --> 01:34:05.180
he drinks fucking vodka and he eats subs.
Just meatball subs.

1598
01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:09.800
Chicken parm all day so people subscribe just so they can experience what it's

1599
01:34:09.801 --> 01:34:14.140
like to be fucked up drunk with a chicken like a chicken Parmesan Sob.

1600
01:34:14.670 --> 01:34:19.180
Great meatballs and sausage and pepper shit and not allowed to eat anymore.

1601
01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:22.820
Drop outs.
Drunk life,
follow that.

1602
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:27.110
And every now and then Carl go to a massage parlor and get jerked off and like,

1603
01:34:27.111 --> 01:34:29.430
yeah,
but you can't tell your wife about that.

1604
01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:32.960
Like Carl was doing some crazy shit.
What's he doing here?
Like three sandwiches.

1605
01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:33.550
Yeah.

1606
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:36.800
You beat Carl and you don't even tell everybody about Carl getting jerked off.

1607
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:41.880
He's eating a sub while he's getting jerked off.
The kid's a maniac.
That's,

1608
01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:45.200
that's the next level shit,
man.
That's what's going to happen.

1609
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:47.550
People are saying the kids are wasting their lives.
Right.

1610
01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.890
You're just wasting life sitting there watching TV,

1611
01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:53.850
not even be out there doing anything.
That's just TV.
TV,

1612
01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:58.130
TV is like the smoke signals of entertainment.
I mean,
it's beautiful

1613
01:34:58.130 --> 01:34:58.761
<v 1>for us,</v>

1614
01:34:58.761 --> 01:35:02.270
but so was a smoke signal when you didn't know where the fuck the camp was.

1615
01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:05.390
Where is everybody?
They used to all those it fucker.
I can find them.

1616
01:35:05.391 --> 01:35:09.380
That is a lifesaver,
especially when it's cold out.
That shit was a life saver.

1617
01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.520
That's the TV is,
is this smoke signals of digital entertainment.

1618
01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:17.840
One day you're going to actually be that.
You're going to be in that guy's head.

1619
01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:21.930
<v 3>Sorry.
It's starting already slowly with reality shows and all that stuff,</v>

1620
01:35:21.931 --> 01:35:26.040
but we're all going to be one.
Everybody got Facebook,
everybody got an Instagram.

1621
01:35:26.041 --> 01:35:29.750
Everybody's on something.
That's weird.
You can,
you can,
you know,

1622
01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:31.890
you just can't stream it the way you're talking about,

1623
01:35:31.891 --> 01:35:32.920
but you know that's coming.

1624
01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:33.910
<v 1>That's going to happen.</v>

1625
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:37.540
It's going to be weird as fuck and it's going to first take place through

1626
01:35:37.541 --> 01:35:40.370
something like a Google glass or something like that.
Visor adviser,

1627
01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:45.030
the Google visor.
Jump on advisor idea.
So real we need to do,
let's do it.
Come on,

1628
01:35:45.031 --> 01:35:47.600
let's get in the fires of game with.
I'm not interested.
I have,

1629
01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:53.070
I have my time section doubter,
right.
No time for anything else.
My time.

1630
01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.150
There was no way that would make me more happy.

1631
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:56.680
It's just not going to make me more happy.

1632
01:35:56.710 --> 01:36:00.970
We can be the Steve jobs and Pfizer's good luck with all that.
Dude.
I'm content.

1633
01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:03.010
I'm 100% content.

1634
01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:07.470
I have no desire to take on any additional projects if anyone wants to.
Pfizer's,

1635
01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:10.060
do you know how difficult that shit would be to do?

1636
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:12.700
Well you need to do is contact Google.
No,

1637
01:36:12.701 --> 01:36:14.470
I wanted to start off with just a regular advisor.

1638
01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:15.760
I think that's what you have to do.

1639
01:36:15.761 --> 01:36:20.270
You have to like first get your feet into being the best Pfizer,
you know,

1640
01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:23.860
having the Nike Shoe,
that would be easy dude.
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

1641
01:36:23.890 --> 01:36:28.180
It's an easy investment right now that can turn into like for me to agree with

1642
01:36:28.181 --> 01:36:31.570
you.
It's like how much is this Pfizer?
If you look at that visor,

1643
01:36:31.571 --> 01:36:33.980
it's just a piece of plastic,
you know?
It's like,

1644
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:37.060
like all you need to really pay for it.
Like the thing on the top,

1645
01:36:37.061 --> 01:36:37.930
like the head piece.

1646
01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:41.730
So it's like one of those Vegas visors that hunter s Thompson used to wear,

1647
01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:45.100
but it's just bigger.
Yeah.
And it's down on your face.
Yeah,

1648
01:36:45.370 --> 01:36:49.940
I could totally see it happen.
I man,
the Chickson innovator,
daft punk,
Marsha,

1649
01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:53.230
which she should do is take,
she should start this.

1650
01:36:53.231 --> 01:36:56.080
You should start this with her.
I was,
you should do,
should find her.

1651
01:36:56.081 --> 01:36:58.990
She's probably still got some of his money squirreled away somewhere.

1652
01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.070
I can't find him a fucking hole in the park.

1653
01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:07.780
The brown bag dug two feet under a tree.
Yeah,
she's got,
she didn't,

1654
01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:11.320
she didn't blow all over.
She's,
she's hiding some of it from his wife.

1655
01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:13.600
You know that when you're 81 years old,

1656
01:37:13.690 --> 01:37:17.080
if you're fucking a guy that's 81 the shit could end at any moment.
They know it,

1657
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:19.450
they know it,
they plan for the future.

1658
01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:22.420
I doubt she didn't have like an ATM card or something.

1659
01:37:22.421 --> 01:37:24.070
I mean it just doesn't make any sense to me.

1660
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:28.590
<v 3>I,
she claims she has a job,
she's like his personal assistant or something high.</v>

1661
01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.900
A better,
a better title.
The title don't be impede on.

1662
01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:35.960
That's what she has.
I bet she doesn't have that job anymore.

1663
01:37:36.490 --> 01:37:40.190
And I know she in it and the interview is banana.

1664
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:44.360
She says she just like Barb was say you just came from seeing Donald Sterling.

1665
01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:48.410
How is he?
And she was talking like,
well Donald's this and that was,

1666
01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.350
oh he's like a father figure to me and you know,

1667
01:37:51.351 --> 01:37:54.110
I'm just trying to help him right now.
So I was like,

1668
01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:56.250
this would be this so bizarre

1669
01:37:56.250 --> 01:38:01.110
<v 8>that if it's true it is still in contact and kicking it like this.</v>

1670
01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:05.180
<v 0>No other way.
In 81 year old guy gets to bang 20 year olds.</v>

1671
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:08.300
They have to be crazy.
That's the only way it works.

1672
01:38:08.301 --> 01:38:10.930
And you have to deal with everything.
You're 81 years old,

1673
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:15.710
you have to buy or Bentley and you have to deal with a hundred percent crazy

1674
01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:20.840
coming at you on a train all day long drama.

1675
01:38:20.841 --> 01:38:24.770
That's not real drama.
This black guys on Instagram,

1676
01:38:24.771 --> 01:38:27.380
you've got to deal with all that.
It all comes with this crazy bitch.

1677
01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:30.830
You got to just deal with it.
And so part of the game,
it's a part of the game.

1678
01:38:30.831 --> 01:38:33.980
You got to accept it.
You got to accept it in her defense.

1679
01:38:33.981 --> 01:38:36.530
What I heard and I need to stop doing that,

1680
01:38:36.531 --> 01:38:38.120
but I'm going to do it till we Google it,

1681
01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:43.360
is that she was part of her job was to record everything that he knew there was

1682
01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:45.573
being recorded.

1683
01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:49.240
<v 8>Uh,
it's,
he's,
he's recording it.
Yes.
Is He's,</v>

1684
01:38:49.241 --> 01:38:50.740
because it's first when I heard the tape and said,

1685
01:38:51.010 --> 01:38:56.010
how did this bitch like she should like work for bits spokesperson for the who

1686
01:38:56.201 --> 01:38:59.140
she recorded this with.
Well she finally,
she did.
Yeah,

1687
01:38:59.210 --> 01:39:02.860
she recorded it for him and it says,
and then she just took his tape

1688
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:06.090
<v 0>or he,
she didn't give it to them.
Right.</v>

1689
01:39:06.091 --> 01:39:09.090
She might've had it and didn't give it to them.
But here's the deal.
Palm,

1690
01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:13.500
if that's the truth,
then that makes it no longer crime.
Right.

1691
01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:18.270
Because it's only a crime in California.
If w two people,
uh,

1692
01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.280
record something and one of them doesn't know about it.
Right.

1693
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.850
But as long as both of them know about it in California,
it's not a crime.

1694
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:26.870
<v 8>Yeah,
no,
I heard it was,
it's his shit and I didn't,</v>

1695
01:39:26.871 --> 01:39:28.250
I don't know if she's taping it for him,

1696
01:39:28.251 --> 01:39:32.610
but it makes kind of sense and I want it to make sense before we've looked at
it.

1697
01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:37.730
And then she palmed it.
So she's not as,
as she is devious as far as pushing him.

1698
01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:39.260
Well,
the questions,
but

1699
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:40.530
<v 0>you know,
the whole story,</v>

1700
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:43.340
it's almost like she got pushed into it because you know the whole story,

1701
01:39:43.341 --> 01:39:44.270
she's getting sued

1702
01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:47.720
<v 8>by the wife.
Yeah.
So she's,
this was a self defense move.</v>

1703
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:50.310
<v 0>Yeah,
for sure.</v>

1704
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:55.020
Because like the wife is trying to get all the money back.
Like she bought,

1705
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:58.980
she bought,
he bought her a condo and a bunch of other shit.
Look at us,

1706
01:39:58.981 --> 01:40:00.170
we're like a little TMZ bitches.

1707
01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:01.733
<v 8>No,
no,
but there's a,</v>

1708
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:06.330
there's a social science thing to it and my thing is like there's a bunch of

1709
01:40:06.331 --> 01:40:09.330
people here who won't,
will not accept the rules of the game.

1710
01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:13.050
The wife is trying to sue like listen wife,

1711
01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:17.490
you made it to 80 or whatever with this dude and he's a billionaire.

1712
01:40:17.491 --> 01:40:22.320
There's no way that a younger chick in the way nature works.

1713
01:40:22.321 --> 01:40:25.140
It's not going to get at your man or your man's going to get,

1714
01:40:25.141 --> 01:40:30.000
so for you to sue one of his younger chicks,
that's against,

1715
01:40:30.330 --> 01:40:32.040
that's against the laws of the game.

1716
01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.960
For him not accepting that this young chick with fuck younger dudes,

1717
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:41.970
he's in denial himself and then she,
she's just crazy.

1718
01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:46.120
<v 0>Well she's the type of girl that's willing to fucking 80 year old billionaire</v>

1719
01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:50.170
six which again,
you don't,
you know either that you go to another country,

1720
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:54.180
<v 8>right.
And then you can't trust if you're a 80 minute 80 year old billionaire,</v>

1721
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:58.240
<v 3>you can't trust a girl who's willing to fuck you with tapes.</v>

1722
01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:03.340
Exactly.
So then it's like a lot of like,
it's like three people fucking up.

1723
01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:07.370
<v 0>You know what I thought was the most bizarre about all of it?
Um,</v>

1724
01:41:07.630 --> 01:41:12.630
apparently I was correct and that what she is as far as the most recent story is

1725
01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:19.250
that she was supposed to record his saying his conversations because he would

1726
01:41:19.251 --> 01:41:22.460
say things and then forgot he sat him.
Right.
So He's,
he's got,

1727
01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:25.370
he's dementia 81 years old.
He's old as fuck.

1728
01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:30.530
So he would say crazy things and then she would record them and you know,

1729
01:41:30.531 --> 01:41:34.910
and let him know like what he said.
Well in this case,
somehow or another,

1730
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.600
it got leaked how it got leaked to speculation,

1731
01:41:38.601 --> 01:41:41.570
but he knew he was being recorded.
All right.
That is true.

1732
01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.570
<v 3>So you can't,
it's against the law.
The record,
anyone,</v>

1733
01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:48.080
like what if they don't say anything and it's just bathroom noises and stuff.

1734
01:41:48.110 --> 01:41:50.930
It's against the law still.
Even if they don't talk in it.
Absolutely.

1735
01:41:50.931 --> 01:41:53.060
In California.
If they don't know about it,
it's against the law.

1736
01:41:53.061 --> 01:41:53.950
You're not allowed to record.

1737
01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:58.410
The default essence can be like if you just put a tape recorder down behind the

1738
01:41:58.411 --> 01:42:01.820
toilet,
they don't say a word.
They just did it and then they leave.

1739
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:03.770
That's still against the law even though they don't say it.

1740
01:42:03.771 --> 01:42:05.990
It said they're just their spirit being in the room,

1741
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:08.870
<v 0>the noises of them,
um,
being recorded.</v>

1742
01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:12.200
There are actual physical presence being marked by the sound of their feet.

1743
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:14.150
I think that's probably illegal.
Really?

1744
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.690
<v 4>Yeah.
That's why they used to tape criminal</v>

1745
01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:22.380
guilty as fuck.
He's like,

1746
01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:28.160
if you take a tape and put it behind the back in burp boilers in Burbank,

1747
01:42:28.450 --> 01:42:31.580
whatever,
whatever,
and the girl might happen to be a stripper,
whatever,
whatever.

1748
01:42:32.130 --> 01:42:34.330
That's that combination.
That's never gonna happen.
But if it did,

1749
01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:37.900
it's just they know that you were recording her pooping.

1750
01:42:38.110 --> 01:42:42.160
It's just interesting because I guess recording.
No,
no,
Brian,

1751
01:42:42.161 --> 01:42:44.390
that's an interesting fucking space is interesting.

1752
01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:47.900
We you talking about that you clam up and you're like,
oh

1753
01:42:50.630 --> 01:42:51.780
no,
I thought it was crazy.

1754
01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:56.660
<v 0>The whole thing is that he got a two point $5 million fine.</v>

1755
01:42:57.110 --> 01:43:00.110
That was a Max,
like that's a weird thing man.

1756
01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:03.590
A fine like a two point $5 million fine.

1757
01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:08.510
Like I could see saying like,
all right,
this guy's a piece of shit.
He shouldn't.

1758
01:43:08.511 --> 01:43:09.140
Uh,

1759
01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:14.140
he shouldn't be able to own a team in our league just because he's such weak

1760
01:43:15.351 --> 01:43:19.100
moral moral character.
Let's get rid of him.
The guy's a dick head.

1761
01:43:19.101 --> 01:43:20.870
Let's get rid of them.
But to say you're going to,

1762
01:43:21.110 --> 01:43:24.920
you're going to find him for being racist since when has to be racist,

1763
01:43:24.921 --> 01:43:27.350
like finable.
Well that's crazy.

1764
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:31.360
<v 3>There's an NBA constitution and under the constitution that's the most you could</v>

1765
01:43:31.361 --> 01:43:34.390
find somebody,
and I don't want to put it,

1766
01:43:34.690 --> 01:43:38.140
I guess saying something detrimental against the entire league.

1767
01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.830
So what he said is under that,

1768
01:43:42.490 --> 01:43:45.400
so it's a to 52.5 was the Max.

1769
01:43:45.730 --> 01:43:49.990
So that's like the top that they're allowed to find anything hurting.

1770
01:43:49.991 --> 01:43:52.070
The NBA can be that they can find them for

1771
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:56.360
<v 8>doing anything.
He's just one team,
but he's hurting the image of the whole.</v>

1772
01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:58.950
<v 0>Right.
I get all that.</v>

1773
01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:03.390
I just don't get how they think that they can find someone's getting all the

1774
01:44:03.391 --> 01:44:07.910
other owners nervous.
Sound so crazy to find someone from being racist

1775
01:44:08.050 --> 01:44:12.770
<v 8>that the amount that they agreed on to like the entire NBA,
all the owners,</v>

1776
01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:16.610
they probably agreed to the amount and it just an amount that won't affect any

1777
01:44:16.611 --> 01:44:17.444
of them.

1778
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:22.450
<v 0>Yeah,
I bet you're right.
That's the maximum of 2.5 million.
Everyone's good.</v>

1779
01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:29.390
It's like we spent 2.5 just to get to this meeting.

1780
01:44:30.110 --> 01:44:34.320
Don't make 2.5 in a week.
Yeah,
just off the interest of all that money.
Yeah.

1781
01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:39.770
That's for folks who don't even know what that means.
If you have $1 billion,

1782
01:44:39.771 --> 01:44:44.771
he had a thousand million and a thousand million dollars constantly raining in

1783
01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.270
percentages.

1784
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:51.890
If you just have some simple mutual funds that generate,
you know,

1785
01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.510
x amount of percent per month or x amount of percent off of your savings
account.

1786
01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:57.770
I mean what is that?

1787
01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:00.770
If you have a savings account and you've got $1 billion in it,

1788
01:45:01.130 --> 01:45:02.690
I mean how much money do you get?
I mean,

1789
01:45:02.691 --> 01:45:05.690
I know most of them don't have liquid assets like that that keep your money in a

1790
01:45:05.691 --> 01:45:08.780
bunch of different things.
They have some liquid,
some real estate.

1791
01:45:08.781 --> 01:45:11.990
They diversify and stocks and bonds and all that other shit,

1792
01:45:11.991 --> 01:45:16.640
but just the sheer numbers that that money is generating if you're doing it

1793
01:45:16.641 --> 01:45:19.040
right.
Right.
Should it be staggering?

1794
01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:23.720
They should get 1 million bucks a month is nothing comes in.

1795
01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:28.300
I'm shocked that he's just still a billionaire.
Yeah.
One,

1796
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:33.160
he's got 1.9 1.9

1797
01:45:33.170 --> 01:45:35.780
<v 8>that's all in 80 years.
What the fuck has he been doing?</v>

1798
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:40.970
How many bitches has he been giving money to
buy Bentley's and shit?

1799
01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.120
<v 0>It's a ridiculous that the wife can sue.</v>

1800
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:48.030
<v 8>Yeah.
I don't think that that suit is going to stand up.
It shouldn't.</v>

1801
01:45:48.150 --> 01:45:48.830
It shouldn't.

1802
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:53.500
<v 0>It doesn't matter.
She has to defend it.
Hold on.
Yeah,
she has to defend it.
Yeah.</v>

1803
01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:57.580
You know,
it's one thing if you,
you sued or divorce,
you know,
you can't,
like,

1804
01:45:57.581 --> 01:46:01.310
you can't have a 20 year old bitch on the side and give her fucking Ferrari's.

1805
01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:05.380
Get out of my mind.
I've done it to you.
Fuck it.
I'm stilling.
That makes sense.

1806
01:46:05.650 --> 01:46:10.540
But to see,
to sue the girl because your husband gave her gifts

1807
01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:12.510
<v 8>and your husband is standing right next to you.</v>

1808
01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:15.670
How are you going to skip over him and go to this chair chick?

1809
01:46:15.710 --> 01:46:19.310
<v 0>That is one of the,
just one of the many reasons why marriage is preposterous.</v>

1810
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:21.440
Pastor says so ridiculous.

1811
01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:27.360
The idea is so stupid that you get linked to someone financially.

1812
01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:32.690
You lock it in place and if that person gives someone some shit and you don't

1813
01:46:32.691 --> 01:46:37.130
like it,
that came from my money.
Right?
Didn't he spent it,

1814
01:46:37.131 --> 01:46:40.610
but he can't spend money on whatever the fuck he wants to spend it on.

1815
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:41.960
If he bought them,
you know,

1816
01:46:41.961 --> 01:46:44.660
if he bought a house just off some person who just bought a house,

1817
01:46:45.570 --> 01:46:48.920
would you say you fucking buy that house?

1818
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.510
You can't stop the dude from buying a house.
You know,

1819
01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:54.210
you might win in court and get half of his money,

1820
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:58.260
but you can't change what he bought.
You can't.
He bought it.

1821
01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:02.520
He bought her a fucking car.
He bought her a house.
That's,
that's gone.

1822
01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.210
That's just like,
feel.
Yeah,
that's,
it's gone.

1823
01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.910
It's just like buying it from someone and,
uh,
you know,
and,

1824
01:47:09.911 --> 01:47:11.370
and keeping it for yourself,
it's gone.

1825
01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:12.710
<v 8>Him and his wife have a really,</v>

1826
01:47:12.850 --> 01:47:16.960
really interesting relationship just based on what I've seen.
Like,

1827
01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:21.910
uh,
she won one statement,
I don't know the audit statement.
One statement is like,

1828
01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:27.010
she does not condone him.
And he's,
um,
his,
his strange wife.

1829
01:47:27.011 --> 01:47:30.730
We're not to get with them within days of that,

1830
01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.290
she's seen with him defending him.
They went,

1831
01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:38.770
came out of a restaurant together and she's like,
he's not racist.
And then,

1832
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:42.700
then I saw something today where she's glad that they took the team from him.

1833
01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:46.120
What?
So,
so she's gone back and forth.

1834
01:47:46.121 --> 01:47:51.121
She's going back and forth and she's obviously in his life or acting or getting,

1835
01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:52.451
maybe she's just,

1836
01:47:52.451 --> 01:47:56.440
maybe she's just getting paid and maybe she just wants a team to land in a lap

1837
01:47:56.441 --> 01:48:00.040
or keeping an eye.
But it's,
it could be.
Yeah.

1838
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:01.720
You never fucking know.

1839
01:48:01.890 --> 01:48:05.980
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,
especially a 80 year old dude who doesn't remember shit.
Right.</v>

1840
01:48:06.010 --> 01:48:09.030
And he's got to get a recording every time he talks,
you know,
annoying.

1841
01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.870
That must be for the wife.
Yeah.
She's like,
look,
you stupid motherfucker.

1842
01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:14.800
This is the week we go to Hawaii.
Get your shit together,
let's go.

1843
01:48:15.210 --> 01:48:18.730
You know she's probably tired of him.
He's probably tired of all is not.
And then,

1844
01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:22.890
oh he's a sweetie.
He's not racist.
You leave,
leave my,
my,

1845
01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:28.090
my but alone Donald.
This is just for that is,

1846
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:32.770
yeah,
he the poor bastard.
He's just an old senile,
old racist.
Shitheads

1847
01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:36.330
<v 8>yeah.
And a lot of that shit is like I said,
dementia and it's anonymous anomaly.</v>

1848
01:48:36.670 --> 01:48:39.840
It's like
the only thing,

1849
01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:44.040
like when everybody wanted him to get fired,
like when it first tapes,

1850
01:48:44.041 --> 01:48:45.030
so it's cat.
He came out,

1851
01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:49.290
I wasn't down with that cause I wasn't as offended by the tapes because it's

1852
01:48:49.291 --> 01:48:53.430
like what a shocker that an 80 year old guy was racist.

1853
01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:56.250
But when,
uh,

1854
01:48:56.430 --> 01:49:00.240
Adam silver is that the NBA Commissioner gave the speech,

1855
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:03.870
like I was on board with the speech.

1856
01:49:04.230 --> 01:49:07.680
I went from not caring whether they fired on or not,

1857
01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:12.060
but when Adam silver gave the speech and said band full life,

1858
01:49:12.630 --> 01:49:17.630
it was not just the words but the way he delivered it that made me believe in

1859
01:49:17.911 --> 01:49:22.911
this guy as a commissioner and that he wanted to fix some shit and that he was

1860
01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:27.390
doing it.
He was just doing it for the,

1861
01:49:27.391 --> 01:49:31.080
just for the good of humanity and that kind of,

1862
01:49:32.010 --> 01:49:36.510
that kind of made me say,
okay,
kick him out.
But before I didn't care.
Right.

1863
01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:41.310
I if you,
I don't know if you've seen the speech,
but I felt something,

1864
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:44.790
I just felt something,
I was like some honesty and integrity there.

1865
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:49.330
<v 0>Well that's important man.
Look,
I mean especially important.
If you look,</v>

1866
01:49:49.331 --> 01:49:53.920
imagine if you were the guy who was running the NBA and you weren't a racist and

1867
01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:57.610
you got this racist old dickhead that owns the clippers and he says some stupid

1868
01:49:57.611 --> 01:49:59.630
shit and they're like,
you dumb mother fucker.

1869
01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:03.880
Do you not understand that 80% of his league is black and you say stupid shit

1870
01:50:03.881 --> 01:50:04.271
like that.

1871
01:50:04.271 --> 01:50:09.271
Like this is the whole reason why basketball is popular is because the athletes

1872
01:50:09.371 --> 01:50:10.390
are so fucking good.

1873
01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:14.440
Do you understand that 80% of these athletes are Wa are black?
So I mean,

1874
01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:15.221
just look at the numbers.

1875
01:50:15.221 --> 01:50:18.590
You stupid fuck like you're ruining everything and then being a new,

1876
01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.620
a good human,
just being a good human being.

1877
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:24.580
Do you want your business to be associated?
Imagine if you,
whatever,

1878
01:50:24.581 --> 01:50:29.110
you ran a a chain of comedy clubs,
you know,

1879
01:50:29.230 --> 01:50:31.990
and you found out that someone in your chain of comedy clubs,

1880
01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:35.560
someone who owns one of your chains was a racist or saying racist shit.

1881
01:50:35.890 --> 01:50:39.280
He'd be like,
Oh fuck outta here.
Get outta here out done.

1882
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:41.980
I don't want this guy associated with me.
You'd boot him out immediately.

1883
01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:46.030
You'd have to feel like that if you were a person of integrity and you are

1884
01:50:46.031 --> 01:50:47.680
running something like the NBA.

1885
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:52.270
<v 8>But it was,
it was just like,
like when,
so,</v>

1886
01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:57.280
so Donald Sterling makes these tapes that I can accept as like not surprised and

1887
01:50:59.211 --> 01:51:02.420
because that's what I expect.
That's what I mean.
That's what I expect.

1888
01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:05.420
But when another rich guy,
right.

1889
01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:10.040
Makes the speech that he makes and with the feeling that he makes.

1890
01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:11.960
That's what I don't expect.

1891
01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.920
Like the honesty and the genuineness that I felt.

1892
01:51:16.130 --> 01:51:17.330
I didn't expect that.

1893
01:51:17.590 --> 01:51:20.090
<v 0>Well Shit,
I want to watch it now because of I've only a,</v>

1894
01:51:20.091 --> 01:51:22.060
I heard them making fun of it on an opiate and,

1895
01:51:22.370 --> 01:51:25.810
<v 1>okay,
that's totally fair.
So bad.
They were crushing it.
They were,</v>

1896
01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:30.370
they said that he looked like Nosferatu and it looked like he should have risen

1897
01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:35.320
behind the podium,
like popping out of a coffin.
So stupid.

1898
01:51:35.890 --> 01:51:38.640
What is this?
What is his name again?
I think it's Adam

1899
01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:44.040
<v 0>silver NBA president mission Donald Sterling.</v>

1900
01:51:46.170 --> 01:51:48.020
<v 8>I keep just seemed upset.</v>

1901
01:51:48.890 --> 01:51:51.200
Like he really took this personally.

1902
01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:55.240
<v 0>It would have been,
um,
it would have been fascinating if they didn't react.</v>

1903
01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:57.910
It'd been fascinating.
Like what kind of a blow back that would be.

1904
01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:59.770
I think it would be pretty substantial.
It would have been,

1905
01:51:59.771 --> 01:52:02.740
it would appeal to it a very substantial,
if they didn't do something about it,

1906
01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:06.220
it's crazy.
It was like the clippers are like heroes now.
Everywhere they shell.

1907
01:52:06.221 --> 01:52:07.630
Everybody goes bananas.

1908
01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:10.180
<v 8>The clip is a so corny.
They did this,
uh,</v>

1909
01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:15.100
this protesting before one of the games where they all walked in the middle of

1910
01:52:15.101 --> 01:52:15.790
court.

1911
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:18.820
What a sh things inside out and then dropped the things on the floor and then

1912
01:52:18.821 --> 01:52:22.480
they walked away as if they just changed civil rights and like get the fuck

1913
01:52:22.481 --> 01:52:23.314
outta here.

1914
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:28.260
<v 1>Do Shit.
What the fuck is that?
Like will be famous though for it.</v>

1915
01:52:28.261 --> 01:52:33.261
If you stop and think about it like this is a civil rights is a biggest civil

1916
01:52:33.541 --> 01:52:37.530
rights issues ever has existed recently in modern sports.
Yeah.

1917
01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:41.220
What does it but besides Jimmy,
the Greek Jimmy,

1918
01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:45.970
<v 8>the Greek I think got railroaded.
He said some facts.
It's</v>

1919
01:52:46.090 --> 01:52:49.390
<v 5>just the fact that were very uncomfortable for people who are uncomfortable with</v>

1920
01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:53.960
people.
I had still to this day don't get it.
Like what did he say?

1921
01:52:54.170 --> 01:52:57.770
I used to breed,
likes to eat in slave.
He didn't say he did it.

1922
01:52:58.010 --> 01:53:02.510
He said back then they bred a big black books

1923
01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:08.440
<v 9>this past Saturday morning of a conversation that it led to leak included</v>

1924
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:11.390
clippers owner,
Donald Sterling.

1925
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:16.940
The NBA commenced an investigation which among other things included in

1926
01:53:16.941 --> 01:53:21.941
interview of Mr Sterling that investigation is now complete

1927
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:29.030
the central findings of the investigation or that the man whose voice is heard

1928
01:53:29.031 --> 01:53:33.560
on the recording and on a second recording from the same from the same

1929
01:53:33.561 --> 01:53:38.561
conversation that was released on Sunday is Mr Sterling and at the hateful

1930
01:53:39.861 --> 01:53:44.210
opinions voiced by that man are those of Mr Sterling.

1931
01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:51.980
The views expressed by Mr Sterling are deeply offensive and harmful

1932
01:53:55.530 --> 01:53:56.580
that they came from.

1933
01:53:56.610 --> 01:54:01.320
An NBA owner only heightens the damage and my personal outrage

1934
01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:03.680
setup.

1935
01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:08.680
Sentiments of this kind are contrary to the principles of inclusion and respect

1936
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:15.250
that formed the foundation of our diverse multicultural and multiethnic league.

1937
01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:21.420
<v 5>I am personally as guy drawing the piss out of me.</v>

1938
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:26.870
The views expressed by Mr Sterling came from within an institution that I said

1939
01:54:29.190 --> 01:54:31.320
that has historically taken,
he's nervous,

1940
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:36.350
such a leadership role in matters of race relations because current and former

1941
01:54:37.021 --> 01:54:39.030
players,
coaches,

1942
01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:44.040
fans and partners of the NBA took question.

1943
01:54:44.250 --> 01:54:49.250
They're very association with the league freshman that are to them and pioneers

1944
01:54:51.330 --> 01:54:55.840
of the game like Earl Lloyd show whose birth,

1945
01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:59.260
this is where they're mocking Sweetwater Clifton.
Oh,
sweet water.

1946
01:54:59.330 --> 01:55:03.870
The Great Bill Russell and particularly Magic Johnson.

1947
01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:09.300
I apologize.
I guess they were in the photos.
Is that what that was about?

1948
01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:14.640
Those guys?
I think so.
Accordingly.
Yeah.
I think immediately,

1949
01:55:14.850 --> 01:55:15.900
I think Bill Russell was too.

1950
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:21.000
<v 9>I am banning Mr Sterling for life from any association with the Clippers</v>

1951
01:55:24.010 --> 01:55:25.600
Organization or the NBA.

1952
01:55:27.670 --> 01:55:32.290
Mr Sterling may not attend any NBA games or practices.

1953
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:34.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1954
01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:39.180
<v 9>He may not be present at any clippers facility and he may not participate in any</v>

1955
01:55:40.601 --> 01:55:44.190
business or player personnel decisions involving

1956
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:45.053
<v 5>the team.</v>

1957
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:51.420
He will also be barred from attending NBA Board of governors meetings or

1958
01:55:51.421 --> 01:55:54.870
participating in any other league activity.

1959
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:58.150
<v 0>I like it.
I would like to,
he did it.
You know why I liked it?</v>

1960
01:55:58.151 --> 01:56:01.390
He did it because fuck old dick heads like that.
Just,

1961
01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:06.100
just fuck a dude who thinks like that.
Right?
Who Cares?
Get rid of them.
Yeah.

1962
01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:10.560
It's not like he's hurting anyone out in the street.
Yeah.

1963
01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:15.520
You just saying your league doesn't tolerate racism and even by financially

1964
01:56:15.521 --> 01:56:19.820
penalizing him 2.5 million,
which is a pittance to a wealthy man like that,
right?

1965
01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:24.960
That fucking team is going to be worth an ass load of money and they're going to

1966
01:56:24.971 --> 01:56:28.510
sell it.
And guess who makes the money?
Donald fucking sterling.

1967
01:56:28.630 --> 01:56:30.310
So by this whole controversy,

1968
01:56:30.311 --> 01:56:34.600
his team's probably way more valuable and he's selling the team at the peak.

1969
01:56:34.630 --> 01:56:38.680
This is the best his team has ever been.
Oprah.
The only way she's not buying it.

1970
01:56:38.710 --> 01:56:39.580
No,
the only,
no.

1971
01:56:39.730 --> 01:56:44.730
The only way that it's not going to work is if people get together and decide,

1972
01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:48.610
you know what?
Fuck this dude.

1973
01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:53.020
Nobody by the clippers making me get rid of it for make them,

1974
01:56:53.050 --> 01:56:57.340
make them sell it to the lowest bidder and you know,

1975
01:56:57.341 --> 01:57:00.160
make sure that nobody bids more than a hundred dollars for the fuck out.

1976
01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:03.520
Just make sure that he gets it for the highest bidder,

1977
01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:06.100
but that I people like make an agreement,

1978
01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:09.370
<v 5>I can own it then that I don't know how to play is going to get paid after that.</v>

1979
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:10.960
<v 0>You're gonna have to figure out a way.
My,</v>

1980
01:57:10.961 --> 01:57:14.600
I'm retarded idea has got a lot of holes in there.
It's a lot of holes in it,

1981
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:19.670
but if you could mean if you really want it to come up with people really wanted

1982
01:57:19.690 --> 01:57:23.270
to collude and come up with one is is that illegal?
What happens if we do that?

1983
01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:27.620
That shit is hell.
Yeah.
He can't collude.
That's like anti iPractice right,

1984
01:57:27.621 --> 01:57:31.220
or anti fair anti something,
something.
Yeah,

1985
01:57:31.221 --> 01:57:34.670
there's probably some collusion penalties that you would incur,

1986
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:35.960
but if you get people,

1987
01:57:35.961 --> 01:57:39.100
all the rich dudes with money so you know we're not buying a clip or this guy's

1988
01:57:39.110 --> 01:57:41.840
not going to get any money from us,
then the players are,
fuck

1989
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:44.450
<v 5>you know what the only problem with that is it's like property.</v>

1990
01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:48.560
It's like if somebody buys a house next to you for $50 then the value of your

1991
01:57:48.561 --> 01:57:49.430
shit goes down.

1992
01:57:49.890 --> 01:57:54.120
I said it ended up being true and the other NBA owners are going to be like,
ah,

1993
01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:58.640
and they're powerful enough to sell it to a charity and then rich guy buys it

1994
01:57:58.641 --> 01:57:59.360
from the charity.

1995
01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:01.600
<v 0>If someone says like the NBA,
uh,</v>

1996
01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:06.740
says like they want $500 million for the Lakers and like a $500 million,

1997
01:58:06.921 --> 01:58:09.680
you know the clippers sold for 100 bucks.
Right?
You guys are going crazy.

1998
01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:11.330
We don't mind you making a little money,

1999
01:58:11.331 --> 01:58:13.850
but this is disrespectful and treating me like I'm an idiot.

2000
01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:17.150
You don't think I read the paper?
Oh,
there was special circumstances.

2001
01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:21.140
No special circumstances,
Bro.
If she goes down to yeah,
you don't,

2002
01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:25.730
they will give you a million about a million,
but one last one.
We're giving it.

2003
01:58:25.731 --> 01:58:29.000
We're giving them away.
It's tough to get $1 million since page.
This is not,

2004
01:58:29.210 --> 01:58:31.130
you know,
we have the fucking expenses.

2005
01:58:31.590 --> 01:58:34.520
We've got to pay the trainer and it's fucking basketball court needs wax.

2006
01:58:34.890 --> 01:58:37.760
It's a lot of money involved and own Goddamn team show.

2007
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:40.430
Like we're just going to be making money hand over fist.

2008
01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:44.440
They had fucked the whole thing up,
man.
This is what Jimmy,
the Greek said.

2009
01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:46.360
He said black people are Betty or athletes.

2010
01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:53.680
He said black people are better athletes.
Um,
I don't know.
I think he's right.

2011
01:58:54.610 --> 01:58:58.720
I think he's right.
Is that right?
I think he's right.

2012
01:58:59.830 --> 01:59:04.000
He's,
he's at least 80% right?
Yeah.
This is what he said.

2013
01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:08.160
This is the quote.
The quote is a little,
you know,
it's a little sketch with,

2014
01:59:08.170 --> 01:59:10.450
we're talking about 1988 too by the way.
Right.
Jimmy?

2015
01:59:10.451 --> 01:59:13.750
The Greek wouldn't last five minutes today.
He would,

2016
01:59:13.751 --> 01:59:17.720
they would catch them on cell phone sites.
Rages,
Shit that,
you know,

2017
01:59:17.890 --> 01:59:20.080
a couple of whiskeys in them eating a Hoagie.

2018
01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:25.300
It says the black is a better athlete to begin with because he's been bred to be

2019
01:59:25.301 --> 01:59:28.660
that way.
Can we just stop there at the,
that's one of the black,

2020
01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:29.893
<v 4>the book,</v>

2021
01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:34.940
the black is a problem of black cause I like where he's going,

2022
01:59:34.941 --> 01:59:35.774
but the black,

2023
01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:39.490
<v 0>yeah.
You imagine if some like Louis Farrakhan Guy,
the white,</v>

2024
01:59:40.050 --> 01:59:42.070
the white list for frying too.
People,

2025
01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:47.220
the white believes he is of a high breed because he was not bred to be,

2026
01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:49.740
uh,

2027
01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:54.740
because of the high thighs and big thighs that goes up into his back and they

2028
01:59:56.741 --> 02:00:00.340
could jump higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs.

2029
02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:05.610
And he's bred to be the better athlete because this goes back all the way to the

2030
02:00:05.981 --> 02:00:08.410
civil war.
When during the slave trade,

2031
02:00:08.411 --> 02:00:13.411
the slave owner would breed the big black to his big woman so that he could have

2032
02:00:14.291 --> 02:00:15.730
a big black kid.

2033
02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:21.840
<v 4>Sort of facts are there,
but</v>

2034
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:28.090
pretty much white legislation thing was to collation.
Articulation is a,

2035
02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:32.980
<v 0>a little on the crude side.
On the cruise side.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

2036
02:00:33.370 --> 02:00:38.230
So apparently he was on the network,
um,
talking about,

2037
02:00:38.231 --> 02:00:41.980
uh,
you know,
given the inside scoop on gambling.
That's what he used to do.

2038
02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:47.260
And he did it for 12 years and he said that,

2039
02:00:47.261 --> 02:00:49.330
and that's,
that's,
that's where they ended it for him.

2040
02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:53.850
It was CBS fired him and no,
I don't think anybody ever hired him after that.
Uh,

2041
02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:58.430
it was,
it was tough.
He went down.
Yeah.

2042
02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:03.190
And did he die?
Yeah,
he eventually died,
but he died like broken.

2043
02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:07.690
Like he couldn't associate with people that he used to talk to every day and

2044
02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:11.260
everything that he loved the sport,
you know,
it's taken from him.

2045
02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:15.160
He died it way back in [inaudible] 96 [inaudible] 77 years of age.

2046
02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:19.930
That's fucking crazy.
It's amazing how,
one thing too,
man.
One thing,

2047
02:01:19.931 --> 02:01:23.590
just if you say something like that,
you can say some stupid shit,

2048
02:01:23.950 --> 02:01:27.730
but if you say something that people think is a racist politics thing and you

2049
02:01:27.731 --> 02:01:31.930
get stuck.
What Paula Dean Paula Deen.
Yeah.
Well sort of.

2050
02:01:31.931 --> 02:01:34.030
Everything's gone for her.
Not really.

2051
02:01:34.031 --> 02:01:38.350
She's still doing fucking tours and selling books and that doesn't seem to

2052
02:01:38.351 --> 02:01:42.530
affect her as much.
She's got some tour that they were just making fun of on some

2053
02:01:42.650 --> 02:01:45.110
<v 1>a website May.
She'd lost like over a hundred sponsors.</v>

2054
02:01:45.111 --> 02:01:48.710
So it did change in her restaurant,
I think is closed now.
Oh,

2055
02:01:48.711 --> 02:01:50.870
she had a restaurant.
Yeah.
That's where all this,

2056
02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:53.140
how are you sure that it's closed?
Find out we'll,

2057
02:01:53.141 --> 02:01:54.950
but we'll Google the repercussions

2058
02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:58.490
<v 0>suffered by Paula Dean.
Um,</v>

2059
02:01:59.570 --> 02:02:04.570
I wonder if it's different today too because you could go on like a website and

2060
02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:11.260
you could sort of like apologize or argue your position or tell say,

2061
02:02:11.511 --> 02:02:15.780
you know,
like did you see that Jeremy Clarkson thing pull up that um,

2062
02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:18.460
Brian abandoned that for a moment and pull up uh,

2063
02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:23.390
Jeremy Clarkson find for using the n word

2064
02:02:23.970 --> 02:02:28.640
<v 1>or in trouble for using the n word.
That's the guy in England.
Yeah.
Meaning mine.</v>

2065
02:02:29.810 --> 02:02:32.770
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That was stupid.
Oh,
he's an idiot.

2066
02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:37.420
These guys have done this before.
I mean I think he's a hilarious guy

2067
02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:42.160
<v 0>sometimes,
but they've said some really racist shit.
Pull it up.</v>

2068
02:02:43.330 --> 02:02:46.300
I'm sure he got on TV and apologize.

2069
02:02:46.301 --> 02:02:48.410
He made a or on Youtube and he apologized for it.

2070
02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:52.540
<v 10>Jeremy Clarkson is one of the PVC is best known and well paid anchors.</v>

2071
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:55.430
He fronts top gear,
which is a popular car program,

2072
02:02:55.640 --> 02:03:00.640
which last year became the most widely watched factual TV show in the world here

2073
02:03:01.011 --> 02:03:03.740
in the UK.
Clarks and is known for is edgy humor,

2074
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:06.200
but this time he may have gone too far.

2075
02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:10.130
Video of Clark's and apparently using racist language has been linked to the

2076
02:03:10.131 --> 02:03:12.260
British media.
In this snippet,

2077
02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:15.880
you can hear him mumble the n word Elian

2078
02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:21.770
to Lindy skills.
That's him go eeny meeny,
miny moe.

2079
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:26.930
The clip was film several years ago and it was never broadcast and Clark denied

2080
02:03:26.931 --> 02:03:30.560
using the term at all,
but after the video was posted online,

2081
02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:33.380
he apologized and asked for forgiveness.

2082
02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:38.660
<v 11>Please be assured I did everything in my power to not use that word and does.</v>

2083
02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:45.930
I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for the fact that obviously my efforts

2084
02:03:45.931 --> 02:03:47.460
weren't quite good enough.

2085
02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:53.040
<v 10>The BBC did a statement saying it made it absolutely clear to him the standards</v>

2086
02:03:53.041 --> 02:03:55.370
and the BBC expects on air and off.

2087
02:03:55.730 --> 02:04:00.260
We've left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this.
Okay.
Okay.

2088
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:05.470
<v 0>Here's one interesting thing about the editing of a Clarkson's apology is that</v>

2089
02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:09.410
what he said was that he,
he did it three times.
He did three takes.

2090
02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:15.280
He tried to say that and it sounded like that and he sent a letter to them

2091
02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:17.830
making sure that the editors didn't put that in.
So they didn't,

2092
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:21.970
that was 2012 so it's just sort of coming out now.
But,
um,

2093
02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:25.210
I didn't even,
I,
I always thought it was tiger.

2094
02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:31.650
<v 1>What do you mean catch a tiger by the toe?
Oh,
I know you've seen that before.
No,</v>

2095
02:04:31.651 --> 02:04:36.150
the fucking nursery rhyme.
My daughters use it.
That's how they pick.

2096
02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:38.040
They get a little cup of water before

2097
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.990
<v 0>they go to bed at night.
It's like a little ritual.</v>

2098
02:04:39.991 --> 02:04:42.930
They like drinking water before they go to bed and they want to choose which one

2099
02:04:42.931 --> 02:04:46.020
they get.
So each night one of them would get to Eenie Meenie Miney Mo.

2100
02:04:46.110 --> 02:04:50.340
So they'll go eeny meeny miny moe.
But it's catch a tiger.
I've never heard.

2101
02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:53.390
<v 3>That's how I always thought it.
I never even heard of it.
So when you,</v>

2102
02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:56.710
when saying this,
you're talking about like the original original,

2103
02:04:57.310 --> 02:05:01.450
like this is like a Jim crow slavery nursery rhyme.
Well,

2104
02:05:01.451 --> 02:05:04.720
I don't think it is.
I mean he's using it as one,

2105
02:05:04.721 --> 02:05:09.190
but I've always heard it is catch a tiger by the toe and you could add a racial

2106
02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:11.830
thing.
I've always heard that,

2107
02:05:11.831 --> 02:05:16.540
but this might go back that far back might be where you actually got it from
him.

2108
02:05:17.050 --> 02:05:20.190
<v 0>It might be because he's in England,
you know,
in England,
if you,</v>

2109
02:05:20.191 --> 02:05:22.330
if it does go back all the way to England,

2110
02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:25.450
I mean it might've been one of those things like powdered wigs.

2111
02:05:25.670 --> 02:05:30.440
The guy over here,
we swapped it around and you're like,
let's make it tiger.

2112
02:05:30.490 --> 02:05:33.910
You shouldn't,
you know,
but he's,

2113
02:05:33.911 --> 02:05:38.710
he's also said a lot of dumb racist shit before they were slagging on Mexicans

2114
02:05:38.711 --> 02:05:40.000
in the worst way ever.

2115
02:05:40.001 --> 02:05:44.370
Once they were just generally talking about I'm making a Mac.

2116
02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:48.920
It was about making a Mexican car and then,
and they were joking around about,

2117
02:05:49.030 --> 02:05:51.700
could you imagine being born a Mexican?
You know,

2118
02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:55.120
what would it be like to be a Mexican and this really bad jokes?

2119
02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:59.140
It was pull that shit up,
pull it,
pull it up.
The,
the um,

2120
02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:02.590
top gear Mexican remarks.

2121
02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:06.970
It was really gross man because it was so obvious that they were trying to set

2122
02:06:06.971 --> 02:06:07.900
up jokes.

2123
02:06:08.410 --> 02:06:13.390
It was real obvious like for as a comic is it's awkward to watch cause it's real

2124
02:06:13.391 --> 02:06:18.010
clunky and then the payoff is just racist racism.
Fuck.

2125
02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:22.540
Just total racism.
There wasn't anything good about it.

2126
02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:26.420
<v 7>Mexican car cause the cars reflect national characteristics to others.</v>

2127
02:06:26.430 --> 02:06:31.430
So German cars are sort of halo build and and Tommy and caused a bit flamboyant

2128
02:06:31.570 --> 02:06:35.590
and quick Mexican cars just going to be lazy,
feckless flats

2129
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:41.140
leaning against the fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole

2130
02:06:41.141 --> 02:06:42.310
in the middle.
Donors a coat.

2131
02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:47.600
<v 0>Keep it going cause it gets crazier edited.</v>

2132
02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:53.000
So yeah.
Oh it gets crazier.
He says you got the wrong one.
Try.

2133
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:56.630
If you try to find where that goes on from like leaf version,

2134
02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:57.890
they shouldn't have that.
Correct.

2135
02:06:59.070 --> 02:07:03.180
<v 7>I've said some racist shit before but this is offensive cars pushed and pulled</v>

2136
02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:06.580
ahead of sir cause we already heard most of it can cause to be flamboyant and

2137
02:07:06.581 --> 02:07:07.340
quick.

2138
02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:11.590
It's skin sportscar 33,000 pounds.

2139
02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:13.000
That isn't enough.

2140
02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:17.440
Isn't enough because there has been somebody who's paid for that to be developed

2141
02:07:17.441 --> 02:07:20.660
and it's got to be shipped.
So it's,
I'd say tell him to quit to the car though.

2142
02:07:21.570 --> 02:07:26.020
But they do say,
and they're blurred.
He's got rack and pinion steering.
Wow.

2143
02:07:26.021 --> 02:07:29.040
It's got steering.
I'm sorry.

2144
02:07:29.050 --> 02:07:32.160
But just imagine waking up and remembering your Mexico

2145
02:07:34.110 --> 02:07:35.980
can just,
you can just go

2146
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.270
<v 12>straight back to sleep again.
I'm going to new old day.</v>

2147
02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:42.850
That's what I'd be looking to get any complaints about this because the Mexican

2148
02:07:42.851 --> 02:07:46.030
embassy,
the ambassador is going to be sitting there with it,
so at,

2149
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:49.660
I won't complain.
It's fine.

2150
02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:58.010
<v 0>Yeah.
Whoops.
Yeah.
This guy,
my Mexican friends did not tolerate this man.</v>

2151
02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:01.280
He's been saying racist shit that shows what I'm saying.
Race you shit.

2152
02:08:01.281 --> 02:08:04.670
I think it's a good show.
They say funny Shit,
Jeremy Clarkson's hilarious.

2153
02:08:04.671 --> 02:08:08.490
But that,
you know,
maybe it's just a different attitude over there.

2154
02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:09.620
Maybe it's a cultural thing.

2155
02:08:09.710 --> 02:08:13.770
<v 3>I think it's a superiority complex for sure.
And uh,</v>

2156
02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:18.920
just the fact that,
I guess when,
when did that episode a year?

2157
02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:22.320
Couple of years ago,
I think it was black.

2158
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:24.570
<v 0>There was some blow back but not enough to cancel it.</v>

2159
02:08:24.571 --> 02:08:28.500
They just said it was the number one show,
reality show in the world,

2160
02:08:28.710 --> 02:08:31.830
essentially non scripted show in the world.
But it is scripted.

2161
02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:34.920
It's obviously scripted.
That was all scripted.
All that shit mean.

2162
02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:38.520
Did they say nonfiction?
Is that what they said?
Whatever it is.

2163
02:08:38.521 --> 02:08:42.750
Nonfiction non-scripted that was so obviously scripted.

2164
02:08:42.751 --> 02:08:43.590
It was gross.

2165
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:47.670
And that whole thing of imagine waking up and remembering your Mexican,

2166
02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:52.320
that is a crazy thing to say.
Stone cold say that.
The Oscar de la Hoya,

2167
02:08:53.250 --> 02:08:57.240
you know.
See that's the most ridiculous thing to say ever.

2168
02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:02.100
The idea that that would be enough to be a joke,
like a set up and a punchline.

2169
02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:04.740
<v 3>And the audience was laughing too.
So it's like,</v>

2170
02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:09.090
I don't even like where Mexican comics make Mexican jokes,

2171
02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:14.150
<v 0>you know?
Um,
uh,</v>

2172
02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:18.570
Anthony Bordain put a Tumblr blog entry recently,

2173
02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:20.820
like yesterday about Mexico,

2174
02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:24.930
about how crazy is it that we love Mexican food.

2175
02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:29.580
We love their style of clothing.
We love a lot of their architecture.

2176
02:09:29.581 --> 02:09:32.670
We love all these different things about Mexico and about that come from Mexico.

2177
02:09:32.671 --> 02:09:33.690
But we don't love Mexico.

2178
02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:38.130
Like what is it like that Mexico has this negative connotation.
They,

2179
02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:42.160
he just goes into like how important their culture has been food wise.

2180
02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:45.180
Whenever he worked at a restaurant I was always the Mexicans that hooked him up

2181
02:09:45.181 --> 02:09:48.750
and helped him out and some of the hardest working people he's ever met and the

2182
02:09:48.751 --> 02:09:53.160
most dedicated to to cooking all these different things and he made this great

2183
02:09:53.161 --> 02:09:57.870
point like what the fuck is it about us that has this weird prejudice towards

2184
02:09:57.871 --> 02:10:02.640
Mexico and Mexican people when so much great shit has come from that culture.

2185
02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:07.920
Like clearly it's a country that's in turmoil financially and in leadership wise

2186
02:10:08.041 --> 02:10:09.870
and the drug war and all that.

2187
02:10:09.871 --> 02:10:13.950
I mean there's obviously problems with Mexico but to ignore all the amazing shit

2188
02:10:13.951 --> 02:10:14.790
that they've created.

2189
02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:19.020
And I mean just go all the way back to when you know the Aztecs were building

2190
02:10:19.021 --> 02:10:22.950
these gigantic fucking pyramids here.
It's beautiful structures.
Go back to them,

2191
02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:25.350
the Mayans all the same essentially.

2192
02:10:25.380 --> 02:10:28.710
I mean all that eventually became the people of Mexico.

2193
02:10:29.010 --> 02:10:32.610
If you go down to like Cheech and eatsa where the Mayan temple is,

2194
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:35.870
you still see people that are,
they're Mayan man,
right?

2195
02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:37.640
I mean you can call Mexico if you want,

2196
02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:43.130
but they're like four foot five and they have these crazy like long like,

2197
02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:47.330
like American Indian looking faces.
Like they look very different.

2198
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:52.070
Like there's some people down like in the Yucatan that they're essentially

2199
02:10:52.071 --> 02:10:56.450
descendants of the Mayans.
Man.
I mean that is a part of Mexican culture.

2200
02:10:57.350 --> 02:11:00.980
And Anthony Bordain makes a really interesting point about that.

2201
02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:02.180
<v 3>That's a,
that's a dope article.</v>

2202
02:11:02.181 --> 02:11:07.181
I'm going to stop being racist because now he's right.

2203
02:11:07.370 --> 02:11:10.610
As far as the article is concerned,
it's just,
you know,

2204
02:11:10.611 --> 02:11:14.210
I think racism is like the main ingredient.

2205
02:11:14.230 --> 02:11:19.010
Twitters is insecurity and just,
you know,
just in anything,

2206
02:11:19.011 --> 02:11:20.690
even in comedy or anything,

2207
02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:26.360
people always find a way to put themselves above another person.

2208
02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:31.580
Sometimes that involves color and race and sometimes people with money,

2209
02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:32.640
you know,

2210
02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:35.720
there might be somebody else the same color and they have more money and they'll

2211
02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:37.780
find a way to put them down.
So there's classism,

2212
02:11:37.950 --> 02:11:41.750
but it's all rooted in insecurity.
And they could do a lot of damage.

2213
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:43.143
It just fucked up.

2214
02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:46.410
<v 0>It is fucked up.
And you know what else you see?
It is weird.
A weird place.</v>

2215
02:11:46.770 --> 02:11:48.670
You see it with famous people,
right?

2216
02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:51.030
Like do you ever be hanging around with a couple of famous dudes and a more

2217
02:11:51.031 --> 02:11:54.930
famous personal walk in and just Trump the famous person again,

2218
02:11:55.050 --> 02:11:59.640
have to just of those like Fox events were all these like actors all get

2219
02:11:59.641 --> 02:12:01.590
together and they were like,
they have like a,

2220
02:12:01.970 --> 02:12:05.050
like almost like a pecking order and they'll,

2221
02:12:05.051 --> 02:12:08.210
they'll treat the other ones like shit because this one's on a TV show.

2222
02:12:08.211 --> 02:12:09.450
Like these two guys.

2223
02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:14.220
I watched these two guys argue once and one of them was an actor who did films

2224
02:12:14.221 --> 02:12:16.500
and the other one was an actor who did tell her shit.

2225
02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:20.670
And the actor who did films was saying,
no,
no,
no,
you do shit.

2226
02:12:20.850 --> 02:12:24.270
I do films.
Don't say you do what I do.
And they were like,

2227
02:12:24.271 --> 02:12:27.960
what can they do it like he was like saying,
you do you do television?
I do films.

2228
02:12:27.961 --> 02:12:30.960
And they were,
they were bitching at each other.
And that's what they were using.

2229
02:12:31.110 --> 02:12:34.980
The one guy was holding over the TV stars head.
He's a loser.

2230
02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:40.650
He is a fucking TV show and some days calling him a loser.

2231
02:12:40.710 --> 02:12:43.440
I could understand him.
He was talking to a soap opera star,
but come on man.

2232
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:45.950
Even if you worked,
did you hear about that soap operas started.

2233
02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:49.920
Did a Iowasca any fucking quit his job.
Oh for real?
Yeah.

2234
02:12:49.921 --> 02:12:53.460
Some do on days of our lives.
She was like,
fuck this.

2235
02:12:54.150 --> 02:12:57.600
He did IOWASCA tripped his balls off.
Opened up.
Yeah.

2236
02:12:57.601 --> 02:13:01.110
He got an open way the fuck up.
He came back and he said,
this is just nonsense.

2237
02:13:01.111 --> 02:13:05.550
I'm not doing this anymore.
Right?
Yeah.
There he is.
You quit days of awesome.

2238
02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:09.240
How long has he been on there?
I don't know if he's been on there.

2239
02:13:10.110 --> 02:13:11.610
They all want to quit though,
man.

2240
02:13:11.670 --> 02:13:15.840
I had a buddy who was on a soap opera for a long time.
He fucking hated it.

2241
02:13:15.841 --> 02:13:18.960
He'd rather not worked and be on a soap opera.
Why did he do it?

2242
02:13:18.961 --> 02:13:20.400
Keep doing it too.
Was trying to just,

2243
02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:24.540
he was trying to be an actor and you know when you're trying to be an actor and

2244
02:13:24.541 --> 02:13:25.201
you have the choice,

2245
02:13:25.201 --> 02:13:28.760
you can work as a bartender or you could work as a soap star.
You're like,

2246
02:13:28.770 --> 02:13:31.760
oh well you know what?
A lot of people who've made it from soap star legitimate,

2247
02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:37.170
but there's a certain amount of time you can,
you can only,
you have to bail.

2248
02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:40.980
Like as far as like the industry classism,
I think they look at you.

2249
02:13:40.981 --> 02:13:44.310
If you're on a soap for too long,
they go,
this motherfucker's or so

2250
02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:46.960
<v 8>it's like the fact guy thing.
It's talking about you</v>

2251
02:13:47.650 --> 02:13:50.110
<v 0>soap opera,
they actor.
Listen you,</v>

2252
02:13:50.111 --> 02:13:53.870
you've been a villain on this soap opera.
It's been amazing.
Right?

2253
02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:57.380
For 50 years and you're going to continue to do that.
Like no,
no,
no,
I'm,

2254
02:13:57.381 --> 02:13:59.890
I'm about to break out box come mainstream now.

2255
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:04.460
<v 8>We don't allow it.
Yeah.
We don't allow it.
I get that.
I get that too.
Do you?</v>

2256
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:06.810
Yeah.
Not,
not the villain thing,

2257
02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:11.160
but like when I went to Montreal the last time,

2258
02:14:11.161 --> 02:14:13.380
two years at the comedy festival comedy festival,

2259
02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:16.260
it didn't matter how good I did,

2260
02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:21.740
they were looking at 25 year olds and anybody who was older who was a star,

2261
02:14:22.890 --> 02:14:27.490
if you fell in the middle like me,
Zach,
Saran over you,
like,

2262
02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:31.500
like you're like,
you're done.
You didn't do it at the time.

2263
02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:36.300
Like it was just that.
But if you were 25 and had one good joke in your,

2264
02:14:36.450 --> 02:14:41.280
in your set,
then it's,
it was,
it's like the youth rush.

2265
02:14:41.550 --> 02:14:45.520
That's interesting.
And it,
but it was,
it was good for me to see that.

2266
02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:48.900
And that was like that.
And a few other things is like,
all right,

2267
02:14:48.930 --> 02:14:50.760
I got to figure out a way to get my shit together.

2268
02:14:51.010 --> 02:14:54.730
<v 0>That's really fascinating.
He man,
so that's just like what they're selling,
right?</v>

2269
02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:57.010
They're just trying to sell.
There's trying to sell you

2270
02:14:57.010 --> 02:15:00.990
<v 8>young,
right?
Yeah,
they are.
It's selling youth.
And,
uh,</v>

2271
02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:05.020
my manager spoke to my ex agent when it,

2272
02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:08.530
like I had the agent before I had the manager and my manager's like,

2273
02:15:08.531 --> 02:15:12.580
we got to get even more money for these college gigs or these,

2274
02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:16.780
these shows and uh,
about my agent told my manager,

2275
02:15:17.890 --> 02:15:20.020
Ian's time has passed.
It's the most you can get from him.

2276
02:15:20.210 --> 02:15:21.710
<v 0>Whoa.</v>

2277
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:23.090
<v 8>Funny.
Didn't matter.
Nothing.</v>

2278
02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:25.350
<v 0>You know,
it's really stupid about that at all.</v>

2279
02:15:25.351 --> 02:15:30.351
All the things that you do like as an art form [inaudible] the being a comedian,

2280
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:36.270
like being young is probably the least important because being older you're

2281
02:15:36.581 --> 02:15:38.020
going to have more knowledge,
right?

2282
02:15:38.070 --> 02:15:41.740
You didn't have more opinions on things and you recognize bullshit easier.

2283
02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:43.840
You'll see the bullshit in yourself,
you recognize you,

2284
02:15:43.841 --> 02:15:48.820
but you just become so much better as you get older as a comic that the young

2285
02:15:48.821 --> 02:15:52.600
guys like,
man,
when I was 21,
I always say this,
I sucked.

2286
02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:55.420
I was a terrible comedian and one of the reasons why I was a terrible comedian

2287
02:15:55.421 --> 02:15:57.230
is fucking everybody's terrible when they're 21.
Right?

2288
02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:00.460
You might have a couple of good jokes.
You might have a couple of the he he's,

2289
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:02.560
and so when you start making points,

2290
02:16:02.770 --> 02:16:06.580
if you're making a point about anything and your 21 nobody wants to listen to

2291
02:16:06.581 --> 02:16:07.180
you,
dude,

2292
02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:11.050
you're too dumb because very few people that are 21 years old that can carry a

2293
02:16:11.051 --> 02:16:14.680
nuanced point on stage in front of a room full of strangers about a

2294
02:16:14.681 --> 02:16:17.320
controversial issue and say it in a way it's going to make everybody laugh

2295
02:16:17.321 --> 02:16:21.880
hysterically.
It's rare.
You got your rare Chappelle's you got your rare,

2296
02:16:21.881 --> 02:16:24.070
you know I'm sure Eddie Murphy when he was young it was crushing.

2297
02:16:24.250 --> 02:16:26.050
It wasn't as like,
it wasn't

2298
02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:30.210
<v 8>poignant but he was,
he had that funding [inaudible]</v>

2299
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:34.480
<v 1>killing it but for the most part,
most 21 year olds are dark shit.
Right.</v>

2300
02:16:34.510 --> 02:16:36.700
They just dog shit their kids,
they don't know any of that.

2301
02:16:36.770 --> 02:16:38.020
They don't know anything yet but,

2302
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:43.300
<v 8>but the built the business doesn't care.
It was like,</v>

2303
02:16:43.301 --> 02:16:46.630
and to me funny is young,
as long as you're funny.
It's young.

2304
02:16:46.990 --> 02:16:51.520
Like people just want to laugh and if you're funny they don't give a fuck how

2305
02:16:51.521 --> 02:16:53.620
old you are.
Like this guy.
Like when I was a kid,

2306
02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:56.680
I was watching Benny Hill because he was fucking funny.

2307
02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:01.600
His age never mattered to me,
but now they are making that shit.

2308
02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:05.570
<v 1>Well I think they want to sell you like a symbol.</v>

2309
02:17:05.571 --> 02:17:08.210
You know that girls are going to get into you.
It's,
they're going to,
you know,

2310
02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:12.160
it's going to be like when Dane Cook was in as my space prime,
you know,

2311
02:17:12.170 --> 02:17:14.630
they're going to flock to see your shows.
Oh my God.

2312
02:17:15.890 --> 02:17:19.430
And you got to admit that that's a,
an attractant.
Whether it's as a singer,

2313
02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:23.990
it's attracting as an actor and she could be as a comedian too,
right?

2314
02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:26.390
But not if you're really into standup comedy.

2315
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:28.070
And if you're really into standup comedy,

2316
02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:33.250
you go to see Louis C K he's in his forties he's fat and he's hilarious.

2317
02:17:33.351 --> 02:17:34.880
And he's attracted everybody.

2318
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:39.530
You're trying to attract to be attracted to those 20 something year olds.
So,

2319
02:17:39.710 --> 02:17:44.420
but,
and when he was 30 he wasn't doing so well.
Right.
So when he was,
you know,

2320
02:17:44.421 --> 02:17:46.430
he's probably like,
I think he's older than me.

2321
02:17:46.430 --> 02:17:49.430
I'm 46 so I think he's 47 or something like that.

2322
02:17:49.670 --> 02:17:53.900
So when he was 36 37,
nobody gave a fuck about him.

2323
02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:57.530
It's the sort of same situation and now look,
boom,
you know,

2324
02:17:57.770 --> 02:18:00.010
arguably the number one comic in the world.
So,

2325
02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:04.090
and then you got David towl better now than ever.
Right.

2326
02:18:04.130 --> 02:18:08.490
Better now than ever.
And he's 50 and there's rock still go in and just going.

2327
02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:11.180
I just,
there's tons of people.
Yeah.
Even fucking Jerry Seinfeld,

2328
02:18:11.181 --> 02:18:15.590
he's like 62 there,
you know,
I mean,
when,
when a comic learns how to be a comic,

2329
02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:20.260
I keep hearing and I need to see him to see it myself.
Like bill Cosby.
Yes.

2330
02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.910
Yes.
I hear the same shit.
I need to see him too.
Let's go see him.
Okay.

2331
02:18:25.130 --> 02:18:29.280
Let's find out when he is here and yeah,
I keep hearing that.
Yeah.

2332
02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:30.560
I keep hearing that he's killing it.

2333
02:18:30.590 --> 02:18:32.780
I keep hearing he's killing it and I'm hearing it from people outside.

2334
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:36.920
Showbusiness I held it from a dude I know in Austin.
He's not,

2335
02:18:36.921 --> 02:18:40.670
has nothing to do with show business.
Right.
And,
uh,
he was telling me,
he's like,

2336
02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:43.880
me and my friends would see bill Cosby.
I'll log,
what was it like?
He's like,
dude,

2337
02:18:44.510 --> 02:18:48.290
he goes,
you wouldn't believe it man.
He goes,
he,
he,
he's telling these stories.

2338
02:18:48.350 --> 02:18:51.590
At first you're like,
man,
these fucking stories.
He'd taken a long time.

2339
02:18:51.770 --> 02:18:55.490
He goes and then five minutes and you are fucking crying,
laugh.

2340
02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:59.240
And then you realize how he's tying all these stories in together and you're

2341
02:18:59.241 --> 02:19:03.590
like,
I'm watching a master doesn't have an opening act goes on stage by himself.

2342
02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:08.390
Right.
He does like 90 minutes,
two hours,
just him himself and it's captivating.

2343
02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:10.430
That's the Shit I've been hearing.
Keep hearing it.

2344
02:19:10.490 --> 02:19:13.220
I don't hear anybody saying it's bad.
Nobody.
No.

2345
02:19:13.250 --> 02:19:16.100
I'm hearing over and over again that it's killer.
He's like 80 years old.

2346
02:19:16.101 --> 02:19:20.480
He's getting street reviews.
Yeah.
What?
Oh,
like word of mouth.

2347
02:19:20.510 --> 02:19:21.343
That's amazing.

2348
02:19:21.610 --> 02:19:24.430
<v 8>Like word of mouth is like an underground young band coming up.</v>

2349
02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:28.130
So that's what I'm saying.
Funny transcends

2350
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.160
<v 5>like you're hearing the same thing.
I'm hearing that I have a few friends,</v>

2351
02:19:31.161 --> 02:19:34.070
I went to see him and they're like,
you got to see him.
And it's on my,

2352
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:37.940
one of my list of things to go see.
It's like going to Coachella.

2353
02:19:37.941 --> 02:19:39.140
I gotta go see this dude.

2354
02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:43.320
<v 0>Yeah,
we got to see him before.
Okay.
Check this out.</v>

2355
02:19:43.380 --> 02:19:47.440
I think I'm going to be in Vegas when he's there.
Oh Shit.

2356
02:19:47.940 --> 02:19:49.500
Hold on a second.
It's um,

2357
02:19:50.190 --> 02:19:55.190
there's a UFC on the 24th and Bill Cosby is in Vegas on the 23rd.

2358
02:19:56.460 --> 02:20:00.390
Oh Shit.
Perfect.
Treasure island showroom.
Please tell me you want to,

2359
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:05.050
<v 5>I'll come out there know not in Vegas.
All right,
cool.
I'm not do it with me.</v>

2360
02:20:05.051 --> 02:20:07.130
If you want,
I'll get you tickets to the UFC to its next.

2361
02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:11.170
I'll do that to boom again.
Yeah.
Do you want to see Cosby?

2362
02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:14.560
Are you gonna fuck yeah,
you have the attention span,

2363
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:21.730
but it is kind of,
it's not really standard visit though.

2364
02:20:21.731 --> 02:20:23.920
It's kind of like a one man play.
I don't know.

2365
02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:27.310
I don't even want to judge what it is.
I don't know what it is,

2366
02:20:27.550 --> 02:20:29.260
but I need to find out if I can get to,
it's funny,

2367
02:20:29.261 --> 02:20:33.060
I wanted to defend what it is and I don't even know.
All right.

2368
02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:35.110
We'll talk about this after.
But I'm just like,

2369
02:20:35.111 --> 02:20:39.520
now that I know that this is a possibility and it's a night at half off perfect.

2370
02:20:40.170 --> 02:20:44.760
<v 0>Wayne's during the day and then the nighttime I have off but it's probably about</v>

2371
02:20:44.770 --> 02:20:46.890
like a six o'clock show tickets available.

2372
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:51.660
Oh people probably falsely says a 8:00 PM Oh shit.
They're staying awake.

2373
02:20:51.690 --> 02:20:54.240
Oh my God.
Who's there next week man.
See Ya

2374
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:59.090
<v 5>right after bill copy birthday cardio.
That is ironic as fuck.</v>

2375
02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:06.970
Cause he took a Mitzia took a Cosby joke to him.

2376
02:21:08.290 --> 02:21:09.540
That was the final nail in the [inaudible] on the

2377
02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:13.710
<v 0>coffin when people saw him do a bill copy.
That's hilarious.</v>

2378
02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:16.860
And wonder bill thinks when he sees that he probably doesn't even know.

2379
02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:20.190
He probably didn't even fucking heard about the video and he probably has no

2380
02:21:20.191 --> 02:21:22.230
idea that it got busted stealing his joke.

2381
02:21:22.231 --> 02:21:25.490
So I doubt he pays attention to it at all.

2382
02:21:26.250 --> 02:21:30.150
But apparently the motherfucker keeps writing and I say motherfucker with all

2383
02:21:30.151 --> 02:21:32.790
due respect.
Yeah.
Is there a tickets still available?
I don't know.

2384
02:21:32.791 --> 02:21:33.810
We'll find out after the show.

2385
02:21:33.811 --> 02:21:37.160
I don't want to be investigating during the program,
but um,

2386
02:21:37.230 --> 02:21:38.760
I think that's a great idea,
man.

2387
02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:41.400
I really need to see it because I keep hearing it,
man.

2388
02:21:41.401 --> 02:21:43.190
Chris Rock was the first one I heard it from.
Yeah.

2389
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:48.180
He said that shit to Seinfeld said it.
Yeah.
Chris Rock was a fascinating name,

2390
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:51.330
shaking his head and he goes,
ah.
He goes,
I felt like I was like an amateur.

2391
02:21:52.060 --> 02:21:54.870
Watch that guy up there.
Cause I felt like I was an amateur.
I was like,
wow,

2392
02:21:54.871 --> 02:21:59.790
that's crazy.
And he goes,
he goes up there with no,
no,
no opening act.

2393
02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:03.240
That's like an hour and a half by himself.
Said it was amazing.
I was like,
wow,

2394
02:22:03.241 --> 02:22:04.080
that's incredible.

2395
02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:07.560
What do you know what some one thing if this guy who was my friend in Austin

2396
02:22:07.561 --> 02:22:08.340
says it,

2397
02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:11.970
but when that guy says exactly the same thing as Chris rock gotta listen,

2398
02:22:12.030 --> 02:22:13.770
you gotta go to something,
something's going on.

2399
02:22:13.771 --> 02:22:17.640
And I would assume Chris rock is pretty critical.
How do you not be,
I mean,

2400
02:22:17.641 --> 02:22:19.950
he's an icon for sure.
Like,
I've heard people say,

2401
02:22:19.951 --> 02:22:22.290
there's some old dudes that were really funny that really weren't funny.

2402
02:22:23.170 --> 02:22:25.080
There was a few guys,
oh my God,
you never seen,

2403
02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:27.880
he's hilarious and you seem it's dog shit.
It's just,

2404
02:22:28.170 --> 02:22:29.850
he's just an old dude that people like,

2405
02:22:29.851 --> 02:22:32.550
people don't want to say nothing bad about it.
They don't want to say,

2406
02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:35.400
I'd be disappointed that this didn't live up to it.

2407
02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:38.370
Now we put all this hype behind it.
We're going to have to get drunk

2408
02:22:40.810 --> 02:22:44.760
to get hammered and make it even better and then embarrass ourselves by trying

2409
02:22:44.761 --> 02:22:45.910
to meet him and getting shut down.

2410
02:22:47.850 --> 02:22:52.660
We went to see dice backstage.
We went to see a dice rather,
um,
at the um,

2411
02:22:53.050 --> 02:22:54.090
uh,
the Riviera,

2412
02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:57.570
which is one of the best places to see him cause it's all old school and it's

2413
02:22:57.571 --> 02:23:02.571
upstairs and it was Jim Norton and Anthony Cohlmia and Brian and me and we all

2414
02:23:04.471 --> 02:23:06.690
had off.
We,
nobody had to work.
So it was just,

2415
02:23:06.750 --> 02:23:09.000
it was a treat just to be able to sit there and watch dice.

2416
02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:12.780
And then we went backstage and was like talking to him like this might be one of

2417
02:23:12.781 --> 02:23:14.420
the coolest things I've ever done.

2418
02:23:14.850 --> 02:23:18.590
Gone to see a show and then gone backstage to hang out with dice clay after a

2419
02:23:18.591 --> 02:23:22.110
show in Vegas.
It was really cool,
but dice knows me.

2420
02:23:22.330 --> 02:23:26.290
Bill Cosby would just kick us right then.
Scrubs.
Fuck out of here.

2421
02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:31.220
I'll causing my,
yeah.

2422
02:23:32.220 --> 02:23:37.050
Jello pudding.
Red Bands are going to start doing his own thing.

2423
02:23:37.630 --> 02:23:40.350
Yeah.
Oh Shit.
They're definitely gonna get kicked out.

2424
02:23:43.290 --> 02:23:46.710
Imagine if you did that in his room.
He would beat you to death

2425
02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:52.330
with sinks.
Bill Cosby,
Bill Cosby Beats Brian.
Read married with a lamp,

2426
02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:55.650
picks up the lamp and breaks it over your head and then stabs you in the neck

2427
02:23:55.651 --> 02:23:59.490
with the broken pieces.
Is there even any footage of bill Cosby versus heckler?

2428
02:23:59.491 --> 02:24:01.350
I Bet I would love to see what he would,

2429
02:24:01.650 --> 02:24:06.360
his response to that would be they probably don't allow hecklers at his shows on

2430
02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:09.760
those fucking people so quick.
Yeah,
he's,
I mean,

2431
02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:11.400
he's not doing that kind of comedy.

2432
02:24:11.401 --> 02:24:15.240
He's doing the kind of comedy where it's like these long monologues that are

2433
02:24:15.241 --> 02:24:16.230
stories,
you know,

2434
02:24:16.231 --> 02:24:21.231
that he's crap crafted and molded to like the perfect amount of words he,

2435
02:24:22.471 --> 02:24:26.280
you know,
he used to,
it's kind of fascinating.
I mean now he's doing shows,

2436
02:24:26.281 --> 02:24:28.770
obviously if you go to bill cosby.com a lot of shows,

2437
02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:31.230
he's got a lot of shows planned out like over and over,

2438
02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:34.230
like May 9th two shows in a night.

2439
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:37.120
On May 9th May 10th he's got a show May 11th may,

2440
02:24:37.330 --> 02:24:42.210
I mean he's working.
I don't think if I had his money,

2441
02:24:42.211 --> 02:24:45.990
there's no way I'd still be doing.
I think he enjoys it,
but got it.

2442
02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:48.490
What I'm hearing is,
or what I was hearing before he,

2443
02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:51.900
he was doing all these shows was that he would go and do like a,

2444
02:24:51.930 --> 02:24:54.930
like a tonight show or a Letterman appearance,
one of those type of things.

2445
02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:56.580
He didn't even practice the material.

2446
02:24:56.790 --> 02:25:01.320
He would just write it to write it himself and he would work on it himself and

2447
02:25:01.321 --> 02:25:04.080
then he would go onto these shows and just do it.

2448
02:25:04.470 --> 02:25:08.400
The first time he was doing it was on live TV and they would say,
you know,

2449
02:25:08.401 --> 02:25:10.320
don't you go to the comedy clubs and practice like,

2450
02:25:10.321 --> 02:25:14.430
I ain't know how to do comedy.
Like his,
in his mind,

2451
02:25:14.431 --> 02:25:17.400
he knew how to discern what was good,
what was bad,

2452
02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:22.470
crafted all himself and then release it into the wild.
I had enough practice.

2453
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:23.710
He trusted himself

2454
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:26.670
<v 3>and he,
I guess he's honest enough with themselves to say,
this is funny.</v>

2455
02:25:26.671 --> 02:25:27.504
It's not funny.

2456
02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:30.700
<v 1>Yeah.
That's fascinating.
In and of itself.
That's a,</v>

2457
02:25:30.701 --> 02:25:34.690
that's an interesting point of view.
I mean,
I guess you get to,
it sounds,

2458
02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:38.850
<v 3>oh z,
right?
Fuck yeah,
it does.
It sounds ballsy,
but you should.
Yeah.
Like you said,</v>

2459
02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:40.680
when you get to a certain age,
you should know,

2460
02:25:40.681 --> 02:25:45.270
but it still sounds ballsy and appoint that I'm not definitely not it.

2461
02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:50.150
<v 1>Yeah.
Real,
real,
real,
ballsy.
But he also got in some trouble,</v>

2462
02:25:50.151 --> 02:25:54.080
man.
There was some,
he had to settle a lawsuit.
Someone accusing him of,

2463
02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:59.550
there was like some drug thing,
some date rape pills.
Yeah.
Well,

2464
02:25:59.750 --> 02:26:02.870
girls,
again,
man,
sexual assault allegations

2465
02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:06.750
<v 3>doesn't matter who you are.
You cannot escape vagina.</v>

2466
02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:09.360
<v 1>We'll get you.
We'll get you,
man.</v>

2467
02:26:09.450 --> 02:26:13.220
Maybe we answered the question like why is he still doing stand that pay off

2468
02:26:13.221 --> 02:26:17.090
these suits,
pay off these suits.
That's probably a big factor.

2469
02:26:17.870 --> 02:26:19.910
And then on top of that,
it probably,

2470
02:26:19.911 --> 02:26:22.590
because he can still get some pussy on the road

2471
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:27.740
and I still bill Cosby,
Bill Cosby at man,

2472
02:26:27.741 --> 02:26:31.550
it's still nothing better than road pussy.
Isn't that amazing?
That's ridiculous.

2473
02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:35.720
Could you imagine if that was the case?
If you pulled him aside and he said,
Bill,

2474
02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:38.510
it's amazing that you're still doing all these shows.
Like what's up?

2475
02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:43.280
I got two words for you
and it gives you

2476
02:26:46.270 --> 02:26:47.520
the impression do it,
but is it,

2477
02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:53.420
and I'm not even going to press this as a terrible bill Cosby,

2478
02:26:53.421 --> 02:26:57.410
but it's better than mine.
That's what I've never tried to do.
Jello pudding.

2479
02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.750
I sound like Red Fox.
Oh Man.
I need to rethink my cosmic impression.
Yeah,
he's,

2480
02:27:02.810 --> 02:27:06.380
he's on stage.
This is just some fascinating shit.
He's got a hearing aid on.

2481
02:27:06.690 --> 02:27:10.250
No Shit.
It's just somebody reading in the lines,
but look at,
he's got this thing.

2482
02:27:10.490 --> 02:27:14.250
I mean it looks like a hearing aid.
I mean what is that?
He's old man.
Damn.
Yeah,

2483
02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:19.100
it's old.
Yeah.
I mean he's like,
it's got like this wired thing.

2484
02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:23.300
Maybe it's a so he could hear what the audience is hearing.
It might be that.

2485
02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:26.990
Is that his microphone?
Cause you have a mic in front of him or,
I don't know.

2486
02:27:26.991 --> 02:27:28.880
It's hard to tell.
It's a weird picture.
It looks,

2487
02:27:28.910 --> 02:27:31.940
it doesn't look like a microphone in his hand unless he uses a really tiny

2488
02:27:31.941 --> 02:27:33.950
microphone.
But it's lip syncs.
The whole thing.

2489
02:27:34.610 --> 02:27:38.000
Imagine if he does because he's so old.
That's how he does it.
He doesn't like,

2490
02:27:38.060 --> 02:27:41.350
like Britney Spears does commercial concerts.

2491
02:27:42.020 --> 02:27:45.830
Can you imagine if a Guy Lipsync standup?
Has anyone ever done that before?

2492
02:27:45.831 --> 02:27:48.690
I'd asked,
but it's hilarious.
That would be so hard.

2493
02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:52.860
It's so hard to do to,
to lip sync your stand up.

2494
02:27:53.290 --> 02:27:55.340
Cause I do a different every night.

2495
02:27:55.700 --> 02:27:58.970
I just know where it'd be able to lip sync it like it never glass drops.

2496
02:27:59.330 --> 02:28:03.500
You keep going have keep going and play it off.
But you didn't hear it.

2497
02:28:03.710 --> 02:28:05.020
Places on fire.
You're still going.

2498
02:28:07.850 --> 02:28:11.450
I'm going to do my act in the back.
If you don't burn alive,
but please laugh.

2499
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:14.610
People were running out to do the heroes soundtrack.

2500
02:28:14.730 --> 02:28:17.660
This is a fucking laugh track.
No one's laughing.
We're on fire.

2501
02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:22.900
And then I wasn't like,
hi mom.
Hello.

2502
02:28:23.020 --> 02:28:24.130
<v 0>It'd be funny shit.</v>

2503
02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:27.340
I'm sure someone's done it cause anyone ever juice the audience before?

2504
02:28:27.341 --> 02:28:28.930
Has anybody ever used like a laugh track?

2505
02:28:28.931 --> 02:28:32.980
Like whether on stage that that sounds disgusting.
That's him.

2506
02:28:33.450 --> 02:28:37.270
Must've been done.
Must have been done.
Somebody must've done it.

2507
02:28:37.450 --> 02:28:39.520
If you can think of it,
somebody must have done it.

2508
02:28:41.140 --> 02:28:44.530
People are always accusing people of planting,
putting a plant in the audience.

2509
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:46.450
Heckles says something stupid.

2510
02:28:46.451 --> 02:28:49.690
So the guy on stage give a perfect thing to say to him.
Like Deco wasn't,

2511
02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:52.180
he's a plant,
they planted them in the audience.

2512
02:28:52.660 --> 02:28:55.960
Now I'm sure that's happened because I've heard of it happening and like sort of

2513
02:28:55.961 --> 02:29:00.460
like fake like performance art type scenarios and shows.

2514
02:29:01.180 --> 02:29:02.013
But uh,

2515
02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:06.300
<v 5>I know it happens when you watch most comedy central specials.
I,</v>

2516
02:29:06.330 --> 02:29:10.650
you could hear the cheap can't like why can't comedy central used better canned

2517
02:29:10.651 --> 02:29:12.700
laughter.
So they have canned laughter you think?

2518
02:29:12.701 --> 02:29:17.250
Did they do like over there standup specials?
Like if you listen,
you could,

2519
02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:21.180
you could hear like all the audiences from all the special sound the same,

2520
02:29:21.181 --> 02:29:24.270
which is impossible.
It's impossible.

2521
02:29:24.890 --> 02:29:26.640
Like they all laugh the same way.

2522
02:29:26.670 --> 02:29:31.670
There's that one show a that uses the young standups and the whole audience is

2523
02:29:31.861 --> 02:29:36.800
just canned.
Laughter is what's really suck is,
I don't want to say this,

2524
02:29:36.930 --> 02:29:39.500
I guess they just don't say it all right.
What's the show?
But,

2525
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:44.510
but I guess because there was even jokes that were so dumb that you can't,

2526
02:29:44.731 --> 02:29:45.420
you can't even,

2527
02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:48.840
you know that there's no one going to be laughing at this and it just explodes.

2528
02:29:48.841 --> 02:29:52.530
Like they just got off stage and you're just like,
what the fuck is this shit?

2529
02:29:53.100 --> 02:29:57.390
Wow.
And it's edited to where the audience like is still laughing,

2530
02:29:57.420 --> 02:30:01.380
but it goes on to like the next choke.
Like it's just how it's edited.

2531
02:30:01.410 --> 02:30:04.850
You could just tell,
I forgot the African name of the show.
I don't wanna say it.

2532
02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:08.600
<v 0>Yeah.
You don't have to say the name.
That's kind of fucked up.
Right.</v>

2533
02:30:08.750 --> 02:30:13.220
That's a boy.
That's one of those weird like what's the line?

2534
02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:17.090
What's deceptive and what is just editing when you start adding laughter to a

2535
02:30:17.091 --> 02:30:21.020
comedy show,
like a laugh track on sitcoms.
Okay.
For some reason.
Why is that?

2536
02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:24.110
Why the fuck is a tray?
That's not,
that's not okay either.

2537
02:30:24.250 --> 02:30:27.480
<v 5>It's not okay if she gets big,
it gets annoying too is like,</v>

2538
02:30:27.481 --> 02:30:29.700
especially when there's laughter where you know that's not a joke.
Yeah.

2539
02:30:30.060 --> 02:30:32.790
If you want to know how stupid it is,
watch one of those Disney shows.

2540
02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:34.840
What was Disney shows the last big one.

2541
02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:36.960
And the guy comes in with the flip flop side in your life

2542
02:30:38.390 --> 02:30:41.020
<v 2>and everybody's like,
Woo.
The</v>

2543
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:44.810
<v 0>really bad laugh track scenes are offensive.
They hurt,</v>

2544
02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:48.760
they hurt since so hurt.
They're insulting.
It's offensive.
It's a fact.

2545
02:30:48.770 --> 02:30:51.170
You heard the culture,
you,
you,
you,

2546
02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:56.320
if anybody who can listen to this and really believe that that's real laughter

2547
02:30:56.450 --> 02:31:00.470
is either very,
very young,
which is rude cause you do like a Shitty,

2548
02:31:00.530 --> 02:31:04.190
shitty joke on children or they're idiots.

2549
02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:05.900
So those are the two options.

2550
02:31:06.050 --> 02:31:08.810
Either someone's really young and you're treating them like they're fools.

2551
02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:12.170
And You giving them bad entertainment and giving them really low standards to

2552
02:31:12.171 --> 02:31:17.170
behave by or you're making movies and shows for idiots and it,
yeah,

2553
02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:20.250
it definitely giving them like low standards

2554
02:31:20.580 --> 02:31:23.820
<v 3>to live by or for sure.
Oh they don't give a fuck man.
Like they don't trust,</v>

2555
02:31:23.821 --> 02:31:27.510
they just don't trust like,
you know,
like make something good.

2556
02:31:27.630 --> 02:31:29.250
Just put it out there in and trust it.

2557
02:31:29.390 --> 02:31:32.890
<v 0>But it's also that there's a lot of dummies out there that like bad shit that</v>

2558
02:31:32.891 --> 02:31:36.230
there's just a lot of that man and a lot of these sitcoms that are really like

2559
02:31:36.231 --> 02:31:37.550
Brian coulombs hope my house.

2560
02:31:37.730 --> 02:31:40.640
And we were talking about sitcoms that he did and he was,

2561
02:31:40.641 --> 02:31:45.050
he was just shaking his head.
He was like so bad.
He goes,
I'm doing the show.

2562
02:31:45.051 --> 02:31:49.220
I can't fucking believe this is a sitcom.
I can't believe how bad it is.

2563
02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:52.490
And he did like a couple of episodes and he was telling me about it and he was

2564
02:31:52.491 --> 02:31:55.550
like,
the people like they're convincing themselves.
He goes,

2565
02:31:55.630 --> 02:32:00.320
the actors on the set or laughing and the show does well on TV and he's like,

2566
02:32:00.321 --> 02:32:04.580
and it's shit,
it's terrible.
And I was like,

2567
02:32:04.581 --> 02:32:08.120
what is that?
And he goes,
I don't know.
We were trying to figure it out.
I'm like,

2568
02:32:08.121 --> 02:32:10.910
is it just desserts?
Just a lot of really dumb mother fuckers out there.

2569
02:32:10.911 --> 02:32:13.880
And that just hits their frequency.
And so the disease,

2570
02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:18.760
clever people that know the right frequency for dumb people,
you know,

2571
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:20.410
where would I be without you hunting?

2572
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:25.180
Probably know where goodnight fade to black dirt,

2573
02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:29.960
Marto w whatever it is,
man,
it's popular.

2574
02:32:30.050 --> 02:32:32.520
<v 3>Well there's,
you know,
there's,
there's,
you know,
there's,</v>

2575
02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:37.550
there's no lack of stupid people in this world.
Like when I was watching like,

2576
02:32:37.551 --> 02:32:41.840
uh,
I think it was on e years ago,
maybe even 10 years ago.

2577
02:32:41.841 --> 02:32:45.640
And that's talking about Gilligan's island and PPS.
So riding,
so said,

2578
02:32:45.650 --> 02:32:47.570
please rescue those people.

2579
02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:51.830
<v 4>Bluff the eyes.
Like nobody gonna help.</v>

2580
02:32:51.860 --> 02:32:56.840
Like real letters.
I'm not even making this up.
It's real.
No,
I'm sure.

2581
02:32:56.880 --> 02:32:58.880
But we're worried about them.
But watching him every week,

2582
02:33:02.190 --> 02:33:05.420
they're out there on that island by themselves.

2583
02:33:05.900 --> 02:33:10.880
It's going to be a monsoon out.
We need your help.
Those people,

2584
02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:15.210
there's a month soon.
Nice Foy.

2585
02:33:15.470 --> 02:33:17.150
Those people raise kids.

2586
02:33:17.350 --> 02:33:22.210
<v 0>Yeah.
They raise kids to go out there and harass your kids.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2587
02:33:22.270 --> 02:33:23.103
Well this,

2588
02:33:23.290 --> 02:33:28.290
but do you think that a show that's a dumb show actually influences the culture

2589
02:33:28.451 --> 02:33:31.150
enough to have an effect on it?
Because if that's the case,

2590
02:33:31.151 --> 02:33:33.960
and I'm guilty too for fear factor,
if there,

2591
02:33:33.970 --> 02:33:38.970
if a show can be so dumb and lower standards so much and its delivery in the

2592
02:33:39.851 --> 02:33:44.851
shitty jokes and the canned laughter and just just as low rpm entertainment

2593
02:33:46.270 --> 02:33:51.270
[inaudible] Ma and sucks you into its fucking more of soap opera stupidity.

2594
02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:53.310
If,
if that,
if it is,

2595
02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:58.320
is it possible that that can actual actually lower a collective intelligence of

2596
02:33:58.571 --> 02:33:59.620
any part of a culture?

2597
02:33:59.970 --> 02:34:01.820
<v 3>Well,
it won't improve it.</v>

2598
02:34:05.630 --> 02:34:07.780
<v 4>You could,
you could go where you want to go from there.</v>

2599
02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:12.330
And I don't,

2600
02:34:12.330 --> 02:34:16.410
I don't think like I've heard you're being a hard on fear factor before,

2601
02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:18.250
but that shit interesting.

2602
02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:22.370
<v 0>Well it was,
it is definitely a little different and it's stupidity,</v>

2603
02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:23.990
but it's still stupidity.

2604
02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:27.550
<v 8>It's,
yeah.
But here's the thing about fear factor.</v>

2605
02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:30.940
It was you at home,

2606
02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:36.460
putting yourself in these people's situation like in in the day and you're

2607
02:34:36.461 --> 02:34:40.060
wondering what anything that makes you kind of say,
could I do that?

2608
02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:44.220
And you watch somebody go through it and do it.
It,
it's,
it's,

2609
02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:45.700
it's just there's,

2610
02:34:45.730 --> 02:34:50.260
there's something interesting about fear factor that I wouldn't just brush off,

2611
02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:54.370
you know,
they call it,
there's an ingredient in there that's,

2612
02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:59.530
that's important that you know that,
that people can use on other things,

2613
02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:02.620
but there's something definitely there to make people keep watching it.
It's not,

2614
02:35:02.621 --> 02:35:06.370
even though the 50 it wasn't even when somebody at the end and got the $50,000

2615
02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:10.370
it's the,
they did all this.
Even if you're,
you can look at it,

2616
02:35:10.770 --> 02:35:13.420
there's different types of people that watched it to say,

2617
02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:18.600
these people are stupid or I can't believe this person just ate that or did that

2618
02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:21.310
people or just,

2619
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:25.360
just the interest in things that people go through,

2620
02:35:25.361 --> 02:35:29.360
watching people go through what they're going to go through.
It's just,
it's,

2621
02:35:29.450 --> 02:35:30.730
there's a lot of shit there,
man.

2622
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.271
<v 0>Well,</v>

2623
02:35:31.271 --> 02:35:35.470
there's a psychological battles that are going on when you see people trying to

2624
02:35:35.471 --> 02:35:39.670
eat blended rats or climb up buildings and the fucking terrified of heights or

2625
02:35:39.671 --> 02:35:43.240
swim when they can't swim.
There's a lot of psychological shit going on.

2626
02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:47.410
And then there's also just the fact that they really are,
whatever they're doing,

2627
02:35:47.470 --> 02:35:51.160
as ridiculous as it is,
they really are competing,
right?
It's a human competition.

2628
02:35:51.161 --> 02:35:54.410
Whenever you're watching any sort of competition,
it becomes compelling,
right?

2629
02:35:54.430 --> 02:35:58.000
Because you try to figure out what you would do and you get caught up like we

2630
02:35:58.001 --> 02:35:58.834
were talking about.

2631
02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:01.750
What was the dude's name that were saying Clark live in Clark's life?

2632
02:36:01.940 --> 02:36:06.280
Was it Clark?
Oh yeah.
What does,
what do we call it?
Carl.
Carl.
Carl.
Carl.

2633
02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:09.880
If you were living in Carl's life,
what's compelling about it?

2634
02:36:09.881 --> 02:36:12.130
Besides the fact that you get to experience someone else's life,

2635
02:36:12.131 --> 02:36:16.390
as you probably get your own mind as well.
Thank fuck,
would I do this?
Oh my God,

2636
02:36:16.391 --> 02:36:18.910
I am is crazy.
I can't believe you did fuck this chick.

2637
02:36:19.090 --> 02:36:23.350
He doesn't even call you crazy.
They're watching cause chased calls.

2638
02:36:23.351 --> 02:36:27.400
The condoms tore down.
Doesn't mean you're supposed to just fuck.
Yeah.

2639
02:36:27.401 --> 02:36:28.234
What's calls who

2640
02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:33.340
<v 8>crazy shit that you would never do live vicariously and that's what that,</v>

2641
02:36:33.390 --> 02:36:36.430
you know,
fear factor gave people an experienced man.

2642
02:36:36.670 --> 02:36:40.780
<v 0>It was definitely an experience for me.
It was surreal because I,
you know,</v>

2643
02:36:40.781 --> 02:36:41.321
it was there.

2644
02:36:41.321 --> 02:36:44.170
Why was all happening like can't even book and then I watched it on TV and I

2645
02:36:44.171 --> 02:36:48.450
just leave my house,
shaved my head.
I can't believe I'm like,
as I was doing,

2646
02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:50.530
I was like this is the most ridiculous shit of all time.

2647
02:36:50.531 --> 02:36:52.350
I can't believe this is a job.
Plus plus

2648
02:36:52.580 --> 02:36:54.590
<v 8>like it's like a survivor.</v>

2649
02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:59.330
Like when survivor first came on I said I'm going to watch this shit tonight and

2650
02:36:59.331 --> 02:37:01.370
laugh at how dumb this thing is.

2651
02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:06.880
But the execution of the first episode blew my mind and I watched the entire

2652
02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:12.260
season.
I agree.
And I was like,
and I think you guys had good execution.

2653
02:37:12.850 --> 02:37:14.330
<v 0>They definitely know what they were doing.
Yeah.</v>

2654
02:37:14.410 --> 02:37:18.170
David and Matt Q in Institute dudes that were in charge of the whole thing,

2655
02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:19.880
they knew what the fuck they were doing.
They did.

2656
02:37:19.940 --> 02:37:22.550
They both have done TV for the longest time,

2657
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:25.730
but I think that helps for sure.

2658
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:29.660
But this is something about watching people compete.
It's so fucking compelling.

2659
02:37:29.690 --> 02:37:33.170
That's why people like sports.
Yeah.
That's why people like watching basketball.

2660
02:37:33.171 --> 02:37:36.330
That's why people like watching MMA.
People love watching people.

2661
02:37:36.390 --> 02:37:39.890
<v 3>Okay.
Heat that'll,
that'll never end.
And then it was attractive people too.</v>

2662
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:44.450
And people who are like,
oh that's the person from next door,
whatever.

2663
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:45.703
That's worth.

2664
02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:50.390
Cause people like the normal person and then the real world was hot.

2665
02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:53.840
So it's like these are all the people who auditioned for real world and then get

2666
02:37:53.841 --> 02:37:57.530
on it.
They can do,
they can do,
they can do have power over you.

2667
02:37:58.650 --> 02:37:59.420
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2668
02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:03.410
Like you'll think about how weird it is that we like watching people compete so

2669
02:38:03.411 --> 02:38:06.020
much.
We will watch people run.
Yeah.

2670
02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:09.170
Running is one of the most boring fucking things you could ever watch.

2671
02:38:09.171 --> 02:38:11.900
Person to go left.
Right,
left,
right.
No.

2672
02:38:11.901 --> 02:38:14.820
Golf at least varies a little bit more than running.
Like the,

2673
02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:17.720
the best thing that can happen as far as excitement goes.

2674
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:19.010
Obviously the worst thing to the person.

2675
02:38:19.011 --> 02:38:22.400
But the best thing for the viewer is watching a race where a bunch of people

2676
02:38:22.401 --> 02:38:25.760
fall on top of each other.
One person or the best.

2677
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:29.450
It's the worst for the people involved,
but at home you're like,
oh shit,

2678
02:38:29.451 --> 02:38:30.284
this is crazy.

2679
02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:34.040
The casual person does have anything invested in the race would be their heart

2680
02:38:34.041 --> 02:38:34.701
rate would go up.

2681
02:38:34.701 --> 02:38:38.300
If I saw a bunch of 30 people fall and pile on top of each other in the

2682
02:38:38.301 --> 02:38:41.110
beginning of all of a sudden the interest in it goes up.
Yeah,

2683
02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:45.050
it would be on TV every fucking 15 minutes for 24 hours.

2684
02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:47.570
He would see those people trip and fall on top of each other.

2685
02:38:47.810 --> 02:38:50.300
A terrible start today to the Boston marathon.

2686
02:38:50.301 --> 02:38:53.120
Just a year from the tragic terrorist event.

2687
02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:57.290
We got a pile up at the finish line and a bunch of people just stumble on top of

2688
02:38:57.291 --> 02:39:00.680
each other and break hips,
twist ankles.
They would play that shit,

2689
02:39:00.681 --> 02:39:02.500
but over and over and over.

2690
02:39:02.501 --> 02:39:07.160
I know they're still looking for a fucking plane that's it's on the news every

2691
02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:10.760
day,
all day long.
A fucking plane that disappeared seven weeks ago.

2692
02:39:10.850 --> 02:39:14.870
There's no story.
There's no information that's new.
There's no pictures,

2693
02:39:14.930 --> 02:39:19.720
there's no metal.
Every day.
A new chapter in the Malaysian airlines,

2694
02:39:20.140 --> 02:39:24.620
<v 3>the new week eight,
the news milk that for ratings,
it's the craziest.</v>

2695
02:39:24.650 --> 02:39:27.550
Don't care about those all the time.
The craziest milking of all time.

2696
02:39:27.820 --> 02:39:32.090
It's like he just like the Jody areas trial.
It's like why they made us or made,

2697
02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:32.981
I didn't care.

2698
02:39:32.981 --> 02:39:37.060
But they made people care about the results of this case is Jody Eris,

2699
02:39:37.061 --> 02:39:40.570
was she hot?
She did.
She was hot.
Which ones?
She,
she was,

2700
02:39:40.900 --> 02:39:42.280
she was pushing for a murderer.

2701
02:39:42.490 --> 02:39:46.930
She murdered her boyfriend and then the one the year before the year before.

2702
02:39:47.020 --> 02:39:51.610
So the missing plane is just Jody areas or the thing they slipped in.

2703
02:39:52.030 --> 02:39:56.530
Slipped in place of.
There's no Katrina.
So let's do the plane.

2704
02:39:57.070 --> 02:40:00.520
There's no,
that hot chick has killed her man.

2705
02:40:00.670 --> 02:40:04.420
Like some regular people who have killed their man.
So let's do the plane.

2706
02:40:04.510 --> 02:40:04.721
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2707
02:40:04.721 --> 02:40:08.530
How many regular people killed their men in between the time where Jody areas

2708
02:40:08.531 --> 02:40:11.180
killed her man and the plane crashed,
right?
Probably all,

2709
02:40:13.430 --> 02:40:14.010
<v 3>yeah.
Really not</v>

2710
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:18.390
<v 8>hot.
It didn't have,
they didn't have good PR.
They didn't get out there.</v>

2711
02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:22.670
<v 0>Pr.
I used to do a joke about Manson,</v>

2712
02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:25.220
about how Manson is like the Bob hope of serial killers,

2713
02:40:26.610 --> 02:40:29.450
but everybody says Bob hope was a comedian when I was a kid.

2714
02:40:29.451 --> 02:40:33.500
Like buffalo never made me laugh.
I'm not laughing.
I get Charlie Chaplin.

2715
02:40:33.501 --> 02:40:36.710
I understood the three Sturges,
Bob Hope.
I'd be like,
what are you laughing at?

2716
02:40:37.130 --> 02:40:39.920
But like when you talk about like serial killers,
everybody's like,
oh,

2717
02:40:39.921 --> 02:40:44.680
he's fucking Manson.
The guys like Manson.
I beat the fuck out of Manson.

2718
02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:46.880
Manson never talked shit to me.
If he got crazy with me,

2719
02:40:46.881 --> 02:40:51.020
I would fucking Manson up.
He's like five feet tall.
He weighs a hundred pounds.

2720
02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:53.810
He didn't even kill anybody.
He got other people to kill people for him.

2721
02:40:53.811 --> 02:40:57.260
You got to Tex Watson to do all the murders and all those other squeaky Fromme

2722
02:40:57.261 --> 02:41:01.220
would tried to kill a Gerald Ford.
I'm not scared of Manson,
but I was like,

2723
02:41:01.221 --> 02:41:05.390
during the whole time there's been all these serial killers that have killed way

2724
02:41:05.391 --> 02:41:09.410
more people and you never hear about that.
And the joke was that Henry Lee Lucas,

2725
02:41:09.770 --> 02:41:13.370
he's the guy that they made that movie Henry Portrait of a serial killer about,

2726
02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:18.260
he was with the dude from walking dead.
The brother,
not the guy,

2727
02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:20.330
not the guy who shoots the crossbows,
but his brother.
Yeah.

2728
02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:24.430
<v 8>Oh,
okay.
I know you told him the one that's hands missing.
Yes.
That guy,</v>

2729
02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:25.650
he played Henry Lee.

2730
02:41:25.651 --> 02:41:29.760
Lucas and Mike can really look as killed 60 fucking people and everyone's
Manson.

2731
02:41:29.790 --> 02:41:31.870
He's like,
man,
the guys are gonna.
He goes,
no,

2732
02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:33.520
what do I have to do to get a little attention?

2733
02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:37.590
I killed 64 it's disrespectful cause it's real serious,

2734
02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:39.920
but you've got 65 buddies.

2735
02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:45.250
<v 0>It's like a dude who won like an amateur boxing championship and they've</v>

2736
02:41:45.251 --> 02:41:47.290
compared them to Muhammad Ali.
Oh,
that's funny.
They just,

2737
02:41:47.410 --> 02:41:49.700
they're just talking about him all the time.
They don't talk about Ali.

2738
02:41:50.110 --> 02:41:52.510
<v 8>What about me bitch?
You fucking crazy.
Like good.</v>

2739
02:41:52.540 --> 02:41:55.460
I did want the title three times.
This dude,
one of the amateur thing.
Yeah,

2740
02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:58.870
that's what it's like.
Yeah,
that's fucked up.
But the Manson thing,

2741
02:41:58.871 --> 02:42:00.930
I guess it was the cult leader,
part of it was,

2742
02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:04.030
which freaked everybody out because people were terrified by someone who could

2743
02:42:04.031 --> 02:42:08.770
lead people astray.
Right.
And it was the time,
and I think he was a Hippie,

2744
02:42:09.140 --> 02:42:09.940
right?
There's,
yeah,

2745
02:42:09.940 --> 02:42:14.740
there's a lot of things that they take out of the story that they don't focus on

2746
02:42:14.741 --> 02:42:17.380
now.
Like back then maybe,
I don't know,

2747
02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:22.150
it feels like just on instinct that they wanted to condemn hippies back then,

2748
02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:26.700
100% so they use this guy to condemn hippies,
like the,
you know,

2749
02:42:26.701 --> 02:42:31.690
the suits and then,
then now that part of the story is gone,
you know?
And,

2750
02:42:31.780 --> 02:42:36.730
and now it's just fascinating.
It told residually fascinating.

2751
02:42:36.731 --> 02:42:40.900
But back then it could have been a big story for what was the reason why,
why?

2752
02:42:40.901 --> 02:42:43.690
That was a big story back then because there was a lot

2753
02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:47.690
<v 0>dark shit that happened when there was a murdered pregnant woman who was also a</v>

2754
02:42:47.691 --> 02:42:51.960
movie star,
Sharon Tate.
That was,
it struck home with a lot of good elements.
Yeah.

2755
02:42:51.980 --> 02:42:55.070
And then Roman Polanski,
it was his wife that was murdered.

2756
02:42:55.071 --> 02:42:56.450
A lot of people didn't know that.

2757
02:42:56.530 --> 02:43:00.050
And then Roman Polanski turns out to be a child molester and he plays on his

2758
02:43:00.051 --> 02:43:02.210
crazy connections to that,
that murder,

2759
02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:06.560
they wrote war or die pig or something like that and blood on the wall.

2760
02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:09.770
<v 8>So what was the name of the of color you mentioned Henry Lee Lucas.</v>

2761
02:43:09.771 --> 02:43:12.160
So this is what he was doing.
I didn't

2762
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:15.950
<v 0>do it.
Regular people,
it's killing like diner waitresses and shit.
Yeah,</v>

2763
02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:16.701
that's what he would do.

2764
02:43:16.701 --> 02:43:18.730
He'd just go across the country and just kill people randomly.

2765
02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:21.360
He's a guy would walk into the bathroom,
a look,

2766
02:43:21.370 --> 02:43:24.640
a restaurant bathroom and he was just decided I'm going to go kill this

2767
02:43:24.641 --> 02:43:26.950
motherfucker,
go in Shank the guy,

2768
02:43:26.951 --> 02:43:29.560
stabbed a bunch of times and go out and eat his meal.
Like nothing happened.

2769
02:43:29.561 --> 02:43:32.740
And people start screaming and uh,
he would go one,
what's going on?

2770
02:43:33.050 --> 02:43:36.520
Like this is like in the 70s,
the 80s.
And then there was,

2771
02:43:36.670 --> 02:43:39.460
nobody knew what the fuck was going on and there's nothing,
you know,

2772
02:43:39.700 --> 02:43:41.440
they didn't get your fingerprints,
he didn't know shit.

2773
02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:42.880
And he would kill people randomly.

2774
02:43:42.881 --> 02:43:46.180
And apparently random killers are the hardest to capture.

2775
02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:49.930
The hardest to like if you've got a person who's a real crazy person who just

2776
02:43:50.050 --> 02:43:53.620
not the plot's not that says,
you know what,
this Brian Red Van Motherfucker,

2777
02:43:53.621 --> 02:43:55.990
I gotta,
I can't take it shit on the podcast anymore.

2778
02:43:56.260 --> 02:43:59.730
I'm going to fucking track them down.
But if it's,
I'm gonna put this camera,

2779
02:43:59.750 --> 02:44:02.590
this tape recorded behind the toilet,
it's someone who gets in their car.

2780
02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:06.550
It's something that gets in their car and says,

2781
02:44:06.551 --> 02:44:07.960
let me just decide who I'm going to kill today.

2782
02:44:08.230 --> 02:44:10.570
And they just drive around and go,
okay,
that's the guy.

2783
02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:13.990
And they just get out and they shoot them and they just get in the car and drive

2784
02:44:13.991 --> 02:44:17.490
away.
It's very difficult to catch that guy,
right,
because then they'll news,

2785
02:44:17.491 --> 02:44:21.790
as I say,
that's been a gang murder.
It could be.
It could be a random,

2786
02:44:22.870 --> 02:44:25.720
I mean it depends on what city you're in too.
Like,
what if you're in Chicago,

2787
02:44:26.050 --> 02:44:28.840
like if you wanted to be a murderer,
like a serial killer,

2788
02:44:28.850 --> 02:44:30.250
you go to the south side of Chicago,

2789
02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:32.290
just drive around and start killing people at random.

2790
02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:35.050
It's happening over there anyway,
right?
It's like there's so much murder.

2791
02:44:35.051 --> 02:44:38.170
They're like Louisiana,
New Orleans.
We were there.

2792
02:44:38.171 --> 02:44:41.770
This guy who was there who had told me about,
he had lived through the,
uh,

2793
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:43.950
Katrina floods and he was talking about the,

2794
02:44:43.951 --> 02:44:46.360
the level of violence that he saw and he said,
well,

2795
02:44:46.361 --> 02:44:50.500
just cops shooting people and craziness and just riding.
It was like,
he goes,

2796
02:44:50.530 --> 02:44:54.160
it was crazy.
Like if you just inter,
you know,

2797
02:44:54.220 --> 02:44:57.580
inserted yourself into some sort of chaotic situation like that and just

2798
02:44:57.581 --> 02:44:59.650
randomly killed a person,
they never catch you.

2799
02:45:00.250 --> 02:45:04.840
He just swoop right back into the back into the darkness,
you know?
That's,

2800
02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:07.570
that kind of serial killer stuff was really scary to people.

2801
02:45:07.571 --> 02:45:11.680
The idea that someone could just not value life so much or get such a thrill out

2802
02:45:11.681 --> 02:45:15.160
of killing someone that they're just willing to do that.
It's like kill people.

2803
02:45:15.161 --> 02:45:17.790
Like is masturbating,
like,

2804
02:45:18.420 --> 02:45:21.190
is this the only good thing,
you know,

2805
02:45:21.191 --> 02:45:26.191
you could say about like a scenario like that is that most of those people you

2806
02:45:29.471 --> 02:45:30.580
would think it's not even a good thing,

2807
02:45:30.581 --> 02:45:35.581
but I would imagine that a lot of them trip up because there are so amoral and

2808
02:45:37.091 --> 02:45:41.920
so fucked up.
Like that was the whole theme of the,
um,
uh,
the,
the,

2809
02:45:41.921 --> 02:45:46.210
uh,
American serial killer book,
American Psycho.
Did you ever read the book?

2810
02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:51.490
The book is way more graphic and fucked up then the movie,
the movie's fucked up,

2811
02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:55.720
but you only have so much time in a movie to go into how crazy guy is.

2812
02:45:56.020 --> 02:46:01.020
But Bret Easton Ellis in the book had hundreds of pages and that it was dark,

2813
02:46:01.511 --> 02:46:05.040
dark,
dark shit.
A real story.
No,
it's fictional,
totally fiction.

2814
02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:09.170
It was sort of a metaphor for the,
uh,

2815
02:46:09.171 --> 02:46:13.730
the cocaine mindset of the 80s and the materialist mindset of stockbrokers and

2816
02:46:13.731 --> 02:46:14.240
this,

2817
02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:18.080
and he just had created this guy who inserted himself into this world who's just

2818
02:46:18.081 --> 02:46:22.430
a complete and total psychopath serial killer.
Fascinating Shit.

2819
02:46:22.670 --> 02:46:25.880
Because the guy like,
it's almost like he's getting more,

2820
02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:31.120
the thrills don't come unless he's more and more reckless now because you get

2821
02:46:32.901 --> 02:46:36.200
tired of doing it this way and then you want to do it that way and then you

2822
02:46:36.201 --> 02:46:38.270
gotta to kick it up a notch in order to get your thrill.

2823
02:46:38.510 --> 02:46:39.920
And a lot of them that happens,

2824
02:46:39.921 --> 02:46:43.820
they ramp up until they eventually get busted and just,
they just,
they,

2825
02:46:44.030 --> 02:46:47.830
they don't get satisfied with just one type of thrill.
Yeah.

2826
02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:51.530
But then there's like,
dudes like the Zodiac killer.
They never catch.

2827
02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:56.600
<v 5>Yeah.
He's just stayed in his own.
Yeah.
He's just smarter spot kept his protocol.</v>

2828
02:46:56.800 --> 02:47:00.720
<v 0>Even made letters,
sent them letters and shit.
Did you ever see that?</v>

2829
02:47:00.721 --> 02:47:05.280
Was it Jake Loyola?
I in hall on golf?
Is that him?
Who did the Zodiac movie?

2830
02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:07.590
Yeah,
he does a,

2831
02:47:08.010 --> 02:47:11.670
<v 5>Charles Fleischer was in that movie.
Was He?
Yeah.
Thanks.
So Charles Pfizer,</v>

2832
02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:13.980
it might be the fucking Zodiac killer.
How about that?
Yeah.

2833
02:47:14.870 --> 02:47:16.500
He might've been in a movie about himself.

2834
02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:19.340
<v 0>Charles Fleischer came to the back of the comedy store one night and handed me</v>

2835
02:47:19.341 --> 02:47:23.420
some fucking thing that he created with plastic that was a new geometric shape.

2836
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:26.760
I just asked him about that.
Yeah,
he said it.

2837
02:47:26.770 --> 02:47:31.300
He invented it some sort of with mathematics invented some sort of a new GM unto

2838
02:47:31.310 --> 02:47:32.090
heard.

2839
02:47:32.090 --> 02:47:36.690
Never heard unto her to geometric shape before and to heard.
Is that the,

2840
02:47:36.691 --> 02:47:41.390
how you say it?
Spending that Roger Rabbit money?
Yeah.
I think that money's gone.

2841
02:47:42.770 --> 02:47:46.820
But he was a weird cat.
You know?
Fleischer was a smart dude.

2842
02:47:47.390 --> 02:47:48.440
He would in his spare time,

2843
02:47:48.441 --> 02:47:52.700
he like read books on astronomy and Shit and come to backstage,
the comic store,

2844
02:47:52.701 --> 02:47:56.780
that back Patio area.
We'd always talk about space.
I mean,
yeah.

2845
02:47:56.781 --> 02:47:59.570
Wild conversations about space and science.
He's a fucking,

2846
02:48:00.350 --> 02:48:03.770
he was more into that than he wasn't this doing stand up.
Yes.
Yeah.

2847
02:48:05.850 --> 02:48:10.440
<v 5>Is He,
how is he financially now?
I haven't seen him in forever,
man.
I see him.</v>

2848
02:48:10.441 --> 02:48:12.660
He always looks good and he always has like a younger girl with him.

2849
02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:17.550
<v 0>Ha.
Ah,
let's see him once in a while.
That's funny.
They used to be a dude who,
uh,</v>

2850
02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:20.100
was an older guy.
He used to come to the comic store.

2851
02:48:20.101 --> 02:48:24.660
He's tried to hypnotize girls.
That was his move and um,

2852
02:48:24.870 --> 02:48:28.200
I'd always heard it.
And then one day,
I mean the main room,
you know,

2853
02:48:28.201 --> 02:48:29.460
the back area of the main room,

2854
02:48:29.461 --> 02:48:33.750
but where the ticket thing is in this comic is saying something,
this woman.

2855
02:48:33.751 --> 02:48:38.130
So he leans over and she goes,
no,
I don't want you to hypnotize me.

2856
02:48:38.850 --> 02:48:42.230
And I just started laughing.
It's fucking true.

2857
02:48:44.850 --> 02:48:47.550
He was asking her if he could hypnotize.

2858
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:52.570
<v 5>Yeah.
What a pleasant guy ass.
Right.
I think you have to,</v>

2859
02:48:52.590 --> 02:48:52.990
yeah,

2860
02:48:52.990 --> 02:48:55.780
<v 0>I don't,
I don't think you can,
you can't just hypnotize someone.</v>

2861
02:48:55.790 --> 02:48:58.390
You have to ask to hypnotize them cause they have to like put themselves in the

2862
02:48:58.391 --> 02:49:00.370
mindset like okay,
I'm about to be hypnotized.

2863
02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:05.080
I don't think it's like one of those you're getting sleepy,
sleepy.
Oh my God.

2864
02:49:05.081 --> 02:49:08.100
It's in troll my mind.
I don't think that works.
If she's in the bathroom,

2865
02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:13.340
I don't think it works.
Imagine that you have a tape recording.
You got any sleep?

2866
02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:17.610
Are you allowed to do that?
We not allowed to record,

2867
02:49:17.611 --> 02:49:22.050
but all you're allowed to project it allowed to broadcast secretly when someone

2868
02:49:22.051 --> 02:49:25.950
doesn't know.
Are you allowed to have,
have you talking in a bathroom?

2869
02:49:27.150 --> 02:49:30.120
I think that if I was,
um,
I mean,

2870
02:49:32.430 --> 02:49:34.740
when it comes to laws like about recording laws,

2871
02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:36.960
eventually we're going to have to abandon that.

2872
02:49:36.961 --> 02:49:40.470
If everybody's just starts recording everything,
right.
Everything already is,

2873
02:49:40.580 --> 02:49:42.180
or one's recording people with their phones.

2874
02:49:42.210 --> 02:49:44.040
That would be the one thing that holds you back.
Right?

2875
02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:45.213
<v 13>B,</v>

2876
02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:46.080
<v 0>you,</v>

2877
02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:50.460
if you have two people and one of them consent and the other one doesn't consent

2878
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:52.200
or doesn't know they're being recorded.

2879
02:49:52.230 --> 02:49:55.350
When you always know you're being recorded because you're always being recorded,

2880
02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:57.470
all those laws are going to have to change.
Right.

2881
02:49:57.710 --> 02:49:59.810
<v 5>Does that make sense?
The fucked up thing is that it doesn't even matter.</v>

2882
02:49:59.811 --> 02:50:04.730
It's like once somebody released the tape,
you're screwed socially.
Yeah.

2883
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:06.770
You're all condemned or whatever.
It's like,
well,

2884
02:50:06.771 --> 02:50:09.680
unless you don't say anything fucked up.
Right.
With how,

2885
02:50:10.010 --> 02:50:12.730
I just think it's hard to not say something fucked up.
Yeah.

2886
02:50:13.250 --> 02:50:16.880
<v 0>Well,
there's definitely hard,
especially when you're an 81 year old racist,</v>

2887
02:50:17.090 --> 02:50:18.860
you know,
if you really stop and think about it,

2888
02:50:18.861 --> 02:50:21.920
that dude was 60 years old when the Internet became pop.

2889
02:50:22.170 --> 02:50:26.220
<v 5>Damn.
That's funny.
It's crazy step in there.
That's what he was stepping.</v>

2890
02:50:26.270 --> 02:50:30.130
Their seed is 60 years old,
but not credible.

2891
02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:32.050
But I think I'm a decent person,

2892
02:50:32.051 --> 02:50:35.380
but I know you could probably play some shit back.

2893
02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:36.510
<v 13>Okay.</v>

2894
02:50:36.510 --> 02:50:40.590
<v 5>From conversations that I said and you could,
somebody could hang me [inaudible]</v>

2895
02:50:41.060 --> 02:50:41.691
<v 0>oh definitely.</v>

2896
02:50:41.691 --> 02:50:44.720
Especially if they did it the way that Jerry called Jeremy Clarkson thing did.

2897
02:50:44.721 --> 02:50:47.990
Well,
you just take one snippet of it.
That sounds so stupid.

2898
02:50:47.991 --> 02:50:50.690
I did everything within my power to not say that word.

2899
02:50:50.810 --> 02:50:53.970
The fuck you did not do it at all.

2900
02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:58.730
He was saying is I did everything in my power to not say that word on television

2901
02:50:58.731 --> 02:51:03.560
and that clip never made TV like he was trying.
He went to his long,

2902
02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:05.600
but they were like,
yeah,
whatever junk.

2903
02:51:05.630 --> 02:51:09.900
They ticked it the most ridiculous salacious chunk and they put it in right.

2904
02:51:09.930 --> 02:51:12.860
I did everything within my power.
Apparently that wasn't enough.

2905
02:51:13.160 --> 02:51:15.300
Could you imagine?
He just has racist Tourette's.

2906
02:51:15.580 --> 02:51:19.790
He was like trying really hard to hold.
I'm Mexican.

2907
02:51:19.940 --> 02:51:24.230
He's trying so hard to hide in it.
He's trying,
he's trying so hard not to say it,

2908
02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:26.690
but he can't.
He can't.
He has to let it out.

2909
02:51:26.850 --> 02:51:29.500
<v 5>Eh,
that that was dumb.
His apology,
that clip of it,</v>

2910
02:51:29.501 --> 02:51:34.000
they showed that shit was dumb.
Yeah,
it is ridiculous.
Not An apology.
No.

2911
02:51:34.001 --> 02:51:36.760
The the clip.
They should excuse if it was a guy.
Yeah.

2912
02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:39.370
Well it doesn't make any sense anyway.
Like I said,
I don't,

2913
02:51:39.371 --> 02:51:43.810
I've never heard it that way.
I heard I was hurt at tiger.
Like why?

2914
02:51:44.040 --> 02:51:46.210
Why are you saying nigger?
Like what do you,
what is he doing?

2915
02:51:46.660 --> 02:51:49.360
Like why are you even hung up?
That's on him.
Yeah.

2916
02:51:49.650 --> 02:51:52.570
I'm 100% I did everything within my power

2917
02:51:54.460 --> 02:51:55.293
<v 0>as it goes home.
A place,</v>

2918
02:51:55.380 --> 02:51:59.060
Xbox live and he's one of the racist kids on there and then that guy was drunk a

2919
02:51:59.061 --> 02:52:02.390
lot too.
That's probably also part of that.
That stomach that he's got,

2920
02:52:02.391 --> 02:52:05.560
that shit ain't,
that ain't come and just from food guys probably lit up.

2921
02:52:05.561 --> 02:52:05.980
He's trying to be

2922
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:09.700
<v 1>funny.
Oh yeah.
Also,
he's probably trying to be funny.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean he's,</v>

2923
02:52:09.701 --> 02:52:12.730
he's kind of like a comic in a sense because he's,

2924
02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.960
I'm sure he's making the cameraman laugh and the producers laugh and he's trying

2925
02:52:16.961 --> 02:52:20.460
to like be edgy.
Like he's got a reputation for saying sunny shit,

2926
02:52:20.470 --> 02:52:24.430
so he's got to live up to it.
And sometimes you're,
yeah,
yeah,
no doubt man.

2927
02:52:24.610 --> 02:52:25.960
No doubt.
You know,

2928
02:52:26.350 --> 02:52:30.370
there was an article that I'm trying to find online and I can't,
we're,

2929
02:52:30.371 --> 02:52:33.410
we're out of time here,
goddammit.
Even Edwards,

2930
02:52:33.490 --> 02:52:36.490
we ran out of Goddamn time all the time with fast.
How long were you doing?

2931
02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:39.310
Three hours.
Hey Jesus.
I know.
That's what I'm saying,
dude.

2932
02:52:39.940 --> 02:52:43.000
It goes by every week like that.
It's crazy.
When a,

2933
02:52:43.001 --> 02:52:46.660
when are you recording your new special?
Well,
it's an album recorded it already.

2934
02:52:46.840 --> 02:52:48.850
Uh,
the beauty of it is there's a,

2935
02:52:48.851 --> 02:52:51.640
there's an article in deadline Hollywood this morning about,

2936
02:52:52.080 --> 02:52:56.050
it's on a Conan's label.
Oh,
beautiful.
Coming out in June.

2937
02:52:56.110 --> 02:52:59.020
I'm the first comic on there.
Oh,
that's awesome.

2938
02:52:59.050 --> 02:53:00.990
And I'm the also the first homeless comic

2939
02:53:01.130 --> 02:53:02.580
<v 0>beyond calling chase.</v>

2940
02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:08.120
<v 1>But thanks chase assholes.
So it's coming out in June,</v>

2941
02:53:08.121 --> 02:53:12.320
but they just released everything.
So I woke up to see that in deadline when?

2942
02:53:12.321 --> 02:53:14.810
In June one and June.
Uh,

Okay,

What's it called?

2945
02:53:20.220 --> 02:53:22.070
Uh,
it's called a hundred percent half ass.

2946
