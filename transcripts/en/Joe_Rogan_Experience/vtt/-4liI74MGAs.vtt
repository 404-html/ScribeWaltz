00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 1>you're not playing basketball.</v>

65
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.723
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Murphy,</v>

66
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>he wears like those ridiculous rapper chains.</v>

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>You know they're covered in diamonds and bling bling and he doesn't wear them</v>

68
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:54.301
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

69
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:55.111
<v Speaker 1>When he goes on stage,</v>

70
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>he takes them off and he puts him on his cousin.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Richard said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Richard is like his tour manager and he'll ritual hold on the chains.</v>

73
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Is that in case he gets shot or something,</v>

74
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>he just doesn't want to blink too hard was on stage.</v>

75
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't want to distract from the message.</v>

76
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard for a comedian have to be to blinky.</v>

77
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Like only black comedians can be blinking.</v>

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.350
<v Speaker 1>that did figure out how to orchestrate music and how to create music and compose</v>

149
00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:52.760
<v Speaker 1>incredible works of music that are still listened to hundreds of years later.</v>

150
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

151
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

152
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.680
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty nuts man.</v>

153
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.440
<v Speaker 1>And we don't even know what his shit really sounded like.</v>

154
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.513
<v Speaker 1>That's the craziest,</v>

155
00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.430
<v Speaker 3>but also the crate,</v>

156
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.720
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to the radio one time,</v>

157
00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:01.141
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about,</v>

158
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:03.450
<v Speaker 3>because some of these guys like autistic autistic people,</v>

159
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.690
<v Speaker 3>some of them were like geniuses in one way and,</v>

160
00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:06.524
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

161
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.120
<v Speaker 3>autistic or they have problems in another way.</v>

162
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.260
<v Speaker 3>This one kid,</v>

163
00:04:10.261 --> 00:04:11.094
<v Speaker 3>they were saying,</v>

164
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

165
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.110
<v Speaker 3>autistic couldn't communicate that he's at home with his mom and dad.</v>

166
00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 3>They live,</v>

167
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.120
<v Speaker 3>they watch a,</v>

168
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

169
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.871
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

170
00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:22.050
<v Speaker 3>some movie that had like a Beethoven Concerto in it to just watch it,</v>

171
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

172
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.120
<v Speaker 3>once the,</v>

173
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120
<v Speaker 3>because like 12 years old,</v>

174
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.190
<v Speaker 3>the mother goes to sleep middle of the night,</v>

175
00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:28.650
<v Speaker 3>wakes up and thinks that the TVs playing it again,</v>

176
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.900
<v Speaker 3>the kids at the piano playing that song from watching it once he's just learned</v>

177
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:34.734
<v Speaker 3>the song.</v>

178
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

179
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.640
<v Speaker 3>so these guys are geniuses in one way and crazy in another way.</v>

180
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:40.670
<v Speaker 1>We talked about autistic,</v>

182
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.940
<v Speaker 1>autistic savant on the podcast a bunch of times before,</v>

183
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.350
<v Speaker 1>cause there's so many really amazing examples of that kind of power.</v>

184
00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I bet a lot of famous musicians and composers and geniuses in the past were</v>

185
00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:54.290
<v Speaker 1>probably autistic savant.</v>

186
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:55.640
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't know how to diagnose it.</v>

187
00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:56.960
<v Speaker 1>They just considered them geniuses.</v>

188
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

189
00:04:57.241 --> 00:04:57.931
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe there's like,</v>

190
00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:58.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's even certain,</v>

191
00:04:58.681 --> 00:04:59.420
<v Speaker 3>like as you were talking about,</v>

192
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

193
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.331
<v Speaker 3>prince,</v>

194
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:01.350
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain levels of it,</v>

195
00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:01.441
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

196
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:01.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

197
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 3>like you got the,</v>

198
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.280
<v Speaker 3>the rock star who's brilliant and amazing,</v>

199
00:05:05.281 --> 00:05:05.581
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

200
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:06.361
<v Speaker 3>he can't like,</v>

201
00:05:06.361 --> 00:05:06.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

202
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 3>remember his address.</v>

203
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

204
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 3>It needs to someone,</v>

205
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.811
<v Speaker 3>a baby's born.</v>

206
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:10.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

207
00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:11.040
<v Speaker 3>And he's the one to babysit them.</v>

208
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:11.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

209
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.271
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>

210
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of that stuff is that</v>

211
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

212
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.320
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

213
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

214
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.541
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't want,</v>

215
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:19.880
<v Speaker 1>isn't it amazing that music for like hundreds and hundreds of years was just</v>

216
00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:22.400
<v Speaker 1>written down like you couldn't record it.</v>

217
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.390
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

218
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.740
<v Speaker 1>like composers,</v>

219
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.690
<v Speaker 1>like when they created a piece of work,</v>

220
00:05:26.691 --> 00:05:30.140
<v Speaker 1>it's actually like writing and that's how like this is my work,</v>

221
00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>this is what I've done.</v>

222
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I've combined all these notes in a certain way.</v>

223
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.880
<v Speaker 1>But you didn't even get to listen to them do it.</v>

224
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

225
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

226
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.240
<v Speaker 1>they never got a chance to record anything.</v>

227
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.601
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

228
00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:38.931
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

229
00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:43.040
<v Speaker 1>we'll never hear Beethoven actually directing any music,</v>

230
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:44.870
<v Speaker 1>or anytime travel.</v>

232
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

233
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:46.034
<v Speaker 1>Until the time travel.</v>

234
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.150
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that amazing now that for hundreds of years it was just written down,</v>

235
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.730
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

237
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it would sound any different to like,</v>

238
00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I wa like it'd be listening.</v>

239
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.943
<v Speaker 1>The Beatles when they</v>

240
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 3>released the Mano version,</v>

241
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 3>which was supposedly to superior version was the Mano,</v>

242
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

243
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 3>versions of all the Beatles songs cause they were recorded in mono and then</v>

244
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 3>later they remastered them at stereo hysteria was so popular.</v>

245
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you grew up on,</v>

246
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 3>was listening to stereo music of versions of what was not supposed to be stereo.</v>

247
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 3>So people actually like listening to the Mano versions.</v>

248
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Now I wonder how much of that is like people just being like,</v>

249
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.631
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

250
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 3>you should've heard that.</v>

251
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

252
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.521
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

253
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:23.010
<v Speaker 3>People do that.</v>

254
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Although you should all man,</v>

255
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:24.901
<v Speaker 3>the classic that it,</v>

256
00:06:24.901 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

257
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.941
<v Speaker 3>when in reality,</v>

258
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:26.421
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like,</v>

259
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:26.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

260
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 3>HD versus [inaudible] kind of mixed different too though,</v>

261
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 3>like things that come out in stereo that weren't really necessarily supposed to</v>

262
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 3>be out more.</v>

263
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:35.121
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

264
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 3>it's so I actually have both versions and uh,</v>

265
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.541
<v Speaker 3>it definitely,</v>

266
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 3>I could see what people are saying.</v>

267
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 3>It's more hardcore hitting and everything seems mixed properly compared to like</v>

268
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.111
<v Speaker 3>what now?</v>

269
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Like some guy in some THX labs like,</v>

270
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:47.691
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

271
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 3>I think this little jingle over here should be louder.</v>

272
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

273
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to have to get into fucking vinyl.</v>

274
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to have to buy a record player and some headphones and listen</v>

275
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 1>to what the fuck everybody's saying.</v>

276
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Because when you talk to like real audio files,</v>

277
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you that like a vinyl LP is a way to go and then you lose something</v>

278
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:04.904
<v Speaker 1>in the sound.</v>

279
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>When you go to CD you lose like our quality a layer.</v>

280
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Can you even buy a record planning now?</v>

281
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.270
<v Speaker 3>These actually so records at best buy now.</v>

282
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.781
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

283
00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:14.614
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

284
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.670
<v Speaker 3>The music industry is trying to find a new thing and which one of the things</v>

285
00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:20.200
<v Speaker 3>that's going retro going back to vinyl because it sounds better,</v>

286
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.560
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

287
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

288
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

289
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.840
<v Speaker 3>and that's all up to debate on my opinion.</v>

290
00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:23.710
<v Speaker 3>How funny is that?</v>

291
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Like you think like old TVs will make a comeback.</v>

292
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.100
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't that be funny if you go in,</v>

293
00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:27.341
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

294
00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:28.390
<v Speaker 3>this is not HD.</v>

295
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

296
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.733
<v Speaker 3>Well it seems like</v>

297
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.510
<v Speaker 1>get away with it with blueray where they don't have to have compression anymore.</v>

298
00:07:33.511 --> 00:07:33.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

299
00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Speaker 1>they have compression to get it to CD to digitize it.</v>

300
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe they could add that quality to it if they stretched it out and made</v>

301
00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:40.650
<v Speaker 1>it a larger file.</v>

302
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.613
<v Speaker 3>I think they do.</v>

303
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

304
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 3>I think flack or whatever that</v>

305
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 3>version is,</v>

306
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I think that that is something that's very close to it or what people can see.</v>

307
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.580
<v Speaker 1>It just depends how big of a real audio people.</v>

308
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 1>So the reason why I even brought it up,</v>

309
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 1>but somebody on my message board made a post suggesting that I put out my next</v>

310
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 1>CD on vinyl and I'm like,</v>

311
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:01.041
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

312
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I've never even thought about doing that.</v>

313
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:03.021
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

314
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of weird suggestion.</v>

315
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:05.744
<v Speaker 1>I might be kind of cool.</v>

316
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 3>It is a cool idea.</v>

317
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:07.191
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like,</v>

318
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you heard about this,</v>

319
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 3>but I guess Steven Wright is writing a novel on Twitter.</v>

320
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:11.950
<v Speaker 3>Do you hear about it?</v>

321
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.783
<v Speaker 1>Did</v>

322
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.211
<v Speaker 1>you hear about this?</v>

323
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

324
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.520
<v Speaker 1>he straight up like</v>

325
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:15.821
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

326
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:16.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

327
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.680
<v Speaker 3>he found out he took,</v>

328
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.341
<v Speaker 3>you know how he's like,</v>

329
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:20.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's known for the shorter jokes,</v>

330
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:20.531
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

331
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:21.251
<v Speaker 3>So they decided,</v>

332
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:21.371
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

333
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:22.660
<v Speaker 3>Twitter is about being short,</v>

334
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:23.710
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to write a novel.</v>

335
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:25.870
<v Speaker 3>So supposedly he's writing a novel.</v>

336
00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:29.020
<v Speaker 3>And you can come in at any point and you might not know what's going on.</v>

337
00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:29.501
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't care.</v>

338
00:08:29.501 --> 00:08:31.000
<v Speaker 3>He's just good album.</v>

339
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.140
<v Speaker 3>I have to follow him.</v>

340
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:37.170
<v Speaker 3>Is it Stephen or Steve with a v I think is with The v actually I think steering</v>

341
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:38.550
<v Speaker 3>right but,</v>

342
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.740
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

343
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:38.890
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

344
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.670
<v Speaker 3>but based on,</v>

345
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.050
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying it's like the same thing if you,</v>

346
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.700
<v Speaker 3>if you bust it out with like everyone else is coming out with like the new hot,</v>

347
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put my,</v>

348
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.330
<v Speaker 3>put my album out like this,</v>

349
00:08:46.331 --> 00:08:46.781
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

350
00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:47.860
<v Speaker 3>And you bust out with,</v>

351
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:48.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

352
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:49.060
<v Speaker 3>a record vinyl.</v>

353
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.080
<v Speaker 3>That might be a way to go.</v>

354
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.943
<v Speaker 3>This can't be him.</v>

355
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.690
<v Speaker 3>He only has 15,000 followers.</v>

356
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.680
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

357
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.513
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

358
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Is that a real,</v>

359
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:55.591
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

360
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 3>that could probably</v>

361
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.933
<v Speaker 1>is about right.</v>

362
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

363
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 1>how could you find out if it's the real deal or not?</v>

364
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Well usually they're verified.</v>

365
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm verified Joan Rivers right here says it's verified follow Joan Rivers.</v>

366
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>But Steven Wright doesn't say verified.</v>

367
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take a chance and following me anyway.</v>

368
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think a lot of those old school guys like Steven Wright or probably just</v>

369
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>now embracing technology,</v>

370
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>so that might be a real number.</v>

371
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:18.480
<v Speaker 1>He might really only have seven.</v>

372
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.810
<v Speaker 1>We could rerelease her website and bitmaps.</v>

373
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>What does bitmaps instead of jpegs we can go.</v>

374
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

375
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

376
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:25.261
<v Speaker 1>that'd be good.</v>

377
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Vinyl,</v>

378
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.720
<v Speaker 1>a photo cause discussion,</v>

379
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.003
<v Speaker 1>every crappy,</v>

380
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

381
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.530
<v Speaker 1>We all go back to like three second video gifts instead of having Ustream,</v>

382
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 1>we just have a Gif animation writing.</v>

383
00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 1>He is writing a novel writing a novel.</v>

384
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

385
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh this is hilarious.</v>

386
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.811
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>

387
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 1>He's writing a fucking novel on Twitter.</v>

388
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.380
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

389
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.483
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to follow.</v>

390
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.001
<v Speaker 1>I heard that.</v>

391
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:45.834
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

392
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.171
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

393
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

394
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>That is such a great idea.</v>

395
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.990
<v Speaker 1>And he ends TBC on like every post to be continued to be getting delirious.</v>

396
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 1>He continued and you get to just follow along with it.</v>

397
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 1>This is so strange.</v>

398
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.273
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>

399
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 1>But addressing your question,</v>

400
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>this was extremely tiring for Harold because of his attention with drift and for</v>

401
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>some reason the abstract speech that his mother was making,</v>

402
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 1>like a toy train.</v>

403
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 1>His brain would stay firmly on track,</v>

404
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>weaving,</v>

405
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 1>turning through it to be continued previously unconnected subjects.</v>

406
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Harold had the opposite of add.</v>

407
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 1>He needed to go go some to some school somewhere.</v>

408
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Some typo needed to go,</v>

409
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:29.220
<v Speaker 1>some to some school somewhere and learned how to space to be continued out</v>

410
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>to be continued and then out space to be continued out.</v>

411
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.230
<v Speaker 1>The last dream he had was about a man who invented mirrors when howled workup</v>

412
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.113
<v Speaker 1>the next day,</v>

413
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 1>all he could remember was that he to be continued,</v>

414
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.040
<v Speaker 1>had a dream about us.</v>

415
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Like this is ridiculous.</v>

416
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 1>This is definitely him.</v>

417
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.080
<v Speaker 1>This is definitely happen.</v>

418
00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:49.790
<v Speaker 1>But this is one of the weirdest things I've ever heard anybody doing that.</v>

419
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Steve writes a maniac.</v>

420
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

421
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:56.220
<v Speaker 1>he was the guy who was single handedly his success through this monkey wrench</v>

422
00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:57.270
<v Speaker 1>into the whole,</v>

423
00:10:57.271 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

424
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Boston comedy scene.</v>

425
00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.731
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

426
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:01.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a great documentary by this guy,</v>

427
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Fran Salameda.</v>

428
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.163
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

429
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to look it up with the name of it is.</v>

430
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever worked with them before?</v>

431
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

432
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Fran was a comic from Boston,</v>

433
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Boston Combo.</v>

434
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>How did he throw a wrench into the scene?</v>

435
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Because he got successful.</v>

436
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.473
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

437
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.250
<v Speaker 1>when he got successful,</v>

438
00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 1>everybody kind of freaked out and was like,</v>

439
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:23.251
<v Speaker 1>what Stan went,</v>

440
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:24.001
<v Speaker 1>standups stood out.</v>

441
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:24.834
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's called.</v>

442
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Bob Boston was this incredible place where there was so many great,</v>

443
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>great comedians that were local guys and they would just work locally,</v>

444
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:32.304
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

445
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden Steven Wright got discovered and Steven Wright started doing</v>

446
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Letterman and Carson and everybody was like,</v>

447
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

448
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Then he got his HBO special and then everybody was like,</v>

449
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:41.694
<v Speaker 1>where's mine?</v>

450
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>When is this going to happen for me?</v>

451
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of like changed the tone of the town because it used to be this</v>

452
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.083
<v Speaker 1>almost like,</v>

453
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to say artists' colony,</v>

454
00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 1>but not so fucking gay.</v>

455
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 1>They were savages.</v>

456
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.571
<v Speaker 1>They were crazy.</v>

457
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Coke's Norton,</v>

458
00:11:56.501 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 1>we'd Smolkin whiskey drink and animals and they were fucking hilarious.</v>

459
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And they were just doing it to make everybody laugh and to get by and get paid.</v>

460
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 1>But then all of a sudden,</v>

461
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:05.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

463
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:06.091
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

464
00:12:06.091 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

465
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 1>the dream sort of appeared in Steven Wright form.</v>

466
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.301
<v Speaker 1>Steven,</v>

467
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:10.481
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

468
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden became fucking huge at famous and rational.</v>

469
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 1>And these guys were like,</v>

470
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:14.351
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

471
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:15.131
<v Speaker 1>Steven's good,</v>

472
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 1>but I'm fucking good too.</v>

473
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:17.350
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

474
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of changed the whole tone of the town.</v>

475
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:19.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

476
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 1>guys started like really working towards deals,</v>

477
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:22.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not necessarily a bad thing,</v>

479
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:24.381
<v Speaker 1>but it became,</v>

480
00:12:24.381 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.540
<v Speaker 1>that it became,</v>

482
00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:27.010
<v Speaker 1>there was a different goal on the horizon.</v>

483
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just being funny.</v>

484
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy how success can get in the way of art.</v>

485
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

486
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 1>And often does often does but doesn't have to,</v>

487
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

488
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.863
<v Speaker 1>manageable.</v>

489
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.011
<v Speaker 1>It's a manageable,</v>

490
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:36.491
<v Speaker 1>like people say,</v>

491
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:37.420
<v Speaker 1>oh you sold out.</v>

492
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm like shut up stupid.</v>

493
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what you're talking about.</v>

494
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.680
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're still doing good stuff.</v>

495
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.811
<v Speaker 3>Part of it is like,</v>

496
00:12:42.811 --> 00:12:43.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean like with you,</v>

497
00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:44.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know like,</v>

498
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:44.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

499
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.980
<v Speaker 3>seeing you at the comedy store when I first was,</v>

500
00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:47.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

501
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.150
<v Speaker 3>when I first was starting,</v>

502
00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:48.511
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

503
00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:51.210
<v Speaker 3>the good thing about you is even when you had a show or anything going,</v>

504
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.770
<v Speaker 3>you still kept that mentality of I've got to get up and create and write and you</v>

505
00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:56.581
<v Speaker 3>continue to do that.</v>

506
00:12:56.581 --> 00:12:59.910
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is you can get out of that quote unquote artists' colony,</v>

507
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

508
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.411
<v Speaker 3>with success.</v>

509
00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:02.191
<v Speaker 3>But then you within,</v>

510
00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:03.360
<v Speaker 3>you remind yourself,</v>

511
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.221
<v Speaker 3>it's like a boxer.</v>

512
00:13:04.221 --> 00:13:04.951
<v Speaker 3>I got to keep training.</v>

513
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:05.410
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

514
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>

515
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I think your motivation changes.</v>

516
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Your motivation goes from the bean.</v>

517
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 1>The motivation of a odd,</v>

518
00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 1>just trying to make it,</v>

519
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I want success,</v>

520
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I want to be,</v>

521
00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:13.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:15.310
<v Speaker 1>recognized too.</v>

523
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.240
<v Speaker 1>You get some success,</v>

524
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:16.571
<v Speaker 1>then you go,</v>

525
00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:16.841
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

526
00:13:16.841 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 1>now I just want to do good stuff.</v>

527
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I just want to have fun.</v>

528
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Now my interest is just on the jokes.</v>

529
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 1>It's just in creating the new bit,</v>

530
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.570
<v Speaker 1>just not putting the act together and it actually becomes more fun that way.</v>

531
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:26.641
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>

532
00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:28.110
<v Speaker 3>When you do like and you get,</v>

533
00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:30.090
<v Speaker 3>so when you call it with a bit or something that you'd let him,</v>

534
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.820
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's as good as getting a big paycheck where you're like,</v>

535
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:32.911
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

536
00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:33.361
<v Speaker 3>that was cool.</v>

537
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:34.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's even,</v>

538
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.771
<v Speaker 3>they were saying like,</v>

539
00:13:34.771 --> 00:13:35.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>

540
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.380
<v Speaker 3>you're so excited about it,</v>

541
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.100
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

542
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.250
<v Speaker 3>And it's because it doesn't always co one of the problems of success as it</v>

543
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:45.990
<v Speaker 3>becomes harder to write in newer stuff unless if you put yourself in those lab</v>

544
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.090
<v Speaker 3>kind of situations where you're saying,</v>

545
00:13:48.091 --> 00:13:48.331
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

546
00:13:48.331 --> 00:13:50.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to work out some new stuff.</v>

547
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.790
<v Speaker 3>You know when people come expecting you to always gonna you know,</v>

548
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.410
<v Speaker 3>do those killer whatever things,</v>

549
00:13:55.411 --> 00:13:56.244
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

550
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

551
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:56.781
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

552
00:13:56.781 --> 00:13:56.991
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

553
00:13:56.991 --> 00:13:57.591
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

554
00:13:57.591 --> 00:13:58.190
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

555
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.670
<v Speaker 1>that's fun.</v>

556
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun problem.</v>

557
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.710
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

558
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a tester but it's fantastic.</v>

559
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.270
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why we like doing that sounds comedy hall to this real</v>

560
00:14:05.271 --> 00:14:05.930
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>

561
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like 80 people and I just,</v>

562
00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck around and not even know what I'm really going to say about something</v>

563
00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:12.950
<v Speaker 1>and they know that that's what you're doing.</v>

564
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.280
<v Speaker 1>They know that you're fucking around a lot and I do most of my real bits too.</v>

565
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to give them solid stand up,</v>

566
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.230
<v Speaker 1>but I also want to use the opportunity to fuck around and stretch out.</v>

567
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I never do a full,</v>

568
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.060
<v Speaker 1>like a full sacrifice set.</v>

569
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I won't like go up there with only new bits and just eat dick.</v>

570
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't like doing that man.</v>

571
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they like it either.</v>

572
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.210
<v Speaker 3>The only time,</v>

573
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:34.421
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

574
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:36.420
<v Speaker 3>I've recently tried something like that is a,</v>

575
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 3>the laugh factory was doing some with Kevin Nealon on Tuesdays.</v>

576
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:39.260
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>

577
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.330
<v Speaker 3>was known as seven minutes in new material and then Kevin Nealon comes on stage</v>

578
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:44.840
<v Speaker 3>and sits with you and Kinda,</v>

579
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:45.731
<v Speaker 3>he's a funny guy.</v>

580
00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:48.790
<v Speaker 3>He kind of risks with you and kind of like makes fun of the material but also</v>

581
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 3>gives you some ideas and uh,</v>

582
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 3>and the audience,</v>

583
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.690
<v Speaker 3>well they're supposed to know that that's what they're there for.</v>

584
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:54.161
<v Speaker 3>Half the audit,</v>

585
00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 3>whenever I go up there and go,</v>

586
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:56.690
<v Speaker 3>how many you guys knew you were coming for this?</v>

587
00:14:56.691 --> 00:14:57.830
<v Speaker 3>And like two or three people clap.</v>

588
00:14:57.831 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 3>The rest of the thought was a real show.</v>

589
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.280
<v Speaker 3>But the idea is you're supposed to go up with seven minutes of brand new,</v>

590
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 3>like never try.</v>

591
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:06.120
<v Speaker 3>So what I,</v>

592
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 3>every time I've gone up there,</v>

593
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 3>I've liked just gone into my blackberry and looked at the ideas I've had that</v>

594
00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 3>I've just put down that I haven't riffed on.</v>

595
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.320
<v Speaker 3>I just go up and riff and it's so much now.</v>

596
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.480
<v Speaker 3>He never had and beautiful and real and good things come out of,</v>

597
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

598
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.410
<v Speaker 1>You know gotta take chances,</v>

599
00:15:19.411 --> 00:15:19.681
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

600
00:15:19.681 --> 00:15:20.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a standup comedy is one.</v>

601
00:15:20.971 --> 00:15:22.770
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most important things about it.</v>

602
00:15:22.771 --> 00:15:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Constantly moving,</v>

603
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.080
<v Speaker 1>constantly taking chances.</v>

604
00:15:25.081 --> 00:15:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Some new thing comes out in the news.</v>

605
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Get onstage that day when with Anthony Wiener,</v>

606
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.990
<v Speaker 1>when when the ship went down,</v>

607
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I went on stage that night and had 10 new minutes cause I was just writing about</v>

608
00:15:35.161 --> 00:15:35.581
<v Speaker 1>it all day.</v>

609
00:15:35.581 --> 00:15:36.510
<v Speaker 1>How ridiculous it was.</v>

610
00:15:36.511 --> 00:15:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I was just laughing and we're living in a fucking Coen brothers movie manner.</v>

611
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

612
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.533
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

613
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.340
<v Speaker 1>It's even now steady number.</v>

614
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Fucking guys name his wiener and he's taking pictures of his Dick and sending</v>

615
00:15:49.261 --> 00:15:49.681
<v Speaker 1>get to women.</v>

616
00:15:49.681 --> 00:15:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

617
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.140
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even seem like it could be real.</v>

618
00:15:52.141 --> 00:15:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

619
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.221
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

620
00:15:53.221 --> 00:15:54.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a movie you would go,</v>

621
00:15:54.241 --> 00:15:55.290
<v Speaker 1>that's shitty writing.</v>

622
00:15:55.291 --> 00:15:56.041
<v Speaker 1>This is through right?</v>

623
00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:56.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

624
00:15:56.191 --> 00:15:56.671
<v Speaker 1>Come on dude.</v>

625
00:15:56.671 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 1>You gotta go another name here.</v>

626
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like whenever these senators get caught doing gay shit,</v>

627
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.020
<v Speaker 1>it's always the same thing I think is anti gay senators.</v>

628
00:16:04.021 --> 00:16:05.040
<v Speaker 1>They get called gay and out.</v>

629
00:16:05.041 --> 00:16:05.430
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

630
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.221

<v Speaker 1>it's it is it that easy?</v>

632
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

633
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.081
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

634
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:10.140
<v Speaker 3>And this is the solution.</v>

635
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.370
<v Speaker 3>This is really what's going on.</v>

636
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Well there's so much of that going on now.</v>

637
00:16:13.051 --> 00:16:13.884
<v Speaker 3>It seems like I just,</v>

638
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.820
<v Speaker 3>they just had a,</v>

639
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.130
<v Speaker 3>I just saw Andrew is Andrew Cuomo,</v>

640
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Mario Cuomo son.</v>

641
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.830
<v Speaker 3>He's now the governor of New York is,</v>

642
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.480
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Andrew or I think anyway,</v>

643
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.240
<v Speaker 3>governor Cuomo was up there talking about some,</v>

644
00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:24.570
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

645
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.280
<v Speaker 3>they just showed a clip of him and I was like,</v>

646
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.151
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

647
00:16:27.151 --> 00:16:28.020
<v Speaker 3>cause he seems like he's,</v>

648
00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:28.740
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

649
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.790
<v Speaker 3>he's a Cuomo.</v>

650
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:30.780
<v Speaker 3>He kind of has like,</v>

651
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.060
<v Speaker 3>seems like he's legit right in back of my mind.</v>

652
00:16:33.061 --> 00:16:33.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

653
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.160
<v Speaker 3>I hope he's not banging some lady.</v>

654
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:35.431
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

655
00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:36.000
<v Speaker 3>it's going to come.</v>

656
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.330
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

657
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.081
<v Speaker 3>cause it almost,</v>

658
00:16:37.081 --> 00:16:39.780
<v Speaker 3>if it's a lady he could live through with light duty,</v>

659
00:16:39.781 --> 00:16:40.680
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

660
00:16:40.681 --> 00:16:41.431
<v Speaker 3>now you can't even live.</v>

661
00:16:41.431 --> 00:16:42.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like,</v>

662
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.380
<v Speaker 3>you know the wiener,</v>

663
00:16:43.381 --> 00:16:43.981
<v Speaker 3>we don't know.</v>

664
00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:44.371
<v Speaker 3>I mean did he,</v>

665
00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:46.380
<v Speaker 3>do he actually have sex with him?</v>

666
00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.480
<v Speaker 3>It was just like sending pictures of his penis a freak.</v>

667
00:16:48.481 --> 00:16:49.314
<v Speaker 3>He's just a freak.</v>

668
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:49.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

669
00:16:49.661 --> 00:16:50.730
<v Speaker 3>So now he's got,</v>

670
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.720
<v Speaker 3>so what I'm saying is like,</v>

671
00:16:51.721 --> 00:16:52.081
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

672
00:16:52.081 --> 00:16:52.361
<v Speaker 3>like if,</v>

673
00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:57.180
<v Speaker 3>if government give governor Cuomo Cuomo Cuomo were found to be having an affair,</v>

674
00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:57.830

687
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:09.000

693
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Gary condit thing.</v>

695
00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Remember when nine 11 happened?</v>

696
00:17:21.601 --> 00:17:23.520
<v Speaker 1>You remember Gary Condit and Chandra Levy?</v>

697
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Chandra Levy was his assistant.</v>

698
00:17:25.741 --> 00:17:26.700
<v Speaker 1>She turned out missing.</v>

699
00:17:26.701 --> 00:17:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thought he killed her because he was having an affair with her.</v>

700
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:30.780
<v Speaker 1>There was all this craziness.</v>

701
00:17:30.781 --> 00:17:31.141
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

702
00:17:31.141 --> 00:17:31.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.430
<v Speaker 1>they found her body,</v>

704
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:32.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:17:32.891 --> 00:17:33.310
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

706
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.143
<v Speaker 1>but he got off,</v>

707
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.473
<v Speaker 1>he got off on it.</v>

708
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:36.600
<v Speaker 1>My God.</v>

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:36.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

711
00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:39.740
<v Speaker 1>And they apparently connected her murder to a bar.</v>

712
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.700
<v Speaker 1>A guy had killed the few women in that area,</v>

713
00:17:41.701 --> 00:17:43.180
<v Speaker 1>so it might've actually been legit.</v>

714
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Serial killer.</v>

715
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:44.650

718
00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 3>You should riff on that about pretty soon there'd be no one left to run and</v>

719
00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:50.821
<v Speaker 3>it'll,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

723
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.881
<v Speaker 3>so someone,</v>

724
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:55.170
<v Speaker 3>no one wants to have any sex with.</v>

732
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 1>we have to come to grips with the fact that everybody that wants to be</v>

757
00:18:45.731 --> 00:18:47.410
<v Speaker 3>So he's being geared up for that.</v>

758
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.790
<v Speaker 3>And so the maid comes in to clean the place and he shows up naked and he</v>

759
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.310
<v Speaker 3>basically think he chased her around and tried to rape her or something.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So the story,</v>

767
00:19:00.761 --> 00:19:01.960
<v Speaker 3>who knows what really happened,</v>

768
00:19:01.961 --> 00:19:02.171
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

769

<v Speaker 3>Is it out?</v>

778
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:10.601
<v Speaker 3>I'll say allegedly.</v>

779
00:19:10.601 --> 00:19:10.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

780
00:19:10.701 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

781
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.280
<v Speaker 3>that's what our sources,</v>

782
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.750
<v Speaker 3>that's what are sources have told us.</v>

783
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.650
<v Speaker 3>The Internet.</v>

784
00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:14.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

785
00:19:14.831 --> 00:19:15.664
<v Speaker 3>The Internet.</v>

786
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I didn't look into that at all,</v>

787
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.311
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

788
00:19:18.311 --> 00:19:18.581
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

789
00:19:18.581 --> 00:19:18.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

790
00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:19.211
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

791
00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:19.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

792
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:20.141
<v Speaker 3>but the point,</v>

793
00:19:20.141 --> 00:19:20.974
<v Speaker 3>but what's funny is,</v>

794
00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.150
<v Speaker 3>is I was reading this,</v>

795
00:19:22.151 --> 00:19:23.260
<v Speaker 3>some of the French,</v>

796
00:19:23.261 --> 00:19:24.590
<v Speaker 3>the French reaction were there,</v>

797
00:19:24.591 --> 00:19:25.180
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

798
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.871
<v Speaker 3>they were saying like,</v>

799
00:19:25.871 --> 00:19:26.530
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

800
00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.120
<v Speaker 3>the French aren't that phased by the whole,</v>

801
00:19:28.121 --> 00:19:28.451
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

802
00:19:28.451 --> 00:19:29.860
<v Speaker 3>they expect their politician to be,</v>

803
00:19:29.861 --> 00:19:30.041
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

804
00:19:30.041 --> 00:19:32.200
<v Speaker 3>if you're a politician and France isn't bang in somebody,</v>

805
00:19:32.201 --> 00:19:33.010
<v Speaker 3>then it's weird.</v>

806
00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

807
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.293
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

808
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.313
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

809
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.561
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

810
00:19:35.561 --> 00:19:36.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

811
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

812
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.001
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

813
00:19:37.001 --> 00:19:39.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing that we've talked about on this podcast before called toxo</v>

814
00:19:39.831 --> 00:19:41.470
<v Speaker 1>plasma and it's a,</v>

815
00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:41.681
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

816
00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:46.150
<v Speaker 1>a cat parasite that infects a human beings and changes their behavior.</v>

817
00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:47.700
<v Speaker 1>And it makes men reckless.</v>

818
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.470
<v Speaker 1>It makes men very aggressive and reckless makes them do crazy shit.</v>

819
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.191
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

820
00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:51.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

821
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge population of a,</v>

822
00:19:53.291 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 1>a high rate of infection rather in France and Francis,</v>

823
00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.873
<v Speaker 1>like 80%,</v>

824
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.950
<v Speaker 1>80% of the people are infected by this toxoplasma as much as 80% in some areas.</v>

825
00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.430
<v Speaker 1>GS,</v>

826
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:04.210
<v Speaker 1>which is insane.</v>

827
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:04.461
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

828
00:20:04.461 --> 00:20:04.990
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

829
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a parasite and it's just to management as you men and women,</v>

830
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.500
<v Speaker 1>sex women.</v>

831
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.170
<v Speaker 1>But the women,</v>

832
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.910
<v Speaker 1>it's tougher to document how it affects women because they think it makes them</v>

833
00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:13.744
<v Speaker 1>more submissive.</v>

834
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.400
<v Speaker 1>But with,</v>

835
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.011
<v Speaker 1>with men,</v>

836
00:20:15.011 --> 00:20:18.520
<v Speaker 1>it makes them aggressive jerks and makes them really reckless.</v>

837
00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:19.480
<v Speaker 1>That explains a lot.</v>

838
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

839
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 1>You went to smoke something and catch it.</v>

840
00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.980
<v Speaker 1>So that's why like pregnant women aren't supposed to touch cat shit.</v>

841
00:20:26.981 --> 00:20:28.720
<v Speaker 1>If they are telling that to your wife when she was pregnant,</v>

842
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.010
<v Speaker 1>don't touch any kitty litter.</v>

843
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever go near any cats.</v>

844
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

845
00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It's why because of a this toxoplasma but huge percentage of people.</v>

846
00:20:35.501 --> 00:20:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean if this guy has toxo if he's from France,</v>

847
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might make them loked out where he just whips his dick out on the</v>

848
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:41.500
<v Speaker 1>main.</v>

849
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.333
<v Speaker 3>That'd be great.</v>

850
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.211
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a great,</v>

851
00:20:43.211 --> 00:20:43.621
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

852
00:20:43.621 --> 00:20:45.310
<v Speaker 3>a plea and the court be like,</v>

853
00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I have toxoplasma plasma know,</v>

854
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.940
<v Speaker 1>feel free to use it.</v>

855
00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honored if you guys use that.</v>

856
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

857
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.650
<v Speaker 1>that maybe I possibly had some [inaudible] saying.</v>

858
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.220
<v Speaker 1>So plasma defense,</v>

859
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.510
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

860
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible.</v>

861
00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see this guy tested.</v>

862
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:57.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

863
00:20:57.971 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 1>if he really did so do something fucking reckless and crazy.</v>

864
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.740
<v Speaker 1>But I think anybody who wants to be in a position of power like that,</v>

865
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:04.420
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them have sexual things.</v>

866
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.273
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

867
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Clinton would just whip his dick out on girls crazy is that,</v>

868
00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.590
<v Speaker 1>it's just where he was the president.</v>

869
00:21:10.591 --> 00:21:11.620
<v Speaker 1>He would just whip his dick on it.</v>

870
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:14.860

925
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

926
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Arnold is probably like when he started banging her,</v>

927
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was so big,</v>

928
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:15.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

929
00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:17.200
<v Speaker 1>when he was bodybuilding in and be like that.</v>

930
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And there's only one way to do that and you have to be on steroids,</v>

931
00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:20.740
<v Speaker 1>you have to be on testosterone.</v>

932
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.420
<v Speaker 1>And Arnold was like,</v>

933
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:22.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

934
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.640
<v Speaker 1>known allegedly for being a guy who would take just fucking massive quantities</v>

935
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:28.474
<v Speaker 1>of everything.</v>

936
00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.130
<v Speaker 1>That's why he was so huge.</v>

937
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 1>You look at the photos of him back when he was Mister Olympia and holy fucking</v>

938
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:35.584
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

939
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Well you know the levels of testosterone,</v>

940
00:22:37.781 --> 00:22:39.520
<v Speaker 1>that guy must have been taken where probably through the roof.</v>

941
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.110
<v Speaker 1>So he probably just would fuck everything.</v>

942
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:41.973
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

943
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Naomi,</v>

944
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.313
<v Speaker 1>I fuck you.</v>

945
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.243
<v Speaker 1>This is everything.</v>

946
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:44.731
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't that,</v>

947
00:22:44.731 --> 00:22:48.570
<v Speaker 3>doesn't that lower your sex drive or are supposed to like make your penis while</v>

948
00:22:48.571 --> 00:22:48.880
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

949
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Cause we lowers your body's natural production of testosterone because if you</v>

950
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:56.560
<v Speaker 1>inject a bunch of testosterone in your body and you bring it over a certain</v>

951
00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 1>baseline when your body is like,</v>

952
00:22:58.001 --> 00:23:00.190
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is all this task doing around here?</v>

953
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 1>So your body says we don't have to use the ball.</v>

954
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Shut the balls down so your body shuts the balls down because you're squirting</v>

955
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:08.500
<v Speaker 1>into your body 10 times a natural level of testosterone.</v>

956
00:23:08.501 --> 00:23:10.600
<v Speaker 1>So you can get a 30 inch fucking arms.</v>

957
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:11.201
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>

958
00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:11.361
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

959
00:23:11.361 --> 00:23:13.870
<v Speaker 1>when you see guys like that and you watch them pose,</v>

960
00:23:13.871 --> 00:23:14.651
<v Speaker 1>you ever see them pose?</v>

961
00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

962
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 1>They have the tiniest balls you've ever seen in your life.</v>

963
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

964
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

965
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I would be terrified if my balls were that small.</v>

966
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.050
<v Speaker 1>And if you see those dudes in those little lines,</v>

967
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.570
<v Speaker 3>m and m done,</v>

969
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:27.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like the ball's wither away.</v>

970
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.393
<v Speaker 3>I would love it.</v>

971
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I think my boss.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

975
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.160
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have two small little cute ball things attached to it.</v>

976
00:23:43.161 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 3>Then these big droopy old man throats,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm allergic to cats so we don't have,</v>

1087
00:26:18.621 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 4>but we have a neighborhood cats and they always go in our back yard and they</v>

1091
00:26:24.201 --> 00:26:27.680
<v Speaker 4>I never had cats so I thought cat shit was like little like bunny shit.</v>

1092
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:29.210
<v Speaker 4>Now it's like serious shit.</v>

1093
00:26:29.211 --> 00:26:33.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm constantly like snoop Dogg was here and my cat has this thing where like</v>

1094
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:36.020
<v Speaker 4>they pee on certain sides of the litter box,</v>

1095
00:26:36.021 --> 00:26:40.560
<v Speaker 4>like the P my cat pees right in front of the opening so it has to put it too,</v>

1096
00:26:40.561 --> 00:26:44.550
<v Speaker 4>but like right out the door of that litter box and he had shit the other day and</v>

1097
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:46.170
<v Speaker 4>just sprayed my wall was shit.</v>

1098
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

1099
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:49.350
<v Speaker 4>there's such dirty little animals.</v>

1100
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.270
<v Speaker 4>And you know when you let them out in the wild,</v>

1101
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:53.280
<v Speaker 4>that's when you gotta be worried about Toxoplasma.</v>

1102
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.481
<v Speaker 4>That's when they catch it.</v>

1104
00:26:54.481 --> 00:26:55.261
<v Speaker 4>They catch it from,</v>

1105
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 4>from rats out in the wild.</v>

1106
00:26:57.391 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 4>So it'd become dangerous.</v>

1107
00:26:59.131 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 4>It can,</v>

1108
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.151
<v Speaker 4>it can fuck with you.</v>

1109
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:01.920
<v Speaker 4>And it's very dangerous for little children.</v>

1110
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.080
<v Speaker 4>Very dangerous for babies and shit like that.</v>

1111
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:05.550
<v Speaker 4>They're immune system's not ready for it.</v>

1112
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:06.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

1113
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.950
<v Speaker 4>Creepy fucking cats and dogs aren't even better than I,</v>

1115
00:27:10.951 --> 00:27:11.970
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>

1116
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:12.330
<v Speaker 4>Dog.</v>

1117
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 4>My dog lately has been digging up shit and in the hiding bones in there and</v>

1118
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:18.210
<v Speaker 4>putting it like just cartoon style,</v>

1119
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 4>like digging holes and it got in a fight with like a possum the other day or</v>

1120
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:22.764
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1121
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 4>And I don't even know what it had.</v>

1122
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:28.590
<v Speaker 4>It looked like maybe a baby of some kind all chewed up and brought it into the</v>

1123
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:31.960
<v Speaker 4>house and just left it right on these pee pads that we,</v>

1124
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.560
<v Speaker 4>awesome baby possum.</v>

1125
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck it was so tiny.</v>

1126
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 4>If your dog killed something and it's gotta be little as fuck.</v>

1127
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1128
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:39.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:40.260
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1130
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:40.861
<v Speaker 4>what does your dog wait?</v>

1131
00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:41.970
<v Speaker 4>Like five pounds or something.</v>

1132
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.380
<v Speaker 4>Eight pounds.</v>

1133
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 4>She's so small.</v>

1134
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.780
<v Speaker 4>How could she kill anything?</v>

1135
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:46.890
<v Speaker 4>What can she kill?</v>

1136
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.960
<v Speaker 4>I think it was probably dead already,</v>

1137
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.490
<v Speaker 4>but she decided to eat it,</v>

1138
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.490
<v Speaker 4>but she brought it in and Laid It on the pee pad.</v>

1139
00:27:53.491 --> 00:27:54.410
<v Speaker 4>Like she thought it was pooped.</v>

1140
00:27:54.411 --> 00:27:55.800
<v Speaker 4>So that's kind of cool.</v>

1141
00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 4>But still it's like I don't want dead corpses and fucking shit on my walls while</v>

1142
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:00.444
<v Speaker 4>I'm cooking.</v>

1143
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.490
<v Speaker 4>Keep the dog outside.</v>

1144
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:03.324
<v Speaker 4>Well not that dog.</v>

1145
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 4>You can't a hawk come and swap that sucker up.</v>

1146
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.140
<v Speaker 4>And what if I were to buy a huge dog house or make a dog house that was big</v>

1147
00:28:10.141 --> 00:28:10.770
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>

1148
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:11.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1149
00:28:11.101 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 4>to let the dog stay in there for ever.</v>

1150
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:15.361
<v Speaker 4>Listen man.</v>

1151
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 4>That dog needs people.</v>

1152
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.070
<v Speaker 4>You've got a dog that needs a lot of human attention.</v>

1153
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.040
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that.</v>

1154
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:20.500
<v Speaker 4>You can't leave.</v>

1155
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.071
<v Speaker 3>We're outside.</v>

1156
00:28:21.071 --> 00:28:21.760
<v Speaker 3>So my crazy,</v>

1157
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.580
<v Speaker 3>we've never been dogged people and my are animals.</v>

1158
00:28:24.581 --> 00:28:25.420
<v Speaker 3>Like I never had animals.</v>

1159
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:25.900
<v Speaker 3>My My,</v>

1160
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.290
<v Speaker 3>my kid loves dogs and we thought about for minute getting one.</v>

1161
00:28:29.291 --> 00:28:30.910
<v Speaker 3>But then I realized that I'd just be,</v>

1162
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.280
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to take care of the dog because my kids three years old,</v>

1163
00:28:33.281 --> 00:28:34.114
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to do it.</v>

1164
00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Kids will tell you,</v>

1165
00:28:35.291 --> 00:28:35.651
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1166
00:28:35.651 --> 00:28:36.461
<v Speaker 3>I love dogs.</v>

1167
00:28:36.461 --> 00:28:37.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely going to take care of it dad.</v>

1168
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know you're walking that fucking thing every day are my boy has</v>

1169
00:28:42.101 --> 00:28:43.690
<v Speaker 3>like he is just fearless.</v>

1170
00:28:43.691 --> 00:28:44.800
<v Speaker 3>She'll go up to any dog.</v>

1171
00:28:44.801 --> 00:28:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Like when he was like one and a half we went to some family friends,</v>

1172
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:51.700
<v Speaker 3>they had like a rottweiler big scary looking and he was up there trying to kiss</v>

1173
00:28:51.701 --> 00:28:52.061
<v Speaker 3>it and we're like,</v>

1174
00:28:52.061 --> 00:28:52.181
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1175
00:28:52.181 --> 00:28:52.301
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1176
00:28:52.301 --> 00:28:52.750
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1177
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.321
<v Speaker 3>But he was just,</v>

1178
00:28:53.321 --> 00:28:54.220
<v Speaker 3>he goes for it.</v>

1179
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust dogs.</v>

1180
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.811
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1181
00:28:55.811 --> 00:28:56.390
<v Speaker 3>no maybes.</v>

1182
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Because they get confused and think babies are dogs.</v>

1183
00:28:58.810 --> 00:28:59.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1184
00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.341
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>

1185
00:29:00.341 --> 00:29:02.080
<v Speaker 3>They don't associate that with being a person.</v>

1186
00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:02.801
<v Speaker 3>So they'll,</v>

1187
00:29:02.801 --> 00:29:05.440
<v Speaker 3>they'll like check a baby just to let a baby now you know,</v>

1188
00:29:05.441 --> 00:29:06.041
<v Speaker 3>like check a baby.</v>

1189
00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:06.874
<v Speaker 3>Like they were checking dogs.</v>

1190
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.800
<v Speaker 3>Don't fucking my territory.</v>

1191
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.450
<v Speaker 3>I've seen dogs do that before.</v>

1192
00:29:10.451 --> 00:29:11.020
<v Speaker 3>It's Carrie.</v>

1193
00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.691
<v Speaker 3>I was going to,</v>

1194
00:29:11.691 --> 00:29:12.730
<v Speaker 3>if you ever eaten at that place,</v>

1195

1197
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.220
<v Speaker 3>we were going with a friend of mine and go sit down one time and we're about to</v>

1198
00:29:21.221 --> 00:29:21.691
<v Speaker 3>sit in this,</v>

1199
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:23.710
<v Speaker 3>this girl like five year old girl,</v>

1201
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.450
<v Speaker 3>cute little blonde girl,</v>

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.230
<v Speaker 3>five year old and she's got like a little bloody nose going.</v>

1203
00:29:29.231 --> 00:29:29.860
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1204
00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.270
<v Speaker 3>oh poor girl fell or something.</v>

1205
00:29:31.271 --> 00:29:35.560
<v Speaker 3>And then as we're sitting we sit next to this dog and the story comes out that</v>

1206
00:29:35.561 --> 00:29:39.100
<v Speaker 3>she was up there playing and the dog bit it or knows and cutter.</v>

1207
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1208
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.061
<v Speaker 3>And we're like,</v>

1210
00:29:40.301 --> 00:29:41.650
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to sit to this dog.</v>

1211
00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:42.760
<v Speaker 5>This dog was,</v>

1212
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.121
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1213
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 5>it looked like a regular,</v>

1214
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't any kind of like,</v>

1215
00:29:45.011 --> 00:29:45.510
<v Speaker 5>it was like a,</v>

1216
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:46.510
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't golden retriever,</v>

1217
00:29:46.511 --> 00:29:47.321
<v Speaker 5>but it was like a regular,</v>

1218
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:48.140
<v Speaker 5>like it wasn't like,</v>

1219
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:48.700
<v Speaker 5>like a month.</v>

1220
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:48.851
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:50.350
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't anything to fucking girl.</v>

1222

1224
00:29:51.891 --> 00:29:54.580
<v Speaker 5>what she did or what happened to the dog was still alive.</v>

1225
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 5>Nobody had beaten it to death.</v>

1226
00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:56.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:56.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:56.921

1229
00:29:56.921 --> 00:29:57.240
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1230
00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:57.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1231
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1232
00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.380
<v Speaker 5>Bite a five year old baby.</v>

1233
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1236
00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:02.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1237
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.270
<v Speaker 5>So I'm always worried with my son,</v>

1238
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:04.451
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1239
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:04.901
<v Speaker 5>He just went,</v>

1240
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1241
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.080
<v Speaker 5>you gotta be real careful.</v>

1242
00:30:06.081 --> 00:30:06.900
<v Speaker 5>It was right up there.</v>

1243
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.900
<v Speaker 5>You got to always think that a dog will consider your baby to be an animal.</v>

1244
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:11.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1245
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.860
<v Speaker 5>they don't,</v>

1246
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.800
<v Speaker 5>they don't consider it to be a person cause it's not talking really in a real</v>

1247
00:30:14.801 --> 00:30:16.250
<v Speaker 5>little and they're high pitched voice.</v>

1248
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 5>It's like this is not the same thing.</v>

1249
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.360
<v Speaker 5>I see Mazda Brawny he could tell me what to do.</v>

1250
00:30:19.361 --> 00:30:20.270
<v Speaker 5>Well this is a little motherfucker.</v>

1251
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 5>Tell him,</v>

1252
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:21.150
<v Speaker 5>tell him what's the deal,</v>

1253
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:21.431
<v Speaker 5>bitch.</v>

1254
00:30:21.431 --> 00:30:22.264
<v Speaker 5>Fuck them up.</v>

1255
00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.680
<v Speaker 5>Try to take my food.</v>

1256
00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:24.800
<v Speaker 5>Tend to her dog for a bit.</v>

1257
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:25.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1258
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.380
<v Speaker 5>I've had the worst week.</v>

1259
00:30:26.381 --> 00:30:28.570
<v Speaker 5>There's this bird that's outside in my tree,</v>

1260
00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:29.980
<v Speaker 5>like the animal kingdom.</v>

1261
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:30.731
<v Speaker 5>You had a cat,</v>

1262
00:30:30.731 --> 00:30:31.271
<v Speaker 5>a dog.</v>

1263
00:30:31.271 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 5>Now the bird,</v>

1264
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:32.853
<v Speaker 5>this bird,</v>

1265
00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it is,</v>

1266
00:30:33.851 --> 00:30:37.570
<v Speaker 5>but every time it gets dark it goes through like 12 different chirp things.</v>

1267
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:37.870
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like,</v>

1268
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.000
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like somebody breaking into a car,</v>

1269
00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.053
<v Speaker 5>Lawrence</v>

1270
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:46.750
<v Speaker 5>and it keeps on doing it the whole entire night to the bird call.</v>

1271
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.950
<v Speaker 5>So I'm thinking about like poisoning or slingshotting are shooting this bird.</v>

1272
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:53.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what to do because it's been all night.</v>

1273
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.190
<v Speaker 5>You're Greek day this week.</v>

1274
00:30:54.191 --> 00:30:57.900
<v Speaker 5>You know how long you'd be out there trying to slingshot this break every window</v>

1275
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.060
<v Speaker 5>and I bet you got some people listen to the podcast too.</v>

1276
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:03.880
<v Speaker 5>Like I know what that mother fucker lives.</v>

1277
00:31:03.881 --> 00:31:04.870
<v Speaker 5>It was him with that sling shot.</v>

1278
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:05.733
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1279
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.870
<v Speaker 5>It's a horrible though.</v>

1280
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.600
<v Speaker 5>I need to BB guns.</v>

1281
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.590
<v Speaker 5>Bb guns are pretty accurate.</v>

1282
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:08.861
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1283
00:31:08.861 --> 00:31:09.311
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking about,</v>

1284
00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:10.121
<v Speaker 5>I can't even see it.</v>

1285
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:10.954
<v Speaker 5>It's just this big.</v>

1286
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.890
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1287
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 5>That's just one of those ideas you get in your head.</v>

1288
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:14.410
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1289
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:14.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>

1290
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to put an end to this.</v>

1291
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:16.680
<v Speaker 5>And then you ended up being like,</v>

1292
00:31:16.681 --> 00:31:18.730
<v Speaker 5>like Wiley Coyote or like Elmer Fudd.</v>

1293
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.890
<v Speaker 5>That's how people like fall from trees and break their neck and die trying to</v>

1294
00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:26.170
<v Speaker 5>kill some bird tweets outside your window.</v>

1295
00:31:26.171 --> 00:31:26.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1296
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:26.570
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

1297
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:27.640
<v Speaker 5>I've had times when like,</v>

1298

<v Speaker 5>It's on lights.</v>

1304
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:38.740
<v Speaker 5>Go on now you got to go around looking for the mosquito against your white wall.</v>

1305
00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.670
<v Speaker 5>Like he disappears.</v>

1306
00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:40.391
<v Speaker 5>He reappears,</v>

1307
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:41.410
<v Speaker 5>you're swinging shit.</v>

1308
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:41.621
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:31:41.621 --> 00:31:44.610
<v Speaker 5>Your eyes are trying to focus my God fucking tears in them,</v>

1310
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:46.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1311
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.141
<v Speaker 5>half hour later like,</v>

1312
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:47.974
<v Speaker 5>fuck it man.</v>

1313
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 5>We don't realize how few bugs we have in California until you go on the east</v>

1314
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:58.330
<v Speaker 5>coast in the summertime and you realize like go near a lake lake in the</v>

1315
00:31:58.331 --> 00:31:58.811
<v Speaker 5>summertime,</v>

1316
00:31:58.811 --> 00:31:59.021
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1317
00:31:59.021 --> 00:31:59.831
<v Speaker 5>mother fucker.</v>

1318
00:31:59.831 --> 00:32:00.910
<v Speaker 5>This is ridiculous.</v>

1319
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:01.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1320
00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.920
<v Speaker 5>But you know how cool lightning bugs was.</v>

1321
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:05.690
<v Speaker 5>I do miss lightening bugs when you're just going out in your backyard and just</v>

1322
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.240
<v Speaker 5>like this glowing paradise.</v>

1323
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:08.441
<v Speaker 5>But those are cool.</v>

1324
00:32:08.441 --> 00:32:08.711
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

1325
00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:09.790
<v Speaker 5>but they don't bother you.</v>

1326
00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:10.210
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1327
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 5>like smell grips,</v>

1328
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.630
<v Speaker 5>I would say with,</v>

1329
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:12.461
<v Speaker 5>with mosquitoes,</v>

1330
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:14.170
<v Speaker 5>like they never have mosquitoes.</v>

1331
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.670
<v Speaker 5>Mosquitoes,</v>

1332
00:32:15.671 --> 00:32:17.020
<v Speaker 5>not a fuckup paradise.</v>

1333
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 5>Whenever you book a trip,</v>

1334
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:19.660
<v Speaker 5>you go down to Mexico and you're like,</v>

1335
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:20.110
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1336
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.771
<v Speaker 5>this is great.</v>

1337
00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:21.521
<v Speaker 5>Here's the beer,</v>

1338
00:32:21.521 --> 00:32:22.300

1339
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:22.990
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1340
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.350
<v Speaker 5>And like half an hour later you start getting busy like,</v>

1341
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.710
<v Speaker 5>and every time they showed those stupid corona commercials where the guy like</v>

1342
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:31.720
<v Speaker 5>throws his cell phone under the water,</v>

1343
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.231
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1344
00:32:32.231 --> 00:32:33.770
<v Speaker 5>show the fucking mosquitoes man.</v>

1345
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.380
<v Speaker 5>It never that comfortable.</v>

1346
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.570
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the good things about Hawaii too.</v>

1347
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.240
<v Speaker 5>Not Too many bugs in Hawaii that's make that trip out to that volcano in the</v>

1348
00:32:41.241 --> 00:32:42.040
<v Speaker 5>middle of the ocean.</v>

1349
00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:42.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1350
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:42.711
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1351
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:42.861
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1352
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 5>That's not a bad,</v>

1353
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.330
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1354
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:45.500
<v Speaker 5>Not that many bugs man.</v>

1355
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.750
<v Speaker 5>But California as far as like no bugs,</v>

1356
00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:49.580
<v Speaker 5>this is probably as good as it gets anywhere in the country.</v>

1357
00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.781
<v Speaker 5>You've got to Florida,</v>

1358
00:32:50.781 --> 00:32:51.800
<v Speaker 5>Florida is ridiculous.</v>

1359
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.690
<v Speaker 5>I might as well be living in the jungle.</v>

1360
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.593
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1361
00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:55.970
<v Speaker 5>Cause there was an apartment building.</v>

1362
00:32:55.971 --> 00:32:57.050
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't mean it's not the jungle.</v>

1363
00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 5>You've got a little pond next door with a fucking alligator in it.</v>

1364
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:00.270
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

1365
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.670
<v Speaker 5>They could be living in Gainesville.</v>

1366
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.630
<v Speaker 5>You could be living in like a nice part of town and take a couple blocks,</v>

1367
00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 5>go for a walk and Oh,</v>

1368
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:07.221
<v Speaker 5>what's this?</v>

1369
00:33:07.221 --> 00:33:08.054
<v Speaker 5>A dinosaur.</v>

1370
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking dinosaur poodle eating dinosaur wander to the streets.</v>

1371
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.610
<v Speaker 5>The Komodo dragons and monsters and alligators are not that aggressive.</v>

1372
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:18.230
<v Speaker 5>They're not nearly as aggressive as crocodiles.</v>

1373
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.860
<v Speaker 5>Crocodiles are really dangerous.</v>

1374
00:33:19.861 --> 00:33:20.180
<v Speaker 5>It's different.</v>

1375
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.470
<v Speaker 5>It's an alligator and a crocodile.</v>

1376
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:22.580
<v Speaker 5>The looks are different.</v>

1377
00:33:22.581 --> 00:33:23.301
<v Speaker 5>A crocodile,</v>

1378
00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 5>their teeth like stick out of their mouth a little bit and they have a longer</v>

1379
00:33:26.391 --> 00:33:27.140
<v Speaker 5>snout.</v>

1380
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.930
<v Speaker 5>Alligators have like a shorter stubbier wider snout,</v>

1381
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.251
<v Speaker 5>but there.</v>

1382
00:33:30.251 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 5>But alligators in general are bigger than crocodiles,</v>

1383
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1384
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.830
<v Speaker 5>No crocodiles,</v>

1385
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:34.910
<v Speaker 5>they can get bigger.</v>

1386
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:38.570
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe American alligators might be bigger than American crocodiles,</v>

1387
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.583
<v Speaker 5>but the biggest,</v>

1388
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.630
<v Speaker 5>the biggest crocodiles are the biggest of that.</v>

1389
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.493
<v Speaker 5>That you know,</v>

1390
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.290
<v Speaker 5>species that form similar though.</v>

1391
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:45.921
<v Speaker 5>I mean Shit,</v>

1392
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:47.820
<v Speaker 5>if you didn't know and you saw an alligator and a crocodile,</v>

1393
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.510
<v Speaker 5>you would say that's the same thing like a Mexican and Guatemalan.</v>

1394
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.081
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1395
00:33:52.081 --> 00:33:52.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1396
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.001
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1397
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:54.110
<v Speaker 5>They don't look much different,</v>

1398
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:54.320
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1399
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.200
<v Speaker 5>but apparently they're,</v>

1400
00:33:55.201 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 5>they're way more aggressive.</v>

1401
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 5>Crocodiles are much,</v>

1402
00:33:57.261 --> 00:33:58.190
<v Speaker 5>much more aggressive.</v>

1403
00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:58.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1404
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:03.080
<v Speaker 5>I watched some documentary on alligators and crocodiles and they had this place</v>

1405
00:34:03.081 --> 00:34:03.280
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

1406
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1407
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was in Florida where they were raising them and they had all these</v>

1408
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:07.390
<v Speaker 5>crocodiles,</v>

1409
00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1410
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.870
<v Speaker 5>these alligators and one crocodile and the crocodile would run over the top of</v>

1411
00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:13.640
<v Speaker 5>the alligators head when they would feed,</v>

1412
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 5>he would like be bitch,</v>

1413
00:34:15.081 --> 00:34:17.390
<v Speaker 5>just stepping over them to get to the food.</v>

1414
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.240
<v Speaker 5>Just super way more aggressive than the alligators.</v>

1415
00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:20.841
<v Speaker 5>But in general,</v>

1416
00:34:20.841 --> 00:34:21.210
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

1417
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:21.550
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1418
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.890
<v Speaker 5>like I don't know how people like,</v>

1419
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1420
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.670
<v Speaker 5>once in a while we got like mountain lions and stuff,</v>

1421
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.290
<v Speaker 5>but generally speaking at,</v>

1422
00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:27.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1423
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:30.680
<v Speaker 5>how much you know with that suck if he's just hanging out in a crocodile or an</v>

1424
00:34:30.681 --> 00:34:32.090
<v Speaker 5>alligator shows up in your backyard.</v>

1425
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:32.983
<v Speaker 5>Now what he'd do,</v>

1426
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.621
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1427
00:34:33.621 --> 00:34:37.250
<v Speaker 5>there was a funny story in Miami about a guy who was running from the law and a</v>

1428
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:39.260
<v Speaker 5>in a high speed chase ditches,</v>

1429
00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:40.610
<v Speaker 5>his car wipes his car out,</v>

1430
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:45.080
<v Speaker 5>jumps into a fucking river and wherever he was or jumped into a lake,</v>

1431
00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:46.550
<v Speaker 5>the moment he jumped in,</v>

1432
00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:47.900
<v Speaker 5>he got killed by an alligator.</v>

1433
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:48.530
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1434
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:52.550
<v Speaker 5>He just landed like right next to an alligator and the alligator jack them right</v>

1435
00:34:52.551 --> 00:34:53.870
<v Speaker 5>in front of the car on my God.</v>

1436
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:54.281
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1437
00:34:54.281 --> 00:34:55.970
<v Speaker 5>it's a fucking movie that is hilarious.</v>

1438
00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 5>Fucking movie.</v>

1439
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.490
<v Speaker 5>The guy jumps out of the car,</v>

1440
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.710
<v Speaker 5>dives into the water and right away,</v>

1441
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.101
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>

1442
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:01.934
<v Speaker 5>Gets killed.</v>

1443
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.433
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1444
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:04.861
<v Speaker 5>it happens.</v>

1445
00:35:04.861 --> 00:35:05.900
<v Speaker 5>Those cops are good man.</v>

1446
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:07.340
<v Speaker 5>They got alligators working with them.</v>

1447
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:08.211
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>

1448
00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:08.781
<v Speaker 5>I was actually,</v>

1449
00:35:08.781 --> 00:35:09.620
<v Speaker 5>I read when I,</v>

1450
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:10.720
<v Speaker 5>it just meant I said the key.</v>

1451
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.200
<v Speaker 5>Is it Kimono Komodo Dragon,</v>

1452
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:12.440
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1453
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.273
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1454
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.450
<v Speaker 5>Some guy read in the paper,</v>

1455
00:35:14.451 --> 00:35:17.540
<v Speaker 5>this guy was like on a boat or something or he was surfing or something happen.</v>

1456
00:35:17.541 --> 00:35:19.760
<v Speaker 5>I think it was on a boat and the shipwrecked.</v>

1457
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:24.050
<v Speaker 5>So this poor guy swims to the first piece of land he finds,</v>

1458
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:26.990
<v Speaker 5>he swims to the shore and a Komodo dragon confronts him.</v>

1459
00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:27.321
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1460
00:35:27.321 --> 00:35:28.160
<v Speaker 5>this poor guy.</v>

1461
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.151
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine?</v>

1462
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:29.301
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1463
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:30.111
<v Speaker 5>it's like a video game.</v>

1464
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:32.410
<v Speaker 5>It's like you survived the thing and I,</v>

1465
00:35:32.411 --> 00:35:32.811
<v Speaker 5>you still have,</v>

1466
00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:33.080
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1467
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:33.740
<v Speaker 5>oh great,</v>

1468
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 5>now I kill him.</v>

1469
00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:35.301
<v Speaker 5>What's next?</v>

1470
00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:36.100
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1471
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:36.650
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1472
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 5>did he,</v>

1473
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 5>I think he'd live</v>

1474
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.821
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1475
00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1476
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy who was a dating Sharon Stone of Sharon Stone's boyfriend.</v>

1477
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1478
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1479
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 1>He was something like Moot newspaper guy or something like that.</v>

1480
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1481
00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he was in a whole room full of Komodo dragons at like a zoo.</v>

1482
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 1>We had white socks on and the Komodo dragon mistook his white foot for a rabbit,</v>

1483
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 1>so it just snapped down on his foot.</v>

1484
00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 1>That guy's fucking screaming and the poison that they have in their saliva,</v>

1485
00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:07.050
<v Speaker 1>they have botulism and all sorts of horrible bacteria in their saliva,</v>

1486
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 1>and you get deathly ill from those bites,</v>

1487
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:13.550
<v Speaker 1>like you have to go on some radical antibiotics like immediately or you're going</v>

1488
00:36:13.551 --> 00:36:14.384
<v Speaker 1>to die.</v>

1489
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.630
<v Speaker 1>That's how it kills things.</v>

1490
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.720
<v Speaker 1>The Komodo dragons bite things and then just follow them.</v>

1491
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Just infect them with their saliva like they,</v>

1492
00:36:20.661 --> 00:36:25.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a video of one that kills a water buffalo and it bites us water buffalo,</v>

1493
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.590
<v Speaker 1>just Jackson and a leg and the water buffalo runs away and then it slowly</v>

1494
00:36:28.591 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 1>follows it for a day while it poisons itself slowly gets poisoned from that</v>

1495
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:33.210
<v Speaker 1>bite.</v>

1496
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.770
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy lists that the,</v>

1497
00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.620
<v Speaker 1>those guide die or he lived,</v>

1498
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.860
<v Speaker 1>he lived because they were right there and they got the thing off of them.</v>

1499
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:41.910
<v Speaker 1>They got it off his foot,</v>

1500
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.601
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1501
00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:43.680
<v Speaker 1>he almost lost his foot.</v>

1502
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.461
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

1503
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:45.370
<v Speaker 1>That stuff is there.</v>

1504
00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.950
<v Speaker 1>There is so dangerous to fucking,</v>

1505
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.350
<v Speaker 1>they played by a whole different set of rules.</v>

1506
00:36:49.351 --> 00:36:50.184
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1507
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.320
<v Speaker 1>65 million years ago,</v>

1508
00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 1>these motherfuckers were roaming around.</v>

1509
00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:55.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1510
00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1511
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:56.671
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1512
00:36:56.671 --> 00:36:57.241
<v Speaker 1>And animals.</v>

1513
00:36:57.241 --> 00:36:58.320
<v Speaker 1>And generally I was thinking about that.</v>

1514
00:36:58.321 --> 00:36:59.870
<v Speaker 1>That lady has seaworld that got that.</v>

1515
00:36:59.871 --> 00:37:01.220
<v Speaker 1>The whale that just took,</v>

1516
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.741
<v Speaker 1>took her.</v>

1517
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1518
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.580
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

1519
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.480
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine?</v>

1520
00:37:03.481 --> 00:37:03.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1521
00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:04.111
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1522
00:37:04.111 --> 00:37:04.944
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1523
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1524
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.450
<v Speaker 1>it's terrifying.</v>

1525
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1526
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:08.130
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk your way out of it.</v>

1527
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>

1528
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And the really terrifying thing about the killer whale thing is that we know</v>

1529
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:12.810
<v Speaker 1>that they're smart.</v>

1530
00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.070
<v Speaker 1>We know that they're intelligent,</v>

1531
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.390
<v Speaker 1>they're not as smart as us,</v>

1532
00:37:15.391 --> 00:37:16.920
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty God damn close.</v>

1533
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 1>They can't change their environment like us.</v>

1534
00:37:18.421 --> 00:37:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And we show,</v>

1535
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:23.040
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence of them being able to create things and build items like we</v>

1536
00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:23.670
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

1537
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.080
<v Speaker 1>But we know they have dialects.</v>

1538
00:37:25.081 --> 00:37:28.680
<v Speaker 1>We know that there are superintelligent as far as their language and it varies</v>

1539
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:32.190
<v Speaker 1>from sector to sector and we also know that they're like incredibly attached to</v>

1540
00:37:32.191 --> 00:37:36.390
<v Speaker 1>their family and they have like this really broad language that we don't even</v>

1541
00:37:36.391 --> 00:37:37.224
<v Speaker 1>totally understand.</v>

1542
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.850
<v Speaker 1>So we know that there are these super intense intelligent animals and we still</v>

1543
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:43.110
<v Speaker 1>lock 'em up in swimming pools.</v>

1544
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:44.670
<v Speaker 1>You know we just go,</v>

1545
00:37:44.671 --> 00:37:45.331
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1546
00:37:45.331 --> 00:37:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what you're saying.</v>

1547
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.000
<v Speaker 1>What he's saying get in there.</v>

1548
00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Like if that thing was saying,</v>

1549
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.270
<v Speaker 1>please I want to be with my mother,</v>

1550
00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:52.230
<v Speaker 1>please let me go.</v>

1551
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1552
00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.920
<v Speaker 1>if it could actually talk and tell you what they really feel,</v>

1553
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.140
<v Speaker 1>they would be screaming in agony every night they,</v>

1554
00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.420
<v Speaker 1>they stuffed them into these little tiny tanks.</v>

1555
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like a refugee camp or something.</v>

1556
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:02.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1557
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.080
<v Speaker 1>they make them perform.</v>

1558
00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:05.310
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways they make the performance,</v>

1559
00:38:05.311 --> 00:38:08.830
<v Speaker 1>stuffing them into these little tanks at night to punish them and then now the</v>

1560
00:38:08.831 --> 00:38:10.140
<v Speaker 1>learn to jump so you can edit me.</v>

1561
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.981
<v Speaker 1>People will clap for you.</v>

1562
00:38:10.981 --> 00:38:12.030
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want people to clap for you.</v>

1563
00:38:12.031 --> 00:38:12.691
<v Speaker 1>That's the swale.</v>

1564
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:15.150
<v Speaker 1>It killed at least two people to that is crazy.</v>

1565
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.500
<v Speaker 1>He's killed at least two.</v>

1566
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.360
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

1567
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:19.980
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to deal with their bullshit man.</v>

1568
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:21.630
<v Speaker 1>You know he's right.</v>

1569
00:38:21.631 --> 00:38:22.464
<v Speaker 1>I see his point.</v>

1570
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:23.791
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

1571
00:38:23.791 --> 00:38:26.970
<v Speaker 1>If aliens came and they were smarter than us and they just couldn't understand</v>

1572
00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

1573
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.350
<v Speaker 1>and we're talking to them like,</v>

1574
00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:28.711
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

1575
00:38:28.711 --> 00:38:29.570
<v Speaker 1>we'll get our shit together.</v>

1576
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.750
<v Speaker 1>We'll stop polluting the ocean.</v>

1577
00:38:30.751 --> 00:38:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Please don't fucking eat us.</v>

1578
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.320
<v Speaker 1>And then they just started eating people.</v>

1579
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:34.561
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1580
00:38:34.561 --> 00:38:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand you bitch.</v>

1581
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1582
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1583
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.420
<v Speaker 5>she's gonna throw you in the zoo.</v>

1584
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:38.283
<v Speaker 5>The people's zoo.</v>

1585
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:40.780
<v Speaker 5>And this guy's like the revolutionary of Wales.</v>

1586
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:41.021
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1587
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:43.510
<v Speaker 5>the Che Guevara is busting out.</v>

1588
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:44.820
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1589
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.101
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1590
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:45.311
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1591
00:38:45.311 --> 00:38:49.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm on team people 100% but we should have totally rethink seaworld.</v>

1592
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.940
<v Speaker 5>We should totally rethink anything where super intelligent animals like that are</v>

1593
00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.620
<v Speaker 5>entrapped.</v>

1594
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1595
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.113
<v Speaker 5>Feed them fish.</v>

1596
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.931
<v Speaker 5>They're depressed.</v>

1597
00:38:55.931 --> 00:38:56.764
<v Speaker 5>They have to be.</v>

1598
00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.400
<v Speaker 5>There's no way it could be a happy fucking in prison dolphin.</v>

1599
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:00.671
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1600
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty entertaining for your kids.</v>

1601
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1602
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.430
<v Speaker 5>but beyond that,</v>

1603
00:39:03.431 --> 00:39:04.570
<v Speaker 5>like I took my kid to the,</v>

1604
00:39:04.571 --> 00:39:04.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1605
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Speaker 5>to the aquarium at Mandalay Bay and he was two,</v>

1606
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:09.101
<v Speaker 5>two and a half of that.</v>

1607
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:09.934
<v Speaker 5>He was going,</v>

1608
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.990
<v Speaker 5>he would see the shark.</v>

1609
00:39:10.991 --> 00:39:11.990
<v Speaker 5>He was shock.</v>

1610
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:12.700
<v Speaker 5>Shock.</v>

1611
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.980
<v Speaker 5>It would take my head I was holding,</v>

1612
00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 5>he'd take my head and just twist it to wherever the shark was.</v>

1613
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:17.740
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1614
00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:18.160
<v Speaker 5>they should,</v>

1615
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 5>they should hire him out at the front and be like,</v>

1616
00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:21.010
<v Speaker 5>you want a tour from this guy?</v>

1617
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.950
<v Speaker 5>And he's just takes your head shot a commercial.</v>

1618
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:24.401
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1619
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:25.330
<v Speaker 5>That'd be a great commercial.</v>

1620
00:39:25.331 --> 00:39:25.690
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1621
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.890
<v Speaker 5>That would be a great commercial.</v>

1622
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.760
<v Speaker 5>But that's different though.</v>

1623
00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:28.510
<v Speaker 5>That's fish.</v>

1624
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.751
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1625
00:39:28.751 --> 00:39:29.281
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

1626
00:39:29.281 --> 00:39:30.190
<v Speaker 5>I go fuck themselves.</v>

1627
00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:30.340
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1628
00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.173
<v Speaker 5>They're stupid.</v>

1629
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 5>They don't even take care of their,</v>

1630
00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:33.304
<v Speaker 5>they're young.</v>

1631
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.520
<v Speaker 5>They just jerk off on eggs and the eggs become babies.</v>

1632
00:39:36.521 --> 00:39:37.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't care about fish,</v>

1633
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:38.621
<v Speaker 5>but dolphins,</v>

1634
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:39.670
<v Speaker 5>I know that they can think,</v>

1635
00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:40.410
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah.</v>

1636
00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:40.590
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1637
00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.690
<v Speaker 5>you watched the cove you ever see?</v>

1638
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:42.551
<v Speaker 5>Did you see the cove?</v>

1639
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:42.701
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1640
00:39:42.701 --> 00:39:44.050
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see the co terrifying.</v>

1641
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.150
<v Speaker 5>And you see the slaughter of Japanese,</v>

1642
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:47.011
<v Speaker 5>the Japanese slaughter,</v>

1643
00:39:47.011 --> 00:39:48.130
<v Speaker 5>those stall fisherman.</v>

1644
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.570
<v Speaker 5>So hard to watch,</v>

1645
00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:49.900
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1646
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.920
<v Speaker 5>cause you know they're smart.</v>

1647
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.600
<v Speaker 5>Dolphins are smart as fuck.</v>

1648
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:53.590
<v Speaker 5>They're like little weird,</v>

1649
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 5>intelligent aliens.</v>

1650
00:39:54.671 --> 00:39:56.470
<v Speaker 5>Almost like little water elves.</v>

1651
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.180
<v Speaker 5>Like they're playful little water ELLs.</v>

1652
00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.880
<v Speaker 5>They're super smart and they seem benign.</v>

1653
00:40:00.881 --> 00:40:01.061
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1654
00:40:01.061 --> 00:40:01.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1655
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they have both sides,</v>

1656
00:40:02.891 --> 00:40:04.510
<v Speaker 5>but they seem very Dell rape view.</v>

1657
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.231
<v Speaker 5>They'll rape you,</v>

1658
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:05.740
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1659
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.060
<v Speaker 5>they'll throw a rape it on your ass.</v>

1660
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:08.770
<v Speaker 5>I'll try it out one.</v>

1661
00:40:08.771 --> 00:40:09.610
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine that?</v>

1662
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.140
<v Speaker 5>How do you come back and report a video online of a woman getting humped on a</v>

1663
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:14.974
<v Speaker 5>dock?</v>

1664
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.640
<v Speaker 5>But Dolphins,</v>

1665
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.430
<v Speaker 5>gadget guy.</v>

1666
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:17.151
<v Speaker 5>He's a guy.</v>

1667
00:40:17.151 --> 00:40:18.130
<v Speaker 5>It's a gay dolphin.</v>

1668
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:19.680
<v Speaker 5>Gay Rapist.</v>

1669
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.513
<v Speaker 5>Dolphin.</v>

1670
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:21.783
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>

1671
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:22.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1672
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:23.591
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man.</v>

1673
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:26.740
<v Speaker 5>I think eventually we're going to have to come to conclusion that zoos are</v>

1674
00:40:26.741 --> 00:40:29.470
<v Speaker 5>really cruel and inhumane punishment.</v>

1675
00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.270
<v Speaker 5>And there those are animal prisons.</v>

1676
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:31.481
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1677
00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:31.931
<v Speaker 5>you've been to,</v>

1678
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:34.200
<v Speaker 5>you've been to the La Zoo man zone.</v>

1679
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.200
<v Speaker 5>It's just miserable.</v>

1680
00:40:35.201 --> 00:40:35.740
<v Speaker 5>Horrible.</v>

1681
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.630
<v Speaker 5>It's the worst even open.</v>

1682
00:40:37.631 --> 00:40:38.640
<v Speaker 5>So it's walkable,</v>

1683
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.540
<v Speaker 5>old ghosts parts.</v>

1684
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:41.291
<v Speaker 5>Hey Bravo.</v>

1685
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:43.810
<v Speaker 5>Fucked up and went to the zoo on mushrooms.</v>

1686
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:44.763
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1687
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:45.400
<v Speaker 5>awful.</v>

1688
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.780
<v Speaker 5>He said it was so sad.</v>

1689
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.940
<v Speaker 5>He said it was like the saddest day ever.</v>

1690
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:49.691
<v Speaker 5>I said all you could do,</v>

1691
00:40:49.691 --> 00:40:51.310
<v Speaker 5>you feel all the negative,</v>

1692
00:40:51.311 --> 00:40:53.100
<v Speaker 5>sad energy from these poor animals.</v>

1693
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.050
<v Speaker 5>People staring at them and the animals are usually,</v>

1694
00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:56.831
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1695
00:40:56.831 --> 00:40:59.830
<v Speaker 5>they seem like every little display went to like the animal was just looking for</v>

1696
00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:00.370
<v Speaker 5>shade.</v>

1697
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:00.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1698
00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.380
<v Speaker 5>He didn't want to entertain you.</v>

1699
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 5>He just in the corner somewhere looking for shade and then they had like an</v>

1700
00:41:05.441 --> 00:41:06.660
<v Speaker 5>elephant thing and it was,</v>

1701
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.280
<v Speaker 5>and it was in the back and they had like,</v>

1702
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.133
<v Speaker 5>it didn't even make it.</v>

1703
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:09.911
<v Speaker 5>The guy was like,</v>

1704
00:41:09.911 --> 00:41:10.690
<v Speaker 5>it's a long,</v>

1705
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:11.523
<v Speaker 5>long walk.</v>

1706
00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.090
<v Speaker 5>So poorly thought out too,</v>

1707
00:41:13.091 --> 00:41:13.924
<v Speaker 5>because look,</v>

1708
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.980
<v Speaker 5>human beings have a bunch of systems that are put in place to ensure that we</v>

1709
00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 5>breed to ensure that we succeed in life,</v>

1710
00:41:20.141 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Speaker 5>to ensure that we accomplish things.</v>

1711
00:41:22.031 --> 00:41:24.220
<v Speaker 5>There's all these things that are set up in order for us to live.</v>

1712
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:24.701
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1713
00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:25.600
<v Speaker 5>the human way.</v>

1714
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:25.871
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1715
00:41:25.871 --> 00:41:26.790
<v Speaker 5>for animals there,</v>

1716
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:29.290
<v Speaker 5>there's all these instincts set up in their minds too.</v>

1717
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.180
<v Speaker 5>One of the big ones is to kill things,</v>

1718
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.141
<v Speaker 5>to kill things,</v>

1719
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:32.980
<v Speaker 5>to survive.</v>

1720
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:33.381
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1721
00:41:33.381 --> 00:41:33.621
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1722
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 5>they get</v>

1723
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.300
<v Speaker 1>that charge that,</v>

1724
00:41:35.301 --> 00:41:35.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1725
00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's fun for them.</v>

1726
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.990
<v Speaker 1>That is what is the joy of life.</v>

1727
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems cruel and fucked up,</v>

1728
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:44.450
<v Speaker 1>but the joy of life or aligns to take out a gazelle and that's what it is.</v>

1729
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:45.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what it therefore,</v>

1730
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:49.970
<v Speaker 1>so if you're going to have real animals and you're going to have them in these</v>

1731
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.720
<v Speaker 1>locked down environments and pretend that it's good for them and pretend that</v>

1732
00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:54.554
<v Speaker 1>it's a good environment,</v>

1733
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.670
<v Speaker 1>you got to let them kill things,</v>

1734
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:56.290
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1735
00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:57.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1736
00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:57.871
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1737
00:41:57.871 --> 00:41:58.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1738
00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:01.260
<v Speaker 3>I went to Kenya once and they have like the animal preserve,</v>

1739
00:42:01.261 --> 00:42:03.630
<v Speaker 3>so you just go in and they say you actually kind of,</v>

1740
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.660
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like you're going into their turf now to check it out.</v>

1741
00:42:06.661 --> 00:42:07.111
<v Speaker 3>So it's not,</v>

1742
00:42:07.111 --> 00:42:07.944
<v Speaker 3>they're not caged,</v>

1743
00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually really interesting.</v>

1744
00:42:09.271 --> 00:42:10.170
<v Speaker 3>So you go somewhere in there.</v>

1745
00:42:10.171 --> 00:42:11.790
<v Speaker 3>They are just doing their natural thing.</v>

1746
00:42:11.791 --> 00:42:13.020
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot more natural,</v>

1747
00:42:13.021 --> 00:42:13.710
<v Speaker 3>it seemed.</v>

1748
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:16.980
<v Speaker 3>The one thing was we were driving back and we saw a rhino and we were in this</v>

1749
00:42:16.981 --> 00:42:17.491
<v Speaker 3>little like,</v>

1750
00:42:17.491 --> 00:42:19.480
<v Speaker 3>they give us this like minivan and I don't mean to,</v>

1751
00:42:19.481 --> 00:42:19.621
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1752
00:42:19.621 --> 00:42:19.801
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1753
00:42:19.801 --> 00:42:20.230
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

1754
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:21.063
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

1755
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.430
<v Speaker 3>it was this little van and we had like this driver,</v>

1756
00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.990
<v Speaker 3>this Kenyan driver,</v>

1757
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.970
<v Speaker 3>and he wasn't at all like,</v>

1758
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:27.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1759
00:42:27.691 --> 00:42:28.830
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't armed.</v>

1760
00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.300
<v Speaker 3>He didn't seem like he was,</v>

1761
00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.620
<v Speaker 3>he was there to protect us.</v>

1762
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.071
<v Speaker 3>He looked like,</v>

1763
00:42:32.071 --> 00:42:32.650
<v Speaker 3>remember the guy,</v>

1764
00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:33.660
<v Speaker 3>the gods must be crazy.</v>

1765
00:42:33.661 --> 00:42:34.494
<v Speaker 3>I remember like the skinny,</v>

1766
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.860
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like that's the guy that was driving and there was like no defense</v>

1767
00:42:37.861 --> 00:42:38.694
<v Speaker 3>mechanism.</v>

1768
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1769
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.780
<v Speaker 3>so this guy stops and where there's like eight or nine of us,</v>

1770
00:42:42.781 --> 00:42:42.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1771
00:42:42.931 --> 00:42:46.470
<v Speaker 3>all Westerners and this rhino is like eating and we're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Rhino Rhino.</v>

1774
00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:51.540
<v Speaker 3>And he looks up and he gives us this like look of death.</v>

1775
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.630
<v Speaker 3>Like it's almost like you just interrupt this shook night in the middle of some</v>

1776
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.750
<v Speaker 3>business meeting and,</v>

<v Speaker 3>we all freaked out.</v>

1779
00:42:58.351 --> 00:42:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Like it was an intimidating look.</v>

1780
00:42:59.461 --> 00:42:59.761
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

1781
00:42:59.761 --> 00:43:00.061
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1782
00:43:00.061 --> 00:43:00.331

00:43:01.851 --> 00:43:02.151
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1787
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:03.060
<v Speaker 3>like Fred Flintstone.</v>

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.580
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1791
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.200
<v Speaker 3>And our Fresno telling us what these guys do,</v>

1792
00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:09.060
<v Speaker 3>I guess are colorblind the rhinos and they,</v>

1793
00:43:09.061 --> 00:43:10.410
<v Speaker 3>and they just see something.</v>

1794
00:43:10.411 --> 00:43:10.960
<v Speaker 3>And if it,</v>

1795
00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.210
<v Speaker 3>if it's disturbing them,</v>

1796
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:12.961
<v Speaker 3>they just run,</v>

1797
00:43:12.961 --> 00:43:13.591
<v Speaker 3>they would ramp,</v>

1798
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:13.921
<v Speaker 3>they would've,</v>

1799
00:43:13.921 --> 00:43:16.680
<v Speaker 3>he would've rammed us and they'll tip you over.</v>

1800
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.701
<v Speaker 3>And now it's,</v>

1801
00:43:17.701 --> 00:43:18.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1802
00:43:18.031 --> 00:43:18.571
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1803
00:43:18.571 --> 00:43:19.440
<v Speaker 3>however it plays out,</v>

1804
00:43:19.441 --> 00:43:20.040
<v Speaker 3>it plays out.</v>

1805
00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:20.873
<v Speaker 3>Either we all,</v>

1806
00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1807
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.300
<v Speaker 1>you all get stomped to death.</v>

1808
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Some shit.</v>

1809
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.780
<v Speaker 1>So pretty crazy dude.</v>

1810
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Dead Rhinos in hippos are two of my number one fears as far as animals go.</v>

1811
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.691
<v Speaker 1>Hungry,</v>

1812
00:43:32.691 --> 00:43:33.500
<v Speaker 1>hippos,</v>

1813
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:33.861
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

1814
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:34.191
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

1815
00:43:34.191 --> 00:43:34.431
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

1816
00:43:34.431 --> 00:43:34.701
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

1817
00:43:34.701 --> 00:43:35.450
<v Speaker 1>hippos,</v>

1818
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:35.841
<v Speaker 1>hippos.</v>

1819
00:43:35.841 --> 00:43:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I think you're responsible for more human deaths in any other animal in Africa</v>

1820
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:40.820
<v Speaker 1>other than ants.</v>

1821
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Really believe aunts are responsible for more human death in any item on answer</v>

1822
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:45.740
<v Speaker 1>kill people.</v>

1823
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit,</v>

1824
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:46.780
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1825
00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in Africa,</v>

1826
00:43:47.931 --> 00:43:49.390
<v Speaker 1>they've got real problems with uh,</v>

1827
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.580
<v Speaker 1>with giant swarms of poisonous ants.</v>

1828
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:53.443
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

1829
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Army ants and all these different,</v>

1830
00:43:55.401 --> 00:43:55.671
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1831
00:43:55.671 --> 00:43:55.881
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1832
00:43:55.881 --> 00:43:57.830
<v Speaker 1>there's so many really vicious aunts.</v>

1833
00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Especially like in the Amazon,</v>

1834
00:43:59.781 --> 00:44:02.510
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing called the bullet ants.</v>

1835
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:03.051
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1836
00:44:03.051 --> 00:44:03.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1837
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:03.660
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1838
00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:07.850
<v Speaker 1>they actually use them for coming of age ceremonies where they make these young</v>

1839
00:44:07.851 --> 00:44:11.480
<v Speaker 1>men stick their hand in these gloves that are filled with these bullet ants.</v>

1840
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1841
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.883
<v Speaker 1>And he's bullet ants.</v>

1842
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.660
<v Speaker 1>It's unbearable pain for like 24 hours for each bite.</v>

1843
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1844
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:18.290
<v Speaker 1>like unbearable.</v>

1845
00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Like getting your hands slammed in a car door all day long.</v>

1846
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.153
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

1847
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Like insane pain and that's like the coming of age thing.</v>

1848
00:44:24.711 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

1849
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.060
<v Speaker 1>if a man can get through this,</v>

1850
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:28.640
<v Speaker 1>he can truly be a match to get benefit vendor.</v>

1851
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:29.720
<v Speaker 1>But in Africa,</v>

1852
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Brian Callan actually,</v>

1853
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:31.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1854
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 1>was uh,</v>

1855
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.580
<v Speaker 1>working when,</v>

1856
00:44:33.581 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 1>when he first got out of college he wanted to work with insects and he wanted to</v>

1857
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:38.820
<v Speaker 1>study them and overseas.</v>

1858
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that scared him off his,</v>

1859
00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:40.981
<v Speaker 1>cause he went,</v>

1860
00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I think to Bornea he went to some crazy fucking jungle and they had to put</v>

1861
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:45.631
<v Speaker 1>Turpentine,</v>

1862
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:49.330
<v Speaker 1>they all slept on platforms and they had to put Turpentine all over the,</v>

1863
00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.900
<v Speaker 1>the legs of the platform.</v>

1864
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:56.170
<v Speaker 1>And they have to be elevated above the floor of the jungle because if you're</v>

1865
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:56.700
<v Speaker 1>leave,</v>

1866
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.490
<v Speaker 1>if you leave them on the floor of the jungle and the ants come up,</v>

1867
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.670
<v Speaker 1>once one ant bites you and sends a signal,</v>

1868
00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

1942
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:55.761
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1943
00:46:55.761 --> 00:46:56.990
<v Speaker 1>that's where it all began.</v>

1944
00:46:56.991 --> 00:46:59.120
<v Speaker 1>That's where human beings were hatched.</v>

00:47:00.741 --> 00:47:02.570
<v Speaker 1>That now still so fucking wild.</v>

1948
00:47:02.571 --> 00:47:03.081
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>

1949
00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:03.351
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1950
00:47:03.351 --> 00:47:04.280
<v Speaker 1>When you look at Africa,</v>

1951
00:47:04.281 --> 00:47:04.941
<v Speaker 1>the continent,</v>

1952
00:47:04.941 --> 00:47:07.910
<v Speaker 1>like you ever watch like those documentaries on African and compare it to any</v>

1953
00:47:07.911 --> 00:47:09.350
<v Speaker 1>other constant continent in the world.</v>

1954
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.741
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got willed the BC lions and crocodiles,</v>

1957
00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 1>saltwater crocodiles and fucking great white sharks off the coast of South</v>

1958
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Africa and it's Jesus Christ.</v>

1959
00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:24.050
<v Speaker 1>No continent is crazier than Africa.</v>

1960
00:47:24.051 --> 00:47:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess Australia is probably a close and don't even get started on the flies</v>

1961
00:47:28.071 --> 00:47:29.060
<v Speaker 1>and how annoying that would be.</v>

1962
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes just sitting on your face all the time.</v>

1963
00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:32.653
<v Speaker 1>I was in Africa.</v>

1964
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:33.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1965
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you see those poor starving kids,</v>

1966
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:36.490
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the saddest things about those videos.</v>

1967
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.460
<v Speaker 1>The eyes they have covered with flies and shit.</v>

1968
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>

1969
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.250
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking crazy place on earth.</v>

1970
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I am obsessed with the Congo man.</v>

1971
00:47:44.231 --> 00:47:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I've got a bunch of documentaries on the Congo.</v>

1972
00:47:46.721 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 1>One of the best ones is from the BBC.</v>

1973
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.360
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1974
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.420
<v Speaker 1>one of the most fascinating things about the Congo is there's so many areas of</v>

1975
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:54.150
<v Speaker 1>it they'd like people barely get to.</v>

1976
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1977
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.533
<v Speaker 1>There's like this,</v>

1978
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:58.000
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable how fucking dense it is.</v>

1979
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.571
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

1980
00:47:58.571 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 1>in one point in time,</v>

1981
00:47:59.531 --> 00:48:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Europeans tried to settle it.</v>

1982
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.130
<v Speaker 1>They tried to like build these giant mansions and shit.</v>

1983
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:04.270
<v Speaker 1>And some of them are still there,</v>

1984
00:48:04.271 --> 00:48:05.170
<v Speaker 1>like in frame,</v>

1985
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.480
<v Speaker 1>but that just gets swallowed up by the jungle.</v>

1986
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 1>It's just too wild.</v>

1987
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.171
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>

1988
00:48:09.171 --> 00:48:09.531
<v Speaker 3>As you got,</v>

1989
00:48:09.531 --> 00:48:09.940
<v Speaker 3>you got,</v>

1990
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.710
<v Speaker 3>you get nature and then you've got like rebels fighting each.</v>

1991
00:48:12.711 --> 00:48:12.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1992
00:48:12.981 --> 00:48:14.670
<v Speaker 3>so you might survive the ants.</v>

1993
00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to be taken down by the whatever the cognitive is,</v>

1994
00:48:17.781 --> 00:48:18.051

1998
00:48:19.251 --> 00:48:21.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of problems because they're fighting over resources.</v>

1999
00:48:21.651 --> 00:48:24.350
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of minerals in the Congo is a lot of minerals that they used to</v>

2000
00:48:24.351 --> 00:48:25.790
<v Speaker 1>make cell phones and shit like that.</v>

00:48:35.601 --> 00:48:36.434
<v Speaker 3>Sure it is.</v>

2013
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:38.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of traveling,</v>

2014
00:48:38.051 --> 00:48:38.351
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2015
00:48:38.351 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy going to the UK like once a year,</v>

2016
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:41.141
<v Speaker 1>but even that,</v>

2017
00:48:41.141 --> 00:48:41.891
<v Speaker 1>it's like enough.</v>

2018
00:48:41.891 --> 00:48:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I go to Australia once.</v>

2019
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:43.624
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2020
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.311
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2021
00:48:44.311 --> 00:48:45.620
<v Speaker 3>I hear you too much sick.</v>

2022
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.591
<v Speaker 3>I'm sick of the trap.</v>

2023
00:48:46.591 --> 00:48:46.801
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2024
00:48:46.801 --> 00:48:47.521
<v Speaker 3>I'd be curious to see it,</v>

2025
00:48:47.521 --> 00:48:48.060
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

2026
00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:51.630
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because people ask like the fun part of stand up is actually being on</v>

2027
00:48:51.631 --> 00:48:55.500
<v Speaker 3>stage and doing a show and I'd rather just drive up the block,</v>

<v Speaker 1>by two because we can work so many places around here.</v>

2033
00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:04.880
<v Speaker 1>You can go to a comedy magic club in Hermosa Beach.</v>

00:49:49.691 --> 00:49:51.400
<v Speaker 3>well maybe I'll just take everybody with me.</v>

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:59.150
<v Speaker 3>I would be like losing a lot of money.</v>

2075
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Just like screw it,</v>

2076
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.593
<v Speaker 3>we're going to stay here.</v>

2077
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Chevy Chase.</v>

2078
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:03.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2079
00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.590
<v Speaker 1>you must have a big international following now because you,</v>

2080
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:11.690
<v Speaker 1>you've really become like as far as like would you call it the Persian community</v>

2081
00:50:11.691 --> 00:50:12.130
<v Speaker 1>or the area</v>

2082
00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:12.963
<v Speaker 3>learning community.</v>

2083
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:16.860
<v Speaker 3>But you know the Persian committee is like my first probably it's funny like a</v>

2084
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.330
<v Speaker 3>like triple e one time Santa Trivia.</v>

2085
00:50:18.331 --> 00:50:18.721
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2086
00:50:18.721 --> 00:50:19.081
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2087
00:50:19.081 --> 00:50:20.160
<v Speaker 3>you're like the Persian Elvis,</v>

2088
00:50:20.161 --> 00:50:21.390
<v Speaker 3>otherwise known as pelvis.</v>

2089
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:23.940
<v Speaker 3>So that sounds like a triple e line.</v>

2090
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:24.211
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2091
00:50:24.211 --> 00:50:25.020
<v Speaker 3>So so I,</v>

2092
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:25.730
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>

2093
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:26.520
<v Speaker 3>that's like my,</v>

2094
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.300
<v Speaker 3>like you got,</v>

2095
00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.760
<v Speaker 3>you got the Persian middle easterners,</v>

2096
00:50:28.761 --> 00:50:30.110
<v Speaker 3>then you got like Arabs,</v>

2097
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:30.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2098
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:31.251
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

2099
00:50:31.251 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 3>and then after that like then like you've got like NPR types that are into like</v>

2100
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:36.223
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2101
00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:39.210
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

2102
00:50:39.211 --> 00:50:39.361
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2103

<v Speaker 3>I love the fact that you're different.</v>

2105
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.290
<v Speaker 3>It's actually pretty funny though.</v>

2106
00:50:43.291 --> 00:50:43.730
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2107
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:47.160
<v Speaker 3>well it's actually good to like do stand up in front of people that know the</v>

2108
00:50:47.161 --> 00:50:48.600
<v Speaker 3>difference between Iran and Iraq.</v>

2109
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:49.463
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2110
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.450
<v Speaker 3>As opposed to like doing it in front of someone who is like,</v>

2111
00:50:51.451 --> 00:50:51.990
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2112
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.291
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2113
00:50:52.291 --> 00:50:53.124
<v Speaker 3>it's all the same.</v>

2114
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:54.900
<v Speaker 3>She is blow it up,</v>

2115

<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2116
00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:57.331
<v Speaker 3>So no,</v>

2117
00:50:57.331 --> 00:50:57.541
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2118
00:50:57.541 --> 00:50:57.931
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>

2119
00:50:57.931 --> 00:50:58.201
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2120
00:50:58.201 --> 00:50:59.190
<v Speaker 3>so it has become a thing.</v>

2121
00:50:59.191 --> 00:51:00.660
<v Speaker 3>What happened was in oh seven,</v>

2122
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:01.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2123
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.700
<v Speaker 3>when we were still doing the acts of evil,</v>

2124
00:51:02.701 --> 00:51:02.911
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2125
00:51:02.911 --> 00:51:03.601
<v Speaker 3>I'm at an Aaron,</v>

2126
00:51:03.601 --> 00:51:04.530
<v Speaker 3>we went out to,</v>

2127
00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:05.730
<v Speaker 3>and this is a tour that you guys,</v>

2128
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.420
<v Speaker 3>we have to oppose us of evil comedies.</v>

2129
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:08.670
<v Speaker 3>I see evil comedy tour.</v>

2130
00:51:08.671 --> 00:51:09.001
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2131
00:51:09.001 --> 00:51:11.970
<v Speaker 3>it actually originally started with Mitzi shore who put us together and call it</v>

2132
00:51:11.971 --> 00:51:12.900
<v Speaker 3>the Arabian nights.</v>

2133
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:15.390
<v Speaker 3>This was in 2000.</v>

2134
00:51:15.391 --> 00:51:18.240
<v Speaker 3>She put us to the Arabian nights and Iranians aren't Arabs.</v>

2135
00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:21.630
<v Speaker 3>So we'd do shows and like inevitably like Iranians would come up afterwards and</v>

2136
00:51:21.631 --> 00:51:21.901
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>

2137
00:51:21.901 --> 00:51:22.561
<v Speaker 3>it was a good show,</v>

2138
00:51:22.561 --> 00:51:22.950
<v Speaker 3>but a,</v>

2139
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:23.760
<v Speaker 3>we're not Arabs.</v>

2140
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.181
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2141
00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:24.870
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2142
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:25.180
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

2143
00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Ronnie's a very sensitive about that.</v>

2144
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:28.950
<v Speaker 3>I actually read a national geographic article,</v>

2145
00:51:28.951 --> 00:51:29.190
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2146
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.490
<v Speaker 3>this journalist went any Ron.</v>

2147
00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I said I was interviewing people and he goes,</v>

2148
00:51:32.431 --> 00:51:33.270
<v Speaker 3>I asked people,</v>

2149
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:34.920
<v Speaker 3>what do you want the world to know about you?</v>

2150
00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:35.521
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2151
00:51:35.521 --> 00:51:37.950
<v Speaker 3>the first thing they would always say is we're not Arabs.</v>

2152
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:38.970
<v Speaker 3>The second thing,</v>

2153
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:40.110
<v Speaker 3>we're not terrorists.</v>

2154
00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.600
<v Speaker 3>So it's like it's better to be a terrorist in an Arab in their mind.</v>

2177
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:17.610

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2183
00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Toronto is an international city.</v>

2184
00:52:25.961 --> 00:52:26.290
<v Speaker 3>Of it.</v>

2185
00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:26.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2186
00:52:26.471 --> 00:52:31.360
<v Speaker 3>I ran is much more sophisticated and much more ahead than we've been led on.</v>

2187
00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:31.811
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2188
00:52:31.811 --> 00:52:36.270
<v Speaker 3>we've lumped them in with like Pakistan and Afghanistan and even those,</v>

2189
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean like Afghanistan,</v>

2190
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:37.981
<v Speaker 3>it's probably the,</v>

2191
00:52:37.981 --> 00:52:39.810
<v Speaker 3>the one that's like the least developed,</v>

2192
00:52:39.811 --> 00:52:40.320
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2193
00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.430
<v Speaker 3>But even those countries,</v>

2194
00:52:41.431 --> 00:52:44.930
<v Speaker 3>like if they have a lot of western influences and also a lot of,</v>

2195
00:52:44.931 --> 00:52:45.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2196
00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:47.580
<v Speaker 3>especially with technology and stuff now there's a lot of people that are</v>

2197
00:52:47.581 --> 00:52:48.401
<v Speaker 3>advanced in this country,</v>

2198
00:52:48.401 --> 00:52:49.920
<v Speaker 3>especially if you going to a major city,</v>

2199
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:50.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2200
00:52:50.611 --> 00:52:52.860
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see it's the hustle and bustle.</v>

2201
00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.030
<v Speaker 3>You're going to see some dude driving.</v>

2202
00:52:54.031 --> 00:52:56.820
<v Speaker 3>A Mercedes Benz is a multimillionaire and you can see some dude like pushing a</v>

2203
00:52:56.821 --> 00:52:58.800
<v Speaker 3>cart who's making five bucks a year or something.</v>

2204
00:52:58.801 --> 00:52:59.634
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

<v Speaker 3>this exists,</v>

2207
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.441
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

2208
00:53:01.441 --> 00:53:05.550
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people's image of the Middle East is just dudes and turbans and</v>

2209
00:53:05.551 --> 00:53:06.660
<v Speaker 3>women in Burkas.</v>

2220
00:53:17.401 --> 00:53:18.700
<v Speaker 3>themselves and they could just barely see.</v>

2443
00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:47.140
<v Speaker 3>It was really nice,</v>

2444
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:48.910
<v Speaker 3>but like nobody was staying there.</v>

2445
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.470
<v Speaker 3>So he takes us there anyway,</v>

2446
00:57:50.471 --> 00:57:52.390
<v Speaker 3>so he becomes our guide unintentionally.</v>

2447
00:57:52.391 --> 00:57:53.224
<v Speaker 3>He's now our guide,</v>

2448
00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.170
<v Speaker 3>told them those or avoid,</v>

2449
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:55.721
<v Speaker 3>I've told my wife,</v>

2450
00:57:55.721 --> 00:57:55.931
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2451
00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

2452
00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:57.221
<v Speaker 3>Now we've got a guide,</v>

2453
00:57:57.221 --> 00:57:58.031
<v Speaker 3>like how do we tell him no?</v>

2454
00:57:58.031 --> 00:57:58.540
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2455
00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:59.590
<v Speaker 3>don't worry you don't.</v>

2456
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.410
<v Speaker 3>I show you around if you like,</v>

2457
00:58:02.411 --> 00:58:05.520
<v Speaker 3>then maybe you can give some leading me like bring up the money thing and he</v>

2458
00:58:05.521 --> 00:58:05.890
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

2459
00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:06.430
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2460
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:07.061
<v Speaker 3>let me take you here.</v>

2461
00:58:07.061 --> 00:58:07.630
<v Speaker 3>Then he said,</v>

2462
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:10.110
<v Speaker 3>let me take you kick that motherfucker right out of there.</v>

2463
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.620
<v Speaker 3>It's one of these situations though where you're like,</v>

2464
00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:11.801

2466
00:58:12.881 --> 00:58:13.271
<v Speaker 3>He kind of,</v>

2467
00:58:13.271 --> 00:58:15.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean you feel intimidated because you like,</v>

2468
00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:16.960
<v Speaker 3>they know each other somehow.</v>

2469
00:58:16.961 --> 00:58:17.081
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2470
00:58:17.081 --> 00:58:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to let you just,</v>

2473
00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:20.980
<v Speaker 3>but just be ready to run at any minute.</v>

2474
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.530
<v Speaker 3>So we ended up in some,</v>

2475
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:24.101
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2476
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:25.150
<v Speaker 3>let me take you for dinner.</v>

2477
00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:26.110
<v Speaker 3>We go to this restaurant.</v>

2478
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:26.651
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>

2479
00:58:26.651 --> 00:58:28.330
<v Speaker 3>There was like balloons and banners.</v>

2480
00:58:28.331 --> 00:58:29.320
<v Speaker 3>All this shit was up,</v>

2481
00:58:29.321 --> 00:58:30.154
<v Speaker 3>but there was no one.</v>

2482
00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:34.060
<v Speaker 3>We were the only two eating in the restaurant and the waiter comes to the waiter</v>

2483
00:58:34.061 --> 00:58:35.380
<v Speaker 3>was so excited to see us.</v>

2484
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:35.771
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2485
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:36.041
<v Speaker 3>hello,</v>

2486
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:36.550
<v Speaker 3>hello.</v>

2487
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:40.450
<v Speaker 3>And it's like the waiter was the waiter slash the cook slash the owner.</v>

2488
00:58:40.451 --> 00:58:43.170
<v Speaker 3>Like he would like go cook in the back and they come sit and watch us eat.</v>

2489
00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:44.350
<v Speaker 3>It was the craziest shit.</v>

2490
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2491
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.270
<v Speaker 3>But the OBI wan Kenobi Shit,</v>

2492
00:58:46.271 --> 00:58:48.880
<v Speaker 3>those crazy is these guides.</v>

2493
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:52.820
<v Speaker 3>They actually were the Obi wan Kenobi like the,</v>

2494
00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:54.400
<v Speaker 3>the gown with the hat,</v>

2495
00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:55.840
<v Speaker 3>like during the day they wear it.</v>

2496
00:58:55.841 --> 00:58:57.940
<v Speaker 3>And that's the official like fairs,</v>

2497
00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:00.130
<v Speaker 3>like guide outfit like that.</v>

2498
00:59:00.131 --> 00:59:01.600
<v Speaker 3>Like that's an official guide.</v>

2499
00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Like the government I think recognizes them as guides.</v>

2500
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:06.940
<v Speaker 3>And the weird one when I realized it was Obi wan Kenobi and I,</v>

2501
00:59:06.941 --> 00:59:07.361
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

2502
00:59:07.361 --> 00:59:07.661
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2503
00:59:07.661 --> 00:59:11.350
<v Speaker 3>George Lucas must've come to fairs and come up with this because my wife and I,</v>

2504
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:12.700

2506
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:15.580

2507
00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:16.150

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:18.130
<v Speaker 3>So he takes us to like the castle.</v>

2509
00:59:18.131 --> 00:59:18.461
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2510
00:59:18.461 --> 00:59:18.941
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2511
00:59:18.941 --> 00:59:20.170

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.050
<v Speaker 3>I see you at other sides.</v>

2515
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.500
<v Speaker 3>I guess they don't let the guides come.</v>

2516
00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:25.221
<v Speaker 3>So should we go?</v>

2517
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:26.150
<v Speaker 3>We take a picture too.</v>

2518
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.400
<v Speaker 3>And then we're like how's it going?</v>

2519
00:59:27.401 --> 00:59:28.041
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find us.</v>

2520
00:59:28.041 --> 00:59:30.470

2526
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.970
<v Speaker 3>So he kind of kept an eye on us and you know how like in Star Wars,</v>

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.010
<v Speaker 3>I was like George Lucas must've come here and gotten a guide and then it came up</v>

2532
00:59:52.011 --> 00:59:53.330
<v Speaker 3>with the fucking Obi wan Kenobi.</v>

2533
00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:53.811
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2534
00:59:53.811 --> 00:59:54.770
<v Speaker 3>That's so weird.</v>

2535
00:59:54.771 --> 00:59:57.110
<v Speaker 3>So how long has this guide outfit existed?</v>

2536
00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:57.401
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2537
00:59:57.401 --> 00:59:58.340
<v Speaker 3>the guide outfit was,</v>

2538
00:59:58.341 --> 01:00:01.250
<v Speaker 3>is like day day outfit and then by night he would show up.</v>

2539
01:00:01.251 --> 01:00:02.390
<v Speaker 3>Kind of dress regularly.</v>

2540
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:03.280
<v Speaker 3>But whoa,</v>

2541
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:04.130
<v Speaker 3>that's so strange.</v>

2542
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.180
<v Speaker 3>How long did he,</v>

2543
01:00:05.181 --> 01:00:06.920
<v Speaker 3>you ask how many years they'd been doing this?</v>

2544
01:00:06.921 --> 01:00:07.280
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2545
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.480
<v Speaker 3>we ain't turn tradition.</v>

2546
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.731
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2547
01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:09.570
<v Speaker 3>I didn't ask him about that.</v>

2548
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:10.580
<v Speaker 3>I didn't ask him about the outfit.</v>

2549
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:10.910
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2550
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 3>I just realized there was a bunch of guys with the outfit around like it was,</v>

2551
01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:16.760
<v Speaker 3>it was basically you'd have like your clothes underneath and you just throw the</v>

2552
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:17.900
<v Speaker 3>robot and it's almost like,</v>

2553
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:18.411
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2554
01:00:18.411 --> 01:00:18.951
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like,</v>

2555
01:00:18.951 --> 01:00:19.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2556
01:00:19.131 --> 01:00:19.910
<v Speaker 3>like a judge.</v>

2557
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Like they just put it over.</v>

2558
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever have a pet monkey that robbed you?</v>

2559
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:24.480
<v Speaker 3>There was a pet monkey to rock.</v>

2560
01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:25.943
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

2561
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:29.330
<v Speaker 3>it's funny you say that because they actually,</v>

2562
01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:29.700
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2563
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.550
<v Speaker 3>they do have pet monkeys out there that like,</v>

2564
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:32.713
<v Speaker 3>like um,</v>

2565
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:33.220
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

2566
01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.100
<v Speaker 3>do tricks and stuff.</v>

2567
01:00:34.101 --> 01:00:37.400
<v Speaker 3>But what he did was he took us to a rug store that he's like,</v>

2568
01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:38.690
<v Speaker 3>you want to see rugs?</v>

2569
01:00:38.691 --> 01:00:39.231
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2570
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:41.150
<v Speaker 3>and at the time I was living in with my mom,</v>

2571
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.800
<v Speaker 3>like I was dating my girlfriend,</v>

2572
01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:45.530
<v Speaker 3>but I was living with my mom and I didn't have an apartment,</v>

2573
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:46.940
<v Speaker 3>so I had nowhere to put rugs.</v>

2574
01:00:46.941 --> 01:00:47.181
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2575
01:00:47.181 --> 01:00:47.331
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2576
01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:48.164
<v Speaker 3>I don't need a rug.</v>

2577
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:48.650
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2578
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.780
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2579

2582
01:00:50.511 --> 01:00:51.231
<v Speaker 3>And so finally,</v>

2583
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:52.220
<v Speaker 3>like we go into this place,</v>

01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:46.350
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange that it's connected.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2807
01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:49.470
<v Speaker 1>don't seem to recognize that threat.</v>

2808
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.080
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's connected the oxen,</v>

2809
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.250
<v Speaker 1>they actually said that this Mckean just came out.</v>

2810
01:04:53.251 --> 01:04:53.461
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

2811
01:04:53.461 --> 01:04:54.390
<v Speaker 1>not that this means anything,</v>

2812
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>but McCain just came out and said that giant forest fire they have going on</v>

2813
01:04:57.631 --> 01:04:59.100

2815
01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:00.270
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2816
01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Huge out of control wildfire.</v>

2817
01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:05.670
<v Speaker 1>And they think it was started by illegal immigrants setting up camp.</v>

2818
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2820
01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:07.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys,</v>

2821
01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:09.740
<v Speaker 1>they crossed the border in Arizona said,</v>

2822
01:05:09.741 --> 01:05:10.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2823

2824
01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2825
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Giant fucking 140,000 Acre wouldn't it?</v>

2826
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:17.950
<v Speaker 1>How acres it is now.</v>

2827
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.480
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2828
01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.091
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

2829
01:05:19.091 --> 01:05:19.900
<v Speaker 3>But it's uh,</v>

2830
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually scheduled to do some show in Mexico like in the fall.</v>

2831
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.300
<v Speaker 3>And what's funny is like,</v>

2832
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:25.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2833
01:05:25.451 --> 01:05:27.430
<v Speaker 3>people are always scared of the Middle East and stuff,</v>

2834
01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:29.770
<v Speaker 3>but like my wife and I were talking about like,</v>

2835
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.830
<v Speaker 3>you know all these kidnappings and stuff going on in Mexico and it's like,</v>

2836
01:05:32.831 --> 01:05:35.680
<v Speaker 3>is it worth going down there and you know,</v>

2837
01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about the same thing like Cabo.</v>

2838
01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:40.510
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking of going somewhere in Mexico,</v>

2839
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.130
<v Speaker 3>but is it even worth going?</v>

2840
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.630
<v Speaker 3>I heard that if you go to resorts,</v>

2841
01:05:43.631 --> 01:05:44.110
<v Speaker 3>you're fine.</v>

2842
01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:45.980
<v Speaker 3>My friend Matt just got back from Cabo.</v>

2843
01:05:45.981 --> 01:05:47.110
<v Speaker 3>How goes to cobble all the time?</v>

2844
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.890
<v Speaker 3>He loves it.</v>

2845
01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:48.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a combo.</v>

2846
01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:49.270
<v Speaker 3>Supposed to still be nice,</v>

2847
01:05:49.271 --> 01:05:50.770
<v Speaker 3>but there's Acapulco,</v>

2848
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:52.210
<v Speaker 3>which is real dangerous now.</v>

2849
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Aga bogos supposed to be dangerous.</v>

2850
01:05:53.801 --> 01:05:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Can't coons supposed to be a little tricky.</v>

2851
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:56.590
<v Speaker 3>They've for the most part,</v>

2852
01:05:56.591 --> 01:05:58.130
<v Speaker 3>avoid the resort towns.</v>

2853
01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:58.520
<v Speaker 3>They don't want,</v>

2854
01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.130
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to fuck up business for everybody,</v>

2855
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.470
<v Speaker 3>but in Acapulco they've Jack People in resorts.</v>

2856
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:02.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2857
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.420
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>

2858
01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.230
<v Speaker 3>Poco was apparently pretty shady right now,</v>

2859
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but a cabo is supposed to be still good.</v>

2860
01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I was in Cabo was good.</v>

2861
01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:09.970
<v Speaker 3>It was a nice resort.</v>

2862
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.781
<v Speaker 3>It's actually funny.</v>

2863
01:06:10.781 --> 01:06:13.420
<v Speaker 3>Before all this was kind of going on like five,</v>

2864
01:06:13.421 --> 01:06:17.800
<v Speaker 3>six years ago I went to Cabo and we were staying at the Hilton and it was a nice</v>

2865
01:06:17.801 --> 01:06:19.270
<v Speaker 3>place and it was Kinda,</v>

2866
01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:20.170
<v Speaker 3>it was kinda funny cause he's,</v>

2867
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.120
<v Speaker 3>cause everyone's out there obviously,</v>

2868
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:26.110
<v Speaker 3>you know tourists and the bathing suits and these two dudes showed up.</v>

2869
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:27.370
<v Speaker 3>It was like the,</v>

2870
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:27.761
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2871
01:06:27.761 --> 01:06:28.800
<v Speaker 3>it was like keystone cop.</v>

2872
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.700
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't keeping me was like,</v>

2873
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:31.360
<v Speaker 3>it was like bumbling idiot criminals.</v>

2874
01:06:31.361 --> 01:06:31.841
<v Speaker 3>They showed up.</v>

2875
01:06:31.841 --> 01:06:33.010
<v Speaker 3>These two guys with,</v>

2876
01:06:33.011 --> 01:06:34.450
<v Speaker 3>with empty bags,</v>

2877
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.640
<v Speaker 3>like duffle bags almost a with their shirts off as if they're tourists with</v>

2878
01:06:39.641 --> 01:06:42.130
<v Speaker 3>genes obviously not tourists.</v>

2879
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:42.220
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2880
01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.650
<v Speaker 3>and the reason these two Mexican dudes walking around the pool,</v>

2881
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:46.510
<v Speaker 3>like just checking shit out.</v>

2882
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.540
<v Speaker 3>It like look at least walking around looking for a place to like they start</v>

2883
01:06:49.541 --> 01:06:50.340
<v Speaker 3>snatching things and I,</v>

2884
01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.161
<v Speaker 3>and I looked at my wife,</v>

2885
01:06:51.161 --> 01:06:51.890
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2886
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:53.530
<v Speaker 3>did those guys seem like they fit in here?</v>

2887
01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:53.951
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2888
01:06:53.951 --> 01:06:54.281
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2889
01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:54.551
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2890
01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:57.490
<v Speaker 3>I better tell somebody and went over till the management.</v>

2891
01:06:57.491 --> 01:07:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Like those two dudes don't look like their hotel clients and the next thing you</v>

2892
01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:02.020
<v Speaker 3>know they're getting escorted out.</v>

2893
01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.041
<v Speaker 3>They walked in,</v>

2894
01:07:03.041 --> 01:07:06.080
<v Speaker 3>but it's like they did not buy or invest in a bathing suit.</v>

2895
01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:06.550
<v Speaker 3>So you see,</v>

2896
01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:06.821
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2897
01:07:06.821 --> 01:07:07.654
<v Speaker 3>the part,</v>

2898
01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:08.980
<v Speaker 3>they were in there with their jeans,</v>

2899
01:07:08.981 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 3>with their shirts off,</v>

2900
01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:10.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2901
01:07:10.721 --> 01:07:11.800
<v Speaker 3>obviously not,</v>

2902
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:12.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2903
01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:13.960
<v Speaker 3>just did not fit in at all.</v>

2904
01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:15.640
<v Speaker 3>It's weird how quickly it's changed.</v>

2905
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:19.480
<v Speaker 3>I went on vacation in Cancun I think in like 2000,</v>

2906
01:07:19.481 --> 01:07:20.314
<v Speaker 3>2001.</v>

2907
01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.160
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2908
01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.540
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even think about going there now.</v>

2909
01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2910
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.040
<v Speaker 3>it's too bad too.</v>

2911
01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:26.070
<v Speaker 3>There's so many spots I want to see.</v>

2912
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:26.321
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2913
01:07:26.321 --> 01:07:28.060
<v Speaker 3>I want to see all sorts of,</v>

2914
01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:28.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2915
01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.440
<v Speaker 3>the Mayan ruins.</v>

2916
01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:31.750
<v Speaker 3>So many did plume and uh,</v>

2917
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:32.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2918
01:07:32.141 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I've been to Cheech and EATSA and there's ones outside of Mexico City.</v>

2919
01:07:34.961 --> 01:07:35.860
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see them.</v>

2920
01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:36.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2921
01:07:36.041 --> 01:07:36.820
<v Speaker 3>they're incredible.</v>

2922
01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I guess there's that,</v>

2923
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:38.770
<v Speaker 3>that exhibit in Caba,</v>

2924
01:07:38.771 --> 01:07:39.850
<v Speaker 3>that underwater,</v>

2925
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:40.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2926
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.811
<v Speaker 3>art exhibit.</v>

2927
01:07:40.811 --> 01:07:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen it where it's just a bunch of statues underneath the water and you</v>

2928
01:07:43.991 --> 01:07:44.711
<v Speaker 3>can go down there?</v>

2929
01:07:44.711 --> 01:07:48.160
<v Speaker 3>I think it's scuba dive or do something like that where there's just this huge</v>

2930
01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:51.520
<v Speaker 3>art piece underneath the ocean recently.</v>

2931
01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:52.230
<v Speaker 3>Someone's put,</v>

2932
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.580
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2933
01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:52.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2934
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:53.703
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2935
01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.210
<v Speaker 3>And I guess if you're a good artist,</v>

2936
01:07:55.211 --> 01:07:56.950
<v Speaker 3>they will let you add your own work to it.</v>

2937
01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're real hard.</v>

2938
01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:58.991
<v Speaker 3>So it's Kinda cool.</v>

2939
01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:02.470
<v Speaker 3>So all these really good artists have been adding things to it and I guess it's</v>

2940
01:08:02.471 --> 01:08:03.490
<v Speaker 3>just amazing.</v>

2941
01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:05.710
<v Speaker 3>And the only way you can get to this,</v>

2942
01:08:05.711 --> 01:08:06.461
<v Speaker 3>why scuba diving?</v>

2943
01:08:06.461 --> 01:08:07.001
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

2944
01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:07.571
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

2945
01:08:07.571 --> 01:08:07.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2946
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure about that part,</v>

2947
01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:10.690
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I kind of guessing.</v>

2948
01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a boat.</v>

2949
01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2950
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.633
<v Speaker 3>Well that's cool.</v>

2951
01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:14.320
<v Speaker 3>They've got to write that country,</v>

2952
01:08:14.321 --> 01:08:14.621
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2953
01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:15.470
<v Speaker 3>They've got to figure it out.</v>

2954
01:08:15.471 --> 01:08:16.480
<v Speaker 3>They did with Columbia,</v>

2955
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:17.540
<v Speaker 5>they straightened Columbia.</v>

2956
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:18.051
<v Speaker 5>Columbia,</v>

2957
01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:19.490
<v Speaker 5>apparently you can travel there now.</v>

2958
01:08:19.491 --> 01:08:20.660
<v Speaker 5>And it used to be,</v>

2959
01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:21.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2960
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:23.390
<v Speaker 5>back in the 80s when the cocaine crisis was going on,</v>

2961
01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:24.800
<v Speaker 5>Columbia was just ridiculous.</v>

2962
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.230
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2963
01:08:25.230 --> 01:08:25.461
<v Speaker 5>Metta,</v>

2964
01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:27.170
<v Speaker 5>Ian was a Goddamn war zone,</v>

2965
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.350
<v Speaker 5>but now apparently you can go to Columbia and like they've taken care of shit.</v>

2966
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:31.184
<v Speaker 5>They've cleaned it up.</v>

2967
01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.830
<v Speaker 5>But I don't know if they're ever going to be able to do that with Mexico.</v>

2968
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:34.370
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2969
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:36.380
<v Speaker 5>it's so close to the supply.</v>

2970
01:08:36.381 --> 01:08:36.831
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2971
01:08:36.831 --> 01:08:37.040
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2972
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.440
<v Speaker 5>the cash supply of America is like right there.</v>

2973
01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.210
<v Speaker 5>They can get the drugs and you know,</v>

2974
01:08:41.211 --> 01:08:44.870
<v Speaker 5>get that shit across quickly and they're doing crazy shit like rolling heads</v>

2975
01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:46.160
<v Speaker 5>into disco techs and shit.</v>

2976
01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.220
<v Speaker 5>You heard about that kill people enroll?</v>

2977
01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:48.470
<v Speaker 5>Ha.</v>

2978
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:49.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean at what point do you go,</v>

2979
01:08:49.851 --> 01:08:50.481
<v Speaker 5>I killed them.</v>

2980
01:08:50.481 --> 01:08:51.350
<v Speaker 5>I cut off his head,</v>

2981
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:51.740
<v Speaker 5>rolled it.</v>

2982
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.150
<v Speaker 5>That's the role that a discotheque,</v>

2983
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 5>the other thing I've been thinking of is,</v>

2984
01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:57.460
<v Speaker 5>I guess it Chapin is so broke right now that,</v>

2985
01:08:57.461 --> 01:09:00.020
<v Speaker 5>that it's so cheap to fly to Japan right now.</v>

2986
01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.960
<v Speaker 5>They need people to come to Japan because no one's going now.</v>

2987
01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.170
<v Speaker 5>And so I heard that there's like flights for like ridiculous amounts of money</v>

2988
01:09:06.171 --> 01:09:06.621
<v Speaker 5>from La,</v>

2989
01:09:06.621 --> 01:09:09.230
<v Speaker 5>like 300 bucks or something like that just to go to Japan.</v>

2990
01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:09.590
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2991
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:10.010
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

2992
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 5>now would you go to Tokyo?</v>

2993
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:12.290
<v Speaker 5>Would you do that?</v>

2994
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 5>Or is it doesn't do anything about it.</v>

2995
01:09:14.601 --> 01:09:18.050
<v Speaker 5>Read up on what the levels are as far as radiation goes.</v>

2996
01:09:18.051 --> 01:09:22.160
<v Speaker 5>But the problem with Japan and the radiation is that I don't think they've been</v>

2997
01:09:22.161 --> 01:09:23.550
<v Speaker 5>entirely honest about it.</v>

2998
01:09:23.610 --> 01:09:23.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2999
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:25.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they've been honest about the leak.</v>

3000
01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.040
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3001
01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:26.570
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

3002
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:29.270
<v Speaker 5>they're finding out that all three of them are melt throughs.</v>

3003
01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:29.861
<v Speaker 5>They're there,</v>

3004
01:09:29.861 --> 01:09:33.140
<v Speaker 5>they're finding out all sorts of things where it turns out that the actual</v>

3005
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:34.460
<v Speaker 5>damage done by these,</v>

3006
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:34.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3007
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:36.560
<v Speaker 5>nuclear disasters is far,</v>

3008
01:09:36.561 --> 01:09:38.760
<v Speaker 5>far greater than what they had initially forecast.</v>

3009
01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.800
<v Speaker 5>And so who knows,</v>

3010
01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:42.080
<v Speaker 5>like how far the spread of the radiation goes.</v>

3011
01:09:42.081 --> 01:09:43.640
<v Speaker 5>I would have to hear about that.</v>

3012
01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.620
<v Speaker 5>It'd be a fucking shame to go there for $300 ticket and just fucking nuke for a</v>

3013
01:09:48.621 --> 01:09:49.100
<v Speaker 5>bargain,</v>

3014

<v Speaker 5>get bigger balls.</v>

3015
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:51.680
<v Speaker 5>I would love to go to Japan though,</v>

3016
01:09:51.681 --> 01:09:51.861
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3017
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:52.730
<v Speaker 5>I've always wanted to go.</v>

3018
01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:54.740
<v Speaker 5>I was always hoping that we'd do a UFC in Japan.</v>

3019
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:57.590
<v Speaker 5>It's such an amazing piece of history.</v>

3020
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:58.011
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3021
01:09:58.011 --> 01:10:00.540
<v Speaker 5>that one part of the world is so unique there.</v>

3022
01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:04.640
<v Speaker 5>There are innovations as far as martial arts go and swordsmanship and literature</v>

3023
01:10:04.641 --> 01:10:05.474
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

3024
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's where the book of five rings came from.</v>

3025
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.080
<v Speaker 5>What the book of five rings is one of my like guidebooks for life that me and</v>

3026
01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:14.000
<v Speaker 5>Martin was hace book and that's,</v>

3027
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:14.241
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3028
01:10:14.241 --> 01:10:15.620
<v Speaker 5>all that Samurai way,</v>

3029
01:10:15.621 --> 01:10:16.970
<v Speaker 5>all that shit came from Japan.</v>

3030
01:10:16.971 --> 01:10:18.110
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing culture.</v>

3031
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:20.060
<v Speaker 5>It does seem like a pretty crazy and they,</v>

3032
01:10:20.061 --> 01:10:21.470
<v Speaker 5>and it feels like after,</v>

3033
01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:23.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how they were before World War II,</v>

3034
01:10:23.331 --> 01:10:26.660
<v Speaker 5>but it feels like after World War II they became more capitalistic than we are</v>

3035
01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:27.310
<v Speaker 5>even,</v>

3036
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3037
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:29.630
<v Speaker 5>like if you see like any footage I've seen ever,</v>

3038
01:10:29.631 --> 01:10:30.464
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

3039
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:33.170
<v Speaker 5>you know like the neon lights and the,</v>

3040
01:10:33.171 --> 01:10:34.070
<v Speaker 5>and just like the,</v>

3041
01:10:34.071 --> 01:10:36.920
<v Speaker 5>the amount of like the Japanese and the products they love and you know,</v>

3042
01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:37.191
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

3043
01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:39.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there is materialistic as us though.</v>

3044
01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:41.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they purchase things and own things.</v>

3045
01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:43.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's a lot of emphasis in their culture of owning things.</v>

3046
01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.270
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3047
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:47.210
<v Speaker 5>I think they spend all their money going out to eat and spend all their money</v>

3048
01:10:47.211 --> 01:10:50.750
<v Speaker 5>drinking and spend makeup and different and you notice also knows that a lot of</v>

3049
01:10:50.751 --> 01:10:52.490
<v Speaker 5>them I have all have like eyelashes,</v>

3050
01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:55.040
<v Speaker 5>fake eyelashes and they spent so much money.</v>

3051
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:57.223
<v Speaker 5>Women,</v>

3052
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.320
<v Speaker 5>men started rock and fake eyelashes as well,</v>

3053
01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:01.401
<v Speaker 5>how to do it.</v>

3054
01:11:01.401 --> 01:11:02.234
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of,</v>

3055
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.851
<v Speaker 5>they kind of did,</v>

3056
01:11:02.851 --> 01:11:04.520
<v Speaker 5>they spend a lot more money on how they look.</v>

3057
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:06.080
<v Speaker 5>Like I saw the other day.</v>

3058
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.210
<v Speaker 5>What did Americans,</v>

3059
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.990
<v Speaker 5>I saw the,</v>

3060
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:10.460
<v Speaker 5>at the saddle ranch I saw a group,</v>

3061
01:11:10.461 --> 01:11:13.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm like no step is research</v>

3062
01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:15.560
<v Speaker 3>seven kids for sure.</v>

3063
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:16.560
<v Speaker 3>There were a few Asian pan.</v>

3064
01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Well I had whatever,</v>

3065
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:18.833
<v Speaker 3>same shit.</v>

3066
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.840
<v Speaker 3>They all had their hair done with like the brown in the debt,</v>

3067
01:11:21.841 --> 01:11:24.450
<v Speaker 3>that blonde streaks in it and they all had had like their,</v>

3068
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.090
<v Speaker 3>their genes that probably costs them $300.</v>

3069
01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:27.631
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

3070
01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:28.090
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

3071
01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:31.380
<v Speaker 3>I've always said the Japanese seem to be the most European of Asians.</v>

3072
01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Like they're very much into like,</v>

3073
01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:34.531
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

3074
01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:35.364
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a diff,</v>

3075
01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.690
<v Speaker 3>it seems like a different look.</v>

3076
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:39.720
<v Speaker 3>You know there are little like hipper in their way.</v>

3077
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:40.270
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3078
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Is it mixed with hairstylist?</v>

3079
01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.133
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

3080
01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Interesting how many Japanese people are into American culture.</v>

3081
01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3082
01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:49.230
<v Speaker 3>How much they follow it and are really,</v>

3083
01:11:49.231 --> 01:11:49.910
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

3084
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:50.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3085
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:52.340
<v Speaker 3>enamored by Elvis.</v>

3086
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Michael Jackson was like superman for them.</v>

3087
01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:56.700
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>

3088
01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:56.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3089
01:11:56.911 --> 01:11:58.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating culture.</v>

3090
01:11:58.021 --> 01:12:01.500
<v Speaker 3>You know when they had all these problems with the tsunamis in the earthquake</v>

3091
01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:02.334
<v Speaker 3>and everything like that,</v>

3092
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.110
<v Speaker 3>and people would wait in line for a,</v>

3093
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.490
<v Speaker 3>for food and water and rations,</v>

3094
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:07.080
<v Speaker 3>they were orderly as fuck,</v>

3095
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:07.690
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3096
01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.240
<v Speaker 3>they're culture is like so polite.</v>

3097
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.220
<v Speaker 3>They told me that they went to a bar or something in Japan and people were lined</v>

3098
01:12:14.221 --> 01:12:19.221
<v Speaker 3>up like at the bar as opposed to like the idea of just come at the bazaar</v>

3099
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:19.950
<v Speaker 3>mentality.</v>

3100
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:20.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3101
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:21.990
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty crazy if you think about that.</v>

3102
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:22.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3103
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.990
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

3104
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:24.360
<v Speaker 3>they're much more disciplined,</v>

3105
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:25.800
<v Speaker 3>much more discipline and humble.</v>

3106
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:26.820
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see Babel,</v>

3107
01:12:26.821 --> 01:12:28.980
<v Speaker 3>the movie babble babble.</v>

3108
01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:29.490
<v Speaker 3>Now it is it.</v>

3109
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:29.611
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3110
01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:30.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a great movie.</v>

3111
01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Nri to the director.</v>

3112
01:12:32.221 --> 01:12:33.510
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever see I'm Otis Pedro's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

3114
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.040
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3115
01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.570
<v Speaker 3>With the dog fighting and all that,</v>

3116
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:39.180
<v Speaker 3>I bought on DVD and I put it down somewhere.</v>

3117
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:42.670
<v Speaker 3>I have to get in the mood to watch a movie with subtitles,</v>

3118
01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:43.150
<v Speaker 3>but dude,</v>

3119
01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:44.130
<v Speaker 3>he's intense.</v>

3120
01:12:44.131 --> 01:12:44.970
<v Speaker 3>He's a great director.</v>

3121
01:12:44.971 --> 01:12:45.710
<v Speaker 3>He's done.</v>

3122
01:12:45.710 --> 01:12:46.200
<v Speaker 3>He'd done a,</v>

3123
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.130
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a few of his movies.</v>

3124
01:12:47.131 --> 01:12:47.520
<v Speaker 3>I think he,</v>

3125
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.950
<v Speaker 3>I think he also did 21 grants.</v>

3126
01:12:48.951 --> 01:12:49.350
<v Speaker 3>I might be,</v>

3127
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:50.131
<v Speaker 3>I might be mistaken,</v>

3128
01:12:50.131 --> 01:12:51.360
<v Speaker 3>but I think you're right.</v>

3129
01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:53.100
<v Speaker 3>So he's got like the movies,</v>

3130
01:12:53.101 --> 01:12:56.520
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him do all have like two or three stories and they all kind of</v>

3131
01:12:56.521 --> 01:12:57.690
<v Speaker 3>intertwined somehow.</v>

3132
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.650
<v Speaker 3>And this one Babel was amazing and it had like three stories going on.</v>

3133
01:13:01.651 --> 01:13:02.484
<v Speaker 3>One of them was,</v>

3134
01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:02.911
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3135
01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:03.744

<v Speaker 3>and not Naomi Watts,</v>

3139
01:13:07.381 --> 01:13:07.680
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3140
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.310
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:09.143
<v Speaker 3>I forget her name.</v>

3142
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

3143
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.801
<v Speaker 3>they go to,</v>

3144
01:13:10.801 --> 01:13:13.680
<v Speaker 3>they go to Morocco and they're visiting Morocco and uh,</v>

3145
01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:15.030
<v Speaker 3>and some shit goes down and then,</v>

3146
01:13:15.031 --> 01:13:15.361
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

3147
01:13:15.361 --> 01:13:20.361
<v Speaker 3>and then there's another story of a Mexican family who's trying to get to a,</v>

3148
01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:20.961
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think across the board.</v>

3151
01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:24.060
<v Speaker 3>And then they get into some trouble.</v>

3152
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.490
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a story of this Japanese girl,</v>

3153
01:13:26.491 --> 01:13:27.121
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm talking about.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you have anything.</v>

3156
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:28.831
<v Speaker 3>It's so amazing.</v>

3157
01:13:28.831 --> 01:13:29.490
<v Speaker 3>This girl,</v>

3158
01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 3>I think she should've won the Oscar for best supporting actress that year.</v>

3159
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:33.143
<v Speaker 3>She plays a,</v>

3160
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:37.450
<v Speaker 3>she plays a deaf girl who's like just depressed and living with her dad and this</v>

3161
01:13:37.451 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

3162
01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.110
<v Speaker 3>And she's just as an actor,</v>

3163
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:40.681
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3164
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:42.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you play deaf.</v>

3165
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:43.830
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know how you'd do it that well,</v>

3166
01:13:43.831 --> 01:13:45.030
<v Speaker 3>like it's the most amazing thing.</v>

3167
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:46.890
<v Speaker 3>And what was really cool about it was,</v>

3168
01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.660
<v Speaker 3>so this girl was like a party girl,</v>

3169
01:13:48.661 --> 01:13:49.800
<v Speaker 3>like having a good time with her friends,</v>

3170
01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:50.640
<v Speaker 3>but she's depressed.</v>

3171
01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:54.930
<v Speaker 3>And what was this intense scene where like they're out there partying.</v>

3172
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:57.360
<v Speaker 3>I think they do ecstasy or something and they end up at a,</v>

3173
01:13:57.361 --> 01:13:58.260
<v Speaker 3>at a nightclub.</v>

3174
01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:03.030
<v Speaker 3>And it's the coolest thing because suddenly it goes from her perspective.</v>

3175
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.160
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that from a deaf person's perspective,</v>

3176
01:14:05.161 --> 01:14:05.821
<v Speaker 3>a nightclub.</v>

3177
01:14:05.821 --> 01:14:06.311
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

3178
01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:06.820
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3179
01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.190
<v Speaker 3>it's like really loud,</v>

3180
01:14:08.191 --> 01:14:09.990
<v Speaker 3>but she's not hearing the whole thing is just kind of like,</v>

3181
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:14.680
<v Speaker 3>it's like muddled and she's kind of looking around as the most intense shit.</v>

3182
01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of getting goosebumps thinking you got to see it.</v>

3183
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.051
<v Speaker 3>What's it called again?</v>

3184
01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:18.040
<v Speaker 3>It's called Babel B.</v>

3185
01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:18.221
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>

3186
01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:18.421
<v Speaker 3>B.</v>

3187
01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:18.561
<v Speaker 3>E.</v>

3188
01:14:18.561 --> 01:14:18.761
<v Speaker 3>L.</v>

3189
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:20.380
<v Speaker 3>It has a great soundtrack too.</v>

3190
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:21.191
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3191
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:22.024
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

3192
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.863
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3193
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.101
<v Speaker 3>and this seen,</v>

3194
01:14:24.101 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 3>this girl killed it and she ended up losing to,</v>

3195
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:27.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3196
01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:27.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3197
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:28.241
<v Speaker 3>Hudson.</v>

3198
01:14:28.241 --> 01:14:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Jennifer Hudson from a,</v>

3199
01:14:30.321 --> 01:14:33.520
<v Speaker 3>a dream dream girls was at the movie and I saw her,</v>

3200
01:14:33.521 --> 01:14:34.360
<v Speaker 3>I saw some of that.</v>

3201
01:14:34.361 --> 01:14:35.410
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the whole thing and that,</v>

3202
01:14:35.411 --> 01:14:37.930
<v Speaker 3>but I think that she won because it was like a popular,</v>

3203
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:38.850
<v Speaker 3>like she sang in that.</v>

3204
01:14:38.851 --> 01:14:38.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3205
01:14:38.981 --> 01:14:40.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's some good acting in it,</v>

3206
01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.270
<v Speaker 3>but this girl just knocked it out like as an actor to sit there and watch</v>

3207
01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:44.470
<v Speaker 3>somebody kill it like that.</v>

3208
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:45.520
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3209
01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.353
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>

3210
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:46.871
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3211
01:14:46.871 --> 01:14:47.320
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3212
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.700
<v Speaker 3>but it was all Japan and it was,</v>

3213
01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:49.331
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty cool.</v>

3214
01:14:49.331 --> 01:14:49.841
<v Speaker 3>It's a cool,</v>

3215
01:14:49.841 --> 01:14:51.940
<v Speaker 3>like kind of like a night in Japan.</v>

3216
01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Kind of such an unusual culture,</v>

3217
01:14:53.591 --> 01:14:54.040
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3218
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:54.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3219
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.440
<v Speaker 3>It's a really crazy place.</v>

3220
01:14:56.441 --> 01:14:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3221
01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:59.170
<v Speaker 3>They invented the suicide bombing too.</v>

3222
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.630
<v Speaker 3>They invented the advent of the kamikaze.</v>

3223
01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.101
<v Speaker 3>We know what they did.</v>

3224
01:15:03.101 --> 01:15:04.480
<v Speaker 3>They got people on Crystal Meth.</v>

3225
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:05.141
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3226
01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:05.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3227
01:15:05.351 --> 01:15:05.771
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

3228
01:15:05.771 --> 01:15:07.510
<v Speaker 3>that's how they got them to do kamikaze work.</v>

3229
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Gave him crazy amphetamines and made him just fucking do nutty shit.</v>

3230
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:13.143
<v Speaker 3>Crazy is that,</v>

3231
01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:13.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3232
01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:15.610
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting is when you realize like,</v>

3233
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:15.821
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3234
01:15:15.821 --> 01:15:16.660
<v Speaker 3>that's good to know.</v>

3235
01:15:16.661 --> 01:15:17.050
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3236
01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:20.140
<v Speaker 3>like when you realize sometimes the motivation behind some things,</v>

3237
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:21.820
<v Speaker 3>like my dad before he passed,</v>

3238
01:15:21.821 --> 01:15:24.730
<v Speaker 3>so he used to tell me that a lot of the mullahs in Iran,</v>

3239
01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:25.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3240
01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:25.841
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3241
01:15:25.841 --> 01:15:26.750
<v Speaker 3>they're like a lot of people in,</v>

3242
01:15:26.751 --> 01:15:27.610
<v Speaker 3>you're on smoke opium,</v>

3243
01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:29.290
<v Speaker 3>it's like smoking weed but it's opium.</v>

3244
01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:32.410
<v Speaker 3>And he was saying that a lot of these molars actually smoke opium.</v>

3245
01:15:32.411 --> 01:15:33.820
<v Speaker 3>And I ended up doing a bit about,</v>

3246
01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:34.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3247
01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:34.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3248
01:15:34.511 --> 01:15:37.570
<v Speaker 3>staying up about how the reason these guys are talking shit to America's cause</v>

3249
01:15:37.571 --> 01:15:39.880
<v Speaker 3>they're high and suddenly started making sense.</v>

3250
01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Like even like Kadafi supposedly it's just high on all kinds of meds.</v>

3251
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.870
<v Speaker 3>And so you realize why the guys out there talking like it's fucking Tony</v>

3252
01:15:46.871 --> 01:15:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Montana.</v>

3253
01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:48.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've seen some of the quotes,</v>

3254
01:15:48.701 --> 01:15:49.001
<v Speaker 3>but he's like,</v>

3255
01:15:49.001 --> 01:15:50.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna fight to the death.</v>

3256
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:51.783
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

3257
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:52.990
<v Speaker 3>somebody might give them like,</v>

3258
01:15:52.991 --> 01:15:53.741
<v Speaker 3>credit is like,</v>

01:15:55.721 --> 01:15:56.511
<v Speaker 3>this guy's got balls,</v>

3262
01:15:56.511 --> 01:15:57.580
<v Speaker 3>he's stand up to America.</v>

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:00.790
<v Speaker 3>And he's just talking shit.</v>

3266
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.130
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing with these guys that are kamikaze.</v>

3267
01:16:03.131 --> 01:16:03.431
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3268
01:16:03.431 --> 01:16:03.730
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

3269
01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:04.121
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>

3270
01:16:04.121 --> 01:16:05.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of balls to do that.</v>

3271
01:16:05.141 --> 01:16:05.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3272
01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:06.370
<v Speaker 3>If you're fucking high on meth.</v>

3273
01:16:06.371 --> 01:16:06.671
<v Speaker 3>He like,</v>

3274
01:16:06.671 --> 01:16:06.851
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3275
01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:10.810
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm about to fucking take on this fucking boat with my little plane.</v>

3276
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:12.790
<v Speaker 4>I just saw a movie,</v>

3277
01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:12.971
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

3278
01:16:12.971 --> 01:16:14.290
<v Speaker 4>Remember that movie airport?</v>

3279
01:16:14.291 --> 01:16:17.530
<v Speaker 4>It was big in the seventies I was kind of a report.</v>

3280
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:17.831
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3281
01:16:17.831 --> 01:16:20.440
<v Speaker 4>It was about a terrorism act that this guy,</v>

3282
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:21.910
<v Speaker 4>this guy lost his job.</v>

3283
01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:25.520
<v Speaker 4>The economy was shit and he was going to kill himself to,</v>

3284
01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:26.980
<v Speaker 4>to collect on insurance.</v>

3285
01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.320
<v Speaker 4>And so he went on this plane and it was kind of cool to see like how planes he</v>

3286
01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:31.721
<v Speaker 4>used to be,</v>

3287
01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:32.830
<v Speaker 4>where people are smoking,</v>

3288
01:16:33.450 --> 01:16:33.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3289
01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:33.831
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3290
01:16:33.831 --> 01:16:34.664
<v Speaker 4>and all this crap.</v>

3291
01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:40.020
<v Speaker 4>And then he blew up a bomb on the plane and it was so funny seeing how na Aa,</v>

3292
01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.600
<v Speaker 4>how we used to think if a bomb blew up on a plane,</v>

3293
01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:46.560
<v Speaker 4>like how this little hole came out and the wind blew around the little,</v>

3294
01:16:46.561 --> 01:16:46.781
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

3295
01:16:46.781 --> 01:16:47.021
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3296
01:16:47.021 --> 01:16:48.100
<v Speaker 4>it's windy in here.</v>

3297
01:16:48.101 --> 01:16:48.934

01:20:50.071 --> 01:20:51.780
<v Speaker 3>I talk about this on stage and it's total truth.</v>

3503
01:20:51.781 --> 01:20:54.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like they like if you watch any time,</v>

3504
01:20:54.961 --> 01:20:56.070
<v Speaker 3>like there's something going on,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>

3506
01:20:56.371 --> 01:20:58.350
<v Speaker 3>I would say like whenever there's a hostage situation,</v>

3507
01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.150
<v Speaker 3>like these guys are so bad ass,</v>

3510
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.411
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3511
01:21:04.411 --> 01:21:04.531
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3512
01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:05.460
<v Speaker 3>we might save some,</v>

3513
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:06.600
<v Speaker 3>we might say some hostages,</v>

3514
01:21:06.601 --> 01:21:07.470
<v Speaker 3>but they'll probably die.</v>

3515
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.420
<v Speaker 3>We're going to kick kill the hostage takers,</v>

3516
01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.071
<v Speaker 3>kill the hostage.</v>

3517
01:21:11.071 --> 01:21:11.821
<v Speaker 3>We might kill each other.</v>

3518
01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:12.870
<v Speaker 3>There's still bad ass.</v>

3587
01:22:50.610 --> 01:22:54.000
<v Speaker 1>the president of America is like some sort of a fucking figurehead for giant</v>

3588

<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>

3589
01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.680
<v Speaker 1>The guy who's running Russia is really running Russia.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like hours away from Saint Petersburg,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That'll fuck around.</v>

3613
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:32.020
<v Speaker 1>You know they have wolf problems up there.</v>

3614
01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:32.913
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that.</v>

3615
01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3616
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>They're having giant packs of super wolves that are banding together for the</v>

3617
01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:41.230
<v Speaker 1>first time and killing livestock because it's so fucking cold.</v>

3618
01:23:41.231 --> 01:23:42.040
<v Speaker 1>It's winter.</v>

3619
01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:46.900
<v Speaker 1>It got so cold up there that many packs of wolves joined together to become one</v>

3620
01:23:46.901 --> 01:23:48.610
<v Speaker 1>giant pack because they're,</v>

3621
01:23:48.611 --> 01:23:49.070
<v Speaker 1>they're the,</v>

3622
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:52.300
<v Speaker 1>they're the freezing temperatures were killing all of their game and they were</v>

3623
01:23:52.301 --> 01:23:53.051
<v Speaker 1>getting desperate.</v>

3624
01:23:53.051 --> 01:23:56.950
<v Speaker 1>So they form some sort of a new strategy and we'd go into fucking towns and just</v>

3625
01:23:56.951 --> 01:23:57.784
<v Speaker 1>jack all their,</v>

3626
01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.370
<v Speaker 1>all their livestock who that's gotta be the worst way to go.</v>

3627
01:24:00.371 --> 01:24:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if you like</v>

3628
01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:02.860
<v Speaker 3>walking home with a girlfriend or you know,</v>

3629
01:24:02.861 --> 01:24:04.630
<v Speaker 3>wife after like dinner one night and you're like,</v>

3630
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:05.880
<v Speaker 3>oh that was great dinner and then you,</v>

3631
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.880
<v Speaker 1>you look back,</v>

3632
01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.510
<v Speaker 1>you're like as a pack of fucking wolves are terrifying to him.</v>

3633
01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3634
01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:13.620
<v Speaker 1>cause we've killed them off in this country.</v>

3635
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.130
<v Speaker 1>And then we started restocking.</v>

3636
01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:15.421
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3637
01:24:15.421 --> 01:24:17.100
<v Speaker 1>they're having a problem right now in Idaho.</v>

3638
01:24:17.101 --> 01:24:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I believe it is because a,</v>

3639
01:24:18.781 --> 01:24:20.340
<v Speaker 1>they've stocked the uh,</v>

3640
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:25.050
<v Speaker 1>the giant gray wolf from Canada and they brought it into Idaho to try to like</v>

3641
01:24:25.051 --> 01:24:25.471
<v Speaker 1>bring,</v>

3642
01:24:25.471 --> 01:24:26.590
<v Speaker 1>bring the population's up.</v>

3643
01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.070
<v Speaker 1>But now the populations are out of the,</v>

3644
01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:30.710
<v Speaker 1>out of control and they're in like the several thousands and then another</v>

3645
01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.880
<v Speaker 1>killing livestock and fucking things up.</v>

3646
01:24:32.881 --> 01:24:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And you have to worry about them with people too because they're big animals</v>

3647
01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:38.100
<v Speaker 1>only 180 pounds and they will kill people.</v>

3648
01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Like all that big bad wolf shit and Little Red Riding Hood Shit where it was</v>

3649
01:24:41.821 --> 01:24:42.654
<v Speaker 1>always wolves.</v>

3650
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:44.190
<v Speaker 1>That's because wolves used to kill people.</v>

3651
01:24:44.191 --> 01:24:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3652
01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:45.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3653
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Before we figured out tanks and jets and guns and you know,</v>

3654
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.280
<v Speaker 1>there was like there was a real issue.</v>

3655
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3656
01:24:50.611 --> 01:24:51.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to fuck with a wolf man,</v>

3657
01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:53.730
<v Speaker 1>don't fuck with him.</v>

3658
01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:55.330
<v Speaker 1>That's why there,</v>

3659
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:59.100
<v Speaker 1>there was a great documentary on Yellowstone and the cycle of life and</v>

3660
01:24:59.101 --> 01:25:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Yellowstone and one of the things that talked about is how the wolves got</v>

3661
01:25:01.861 --> 01:25:05.130
<v Speaker 1>stronger over the winter and all these other animals got fucked.</v>

3662
01:25:05.370 --> 01:25:06.210
<v Speaker 1>All these other animals,</v>

3663
01:25:06.211 --> 01:25:07.800
<v Speaker 1>like they couldn't find their vegetation.</v>

3664
01:25:07.801 --> 01:25:10.980
<v Speaker 1>They had digging through all this snow to get to their plants and the wolves</v>

3665
01:25:10.981 --> 01:25:14.490
<v Speaker 1>were just eating all these deer so they would be well fed and they would be</v>

3666
01:25:14.491 --> 01:25:15.091
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>

3667
01:25:15.091 --> 01:25:16.110
<v Speaker 1>And the livestock,</v>

3668
01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:16.681
<v Speaker 1>the Caribou,</v>

3669
01:25:16.681 --> 01:25:17.370
<v Speaker 1>the deers,</v>

3670
01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:20.790
<v Speaker 1>they would all slowly start to the weekend and they would all just get taken out</v>

3671
01:25:20.791 --> 01:25:22.950
<v Speaker 1>by wolves as fascinating to watch,</v>

3672
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.823
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3673
01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:24.841
<v Speaker 3>Two thoughts came to mind.</v>

3674
01:25:24.841 --> 01:25:25.351
<v Speaker 3>One was,</v>

3675
01:25:25.351 --> 01:25:26.880
<v Speaker 3>I remember as a kid in Iran,</v>

3676
01:25:26.881 --> 01:25:27.391
<v Speaker 3>in Tehran,</v>

3677
01:25:27.391 --> 01:25:27.780
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3678
01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.240
<v Speaker 3>I left when I was six and I remember my dad was like,</v>

3679
01:25:30.241 --> 01:25:30.961
<v Speaker 3>my dad was,</v>

3680
01:25:30.961 --> 01:25:32.520
<v Speaker 3>was like a manly man.</v>

3681
01:25:32.521 --> 01:25:32.701
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3682
01:25:32.701 --> 01:25:33.241
<v Speaker 3>he's just like,</v>

3683
01:25:33.241 --> 01:25:33.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3684
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.780
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3685
01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:35.870
<v Speaker 3>and he was and he was a self made millionaire neuron.</v>

3686
01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.350
<v Speaker 3>So like he was like back then,</v>

3687
01:25:37.351 --> 01:25:38.310
<v Speaker 3>like he was like the Godfather,</v>

3688
01:25:38.311 --> 01:25:39.690
<v Speaker 3>like the shitty would do for people.</v>

3689
01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:40.980
<v Speaker 3>He was like the Godfather,</v>

3690
01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.900
<v Speaker 3>like straight up like don Corleone,</v>

3691
01:25:42.901 --> 01:25:43.621
<v Speaker 3>like come to him,</v>

3692
01:25:43.621 --> 01:25:44.460
<v Speaker 3>whatever you need done.</v>

3693
01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.220
<v Speaker 3>But he and all his friends were like wrestlers and shit.</v>

3694
01:25:47.221 --> 01:25:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3695
01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.510
<v Speaker 3>like tough dudes.</v>

3696
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:50.550
<v Speaker 3>A lot of wrestlers out of round rod are wrestlers.</v>

3697
01:25:50.551 --> 01:25:50.791
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3698
01:25:50.791 --> 01:25:53.080
<v Speaker 3>And then my dad was a big drinker because he was from northern,</v>

3699
01:25:53.130 --> 01:25:53.821
<v Speaker 3>northern Iran.</v>

3700
01:25:53.821 --> 01:25:55.560
<v Speaker 3>Tabriz was it near the border of Russia?</v>

3701
01:25:55.561 --> 01:25:57.000
<v Speaker 3>So vodka was like water,</v>

3702
01:25:57.001 --> 01:25:58.140
<v Speaker 3>like they would drink it all the time.</v>

3703
01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:00.330
<v Speaker 3>So I just have this memory of my dad.</v>

3704
01:26:00.331 --> 01:26:01.470
<v Speaker 3>We were coming home from a party,</v>

3705
01:26:01.471 --> 01:26:02.550
<v Speaker 3>he was obviously drunk,</v>

3706
01:26:02.551 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 3>he was us home and there was a pack of wild dogs like down the block from where</v>

3707
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:08.150
<v Speaker 3>we live.</v>

3708
01:26:08.150 --> 01:26:09.650
<v Speaker 3>And my dad was so crazy,</v>

3709
01:26:09.651 --> 01:26:10.010
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3710
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.880
<v Speaker 3>like manly.</v>

3711
01:26:11.150 --> 01:26:14.750
<v Speaker 3>He pulled the car over and picked up a couple of rocks and started chasing the</v>

3712
01:26:14.751 --> 01:26:15.584
<v Speaker 3>pack of dog.</v>

3713
01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm coming here,</v>

3714
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.881
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3715
01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:20.631

3716
01:26:20.631 --> 01:26:23.300
<v Speaker 5>And the guard is throwing rocks at wild and I'm sitting there,</v>

3717
01:26:23.301 --> 01:26:24.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting there as a kid going like,</v>

3718
01:26:24.621 --> 01:26:24.921
<v Speaker 5>Damn,</v>

3719
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:26.480
<v Speaker 5>my dad is as bad as you know,</v>

3720
01:26:26.730 --> 01:26:27.531
<v Speaker 5>when you grow up you're like,</v>

3721
01:26:27.531 --> 01:26:28.011
<v Speaker 5>no man,</v>

01:26:28.011 --> 01:26:29.620
<v Speaker 5>my dad was good the fuck.</v>

3723
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:31.930
<v Speaker 5>But Iranians are famous for their,</v>

3724
01:26:31.931 --> 01:26:33.200
<v Speaker 5>for their physical conditioning.</v>

3725
01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:38.240
<v Speaker 3>There's like a lot of techniques that they used from Iran that are still used</v>

3726
01:26:38.581 --> 01:26:39.031

<v Speaker 5>Hilarious.</v>

01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:24.210
<v Speaker 5>There's a great picture online of this African guy running from a hippo and it's</v>

3811
01:28:24.341 --> 01:28:24.491
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

3812

<v Speaker 5>it's a funny picture and a terrifying picture.</v>

3813
01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:28.380
<v Speaker 5>It's funny because the guy made it,</v>

3814
01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:28.991
<v Speaker 5>he survived.</v>

3815
01:28:28.991 --> 01:28:29.950
<v Speaker 5>He got away from the hippo.</v>

3816
01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.380
<v Speaker 5>But it's fucking terrifying when you watching it man.</v>

3817
01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:37.300
<v Speaker 5>Cause this guy is running in which essentially a gigantic wild pig.</v>

3818
01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:38.291
<v Speaker 5>It's what they are.</v>

3819
01:28:38.291 --> 01:28:39.670
<v Speaker 5>There are different kind of pig.</v>

3820
01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.930
<v Speaker 5>They're in the family of pigs.</v>

3821
01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:42.820
<v Speaker 5>Pigs are ruthless assholes,</v>

3822
01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:43.421
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

3823
01:28:43.421 --> 01:28:47.680
<v Speaker 5>And this giant wild pig is chasing this guy down the street and it's fucking</v>

3824
01:28:47.681 --> 01:28:48.410
<v Speaker 5>terrifying.</v>

3825
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine a thought,</v>

3826
01:28:49.251 --> 01:28:51.350
<v Speaker 3>like one of my thoughts at that point would be,</v>

3827
01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:53.053
<v Speaker 3>are they like,</v>

3828
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:54.740
<v Speaker 3>are they supposed to run faster?</v>

3829
01:28:55.210 --> 01:28:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Learning to think about,</v>

3830
01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:57.281
<v Speaker 5>do you know what I'm saying?</v>

3831
01:28:57.281 --> 01:29:00.080
<v Speaker 5>Like have I ever heard of a news piece about these guys here?</v>

3832
01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:00.760
<v Speaker 5>Like you know,</v>

3833
01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 5>the only that keeps you safe</v>

3834
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:03.750
<v Speaker 1>is that they can't run too far.</v>

3835
01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're so big,</v>

3836
01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.260
<v Speaker 1>they're so big in the Karen,</v>

3837
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:07.081
<v Speaker 1>so much mass in.</v>

3838
01:29:07.081 --> 01:29:08.100
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times they spend,</v>

3839
01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:09.660
<v Speaker 1>they spend a lot of their time in the water.</v>

3840
01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:10.351
<v Speaker 1>They could run,</v>

3841
01:29:10.351 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's not their best move.</v>

3842
01:29:11.521 --> 01:29:12.510
<v Speaker 1>You've got to outdistance them,</v>

3843
01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:13.770
<v Speaker 1>but this guy was running fast.</v>

3844
01:29:13.771 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 1>This thing looked like it was like right on his ass.</v>

3845
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:18.630
<v Speaker 1>One of the beautiful things about this podcast is that we have this message</v>

3846
01:29:18.631 --> 01:29:22.260
<v Speaker 1>board@joerogan.net and whenever we bring up something like this in the podcast,</v>

3847
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:25.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a thread that's already dedicated to the Mazda Bonnie podcasts that</v>

3848
01:29:25.561 --> 01:29:26.060
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

3849
01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:26.581
<v Speaker 1>What is his name?</v>

3850
01:29:26.581 --> 01:29:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Mr Dennison.</v>

3851
01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.133
<v Speaker 1>He puts it up.</v>

3852
01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I should give the guy credit because he puts it up.</v>

3853
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3854
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Mr Dennison.</v>

3855
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Cool motherfucker.</v>

3856
01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:32.993
<v Speaker 1>He's always doing this,</v>

3857
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.260
<v Speaker 1>but I know somewhere on this thread someone's going to put that picture of that</v>

3858
01:29:37.261 --> 01:29:37.891
<v Speaker 1>hippo chasing.</v>

3859
01:29:37.891 --> 01:29:39.480
<v Speaker 1>That guy is a beautiful thing.</v>

3860
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:41.310
<v Speaker 1>The Internet's a beautiful thing in that respect.</v>

3861
01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3862

3866
01:29:45.601 --> 01:29:46.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>

3867
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:47.640
<v Speaker 3>might've been Mogadishu.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Have you seen those pictures are like the of these guys when they were chasing</v>

<v Speaker 3>Did you remember that shit?</v>

3871
01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:55.520
<v Speaker 3>There was like something going on I think in the,</v>

3872
01:29:55.530 --> 01:29:57.240
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Mogadishu years ago.</v>

3873
01:29:58.090 --> 01:29:58.780
<v Speaker 3>It might've been.</v>

3874
01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:00.000
<v Speaker 3>That might've been there.</v>

3875
01:30:00.001 --> 01:30:00.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3876
01:30:00.211 --> 01:30:01.230
<v Speaker 3>that would be a Rwanda then.</v>

3877
01:30:01.231 --> 01:30:02.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3878
01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:05.030
<v Speaker 3>that's the Tutsis and Hutus or what?</v>

3879
01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:07.170
<v Speaker 3>However you say hotel Rwanda.</v>

3880
01:30:07.171 --> 01:30:10.020
<v Speaker 3>But it's crazy to see human beings chasing each other.</v>

3881
01:30:10.021 --> 01:30:12.270
<v Speaker 3>The dude was like straight up chasing.</v>

3882
01:30:12.271 --> 01:30:13.500
<v Speaker 3>They were chasing this one dude.</v>

3883
01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:16.650
<v Speaker 3>They had machetes in their hands and you sit first,</v>

3884
01:30:16.651 --> 01:30:17.580
<v Speaker 3>first thought is like,</v>

3885
01:30:17.581 --> 01:30:18.361
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

3886
01:30:18.361 --> 01:30:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Second thought is this camera man is not,</v>

3887
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:22.870
<v Speaker 1>he's sitting there going like</v>

3888
01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:24.030
<v Speaker 3>picture of this.</v>

3889
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.920
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3890
01:30:24.921 --> 01:30:25.401
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

3891
01:30:25.401 --> 01:30:25.641
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3892
01:30:25.641 --> 01:30:26.480
<v Speaker 3>I could tell the story.</v>

3893
01:30:26.481 --> 01:30:27.314
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to plug in.</v>

3894
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:29.720
<v Speaker 3>And then the third thing is just that poor guy's like,</v>

3895
01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:30.651
<v Speaker 3>he's going to get,</v>

3896
01:30:30.651 --> 01:30:31.850
<v Speaker 3>they're going to catch him and they're going,</v>

3897
01:30:31.851 --> 01:30:33.380
<v Speaker 3>if I can chop them to pieces.</v>

3898
01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3899
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:34.910
<v Speaker 3>that is crazy.</v>

3900
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:36.500
<v Speaker 3>Human beings are such assholes.</v>

3901
01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:36.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3902
01:30:36.971 --> 01:30:37.940

3905
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:42.411
<v Speaker 1>were talking about,</v>

3906
01:30:42.411 --> 01:30:43.520
<v Speaker 1>the Hutus and the tts.</v>

3910
01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.400

01:30:49.401 --> 01:30:49.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3912
01:30:49.681 --> 01:30:52.460
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things about the horrors of that war is it,</v>

3913
01:30:52.461 --> 01:30:56.220
<v Speaker 1>they would go into a town and kill thousands of people with machetes.</v>

3914
01:30:56.221 --> 01:30:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3915
01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Just chop them up and then they would pollute the river because they were throw</v>

3916
01:31:00.531 --> 01:31:02.180
<v Speaker 1>so many bodies in the river,</v>

3917
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:05.690
<v Speaker 1>but the water from the river road become undrinkable because it was rotten with</v>

3918
01:31:05.691 --> 01:31:06.524
<v Speaker 1>human bodies.</v>

3919

<v Speaker 1>it's a terrifying place in Africa is so fucking wild.</v>

3922
01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:17.020
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking it to this day in 2011 it's probably the wildest place on Earth,</v>

3923
01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:17.893
<v Speaker 1>but just Warren</v>

3924
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:18.451

01:31:19.411 --> 01:31:20.640
<v Speaker 3>they just caught one of these other,</v>

3927
01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:21.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4002
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:06.720
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even know about that song until I saw that movie and Eddie Murphy was</v>

4003
01:33:06.721 --> 01:33:07.411
<v Speaker 5>singing it in the movie.</v>

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I watched that movie now like you know when he goes into the bar,</v>

4014
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:26.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4015
01:33:26.591 --> 01:33:28.270
<v Speaker 3>you best have yourself a black Russian,</v>

4016
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:29.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4017
01:33:29.411 --> 01:33:30.280
<v Speaker 3>like there's a new sheriff,</v>

4018
01:33:30.650 --> 01:33:31.760
<v Speaker 5>their name is Reggie Hammond.</v>

4019
01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:32.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>

4020
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:33.590
<v Speaker 5>it's so great man.</v>

4021
01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:33.951
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

4022
01:33:33.951 --> 01:33:34.671
<v Speaker 5>he was the best.</v>

4023
01:33:34.671 --> 01:33:39.200
<v Speaker 5>No one was a better comedic actor in a movie than Eddie Murphy in my opinion.</v>

4024
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:40.490
<v Speaker 5>48 hours.</v>

4025
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:41.750
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] Nick Naulty,</v>

4026
01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.990
<v Speaker 5>he just took off and it was the right amount of vulnerable,</v>

4027
01:33:44.991 --> 01:33:49.770
<v Speaker 5>the right amount of bad ass and cocky and the right amount of self deprecating.</v>

4028
01:33:49.771 --> 01:33:51.410
<v Speaker 5>And he was like 22 at that point.</v>

4029
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:52.730
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

4030
01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.260
<v Speaker 5>And a killer stand up.</v>

4031
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:55.293
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

4032
01:33:55.610 --> 01:34:00.050
<v Speaker 5>It's almost a shame that he had all this problems with trannies and what have</v>

4033
01:34:00.051 --> 01:34:00.490
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

4034
01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:01.550
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't want to go on stage.</v>

4035
01:34:02.330 --> 01:34:06.050
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't want people to heckle him because God damn at one point in time,</v>

4036
01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.790
<v Speaker 5>if you go back and listen to his shit,</v>

4037
01:34:07.791 --> 01:34:11.780
<v Speaker 5>when he was 19 he was a brilliant comedian and like 19 years old.</v>

4038
01:34:11.781 --> 01:34:12.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4039
01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:12.960
<v Speaker 3>it was very funny actually.</v>

4040
01:34:12.961 --> 01:34:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I rented some like old videos and there was a comment like a national</v>

4041
01:34:16.081 --> 01:34:17.730
<v Speaker 3>competition and they were,</v>

4042
01:34:17.731 --> 01:34:22.731
<v Speaker 3>they showed the top five winners and he was fifth place and everyone had heard</v>

4043
01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:24.550
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

4044
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Then on it,</v>

4045
01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:26.070
<v Speaker 3>they're not allowed to know anyway.</v>

4046
01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:27.013
<v Speaker 5>It's gone.</v>

4047
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:28.710
<v Speaker 5>Well he doesn't even do comedy anymore.</v>

4048
01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.570
<v Speaker 5>That's the weird thing his brother does.</v>

4049
01:34:30.571 --> 01:34:30.841
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4050
01:34:30.841 --> 01:34:33.330
<v Speaker 5>it's like Charlie's out there carrying on the family name.</v>

4051
01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.810
<v Speaker 3>It's funny because when people ask me about how I got into comedy,</v>

4052
01:34:35.811 --> 01:34:37.220
<v Speaker 3>I was in college and I'd like,</v>

4053
01:34:37.221 --> 01:34:39.950
<v Speaker 3>I thought about doing it a few times and I was always intimidated because I had</v>

4054
01:34:39.951 --> 01:34:41.480
<v Speaker 3>done acting in plays,</v>

4055
01:34:41.481 --> 01:34:42.020
<v Speaker 3>but I was on,</v>

4056
01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:44.930
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't limited to get in front of an audience and talk about like my point of</v>

4057
01:34:44.931 --> 01:34:45.171
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>

4058
01:34:45.171 --> 01:34:45.411
<v Speaker 3>It was that,</v>

4059
01:34:45.411 --> 01:34:46.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4060
01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.040
<v Speaker 3>so I was in college and I saw these two guys and there was just horrible.</v>

4061
01:34:49.041 --> 01:34:50.240
<v Speaker 3>It was a comedy competition.</v>

4062
01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.910
<v Speaker 3>And so I told myself the next time there's a competition I'm just going to do</v>

4063
01:34:52.911 --> 01:34:53.420
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

4064
01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:54.081
<v Speaker 3>So I was telling people,</v>

4065
01:34:54.081 --> 01:34:54.411
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

4066
01:34:54.411 --> 01:34:54.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4067
01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.840
<v Speaker 3>you get inspired by greatness and mediocrity.</v>

4068
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:58.430
<v Speaker 3>I was inspired by mediocrity.</v>

4069
01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.960
<v Speaker 3>And the funny thing is I,</v>

4070
01:34:59.961 --> 01:35:01.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like maybe a year,</v>

4071
01:35:01.641 --> 01:35:02.570
<v Speaker 3>year and a half ago,</v>

4072
01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:06.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm at the comedy store and the original room on a Tuesday and I,</v>

4073
01:35:06.481 --> 01:35:10.280
<v Speaker 3>and I just came off like this big tour in Australia where I was like headline in</v>

4074
01:35:10.281 --> 01:35:11.990
<v Speaker 3>front of a lot of people and you know,</v>

4075
01:35:11.991 --> 01:35:12.860
<v Speaker 3>it was like automatic.</v>

4076
01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:13.671
<v Speaker 3>I called on a Monday,</v>

4077
01:35:13.671 --> 01:35:15.200
<v Speaker 3>just gave avails for every night.</v>

4078
01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:17.510
<v Speaker 3>And so I get a Tuesday night show.</v>

4079
01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:19.970
<v Speaker 3>So I go off and it's like the crowds not that great.</v>

4080
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:20.601
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into it.</v>

4081
01:35:20.601 --> 01:35:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4082
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.411
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

4083
01:35:21.411 --> 01:35:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I've just got to get off the road doing,</v>

4084
01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:23.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4085
01:35:23.481 --> 01:35:27.920
<v Speaker 3>thousand people in like an hour 20 and now I've got to do 15 minutes.</v>

4086
01:35:27.921 --> 01:35:29.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to try anything new.</v>

4087
01:35:29.031 --> 01:35:29.271
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4088
01:35:29.271 --> 01:35:30.081
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to be here.</v>

4089
01:35:30.081 --> 01:35:30.291
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4090
01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:31.124
<v Speaker 3>why don't I do this?</v>

4091
01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:32.061
<v Speaker 3>I get on stage,</v>

4092
01:35:32.061 --> 01:35:33.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm just all over the place.</v>

4093
01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:34.670
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's really hidden.</v>

4094
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:36.740
<v Speaker 3>The only person laughing is Johnny's Zap.</v>

4095
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:37.640
<v Speaker 3>You Know Jack is a,</v>

4096
01:35:37.641 --> 01:35:38.390
<v Speaker 3>yeah sure.</v>

4097
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:40.880
<v Speaker 3>And what's funny about Johnny's APP is in the past when I first became a</v>

4098
01:35:40.881 --> 01:35:41.150
<v Speaker 3>regular,</v>

4099
01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:41.721
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store,</v>

4100
01:35:41.721 --> 01:35:42.351
<v Speaker 3>Johnny's App,</v>

4101
01:35:42.351 --> 01:35:46.580
<v Speaker 3>actually I'd like given me like he lost a set one time and like he started</v>

4102
01:35:46.581 --> 01:35:48.770
<v Speaker 3>giving me tags and I didn't know who he was cause he'll tell you,</v>

4103
01:35:48.771 --> 01:35:49.370
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

4104
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:50.930
<v Speaker 3>I was around when Richard Pryor was here,</v>

4105
01:35:50.931 --> 01:35:51.291
<v Speaker 3>this and that.</v>

4106
01:35:51.291 --> 01:35:53.000
<v Speaker 3>So I thought he was like a genius of comedy.</v>

4107
01:35:53.190 --> 01:35:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4108
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:57.890
<v Speaker 3>So he gave me like some tags and quickly I realized it was like no this,</v>

4109
01:35:57.891 --> 01:35:59.960
<v Speaker 3>this is a dude who hangs out and it was crazy.</v>

4110
01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Crazy do the hangs out like you know,</v>

4111
01:36:01.671 --> 01:36:03.800
<v Speaker 3>cause then he started give me the table like these are horrible.</v>

4112
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:07.540
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sitting on stage,</v>

4113
01:36:07.570 --> 01:36:11.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of dying and Zap as the only one laughing and I'm like thank you Johnny</v>

4114
01:36:11.770 --> 01:36:15.400
<v Speaker 3>and a and then I'm getting ready to get off stage and Steve Burns the next comic</v>

4115
01:36:15.401 --> 01:36:19.000
<v Speaker 3>and Steve always like does like a long kind of jokey intro for me.</v>

4116
01:36:19.001 --> 01:36:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Like whenever the WHO's next Mazda Bronnie I don't know who that is.</v>

4117
01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Well whatever this next guy,</v>

4118
01:36:23.171 --> 01:36:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if guys want to watch him and he'll do like that.</v>

4119
01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.360
<v Speaker 3>So I started doing that to Steve and I'm just riffing a little bit and it's just</v>

4120
01:36:28.361 --> 01:36:30.310
<v Speaker 3>getting like this is a very mediocre set.</v>

4121
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:31.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm walking off stage,</v>

4122
01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.130
<v Speaker 3>zap waves me down,</v>

4123
01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.720
<v Speaker 3>it's a Tuesday night and I'm like,</v>

4124
01:36:34.721 --> 01:36:36.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh God zaps got a tag for me.</v>

4125
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:37.331
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

4126
01:36:37.331 --> 01:36:37.810
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

4127
01:36:37.810 --> 01:36:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Murphy's here.</v>

4128
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:41.470
<v Speaker 3>And I thought he was in the main room cause Eddie Murphy is always in the main</v>

4129
01:36:41.471 --> 01:36:41.800
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>

4130
01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:42.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4131
01:36:42.370 --> 01:36:43.570
<v Speaker 3>So I thought he was like,</v>

4132
01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:43.721
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4133
01:36:43.721 --> 01:36:44.351
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know if it in the mirror.</v>

4134
01:36:44.351 --> 01:36:44.621
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4135
01:36:44.621 --> 01:36:45.430
<v Speaker 3>so what?</v>

4136
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:47.410
<v Speaker 3>So I start walking and as I walk in,</v>

4137
01:36:47.411 --> 01:36:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Eddie was,</v>

4138
01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Eddie was sitting the whole set watching my set in Mitzi seat,</v>

4139
01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.040
<v Speaker 3>you know Mitzi seat.</v>

4140
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:54.070
<v Speaker 3>I walked past Eddie.</v>

4141
01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:54.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4142
01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:55.301
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

4143
01:36:55.301 --> 01:36:56.890
<v Speaker 3>I just died in front of my comedy.</v>

4144
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I walked down the steps,</v>

4145
01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:02.190
<v Speaker 3>turn around waiting for my buddy who's coming to get me.</v>

4146
01:37:02.191 --> 01:37:03.450
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go to the laugh factory.</v>

4147
01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Eddie walks down in front of my buddy.</v>

4148
01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:06.780
<v Speaker 3>It gives me the quick little look.</v>

4149
01:37:06.781 --> 01:37:07.501
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't say anything,</v>

4150
01:37:07.501 --> 01:37:08.430
<v Speaker 3>just keep walking.</v>

4151
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

4152
01:37:08.970 --> 01:37:10.110
<v Speaker 3>So in the back of my mind,</v>

4153
01:37:10.111 --> 01:37:11.790
<v Speaker 3>the only saving graces,</v>

4154
01:37:11.791 --> 01:37:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking to myself,</v>

4155
01:37:13.050 --> 01:37:13.261
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4156
01:37:13.261 --> 01:37:14.250
<v Speaker 3>he's going to make a comeback,</v>

4157
01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.460
<v Speaker 3>is going to end up on the tonight show.</v>

4158
01:37:15.461 --> 01:37:15.871
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd be like,</v>

4159
01:37:15.871 --> 01:37:17.040
<v Speaker 3>what inspired you to come back?</v>

4160
01:37:17.041 --> 01:37:17.461
<v Speaker 3>And He'd be like,</v>

4161
01:37:17.461 --> 01:37:17.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4162
01:37:17.611 --> 01:37:19.620
<v Speaker 3>I was watching this mediocre set one time.</v>

4163
01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:22.350
<v Speaker 3>The reason he came back,</v>

4164
01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:24.150
<v Speaker 3>you brought it anywhere.</v>

4165
01:37:24.151 --> 01:37:24.860
<v Speaker 3>If he backs</v>

4166
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:25.730
<v Speaker 1>how I roll man,</v>

4167
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:26.350
<v Speaker 1>that's Volaris.</v>

4168
01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:27.070
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

4169
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about this on the Kevin Smith show about going on stage and you</v>

4170
01:37:30.431 --> 01:37:32.800
<v Speaker 1>know how some guys will just go on stage fearlessly.</v>

4171
01:37:32.801 --> 01:37:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Like Chris Rock would go onstage fearlessly with a batch of new material and</v>

4172
01:37:36.671 --> 01:37:39.730
<v Speaker 1>just hash it out and see what the fuck happens.</v>

4173
01:37:39.731 --> 01:37:40.061
<v Speaker 1>And if it,</v>

4174
01:37:40.061 --> 01:37:41.350
<v Speaker 1>if it comes out it comes out.</v>

4175
01:37:41.351 --> 01:37:42.790
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

4176
01:37:42.850 --> 01:37:44.080
<v Speaker 1>it's so tough to bomb.</v>

4177
01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:47.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a bomb in front of a guy like Eddie Murphy must be just fucking</v>

4178
01:37:47.530 --> 01:37:48.363
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

4179
01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.020
<v Speaker 3>I was just the mean because,</v>

4180
01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:52.360
<v Speaker 3>oh and here's the funny thing was halfway through the set,</v>

4181
01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:53.191
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding,</v>

4182
01:37:53.191 --> 01:37:54.580
<v Speaker 3>was a Tuesday night as I was kind of like,</v>

4183
01:37:54.581 --> 01:37:57.730
<v Speaker 3>cause the whole time I'm going just get it together and get through it and Ma</v>

4184
01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:59.500
<v Speaker 3>and be funny and pat and pardon me,</v>

4185
01:37:59.501 --> 01:37:59.791
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

4186
01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:00.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm all over the place.</v>

4187
01:38:00.631 --> 01:38:03.180
<v Speaker 3>So my head's really not into it and I'm not even like,</v>

4188
01:38:03.181 --> 01:38:04.350
<v Speaker 3>cause sometimes I go up there and just go,</v>

4189
01:38:04.351 --> 01:38:06.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to riff for five minutes for new material.</v>

4190
01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:07.673
<v Speaker 3>I just wasn't,</v>

4191
01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:08.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4192
01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:08.910
<v Speaker 3>the year up there I'm like,</v>

4193
01:38:08.911 --> 01:38:11.700
<v Speaker 3>why do I even put in so halfway through the set I'm like,</v>

4194
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:12.360
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4195
01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.720
<v Speaker 3>get your shit together and make it a good set cause somebody might be in the</v>

4196
01:38:15.721 --> 01:38:16.554
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>

4197
01:38:16.770 --> 01:38:19.860
<v Speaker 3>And I swear to God that the past 12 years I've been there,</v>

4198
01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:21.210
<v Speaker 3>I have never had that thought.</v>

4199
01:38:21.211 --> 01:38:22.380
<v Speaker 3>And I thought to myself,</v>

4200
01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:23.061
<v Speaker 3>and then the,</v>

4201
01:38:23.061 --> 01:38:23.340
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4202
01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:24.061
<v Speaker 3>the other voice,</v>

4203
01:38:24.061 --> 01:38:25.380
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store voice came in my head.</v>

4204
01:38:25.381 --> 01:38:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4205
01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:27.040
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck is going to be in the side?</v>

4206
01:38:27.041 --> 01:38:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4207
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:28.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4208
01:38:28.410 --> 01:38:29.191
<v Speaker 3>and who cares?</v>

4209
01:38:29.191 --> 01:38:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole point of the comedy store is to go with who cares?</v>

4210
01:38:31.921 --> 01:38:32.101
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4211
01:38:32.101 --> 01:38:32.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4212
01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:34.590
<v Speaker 3>and so it was one of those like who cares,</v>

4213
01:38:34.730 --> 01:38:37.950
<v Speaker 3>who's cool give in this audience that has any kind of influence of agent or</v>

4214
01:38:37.951 --> 01:38:38.580
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

4215
01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:39.413
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking Eddie Murphy.</v>

4216
01:38:40.490 --> 01:38:43.070
<v Speaker 1>So don't realize when you talk about the comedy store,</v>

4217
01:38:43.071 --> 01:38:43.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4218
01:38:43.371 --> 01:38:46.010
<v Speaker 1>that's like one of like I used to say when I lived in Boston,</v>

4219
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.903
<v Speaker 1>that was Mecca.</v>

4220
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4221
01:38:47.150 --> 01:38:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I would hear about like Kennison and Richard Pryor and that was the comedy store</v>

4222
01:38:50.721 --> 01:38:51.554
<v Speaker 1>in Hollywood.</v>

4223
01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.870
<v Speaker 1>But then you actually get there and you realize,</v>

4224
01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:53.991
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4225
01:38:53.991 --> 01:38:56.900
<v Speaker 1>this is an insane asylum and no one's watching it.</v>

4226
01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:58.160
<v Speaker 1>No one's paying any attention.</v>

4227
01:38:58.161 --> 01:39:00.770
<v Speaker 1>And then fucking Mike is just turned on at one point in the night and then</v>

4228
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:01.790
<v Speaker 1>there's no host.</v>

4229
01:39:01.791 --> 01:39:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Even now,</v>

4230
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.470
<v Speaker 1>convenience tag team.</v>

4231
01:39:03.471 --> 01:39:03.831
<v Speaker 1>What's this?</v>

4232
01:39:03.831 --> 01:39:05.120
<v Speaker 1>No Club in town that does that,</v>

4233
01:39:05.121 --> 01:39:05.954
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

4234
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:07.970
<v Speaker 1>All the comedians just bring each other up.</v>

4235
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:08.091
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4236
01:39:08.091 --> 01:39:08.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking host,</v>

4237
01:39:08.981 --> 01:39:12.200
<v Speaker 1>like a professional show and the guy will go up and I'll bring people up and</v>

4238
01:39:12.201 --> 01:39:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a little time in between and the give you your intro and get it</v>

4239
01:39:14.781 --> 01:39:15.614
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>

4240
01:39:15.730 --> 01:39:18.290
<v Speaker 1>This is not a fucking get your intro straight at the store.</v>

4241
01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:18.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4242
01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:19.050
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4243
01:39:19.050 --> 01:39:19.231
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4244
01:39:19.231 --> 01:39:19.940
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

4245
01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:21.510
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I'll be honest,</v>

4246
01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:23.070
<v Speaker 3>cause that's where I actually grew as a cop.</v>

4247
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.923
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

4248
01:39:24.010 --> 01:39:25.160
<v Speaker 3>I'd done one year comedy.</v>

4249
01:39:25.170 --> 01:39:25.591
<v Speaker 3>Then it became,</v>

4250
01:39:25.591 --> 01:39:29.940
<v Speaker 3>it became a regular coffee store and it was great because there was no pressure.</v>

4251
01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:31.500
<v Speaker 3>It was like you're going to,</v>

4252
01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I got used to shit crowds.</v>

4253
01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.050
<v Speaker 3>That was what was weird when I started performing the laugh factory and there's</v>

4254
01:39:36.090 --> 01:39:38.040
<v Speaker 3>real crowds and I was like,</v>

4255
01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:38.530
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

4256
01:39:38.530 --> 01:39:41.350
<v Speaker 1>God you're so nice at the Improv with the fuck.</v>

4257
01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:42.473
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

4258
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:47.160
<v Speaker 3>And it's weird seeing guys who started in town and started at one of the clubs</v>

4259
01:39:47.161 --> 01:39:47.941
<v Speaker 3>with audiences.</v>

4260
01:39:47.941 --> 01:39:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I actually saw a couple of comic comics one time I saw this at the laugh factory</v>

4261
01:39:51.331 --> 01:39:53.700
<v Speaker 3>one comic go like oh I'm not going after songs.</v>

4262
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:54.583
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4263
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:55.410
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

4264
01:39:55.410 --> 01:39:56.310
<v Speaker 3>oh that's an option.</v>

4265
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize I an option at the store.</v>

4266
01:39:59.690 --> 01:40:02.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many times did Mitzi shove you on after some killer,</v>

4267
01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:04.820
<v Speaker 1>some Martin Lawrence type character.</v>

4268
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Someone would go up and destroy ego,</v>

4269
01:40:06.981 --> 01:40:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Mars</v>

4270
01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:08.141
<v Speaker 3>and also,</v>

01:40:40.011 --> 01:40:44.390
<v Speaker 3>He does one joke and somehow there was feedback on the mic and he just looks at</v>

4293
01:40:44.391 --> 01:40:45.440
<v Speaker 3>the mic for a second.</v>

4294
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:47.270
<v Speaker 3>They looks at the audience,</v>

4295
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:49.970
<v Speaker 3>he drops the mic and he walks off</v>

4296
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:52.311
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

4297
01:40:52.311 --> 01:40:53.440
<v Speaker 3>and the piano is not there.</v>

4298
01:40:53.441 --> 01:40:54.310
<v Speaker 3>There's no one there,</v>

4299
01:40:54.311 --> 01:40:54.740
<v Speaker 3>no one,</v>

4300
01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:55.181
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

4301
01:40:55.181 --> 01:40:58.300
<v Speaker 3>no one is running the asylum and nobody even said like,</v>

4302
01:40:58.301 --> 01:40:58.840
<v Speaker 3>who's next?</v>

4303
01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.800
<v Speaker 3>It's just dead.</v>

4304
01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:00.970
<v Speaker 3>And the artist is kind of like,</v>

4305
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:01.720
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>

4306
01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:02.310
<v Speaker 3>And no one's there.</v>

4307
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:03.100
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

4308
01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:03.581
<v Speaker 3>I'm next.</v>

4309
01:41:03.581 --> 01:41:04.414
<v Speaker 3>I got to go up.</v>

4310
01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:06.340
<v Speaker 3>So I had to go up on stage and be like,</v>

4311
01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:07.151
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4314
01:41:08.831 --> 01:41:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knew who the fuck I was.</v>

4315
01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:12.850
<v Speaker 3>You know that that just makes you tough.</v>

4316
01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:13.331
<v Speaker 3>You learn,</v>

4317
01:41:13.331 --> 01:41:14.164
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

4318
01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.650
<v Speaker 1>My hardest sats were fallen dice at a bunch of hearts sets,</v>

4319
01:41:17.651 --> 01:41:18.484
<v Speaker 1>fallen dice.</v>

4320
01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.200
<v Speaker 1>How fallen dice fallen.</v>

4321
01:41:20.201 --> 01:41:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Martin Lawrence,</v>

4322
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:23.800
<v Speaker 1>fallen men steelier following fall.</v>

4323
01:41:23.801 --> 01:41:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor when Richard Pryor was still doing stand up.</v>

4324
01:41:26.621 --> 01:41:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

4325
01:41:27.210 --> 01:41:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4326
01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:28.181
<v Speaker 1>those were,</v>

4327
01:41:28.181 --> 01:41:29.080
<v Speaker 1>those were weird times,</v>

4328
01:41:29.081 --> 01:41:30.670
<v Speaker 1>but Mitzi was always real smart about that.</v>

4329
01:41:30.671 --> 01:41:31.720
<v Speaker 1>If she thought you were any good,</v>

4330
01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:33.340
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't going to give you an easy spot.</v>

4331
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:35.350
<v Speaker 1>If she thought you were decent and you had a,</v>

4332
01:41:35.351 --> 01:41:35.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4333
01:41:35.711 --> 01:41:39.100
<v Speaker 1>a spark in you should throw you on in the worst position possible.</v>

4334
01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:39.641
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

4335
01:41:39.641 --> 01:41:40.630
<v Speaker 1>A black show?</v>

4336
01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:41.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4337
01:41:41.171 --> 01:41:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Pulling them on after Amar and Laurie</v>

4338
01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:47.030
<v Speaker 1>and she would think it's funny knowing that you get,</v>

4339
01:41:47.370 --> 01:41:48.510
<v Speaker 3>I think that would be fun.</v>

4340
01:41:48.690 --> 01:41:49.523
<v Speaker 3>I think that would be like,</v>

4341
01:41:49.530 --> 01:41:54.370
<v Speaker 3>like the best challenges that have just being able to try that or it is what?</v>

4342
01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.320
<v Speaker 3>After it's over.</v>

4343
01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4344
01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Well here's the thing.</v>

4345
01:41:57.091 --> 01:42:02.091
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes sometimes it works well if you go in there with like I'm fucked</v>

4346
01:42:02.491 --> 01:42:03.121
<v Speaker 3>mentality.</v>

4347
01:42:03.121 --> 01:42:03.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4348
01:42:03.331 --> 01:42:04.440
<v Speaker 3>If you ride the wave though,</v>

4349
01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:06.660
<v Speaker 3>one time I did one time they were,</v>

4350
01:42:06.661 --> 01:42:08.580
<v Speaker 3>they were doing something in the main room.</v>

4351
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:09.623
<v Speaker 3>It was like a,</v>

4352
01:42:09.670 --> 01:42:13.650
<v Speaker 3>it was the black film festival and they had a comedy show and was supposed to be</v>

4353
01:42:13.651 --> 01:42:14.790
<v Speaker 3>headlined by Eddie Griffin.</v>

4354
01:42:14.850 --> 01:42:19.110
<v Speaker 3>So people had to actually come expecting Eddie and Eddie walked in and saw that</v>

4355
01:42:19.111 --> 01:42:20.550
<v Speaker 3>they'd sold tickets and he's like,</v>

4356
01:42:20.850 --> 01:42:21.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not getting paid or some shit.</v>

4357
01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:23.580
<v Speaker 3>He got upset about something.</v>

4358
01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:24.120
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

4359
01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:24.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going up.</v>

4360
01:42:25.290 --> 01:42:27.690
<v Speaker 3>So then so then someone came to me and they're like,</v>

4361
01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.490
<v Speaker 3>hey we need you to get in there,</v>

4362
01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:31.410
<v Speaker 3>the close out the show.</v>

4363
01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:34.980
<v Speaker 3>So they're expecting to Eddie Griffin and I walk up and it was so funny cause</v>

4364
01:42:34.981 --> 01:42:35.340
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

4365
01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:38.340
<v Speaker 3>everyone just got up and started walking out and like there was like one table</v>

4366
01:42:38.341 --> 01:42:43.000
<v Speaker 3>that hung out and literally like I was so like defeat at the top that I just,</v>

4367
01:42:43.050 --> 01:42:43.830
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4368
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:44.530
<v Speaker 3>thanks for hanging out.</v>

4369
01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:44.791
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

4370
01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:45.550
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm,</v>

4371
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

4372
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:46.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm the,</v>

4373
01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:48.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm the rolling credits at the end of the film.</v>

4374
01:42:48.090 --> 01:42:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I said that's what it feels like for the film fest.</v>

4375
01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:53.280
<v Speaker 3>If it was just leaving and that one table was with me because it was all safe</v>

4376
01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:55.410
<v Speaker 3>self deprecating material because it was like,</v>

4377
01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:55.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4378
01:42:55.921 --> 01:42:56.910
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing here?</v>

4379
01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:57.931
<v Speaker 3>And it was like 15,</v>

4380
01:42:57.931 --> 01:42:58.764
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes of that.</v>

4381
01:42:58.800 --> 01:42:59.940
<v Speaker 3>And you live sometimes though,</v>

4382
01:42:59.941 --> 01:43:03.970
<v Speaker 3>if you go into that situation where it's still kind of a hot crowd and,</v>

4383
01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:08.760
<v Speaker 3>and then you go in and now you got to perform in f and it's like they get,</v>

4384
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:09.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4385
01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.320
<v Speaker 3>they're not laughing and,</v>

4386
01:43:10.410 --> 01:43:12.780
<v Speaker 3>and then you try some crowd work and it's not working.</v>

4387
01:43:13.650 --> 01:43:16.470
<v Speaker 3>I had that on a Mo Betta Mondays if the Improv one time.</v>

4388
01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.720
<v Speaker 3>And it was funny cause I'd gotten good cause I,</v>

4389
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:19.260
<v Speaker 3>cause I did,</v>

4435

<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

4436

4437
01:44:34.881 --> 01:44:36.140
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel confident to pick out,</v>

4441
01:44:39.250 --> 01:44:40.450
<v Speaker 1>bombing and a black crowd is a,</v>

4442
01:44:40.451 --> 01:44:42.970
<v Speaker 1>is really hard too because it's very hard to pull yourself out.</v>

4443
01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4444
01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.093
<v Speaker 1>Once it goes down,</v>

4445
01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:47.590
<v Speaker 1>white crowds will give you some room and Albert Black crowds like next.</v>

01:44:54.491 --> 01:44:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Like they w they didn't want you to recover.</v>

01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:56.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4452
01:44:56.761 --> 01:44:57.250

4454
01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.510
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work and that was it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4468
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also,</v>

4469
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:13.810
<v Speaker 1>it's good to do like a room like that where people don't have any,</v>

4470
01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:14.190
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4475
01:45:17.190 --> 01:45:19.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not the best thing to do all the time,</v>

4476
01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.520
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then it's good as a little reality check.</v>

4477
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:24.030
<v Speaker 1>You Shit better be tight son,</v>

01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:28.480
<v Speaker 1>And the most important thing is what?</v>

4482
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:30.700
<v Speaker 1>The first bit that first bit gotta be strong.</v>

01:45:30.730 --> 01:45:31.563
<v Speaker 1>Oh hell yeah.</v>

4486
01:45:34.451 --> 01:45:37.210
<v Speaker 1>if you don't need to set that bitch up with your personality beforehand.</v>

4492
01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:42.930
<v Speaker 3>cause I remember learning this early on,</v>

01:45:42.931 --> 01:45:45.600
<v Speaker 3>I was like never believed the height because there's sometimes some nights</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4534
01:46:34.011 --> 01:46:34.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4535
01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:37.490
<v Speaker 1>the problem with comedy I've always said is that it's just called comedy and</v>

4536
01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:41.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you never go to a club to see live music and it says live music</v>

4537
01:46:41.541 --> 01:46:43.910
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know if you're going to get a rap band or if you're going to get</v>

4538
01:46:43.911 --> 01:46:46.730
<v Speaker 1>fucking guns and roses or classical music.</v>

4539
01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:48.170
<v Speaker 1>It's very clear.</v>

4540
01:46:48.171 --> 01:46:50.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're going to go to when you go to a blues club again to get</v>

4541
01:46:50.431 --> 01:46:51.001
<v Speaker 1>some blues.</v>

4542
01:46:51.001 --> 01:46:52.890
<v Speaker 1>But when you go to a comedy club,</v>

4543
01:46:52.891 --> 01:46:53.161
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4544
01:46:53.161 --> 01:46:54.030
<v Speaker 1>you can get anything.</v>

4545
01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4546
01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.220
<v Speaker 1>How you could get by as Giovanni,</v>

4547
01:46:56.250 --> 01:46:57.330
<v Speaker 1>you could get Dang cooked,</v>

4548
01:46:57.331 --> 01:46:58.230
<v Speaker 1>you could get this guy,</v>

4549
01:46:58.231 --> 01:46:59.050
<v Speaker 1>you get that guy,</v>

4550
01:46:59.050 --> 01:47:00.360
<v Speaker 1>everyone's got a different taste.</v>

4551
01:47:00.361 --> 01:47:05.361
<v Speaker 1>And some people might love Judas Freelander and some people might hate him and</v>

4552
01:47:06.061 --> 01:47:07.250
<v Speaker 1>love Tracy Morgan.</v>

4553
01:47:07.251 --> 01:47:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

4554
01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:07.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4555
01:47:07.711 --> 01:47:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

4556
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:08.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

4557
01:47:08.610 --> 01:47:10.290
<v Speaker 1>it's all so subjective.</v>

4558
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:10.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4559
01:47:10.861 --> 01:47:12.240
<v Speaker 1>That's got to find your audience.</v>

4560
01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:15.480
<v Speaker 1>And one of the beautiful things about showing up places where it's not your</v>

4561
01:47:15.481 --> 01:47:17.480
<v Speaker 1>audience to showing up on some random night at,</v>

4562
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4563
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:20.520
<v Speaker 1>at the Improv is that you can't stack the deck.</v>

4564
01:47:20.521 --> 01:47:22.890
<v Speaker 1>So you have to make some people laugh that don't even fucking know.</v>

4565
01:47:22.891 --> 01:47:24.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't know know your shit.</v>

4566
01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:28.290
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure now you must get these huge crowds of people who know Mazda,</v>

4567
01:47:28.291 --> 01:47:28.621
<v Speaker 1>Ronnie.</v>

4568
01:47:28.621 --> 01:47:29.800
<v Speaker 1>So they come out to see you.</v>

4569
01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:30.810
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4570
01:47:30.810 --> 01:47:33.020
<v Speaker 1>But I think every now and then you got to go in front of,</v>

4571
01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:34.380
<v Speaker 3>I love actually I love,</v>

4572
01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:35.340
<v Speaker 3>like I always say like,</v>

4573
01:47:35.370 --> 01:47:38.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to be in front of everyone that knows me.</v>

4574
01:47:38.131 --> 01:47:39.750

4584
01:47:48.661 --> 01:47:51.930
<v Speaker 3>one thing that happens with my audience is like what happened was when we first</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4608
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:18.451
<v Speaker 3>Persians,</v>

4609
01:48:18.451 --> 01:48:19.284
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to cost.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I actually,</v>

4614
01:48:23.041 --> 01:48:27.720
<v Speaker 3>what's funny is I like now what I do is if I make a reference to something like,</v>

4615
01:48:27.721 --> 01:48:30.060
<v Speaker 3>like there's a joke I do where I mentioned masturbation,</v>

4616
01:48:30.450 --> 01:48:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I actually make fun of that.</v>

4617
01:48:32.551 --> 01:48:33.720
<v Speaker 3>That's why I love having a mixed audience.</v>

4618
01:48:33.721 --> 01:48:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'll look,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll look at the white guy in the audience.</v>

4620
01:48:35.551 --> 01:48:36.630
<v Speaker 3>I go now,</v>

4621
01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:37.171
<v Speaker 3>Hey Mike,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right now there's a table of Persian is going,</v>

4623
01:48:39.570 --> 01:48:40.410
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

4624
01:48:40.411 --> 01:48:42.260
<v Speaker 3>he said masturbation.</v>

4625
01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:42.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4626
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I brought my mother,</v>

4627
01:48:43.851 --> 01:48:45.440
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't speak English.</v>

4628
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:46.251
<v Speaker 3>Now I have to travel.</v>

4629
01:48:46.251 --> 01:48:47.840
<v Speaker 3>It must've Bishan at the Farsi.</v>

4630
01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:50.120
<v Speaker 3>So riff on what thinking.</v>

4631
01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:54.560
<v Speaker 3>And inevitably there's always like this one table that's dying of laughter.</v>

4632
01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:56.480
<v Speaker 3>And I've had people come up after the show be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was totally true.</v>

4636
01:48:59.570 --> 01:49:00.860
<v Speaker 3>And the mother's totally cool with it.</v>

01:51:43.501 --> 01:51:46.570
<v Speaker 3>They're like negative three with windshield windshield.</v>

4758
01:51:46.571 --> 01:51:48.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like w windshield factor.</v>

4759
01:51:48.041 --> 01:51:48.761
<v Speaker 3>It's you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>negative 15 or even Chicago,</v>

4761
01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:52.390
<v Speaker 3>which is a great city.</v>

4762
01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 3>But in December it's a mother fucker.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And the beauty of La,</v>

4767
01:51:56.411 --> 01:51:58.690
<v Speaker 3>I always say the great thing about La is it's so close to such,</v>

4768
01:51:58.780 --> 01:51:59.221
<v Speaker 3>so many great.</v>

4770
01:52:00.521 --> 01:52:01.690
<v Speaker 3>so I love going up to the bay.</v>

4771
01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:02.890
<v Speaker 3>You go to Santa Barbara,</v>

4772
01:52:02.891 --> 01:52:03.521
<v Speaker 3>you go to Vegas,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you go to s,</v>

4774
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:05.110
<v Speaker 3>you know San Diego,</v>

4775
01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:06.280
<v Speaker 3>everything's close by.</v>

4776
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4777
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:07.930
<v Speaker 3>La is an amazing city.</v>

4778
01:52:07.931 --> 01:52:08.980
<v Speaker 3>It's just overpopulated.</v>

4779
01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4780
01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:09.780
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

4781
01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.170
<v Speaker 3>if we didn't live in la though,</v>

4782
01:52:11.171 --> 01:52:12.790
<v Speaker 3>it probably so much more enticing.</v>

4783
01:52:12.791 --> 01:52:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I would say that like when I'm driving around,</v>

4784
01:52:14.471 --> 01:52:14.681
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

4785
01:52:14.681 --> 01:52:16.000
<v Speaker 3>if I wasn't a live here,</v>

4786
01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:17.260
<v Speaker 3>I probably appreciate this more.</v>

4787
01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:18.341
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably like,</v>

4788
01:52:18.341 --> 01:52:18.641
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

4789
01:52:18.641 --> 01:52:20.590
<v Speaker 3>what an incredible place I should live in La.</v>

4790
01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:21.860
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

4791
01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:22.250
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

4792
01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:25.300
<v Speaker 3>a great amount of shitheads in this city,</v>

4793
01:52:25.301 --> 01:52:26.670
<v Speaker 3>but it's just because the numbers,</v>

4794
01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:27.820
<v Speaker 3>the numbers are so high.</v>

4795
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:28.411
<v Speaker 3>But I mean the,</v>

4796
01:52:28.411 --> 01:52:28.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4797
01:52:28.571 --> 01:52:29.291
<v Speaker 3>what is funny?</v>

4798
01:52:29.291 --> 01:52:29.501
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4799
01:52:29.501 --> 01:52:30.490
<v Speaker 3>like whenever I go to New York,</v>

4800
01:52:30.491 --> 01:52:31.810
<v Speaker 3>I love New York in terms of like,</v>

4801
01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:33.100
<v Speaker 3>it's like a playground for adults.</v>

4802
01:52:33.101 --> 01:52:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Like you just jumped in a cab to go to the next restaurant,</v>

4803
01:52:34.991 --> 01:52:35.771
<v Speaker 3>you go to the next club,</v>

4804

4805
01:52:35.981 --> 01:52:36.850
<v Speaker 3>what are you going all night?</v>

4806
01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:38.470
<v Speaker 3>You want to live there?</v>

4807
01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:39.360
<v Speaker 3>I would want to know.</v>

4808
01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:39.971
<v Speaker 3>Well I actually,</v>

4809
01:52:39.971 --> 01:52:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I'd always thought I wanted to live there and then I did two projects out there</v>

4810
01:52:43.791 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>where I was there for four months at a and</v>

4811
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.850
<v Speaker 5>it was like I got an apartment at the corner of Houseton six which is like the</v>

4812
01:52:49.851 --> 01:52:50.870
<v Speaker 5>heart of the village.</v>

4813
01:52:50.871 --> 01:52:51.111
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4814
01:52:51.111 --> 01:52:56.111
<v Speaker 5>this is the best place dude from 7:00 AM till 3:00 AM every day.</v>

4815
01:52:56.331 --> 01:52:57.860
<v Speaker 5>It was like noise outside.</v>

4816
01:52:57.861 --> 01:53:00.400
<v Speaker 5>It was just so like cars punking and and,</v>

4817
01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:01.820
<v Speaker 5>and construction.</v>

4818
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:02.654
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

4819
01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:03.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4820
01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.010
<v Speaker 5>New York I think is good.</v>

4821
01:53:04.011 --> 01:53:07.520
<v Speaker 5>If you're in your 20s and you got your buddies and you're all making some money</v>

4822
01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:09.170
<v Speaker 5>and you just want to run around,</v>

4823
01:53:09.171 --> 01:53:11.540
<v Speaker 5>like I guess the ratio of women to men is like this.</v>

4824
01:53:11.541 --> 01:53:12.080
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't,</v>

4825
01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:12.380
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

4826
01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:14.450
<v Speaker 5>it's like 55 to 45 or so.</v>

4827
01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:15.720
<v Speaker 5>A lot more women than men.</v>

4828
01:53:15.721 --> 01:53:17.480
<v Speaker 5>And there's a lot of models walking around New York.</v>

4829
01:53:18.450 --> 01:53:19.440
<v Speaker 5>How about you?</v>

4830
01:53:19.450 --> 01:53:23.690
<v Speaker 5>So if I had like beaucoup Howard stern type co cashflow,</v>

4831
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:24.900
<v Speaker 5>I would be into live in,</v>

4832
01:53:24.930 --> 01:53:25.190
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

4833
01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:26.170
<v Speaker 5>in New England.</v>

4834
01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:30.350
<v Speaker 5>I did Manhattan like with some sort of a apartment that overlooks like central</v>

4835
01:53:30.351 --> 01:53:31.640
<v Speaker 5>park or something like that.</v>

4836
01:53:31.890 --> 01:53:33.350
<v Speaker 5>If you've got like Madonna money,</v>

4837
01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:38.210
<v Speaker 5>get some one of those crazy $20 million apartments because I've seen some</v>

4838
01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:38.691
<v Speaker 5>online,</v>

4839
01:53:38.691 --> 01:53:40.820
<v Speaker 5>some people put some up on my message board as well.</v>

4840
01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:41.300
<v Speaker 5>And they,</v>

4841
01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:43.700
<v Speaker 5>there was a one that had like a corner building.</v>

4842
01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:44.840
<v Speaker 5>It was a corner,</v>

4843
01:53:44.841 --> 01:53:47.750
<v Speaker 5>a apartment with insane views of the city.</v>

4844
01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:53.050
<v Speaker 5>That's some of the most beautiful things when you look at like a real city scape</v>

4845
01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:54.620
<v Speaker 5>and it's lit at night.</v>

4846
01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:54.931
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

4847
01:53:54.931 --> 01:53:55.151
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

4848
01:53:55.151 --> 01:53:56.210
<v Speaker 5>What a fucking amazing,</v>

4849
01:53:56.211 --> 01:53:58.190
<v Speaker 5>I just think that the numbers of people,</v>

4850
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:59.840
<v Speaker 5>when you're in a place like Manhattan,</v>

4851
01:54:00.250 --> 01:54:00.410
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4852
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:01.940
<v Speaker 5>all the influence they have over you,</v>

4853
01:54:01.941 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 5>all the people around you all the time.</v>

4854
01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:06.080
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think you can have real piece there.</v>

4855
01:54:06.081 --> 01:54:06.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you can relax.</v>

4856
01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:08.740
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what's crazy is when I was living there,</v>

4857
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5053
01:58:18.781 --> 01:58:20.280
<v Speaker 3>that means no local politics.</v>

5054
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:23.430
<v Speaker 3>And thank God I don't know much about the local politics and I'm not about to</v>

5067
01:58:32.251 --> 01:58:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I used to make fun of the president,</v>

5068
01:58:33.181 --> 01:58:33.451
<v Speaker 3>Iran.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They love that.</v>

5075
01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:44.860
<v Speaker 3>How close is the government of Iran to being overthrown?</v>

5076
01:58:45.610 --> 01:58:46.000
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5077
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:46.870
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough call,</v>

5078
01:58:46.871 --> 01:58:47.111
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5079
01:58:47.111 --> 01:58:47.291
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5080
01:58:47.291 --> 01:58:49.360
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because there's like,</v>

5081
01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

5082
01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:50.171
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5083
01:58:50.171 --> 01:58:50.830
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5084
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:51.910
<v Speaker 3>I love politics anyway,</v>

5085
01:58:51.911 --> 01:58:53.170
<v Speaker 3>so I read up on it a lot,</v>

5086
01:58:53.171 --> 01:58:53.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5087
01:58:53.411 --> 01:58:53.631
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

5088
01:58:53.631 --> 01:58:56.980
<v Speaker 3>and there's so many different analysts and it's like what it is is in Iran right</v>

5089
01:58:56.981 --> 01:58:58.450
<v Speaker 3>now it's over 75,</v>

5090
01:58:58.451 --> 01:58:59.530
<v Speaker 3>maybe 80 million people.</v>

5091
01:58:59.531 --> 01:59:01.450
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of young people like,</v>

5092
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5093
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:02.860
<v Speaker 3>like a majority of young.</v>

5094
01:59:02.861 --> 01:59:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5095
01:59:03.170 --> 01:59:05.330
<v Speaker 1>they have the Internet and they want a modern way of life.</v>

5096
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5097
01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:06.831
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is,</v>

5098
01:59:06.831 --> 01:59:07.880
<v Speaker 3>and somebody pointed this out,</v>

5099
01:59:07.881 --> 01:59:10.880
<v Speaker 3>they were saying when the Iranian revolution happened under the Shah,</v>

5100
01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:15.620
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the people that were in [inaudible] leadership position under the Shah</v>

5101
01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:17.150
<v Speaker 3>had been western educated.</v>

5102
01:59:17.210 --> 01:59:18.140
<v Speaker 3>And this guy made a good point.</v>

5103
01:59:18.141 --> 01:59:18.351
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

5104
01:59:18.351 --> 01:59:19.880
<v Speaker 3>so when the revolution happened,</v>

5105
01:59:20.150 --> 01:59:21.260
<v Speaker 3>they had the money and they're like,</v>

5106
01:59:21.261 --> 01:59:21.741
<v Speaker 3>screw it,</v>

5107
01:59:21.741 --> 01:59:22.221
<v Speaker 3>we're outta here.</v>

5108
01:59:22.221 --> 01:59:23.031
<v Speaker 3>They went to France,</v>

5109
01:59:23.031 --> 01:59:23.781
<v Speaker 3>they went to London,</v>

5110
01:59:23.781 --> 01:59:24.800
<v Speaker 3>they came to America,</v>

5111
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:25.761
<v Speaker 3>live their life.</v>

5112
01:59:25.761 --> 01:59:26.594
<v Speaker 3>They're all good.</v>

5113
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:30.470
<v Speaker 3>The people that are running the country now are not western educated.</v>

5114
01:59:30.471 --> 01:59:32.240
<v Speaker 3>They've been part of this revolution,</v>

5115
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5116
01:59:32.590 --> 01:59:34.090
<v Speaker 3>79 and they,</v>

5117
01:59:34.091 --> 01:59:34.281
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

5118
01:59:34.281 --> 01:59:34.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5119
01:59:34.521 --> 01:59:35.630
<v Speaker 3>so they got nowhere to go.</v>

5120
01:59:35.850 --> 01:59:36.780
<v Speaker 1>And when the,</v>

5121
01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:38.940
<v Speaker 1>when the ayatollah took over,</v>

5122
01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:40.440
<v Speaker 1>that was all us backed.</v>

5123
01:59:40.441 --> 01:59:40.741
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5124
01:59:40.741 --> 01:59:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Like there was an issue with the Shah when the United States,</v>

5125
01:59:43.741 --> 01:59:45.060
<v Speaker 1>was that a disagreement with the Shah.</v>

5126
01:59:45.061 --> 01:59:48.000
<v Speaker 1>So they backed the ayatollah and got him conspiracy</v>

5127
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:48.900
<v Speaker 3>theories and the sort.</v>

5128
01:59:48.901 --> 01:59:49.441
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>

5129
01:59:49.441 --> 01:59:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean a big part of it,</v>

5130
01:59:50.491 --> 01:59:54.030
<v Speaker 3>you could go back and trace it to actually a movement happening.</v>

5131
01:59:54.031 --> 01:59:57.060
<v Speaker 3>That was an internal movement because what happened was the Shah,</v>

5132
01:59:57.061 --> 01:59:57.240
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

5133
01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:58.890
<v Speaker 3>The Shaw Westernize the country a lot,</v>

5134
01:59:59.250 --> 01:59:59.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5135
01:59:59.640 --> 01:59:59.850
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

5136
01:59:59.850 --> 02:00:00.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

5137
02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:02.250
<v Speaker 3>and had a lot of progress for the country.</v>

5138
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5139
02:00:02.910 --> 02:00:03.743
<v Speaker 3>nonetheless,</v>

5140
02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:04.490
<v Speaker 3>under the Shah,</v>

5141
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:06.480
<v Speaker 3>like as under any dictator in,</v>

5142
02:00:06.481 --> 02:00:07.320
<v Speaker 3>in the Middle East,</v>

5143
02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.630
<v Speaker 3>there was still a lot of people being persecuted.</v>

5144
02:00:09.631 --> 02:00:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Like opposition was not looked,</v>

5145
02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:11.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5146
02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:13.440
<v Speaker 3>it was frowned upon and you would have like these like,</v>

5147
02:00:13.441 --> 02:00:14.730
<v Speaker 3>and you had different parties,</v>

5148
02:00:14.731 --> 02:00:16.620
<v Speaker 3>you had like hit the monarchists,</v>

5149
02:00:16.770 --> 02:00:18.390
<v Speaker 3>then you had like the nationalists,</v>

5150
02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:21.060
<v Speaker 3>then you had the socialists and the communists and you had the,</v>

5151
02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:21.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5152
02:00:21.481 --> 02:00:22.261
<v Speaker 3>the religious,</v>

5153
02:00:22.261 --> 02:00:22.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5154
02:00:22.441 --> 02:00:23.160
<v Speaker 3>the Islamicists.</v>

5155
02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:26.790
<v Speaker 3>So you had all these different parties and anytime anyone would say anything or</v>

5156
02:00:26.791 --> 02:00:28.230
<v Speaker 3>criticize the Shah,</v>

5157
02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:30.090
<v Speaker 3>like some dude would disappear.</v>

5158
02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:30.331
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5159
02:00:30.331 --> 02:00:30.870
<v Speaker 3>they had,</v>

5160
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:31.051
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5161
02:00:31.051 --> 02:00:31.890
<v Speaker 3>there was the Savak,</v>

5162
02:00:31.891 --> 02:00:33.180
<v Speaker 3>which was the secret police.</v>

5163
02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:37.560
<v Speaker 3>So there's all kinds of like intellectuals that would like criticize them and</v>

5164
02:00:37.561 --> 02:00:38.394
<v Speaker 3>disappear.</v>

5165
02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5166
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:40.590
<v Speaker 3>and so there was,</v>

5167
02:00:40.591 --> 02:00:41.430
<v Speaker 3>there was that going on.</v>

5168
02:00:41.431 --> 02:00:42.510
<v Speaker 3>And so eventually what happened,</v>

5169
02:00:42.511 --> 02:00:45.810
<v Speaker 3>like the Khomeini's history goes that he was actually exiled.</v>

5170
02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:47.040
<v Speaker 3>I lucky I said that by the way,</v>

5171
02:00:47.130 --> 02:00:48.730
<v Speaker 3>was the homie Romania,</v>

5172
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.863
<v Speaker 3>Romania.</v>

5173
02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5174
02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:52.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get my son to learn Farsi.</v>

5175
02:00:52.291 --> 02:00:53.011
<v Speaker 3>It's the funniest thing.</v>

5176
02:00:53.011 --> 02:00:53.641
<v Speaker 3>Seen this kid.</v>

5177
02:00:53.641 --> 02:00:55.230
<v Speaker 3>He's got like an American accent already and he's like,</v>

5178
02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:55.880
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5179
02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:56.251
<v Speaker 3>he's three.</v>

5180
02:00:56.251 --> 02:00:56.551
<v Speaker 3>He'll be like,</v>

5181
02:00:56.551 --> 02:00:56.820
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

5182
02:00:56.820 --> 02:00:56.881
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

5183
02:00:56.881 --> 02:00:57.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5184
02:00:57.150 --> 02:00:57.983
<v Speaker 3>he fucks it up.</v>

5185
02:00:58.560 --> 02:00:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

5186
02:00:59.100 --> 02:00:59.671
<v Speaker 3>so he,</v>

5187
02:00:59.671 --> 02:01:00.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5188
02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:02.160
<v Speaker 3>Khomeini had been exiled to Iraq,</v>

5189
02:01:02.670 --> 02:01:03.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5190
02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:04.200
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

5191
02:01:04.201 --> 02:01:08.160
<v Speaker 3>and he was getting back then it was kinda like the Twitter of today.</v>

5192
02:01:08.370 --> 02:01:08.820
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

5193
02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:09.481
<v Speaker 3>he would sneak,</v>

5194
02:01:09.481 --> 02:01:13.560
<v Speaker 3>he would sneak his sermons back into Iran with tape cassettes.</v>

5195
02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:16.260
<v Speaker 3>So all these other religious guys,</v>

5196
02:01:16.261 --> 02:01:16.501
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

5197
02:01:16.501 --> 02:01:16.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

5198
02:01:16.830 --> 02:01:18.120
<v Speaker 3>there's a city named comb,</v>

5199
02:01:18.121 --> 02:01:19.920
<v Speaker 3>which is a religious city in Iran.</v>

5200
02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:23.850
<v Speaker 3>They were all getting like his sermons and he was criticizing the Shah from</v>

5201
02:01:23.851 --> 02:01:24.990
<v Speaker 3>outside of Iran.</v>

5202
02:01:24.991 --> 02:01:26.190
<v Speaker 3>You can do that from outside,</v>

5203
02:01:26.191 --> 02:01:28.740
<v Speaker 3>but you can't do it from inside Susan from outside.</v>

5204
02:01:29.010 --> 02:01:32.730
<v Speaker 3>And basically what happened was there was all these different oppositions to the</v>

5205
02:01:32.731 --> 02:01:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Shah and discontent was growing and protests were growing.</v>

5206
02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:38.670
<v Speaker 3>And so these guys all kind of banded together.</v>

5207
02:01:38.671 --> 02:01:39.411
<v Speaker 3>And what they do is,</v>

5208
02:01:39.411 --> 02:01:42.020
<v Speaker 3>it's very similar to the protests that were happening during the green movement</v>

5209
02:01:42.021 --> 02:01:44.750
<v Speaker 3>of 2009 where people would be out protesting and then,</v>

5210
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.680
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

5211
02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:45.951
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5212
02:01:45.951 --> 02:01:48.500
<v Speaker 3>the government was shooting to the crowds and kill some people.</v>

5213
02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:49.580
<v Speaker 3>And in the,</v>

5214
02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:51.380
<v Speaker 3>in the Muslim Shiite religion,</v>

5215
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:55.310
<v Speaker 3>like once someone's killed like something like seven days after some of these</v>

5216
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.311
<v Speaker 3>like a morning day,</v>

5217
02:01:55.311 --> 02:01:55.461
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5218
02:01:55.461 --> 02:01:56.660
<v Speaker 3>so they all go out and they mourn.</v>

5219
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:58.370
<v Speaker 3>So these guys would be morning and the,</v>

5220
02:01:58.430 --> 02:02:02.870
<v Speaker 3>and the Shah's police would show up and shoot some more and it just grew and</v>

5221
02:02:02.871 --> 02:02:03.411
<v Speaker 3>grew and grew.</v>

5222
02:02:03.411 --> 02:02:05.090
<v Speaker 3>So the protests were originally like,</v>

5223
02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:06.283
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5224
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:07.310
<v Speaker 3>one faction,</v>

5225
02:02:07.610 --> 02:02:09.560
<v Speaker 3>but then it became more factions and then you,</v>

5226
02:02:09.650 --> 02:02:13.520
<v Speaker 3>then you got to a point where you had like lawyers and doctors protesting in the</v>

5227
02:02:13.521 --> 02:02:14.450
<v Speaker 3>streets of Iran,</v>

5228
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:16.520
<v Speaker 3>like people that should be supporting the regime.</v>

5229
02:02:16.700 --> 02:02:17.960
<v Speaker 3>And then you had the Bazaaris,</v>

5230
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.591
<v Speaker 3>they run the,</v>

5231
02:02:18.591 --> 02:02:19.950
<v Speaker 3>the bazaar is like the,</v>

5232
02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:21.020
<v Speaker 3>the economy.</v>

5233
02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:23.000
<v Speaker 3>These guys shut down the economy,</v>

5234
02:02:23.150 --> 02:02:24.710
<v Speaker 3>the oil company went on strike.</v>

5235
02:02:24.711 --> 02:02:27.170
<v Speaker 3>So all this shit came together and then,</v>

5236
02:02:27.171 --> 02:02:29.210
<v Speaker 3>and then it costs with the revolution to happen.</v>

5237
02:02:29.211 --> 02:02:31.460
<v Speaker 3>And I have a friend of mine who was young back then.</v>

5238
02:02:31.461 --> 02:02:32.570
<v Speaker 3>He said what was interesting,</v>

5239
02:02:32.571 --> 02:02:35.000
<v Speaker 3>he goes like when the Shah left,</v>

5240
02:02:35.001 --> 02:02:35.331
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

5241
02:02:35.331 --> 02:02:37.610
<v Speaker 3>for the first few days in Iran,</v>

5242
02:02:37.611 --> 02:02:39.710
<v Speaker 3>it was total euphoria cause everyone was like,</v>

5243
02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:41.720
<v Speaker 3>we got rid of America,</v>

5244
02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:43.820
<v Speaker 3>we got rid of the this influence.</v>

5245
02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:44.661
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

5246
02:02:44.661 --> 02:02:47.450
<v Speaker 3>what was weird though was cause cause for the protests,</v>

5247
02:02:47.451 --> 02:02:48.860
<v Speaker 3>all these factions were working together.</v>

5248
02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:49.970
<v Speaker 3>He goes now,</v>

5249
02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:51.110
<v Speaker 3>like one guy would be like,</v>

5250
02:02:51.111 --> 02:02:51.231
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

5251
02:02:51.231 --> 02:02:52.070
<v Speaker 3>we did it brother.</v>

5252
02:02:52.071 --> 02:02:52.731
<v Speaker 3>And the other guy would be like,</v>

5253
02:02:52.731 --> 02:02:52.911
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5254
02:02:52.911 --> 02:02:53.481
<v Speaker 3>we did do it.</v>

5255
02:02:53.481 --> 02:02:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Comrade.</v>

5256
02:02:54.230 --> 02:02:54.591
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>

5257
02:02:54.591 --> 02:02:55.760
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute brother,</v>

5258
02:02:55.761 --> 02:02:56.410
<v Speaker 3>he's a Muslim,</v>

5259
02:02:56.410 --> 02:02:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Islam is Conrad.</v>

5260
02:02:57.711 --> 02:02:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm a communist.</v>

5261
02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:01.770
<v Speaker 3>And then they would start turning on each other and then the shift start</v>

5262
02:03:01.771 --> 02:03:02.541
<v Speaker 3>attorney and then,</v>

5263
02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:05.360
<v Speaker 3>and then the Islam is took over and now we're in the shit we're in.</v>

5264
02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:06.770
<v Speaker 3>But all that stuff,</v>

5265
02:03:06.771 --> 02:03:07.371
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

5266
02:03:07.371 --> 02:03:07.980
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

5267
02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:09.950
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of people have talked about this,</v>

5268
02:03:10.190 --> 02:03:11.690
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this stuff did happen.</v>

5269
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5270
02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:13.670
<v Speaker 3>like in 53,</v>

5271
02:03:13.671 --> 02:03:15.800
<v Speaker 3>there was a democratically elected government,</v>

5272
02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:16.101
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5273
02:03:16.101 --> 02:03:16.341
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5274
02:03:16.341 --> 02:03:17.810
<v Speaker 3>the guy was named Mosad debt.</v>

5275
02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.190
<v Speaker 3>And the US,</v>

5276
02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:19.521
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

5277
02:03:19.521 --> 02:03:23.600
<v Speaker 3>the CIA has written their story of how they did a coup d'etat of the</v>

5278
02:03:23.601 --> 02:03:25.940
<v Speaker 3>democratically elected leader in Iran.</v>

5279
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:28.250
<v Speaker 3>They overthrew him and put the Shah in.</v>

5280
02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:30.440
<v Speaker 3>And so like whenever any American,</v>

5281
02:03:30.441 --> 02:03:32.450
<v Speaker 3>like whenever we talk about wars and stuff and they're like,</v>

5282
02:03:32.451 --> 02:03:33.590
<v Speaker 3>we're just trying to bring democracy.</v>

5283
02:03:33.591 --> 02:03:33.861
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5284
02:03:33.861 --> 02:03:34.311
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>

5285
02:03:34.311 --> 02:03:36.710
<v Speaker 3>they was democracy and we overthrew it.</v>

5286
02:03:36.711 --> 02:03:37.910
<v Speaker 3>You've got to read your history.</v>

5287
02:03:38.590 --> 02:03:39.423
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5288
02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:43.220
<v Speaker 3>it's a fascinating time that we live in when people talk about going to war with</v>

5289
02:03:43.221 --> 02:03:44.054
<v Speaker 3>Iran too,</v>

5290
02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:44.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5291
02:03:44.481 --> 02:03:46.040
<v Speaker 3>when they're talking about disarming them,</v>

5292
02:03:46.041 --> 02:03:48.080
<v Speaker 3>if they continue with their nuclear program.</v>

5293
02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

5294
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:49.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

5295
02:03:49.730 --> 02:03:50.511
<v Speaker 3>Strange Times,</v>

5296
02:03:50.511 --> 02:03:51.170
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

5297
02:03:51.170 --> 02:03:51.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5298
02:03:51.321 --> 02:03:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Well Israel is like,</v>

5299
02:03:52.371 --> 02:03:52.611
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5300
02:03:52.611 --> 02:03:53.090
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

5301
02:03:53.090 --> 02:03:53.660
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

5302
02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:54.381
<v Speaker 3>they say like,</v>

5303
02:03:54.381 --> 02:03:55.011
<v Speaker 3>if these guys get,</v>

5304
02:03:55.011 --> 02:03:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Israelis did that to the Iraqi,</v>

5305
02:03:57.140 --> 02:03:57.561
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5306
02:03:57.561 --> 02:03:58.394
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5307
02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:02.530
<v Speaker 3>to one of the Iraqi facilities back in the day where they infiltrate in a,</v>

5308
02:04:02.531 --> 02:04:02.870
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

5309
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:03.770
<v Speaker 3>in a bombed it.</v>

5310
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:05.203
<v Speaker 3>But I guess,</v>

5311
02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:05.790
<v Speaker 3>do you ever,</v>

5312
02:04:05.790 --> 02:04:07.790

02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I think he's like a British name.</v>

5316
02:04:11.031 --> 02:04:11.830
<v Speaker 3>He's a pretty champion.</v>

5319
02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:17.450
<v Speaker 3>he's actually very well educated and he'd make some good arguments and he's,</v>

5320
02:04:17.451 --> 02:04:18.290
<v Speaker 3>and it's almost like,</v>

5321
02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:19.430
<v Speaker 3>it's funny how he,</v>

5355
02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:55.021

5364
02:05:04.471 --> 02:05:06.120
<v Speaker 3>He did a thing where it was,</v>

5365
02:05:06.121 --> 02:05:08.670
<v Speaker 3>it was around the time when Israel and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and the Lebanese were fighting like a few years ago.</v>

5378
02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:25.260
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

5379
02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:25.501

<v Speaker 3>Duh Duh.</v>

5384
02:05:28.921 --> 02:05:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Of course I would expect it to sky news owned by Rupert Murdoch.</v>

5385
02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:32.400
<v Speaker 3>He just goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it just cuts into it.</v>

5387
02:05:33.131 --> 02:05:33.630
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

5388
02:05:33.630 --> 02:05:34.081

<v Speaker 3>And he just goes into it and you see this like blonde girl.</v>

02:05:39.211 --> 02:05:40.044
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

<v Speaker 5>could you answer the question and is he an Irish guy?</v>

5395
02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:43.033
<v Speaker 5>I think he's Irish.</v>

5396
02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:44.670
<v Speaker 5>I have heard this guy.</v>

5397
02:05:44.671 --> 02:05:45.690
<v Speaker 5>The dude is like,</v>

5398
02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:46.590
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to arguing,</v>

5399
02:05:46.591 --> 02:05:47.011
<v Speaker 5>he's pretty,</v>

5400
02:05:47.011 --> 02:05:49.260
<v Speaker 5>he's a pretty bad mother fucker when it comes to arguing.</v>

5401
02:05:49.290 --> 02:05:49.441
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5402
02:05:49.441 --> 02:05:50.810
<v Speaker 5>I'll check out some of his stuff on.</v>

5403
02:05:50.830 --> 02:05:51.001
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

5404
02:05:51.001 --> 02:05:51.201
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

5405
02:05:51.201 --> 02:05:52.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm fascinated by the Middle East,</v>

5406
02:05:52.591 --> 02:05:54.930
<v Speaker 5>especially right now because we're at such a strange time,</v>

5407
02:05:55.170 --> 02:05:55.381
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5408
02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:56.460
<v Speaker 5>with the Internet and you know,</v>

5409
02:05:56.490 --> 02:06:01.490
<v Speaker 5>they're using Facebook to organize and basically overthrow government after</v>

5410
02:06:02.551 --> 02:06:05.460
<v Speaker 5>government and then they keep toppling one after the other.</v>

5411
02:06:05.461 --> 02:06:05.850
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

5412
02:06:05.850 --> 02:06:07.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm curious as to what we're actually seeing.</v>

5413
02:06:07.490 --> 02:06:07.731
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5414
02:06:07.731 --> 02:06:08.481
<v Speaker 3>the problem is,</v>

5415
02:06:08.481 --> 02:06:08.731
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5416
02:06:08.731 --> 02:06:10.520
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because if you talk to a lot of Iranians,</v>

5417
02:06:10.521 --> 02:06:11.061
<v Speaker 3>we always say like,</v>

5418
02:06:11.061 --> 02:06:11.511
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

5419
02:06:11.511 --> 02:06:12.500
<v Speaker 3>like what happened,</v>

5420
02:06:12.501 --> 02:06:13.280
<v Speaker 3>what happened in Egypt?</v>

5421
02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:15.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like it was a positive step in the right direction.</v>

5422
02:06:15.951 --> 02:06:16.784
<v Speaker 3>But the question is,</v>

5423
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:18.440
<v Speaker 3>talk to me six months from now,</v>

5424
02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:20.430
<v Speaker 5>talking about a year from now because we'll be,</v>

5425
02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:20.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5426
02:06:20.970 --> 02:06:23.980
<v Speaker 5>well the people that are alive today even benefit from it or does that make</v>

5427
02:06:23.981 --> 02:06:24.910
<v Speaker 5>their life shittier?</v>

5428
02:06:24.911 --> 02:06:27.550
<v Speaker 5>And then the next generation benefits the worlds.</v>

5429
02:06:27.551 --> 02:06:29.290
<v Speaker 5>And I'm a fucking turmoil right now.</v>

5430
02:06:29.291 --> 02:06:30.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand it.</v>

5431
02:06:30.221 --> 02:06:31.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand economics.</v>

5432
02:06:31.631 --> 02:06:33.680
<v Speaker 5>When people start talking about economic meltdowns,</v>

5433
02:06:33.710 --> 02:06:34.840
<v Speaker 5>it's to me,</v>

5434
02:06:35.230 --> 02:06:36.011
<v Speaker 5>the way I look at it,</v>

5435
02:06:36.011 --> 02:06:36.640
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

5436
02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:37.361
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the day,</v>

5437
02:06:37.361 --> 02:06:38.410
<v Speaker 5>there's the same amount of shit.</v>

5438
02:06:38.411 --> 02:06:39.430
<v Speaker 5>And there's the same amount of people.</v>

5439
02:06:39.431 --> 02:06:40.420
<v Speaker 5>So what the fuck went wrong?</v>

5440
02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:40.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5441
02:06:40.650 --> 02:06:44.410
<v Speaker 5>we were living like kings just to a couple of years ago and now everybody's</v>

5442
02:06:44.411 --> 02:06:46.930
<v Speaker 5>fucking in the shitter because of what?</v>

5443
02:06:46.931 --> 02:06:48.950
<v Speaker 5>Because of an inflated economy and like what?</v>

5444
02:06:49.230 --> 02:06:49.840
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>

5445
02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:52.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm part of the things that I'm starting to see that that makes some sense to me</v>

5446
02:06:52.451 --> 02:06:52.810
<v Speaker 5>cause he right.</v>

5447
02:06:52.810 --> 02:06:54.550
<v Speaker 5>I I a lot of times get lost in it all too.</v>

5448
02:06:54.551 --> 02:06:56.590
<v Speaker 5>But some of the things that started making sense is when they talked to start</v>

5449
02:06:56.591 --> 02:07:00.190
<v Speaker 5>talking about like the difference between the haves and the have nots and like</v>

5450
02:07:00.191 --> 02:07:01.360
<v Speaker 5>how like back in the day,</v>

5451
02:07:01.361 --> 02:07:04.540
<v Speaker 5>like a CEO average would make like 20 times more than,</v>

5452
02:07:04.541 --> 02:07:05.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5453
02:07:05.290 --> 02:07:05.740
<v Speaker 5>than,</v>

5454
02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:06.431
<v Speaker 5>than the worker.</v>

5455
02:07:06.431 --> 02:07:10.000
<v Speaker 5>Now that some of these CEO's are making like 350 times more than the average</v>

5456
02:07:10.001 --> 02:07:10.331
<v Speaker 5>worker.</v>

5457
02:07:10.331 --> 02:07:10.961
<v Speaker 5>So you start going,</v>

5458
02:07:10.961 --> 02:07:11.261
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

5459
02:07:11.261 --> 02:07:11.890
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

5460
02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Like right now they're saying that a lot of these banks have made them,</v>

5461
02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:17.110
<v Speaker 3>like they weren't affected by the,</v>

5462
02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:17.620
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

5463
02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:19.990
<v Speaker 3>by the economic crunch cause we bailed them out.</v>

5464
02:07:19.991 --> 02:07:22.750
<v Speaker 3>And now a lot of these bankers are making a lot more money.</v>

5465
02:07:22.751 --> 02:07:24.400
<v Speaker 3>And yet the economy is supposedly still bad.</v>

5466
02:07:24.401 --> 02:07:26.110
<v Speaker 3>And people that had mortgages that were,</v>

5467
02:07:26.111 --> 02:07:26.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5468
02:07:26.411 --> 02:07:27.670
<v Speaker 3>belly up or still belly up</v>

5469
02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:31.070
<v Speaker 5>money in and of itself is so strange to me.</v>

5470
02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:34.040
<v Speaker 5>The idea that it's based on nothing but confidence now there's no,</v>

5471
02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:35.310
<v Speaker 5>it's not gold back.</v>

5472
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5473
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:36.790
<v Speaker 1>He's just like,</v>

5474
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:37.240
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

5475
02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:39.580
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to pay attention to everything.</v>

5476
02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:42.160
<v Speaker 1>There's just too much shit going on in the world.</v>

5477
02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:45.430
<v Speaker 1>There's too many God damn experiments going on is too many new science</v>

5478
02:07:45.490 --> 02:07:47.620
<v Speaker 1>inventions that I have to look at every day.</v>

5479
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:52.210
<v Speaker 1>There's some new one they invented where they installed some micro chip into a</v>

5480
02:07:52.211 --> 02:07:55.690
<v Speaker 1>rat's brain and the rat recovered lost memories and they're thinking they're</v>

5481
02:07:55.691 --> 02:07:57.370
<v Speaker 1>gonna eventually be able to do this to people.</v>

5482
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just so much fucking shit going on.</v>

5483
02:07:59.590 --> 02:08:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I can't pay attention to everything.</v>

5484
02:08:00.971 --> 02:08:01.750
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

5485
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:02.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5486
02:08:02.230 --> 02:08:02.501

5489
02:08:03.161 --> 02:08:04.840
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty overwhelming sometimes.</v>

5490
02:08:05.230 --> 02:08:07.840
<v Speaker 5>It's a crazy world we live in and we got a tweet in the middle of all that.</v>
