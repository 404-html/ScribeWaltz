<v Speaker 1>gentleman across himself,</v>

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>the fat Jewish or fat Jew depending on </v>

9
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:33.561

<v Speaker 1>I was telling people to check out his </v>

10
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:35.931
<v Speaker 1>instagram because I'm like,</v>

11
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.841
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about where it came </v>

12
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 1>from because to me as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like a self centered thing.</v>

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I think of like stealing jokes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like stealing.</v>

14
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Like someone stand up and they do jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of like memes as jokes,</v>

15
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.370
<v Speaker 1>but they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of them are from like an </v>

16
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>individual page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a girl that he stole from.</v>

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went to her page and it's all her </v>

18
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's wizard name.</v>

19
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one are you talking about?</v>

20
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

21
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 2>I've actually gone through the last 24 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours and have checked over almost 100 </v>

22
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.230
<v Speaker 2>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been researching</v>

23
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>ones that you retweeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the ones that I retweeted that </v>

24
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you put up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a girl,</v>

25
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>attractive young lady with dark brown </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

26
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Find it real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a point being these people,</v>

27
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

28
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before Brian was a standup comic when I </v>

29
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.811
<v Speaker 1>met Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian do like really funny videos and </v>

30
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>there was a time where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is her name?</v>

31
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Princess of Wifi.</v>

32
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

33
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

34
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's super funny because I'd never </v>

35
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.531
<v Speaker 2>even realized it's a smart one where she</v>
<v Speaker 2>posts a bunch of emojis and it's this </v>

36
00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 2>shout out to the snail for facing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other way.</v>

37
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:51.170
<v Speaker 2>And because the one emoji animal that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not facing the same way as the snail,</v>

38
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 2>and so he pretty much just copied every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single thing she did and put it on a,</v>

39
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 2>on his thing and didn't credit her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:02.360
<v Speaker 2>And it's time stamped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing.</v>

41
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's timestamped.</v>

42
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.560
<v Speaker 2>And so when I've been researching all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

43
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people have already researched </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy because he's been doing this </v>

44
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.471
<v Speaker 2>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just never caught fire so fast as </v>

45
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:14.471
<v Speaker 2>it did this weekend.</v>

46
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about you before you,</v>

47
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>before I met you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were kind of like a comedian on the </v>

48
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Internet before the Internet was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that popular,</v>

49
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:26.450
<v Speaker 1>like you'd make funny videos and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how we became friends.</v>

50
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like that thing that people don't </v>

51
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.451
<v Speaker 1>think of that as being a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you think of a comedian has to go </v>

52
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:34.451
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>

53
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.830
<v Speaker 1>because if you're this girl or this guy </v>

<v Speaker 2>which is their new radio station.</v>

100
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.760

00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:30.441
<v Speaker 2>that they have on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is one thing that I've been </v>

119
00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:30.470
<v Speaker 2>doing the last couple of days I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually been taking these,</v>

120
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

121
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 3>if you just put this much energy in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>own life,</v>

122
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 3>he would be so much healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything would be great.</v>

123
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:42.901
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be totally off smoke and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be going to the gym on a regular </v>

124
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:42.901
<v Speaker 3>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your drinking water.</v>

125
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

126
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:48.591
<v Speaker 2>with the car lisman see a video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that overnight when that happened </v>

127
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:48.591
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an obsession when,</v>

128
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 2>when it's something that's unique and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

129
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:55.221
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like people need to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and this to me is something I </v>

130
00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:55.860
<v Speaker 2>can't believe has been going on for so </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

131
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>And when I went to the store last night </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone goes,</v>

132
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know about that guy.</v>

133
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sucks.</v>

134
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

135
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 2>you haven't heard what's been going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>lately?</v>

136
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Sandy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan toe,</v>

137
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 2>he who's a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a comedy store comic,</v>

138
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.650
<v Speaker 2>a paid regular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually had a bit of his that,</v>

139
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.670
<v Speaker 2>his standup bit that he had taken and </v>
<v Speaker 2>made it a meme and then he called him </v>

140
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 2>out on it in the comments and like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple hours later he deleted it.</v>

141
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing happened to Amir Kay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is another comedian.</v>

142
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

143
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know about this.</v>

144
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 2>What he does have a bunch of interns or </v>
<v Speaker 2>writer or a bunch of employees.</v>

145
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he's been claiming for about</v>

146
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 2>the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think five years.</v>

147
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been claiming that he has employees</v>

148
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:36.880
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

149
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.890
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these people working on his </v>

150
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.890
<v Speaker 2>website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

151
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that excuse might happen once or twice,</v>

152
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 2>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

153
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Speaker 2>this is literally here is 50 of them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've already found them</v>

154
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.660
<v Speaker 1>could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could happen more than that.</v>

155
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.310
<v Speaker 1>The thing about saying it once or twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

156
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to stick up for this guy.</v>

157
00:06:56.101 --> 00:07:00.510
<v Speaker 1>But the reality of like Sitcom writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Seinfeld stole,</v>

158
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 1>not Seinfeld the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the show stole one of Kevin James </v>

159
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Bits and did it on their episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is when Kevin James was not </v>

160
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin was a friend of mine.</v>

161
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Still is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was back then and Kevin hadn't </v>

162
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>made it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't,</v>

163
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had an uncanny queens.</v>

164
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.970
<v Speaker 1>He'd won star search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:20.010
<v Speaker 1>and he'd been like on a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different TV shows.</v>

166
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had a big deal with NBC,</v>

167
00:07:22.771 --> 00:07:25.410
<v Speaker 1>like a development deal dues on sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was there,</v>

168
00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:30.411
<v Speaker 1>I went with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did the showcase for all these NBC </v>

169
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:30.411
<v Speaker 1>writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

170
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:34.581
<v Speaker 1>but these showcases are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do these sitcoms things where they </v>

171
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 1>would sit down and they would bring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>all the show runners from very shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have deals with them and they say,</v>

173
00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got this guy,</v>

174
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:43.110
<v Speaker 1>his name's Kevin James.</v>

175
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.580
<v Speaker 1>We just signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was really funny.</v>

176
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.550
<v Speaker 1>We want you guys to watch him do stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and tell us what you think.</v>

177
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.550
<v Speaker 1>So they watched him do standup and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they stole his bit.</v>

178
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And use it as an episode of Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bit about Muffin tops.</v>

179
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin James.</v>

180
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.760
<v Speaker 1>It was one of his signature bits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a long ass time ago and it was </v>

181
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.510
<v Speaker 1>before the show and it's not the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that happened.</v>

182
00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:08.511
<v Speaker 1>That happened a gang of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened a bunch of times with a </v>

183
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:08.511
<v Speaker 1>bunch of different comics on a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different shows.</v>

184
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:12.240
<v Speaker 1>They would have their signature bits </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned into m,</v>

185
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.590
<v Speaker 1>two M plotlines on sitcoms or gags on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>living color was a big one.</v>

186
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of guys claim that some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the writers from in living color would </v>

187
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.311
<v Speaker 1>come down to the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch guys do stand up like handyman </v>

188
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.220
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone said that handyman was something</v>

189
00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:32.580
<v Speaker 1>that was stolen from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the Damon had stolen it,</v>

190
00:08:32.581 --> 00:08:35.220
<v Speaker 1>but some writer it stolen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true or not,</v>

191
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.450
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of those things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen when they think they can get away</v>

192
00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:44.451
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they can go down to the </v>

193
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:44.451
<v Speaker 1>comedy store on open mic night.</v>

194
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a lot of people there.</v>

195
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 2>So many random people that come to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>open mic,</v>

196
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>places that just sit there with their </v>

197
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.601
<v Speaker 2>notepads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just writing everything down or writing </v>

198
00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:55.601
<v Speaker 2>math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be smacked.</v>

199
00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>You want to sit in the back</v>

200
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 1>of the comedy store?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me look.</v>

201
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:58.840
<v Speaker 1>They could always record it and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

202
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>people do that on their phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

203
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>there was going to record sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got to,</v>

204
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 1>in this day and age you got to assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I was first starting out,</v>

205
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a fucking actual tape </v>
<v Speaker 1>recorder.</v>

206
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't just sit in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could have your phone in your </v>

207
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>jacket pocket and no one would know and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be recording.</v>

208
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 1>As long as the mic is up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes out crystal clear.</v>

209
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I've done it in my back pocket like I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done sets and just record it and stuff </v>

210
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 1>that in my back pocket to see what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would sound like.</v>

211
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I can hear everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

212
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Did anyone ever used to take the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>like radio shack,</v>

213
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.080
<v Speaker 2>box interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>private investigator,</v>

214
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.310
<v Speaker 2>tape recorder like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.470
<v Speaker 2>the huge microphone and just sit it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stool.</v>

216
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

217
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:32.740
<v Speaker 1>I definitely saw people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

218
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I actually used to have one that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mini disc recorder.</v>

219
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Who will fuck taught me how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody,</v>

220
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 1>somebody taught me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had it clipped to his belt.</v>

221
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to remember who the dude is and</v>

222
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:50.631
<v Speaker 1>give them credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had a mini district porter </v>

223
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 1>clipped his belt and then he had a line </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ran up to like a little lapel mic </v>

224
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 1>and he would do all the sets like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then store them all in many disks.</v>

225
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.400
<v Speaker 1>So I had a mini disc recorder installed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the comedy store so I could just </v>

226
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.330
<v Speaker 1>record the sets and listened to on me </v>
<v Speaker 1>desk and then we switched over to dat </v>

227
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 1>and then we switched over to cd when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could burn cds and now I don't even know</v>

228
00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:13.461
<v Speaker 1>if that's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they still have that CD setup where </v>

229
00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:14.100
<v Speaker 1>you can burn your copy of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know anymore.</v>

230
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Is it even necessary at all anymore?</v>

231
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>

232
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Phones are just as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

233
00:10:19.561 --> 00:10:23.340
<v Speaker 1>unless you want to get something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality that you could release as an</v>

234
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 1>album because you could get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely have it set up.</v>

235
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.100
<v Speaker 1>You just have the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

236
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 1>some parts of the audience mic like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple spots might.</v>

237
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.200
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was my point?</v>

238
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Point being?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did we get here?</v>

239
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how uh,</v>

240
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Kevin James.</v>

241
00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.220
<v Speaker 1>So they steal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he had employees,</v>

242
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.710
<v Speaker 1>if the fat Jew had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel weird calling them that</v>

243
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I actually enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this particular only time</v>

244
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to say the fat Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like someone's going to take </v>

245
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.200
<v Speaker 1>this shit out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a hack though.</v>

246
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll just going to call them the fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish.</v>

247
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.120
<v Speaker 1>It seems like less overall statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a superhero.</v>

248
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.970
<v Speaker 1>The Fat Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could easily have employees but </v>

249
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:10.420
<v Speaker 1>hasn't even been proven that he has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>employee's.</v>

250
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.800
<v Speaker 1>And where's this guy getting the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hire employees?</v>

251
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:18.130
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I was looking at on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>page was he would talk about how much </v>

252
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:18.560
<v Speaker 1>money he's making off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instagram.</v>

253
00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I saw Katie Kirk and he was doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview and I was like,</v>

254
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.040
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go out because I don't see like a lot </v>

255
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.351
<v Speaker 1>of product placement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went to his inner instagram to try </v>

256
00:11:29.351 --> 00:11:29.351
<v Speaker 1>to find product placement.</v>

257
00:11:29.351 --> 00:11:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you everything and it's funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you said how you didn't say,</v>

258
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:34.950
<v Speaker 2>why is Katie couric interviewing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

259
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 2>the fat Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd that even happen?</v>

260
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Because he has so many instagram </v>
<v Speaker 2>followers.</v>

261
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why.</v>

262
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:41.400
<v Speaker 2>But I was thinking he has his own wine </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

263
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.180
<v Speaker 2>so like the famous picture of him </v>
<v Speaker 2>pouring two bottles of his own wine on </v>

264
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 2>his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his own wine is a.</v>

265
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.550
<v Speaker 2>This is independent of his instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

266
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so what he does is he mixes all </v>

267
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 2>these into it and then he's also done </v>
<v Speaker 2>burger king,</v>

268
00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:01.410
<v Speaker 2>chicken fries and ads and he also </v>
<v Speaker 2>reportedly has done ads where he can </v>

269
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:08.341
<v Speaker 2>delete them within a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time so he can just post a picture of </v>

270
00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:08.341
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:12.901
<v Speaker 2>enjoying a delicious white castle burger</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they deleted in 20 minutes.</v>

272
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:15.840
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them don't leave those ads up.</v>

273
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:21.420
<v Speaker 2>They'll delete them within a week or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're up on their feed and what's </v>

274
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.421
<v Speaker 2>interesting and what's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting is that his wife slash </v>

275
00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:27.330
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's works at tinder as their head of a</v>

276
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 2>publicist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a publicist for tender.</v>

277
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.850
<v Speaker 2>When she she is trained to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I dated a publicist,</v>

278
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:36.010
<v Speaker 2>all she did was like telling me all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these secrets,</v>

279
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

280
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:41.401
<v Speaker 2>you can do this and do that and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their whole life is how to make money </v>

281
00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:43.810
<v Speaker 2>off of social media and get noticed on </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media.</v>

282
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 2>So he has not only a wine company s </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody said he has a,</v>

283
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.440
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tee shirt company a and he's got a </v>

284
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.451
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different little companies that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just intertwines into his instagram </v>

285
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:02.611
<v Speaker 2>to make it look like he's just doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like the Ryan seacrest of like just</v>

286
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.760
<v Speaker 2>joke thievery and getting shit right.</v>

287
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Promoted his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His one's constantly got a bunch of toes</v>

288
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:10.300
<v Speaker 2>in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

289
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:15.301
<v Speaker 2>He has another famous picture which has </v>
<v Speaker 2>him laying in a pool drinking out of a </v>

290
00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 2>pool that has his own wine in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of a copy of that.</v>

291
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 2>A kind of a copy of that show will get </v>
<v Speaker 2>us pulled down here,</v>

292
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last Man on earth is a from that movie,</v>

293
00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:30.970
<v Speaker 2>so he's even stealing his ideas for </v>
<v Speaker 2>pitchers to sell his wind from TV shows.</v>

294
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 2>He's using Reddit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going on websites.</v>

295
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:38.581
<v Speaker 2>What his formula is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a couple people that </v>

296
00:13:38.581 --> 00:13:38.581
<v Speaker 2>actually do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

297
00:13:38.581 --> 00:13:42.350
<v Speaker 2>He's not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another guy a fuck jerry who was</v>

298
00:13:42.351 --> 00:13:47.351
<v Speaker 2>another almost as bad if not worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy and what they do is they just go </v>

299
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 2>to reddit or they just go to any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these websites,</v>

300
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.880
<v Speaker 2>find the number one trending thing at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that second,</v>

301
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.980
<v Speaker 2>try to find the meat in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the meat,</v>

302
00:13:53.981 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 2>throw it on a picture of a black </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheeseburger,</v>

303
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 2>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

304
00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.290
<v Speaker 2>you have it.</v>

305
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad.</v>

306
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much what the formula like</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>

307
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.090
<v Speaker 2>You look for the funniest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thread at different websites.</v>

308
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 2>What has most fused most posts with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>day they take out,</v>

309
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:15.210
<v Speaker 2>steal that idea and then mix it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else is what he does the most </v>

310
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.440
<v Speaker 2>where he'll just take a photo of a fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>chick or something like that,</v>

311
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 2>but or whatever and put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the two together or.</v>

312
00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 2>But what he's mostly he does is somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else does that exact same thing and then</v>

313
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:26.950
<v Speaker 2>he just takes it word from word and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pitcher crops,</v>

314
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:30.100
<v Speaker 2>the name out doesn't give any credit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just throws it up there.</v>

315
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:35.260
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like one of those things where </v>

316
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.491
<v Speaker 2>you could say like maybe somebody sent </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to him and he just didn't know who </v>

317
00:14:38.491 --> 00:14:38.560
<v Speaker 2>made it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he just posted it,</v>

318
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.090
<v Speaker 2>but not if you change all the words and </v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in your own handwriting or your</v>

319
00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:45.430
<v Speaker 2>own font rather because he's done that </v>
<v Speaker 2>before too.</v>

320
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

321
00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:51.751
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting at earlier is that I never </v>

322
00:14:51.751 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 2>thought of like an internet</v>

323
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.360
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>

324
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of an internet comedian </v>
<v Speaker 1>as being the same as a comedian,</v>

325
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 1>but you clearly are like the young lady </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we talked about.</v>

326
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:02.540
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck's her name again?</v>

327
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

328
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.310
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

329
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.830
<v Speaker 2>it's the same as your audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

330

<v Speaker 1>I could take this and turn into a bit,</v>

347
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.770
<v Speaker 1>so I guarantee you that's happened.</v>

348
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's happened in a ton of time with </v>

349
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.480
<v Speaker 2>just normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've probably all done it </v>

350
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.551
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even my mom's probably posted a photo </v>

351
00:16:11.551 --> 00:16:11.560
<v Speaker 2>that she didn't make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some quote that she didn't write of</v>

352
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 2>footsteps from Jesus or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like the big difference between this</v>

353
00:16:18.131 --> 00:16:21.370
<v Speaker 2>and us doing it is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's directly getting paid to do this.</v>

354
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:22.990
<v Speaker 2>He's directly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

355
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:28.080
<v Speaker 2>creating a business and an empire based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on only plagiarism.</v>

356
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

357
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.410
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing is he's taking a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us think of as innocent,</v>

358
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.220
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:16:33.221 --> 00:16:34.810
<v Speaker 1>you send me something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I retweeted,</v>

360
00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:39.811
<v Speaker 1>we all do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's doing it like in a creepy way </v>

361
00:16:39.811 --> 00:16:43.201
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I used the repost app so it </v>

362
00:16:43.201 --> 00:16:45.511
<v Speaker 1>shows I repost things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every time I repost something it's </v>

363
00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:46.810
<v Speaker 1>with a repost app unless someone sends </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to me and I can't figure out where it</v>

364
00:16:46.811 --> 00:16:51.811
<v Speaker 1>came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I had one of those and I </v>

365
00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:51.811
<v Speaker 1>deleted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I deleted recently.</v>

366
00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if black people have been gold this</v>

367
00:16:53.171 --> 00:16:54.940
<v Speaker 1>whole time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

368
00:16:54.941 --> 00:16:56.470
<v Speaker 1>that's not mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

369
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny meme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

370
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I have to delete it now because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this whole thing.</v>

371
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I never trying to profit off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

372
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.280
<v Speaker 1>but I thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

373
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.270
<v Speaker 1>that's somebody else's work and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to get it twisted with me.</v>

374
00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:09.730
<v Speaker 1>So I deleted that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that all this was going on,</v>

375
00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

376
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I can't be a hipper.</v>

377
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting how sensitive every </v>

378
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:16.030
<v Speaker 2>single thing is getting.</v>

379
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.100
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

380
00:17:17.101 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 1>it's really all about intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

381
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:20.040
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

382
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>

383
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing so much research on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that I didn't.</v>

384
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.470
<v Speaker 2>One thing I know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

385
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:31.040
<v Speaker 2>that episode of workaholics where he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pod at forward,</v>

386
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:33.440
<v Speaker 2>the one that they talked about Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isms in it.</v>

387
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.310
<v Speaker 2>A lot fat Jew has a cameo in that for no</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparent reason at all.</v>

388
00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 2>They look over and he's like doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushups on the ground and that's it.</v>

389
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 2>So He's been working his way into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood.</v>

390
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:49.820
<v Speaker 2>He has a video that's on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called fat Jew nude on shrooms in </v>

391
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Mexico where he's just shooting guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

392
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 2>and running around naked on mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then driving at the end.</v>

393
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.500
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of interesting videos.</v>

394
00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:03.501
<v Speaker 2>There's another video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this news morning news place had him on </v>

395
00:18:03.501 --> 00:18:07.911
<v Speaker 2>the morning news and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was right before his instagram was </v>

396
00:18:07.911 --> 00:18:11.001
<v Speaker 2>starting to take off a little and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his manager and some other person </v>

397
00:18:11.001 --> 00:18:13.440
<v Speaker 2>all being interviewed and I wish I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>find.</v>

398
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 2>I've been looking for it if I find I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>show it,</v>

399
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:20.180
<v Speaker 2>send it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting because he kind of </v>

400
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:20.180
<v Speaker 2>put it down like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

401
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.191
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secret to what I'm doing is just </v>

402
00:18:24.191 --> 00:18:26.250
<v Speaker 2>posting a bunch of funny stuff or buts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then getting tons of money from it.</v>

403
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:31.310
<v Speaker 2>And then like he just broke it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if I ever make a video of this </v>

404
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.181
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put that aside at my house because </v>

405
00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 2>there's so many amazing quotes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview and it's really weird.</v>

406
00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Is his manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever was sitting next to him.</v>

407
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.610
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

408
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.920
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make all this money out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to make all this money,</v>

409
00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:43.090
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a guy the black at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end go.</v>

410
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 2>What still good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is what.</v>

411
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.280
<v Speaker 2>I think instagram is good for our health</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fitness and a lot of things,</v>

412
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.670
<v Speaker 2>not just buckets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one of those morning news guys.</v>

413
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.520
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are always wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where their morning news guys.</v>

414
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:59.180
<v Speaker 2>But it was an interesting interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much interesting thing I've been </v>

415
00:18:59.180 --> 00:18:59.460
<v Speaker 2>looking through for the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>days on this guy.</v>

416
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.860
<v Speaker 2>So his comedy central pilot got canceled</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

417
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.900
<v Speaker 2>that was announced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

418
00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.160
<v Speaker 2>that comedy central confirmed that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to.</v>

419
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.860
<v Speaker 1>How did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not if they're after them and see a </v>

420
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:11.860
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

421
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:11.860
<v Speaker 1>because they kept men Sia on after that </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

422
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.750
<v Speaker 1>And his ratings dropped by more than 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent instantly.</v>

423
00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.220
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Christ.</v>

424
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.700
<v Speaker 1>And then also they knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew what the fuck he did,</v>

425
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:24.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they have a show on and they </v>

426
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.750
<v Speaker 1>also knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was a big one,</v>

427
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.690
<v Speaker 1>that the fucking show was responsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>for plagiarism.</v>

428
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it,</v>

429
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:34.930
<v Speaker 1>and Lewis black was fucking furious </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Lewis Black was on comedy </v>

430
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.891
<v Speaker 1>central,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was on the Jon Stewart show and </v>

431
00:19:38.891 --> 00:19:40.940
<v Speaker 1>while he's on the Jon Stewart show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been stealing is doing his shit and</v>

432
00:19:40.941 --> 00:19:45.941
<v Speaker 1>not only just doing it but doing it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this with the fingers the way that told </v>

433
00:19:45.941 --> 00:19:50.420
<v Speaker 1>a bit like Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's literally doing Louis Shit </v>

434
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.990
<v Speaker 1>on the same network loses on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they.</v>

435
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 1>They took a fuck load of heat for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus there's a new regime at comedy </v>

436
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.580
<v Speaker 1>central now and they're way smarter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just there.</v>

437
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.690
<v Speaker 1>They're on the ball as far as like their</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

438
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:06.020
<v Speaker 1>That's why you seen shows like Amy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schumer's show like Hannibal Burress,</v>

439
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.260
<v Speaker 1>like Ari there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing good show and taking </v>

440
00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.350
<v Speaker 1>chances from real comedians for once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

441
00:20:12.351 --> 00:20:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still have their online platform,</v>

442
00:20:14.721 --> 00:20:17.120
<v Speaker 1>which they've been really smart about </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing too though,</v>

443
00:20:17.121 --> 00:20:20.630
<v Speaker 1>like this is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started out as an online platform.</v>

444
00:20:20.631 --> 00:20:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Then they brought it to a television </v>
<v Speaker 1>after they work it out that way.</v>

445
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.880
<v Speaker 1>So there's very little pressure on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's smart.</v>

446
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.160
<v Speaker 1>They're doing everything the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're like,</v>

447
00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:30.290
<v Speaker 1>fuck this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

448
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.450
<v Speaker 1>you just can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it.</v>

449
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was him or if it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>as employees.</v>

450
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.560
<v Speaker 1>We don't really don't know.</v>

451
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 2>He's asked to take responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

452
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:43.230
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's happened in large </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions writing about it.</v>

453
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.050
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

454
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:45.740
<v Speaker 1>know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

455
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going like that.</v>

456
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

457
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.980
<v Speaker 2>has to take responsibility for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he is the one getting the </v>

458
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 2>paychecks for all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if his interns,</v>

459
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:57.250
<v Speaker 2>which are probably unpaid interns is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm guessing a.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This fat Jewish guy has not posted </v>

478
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.060

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Like his last one is 18 hours ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while this is all going down,</v>

491
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.470
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume.</v>

492
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

493
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not 100 percent sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure it's all her work </v>

494
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.470
<v Speaker 1>and it's really fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she's just a funny comic like,</v>

495
00:22:33.471 --> 00:22:36.920
<v Speaker 1>or funny at writing this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call her.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the hell is this guy doing?</v>

<v Speaker 1>which is true.</v>

500
00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:53.380
<v Speaker 1>So he takes that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He puts it up and then he just writes </v>

501
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:53.960
<v Speaker 1>her name on the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's her.</v>

504
00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.200

<v Speaker 1>he puts his own bullshit in it.</v>

507
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.300
<v Speaker 1>and when he puts his own bullshit in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he puts her name at the bottom.</v>

508
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.690
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even say created by.</v>

00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:58.481
<v Speaker 3>I had a big smile on my face when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started getting texts from you and then </v>

542

549
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:18.730
<v Speaker 3>didn't write it or did write it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point is he thinks she wrote it </v>

550
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.720
<v Speaker 3>and instead of crediting her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just writes her name.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even like write original by </v>

<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean anything,</v>

555
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:36.070
<v Speaker 3>like I put people's names at the bottom </v>

00:26:26.871 --> 00:26:29.750
<v Speaker 3>You would constantly see some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>silly shit.</v>

576
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.940
<v Speaker 3>I got to stop following them on </v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram.</v>

577
00:26:31.941 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm still following them right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

578
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 3>Somebody told me that already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm still following.</v>

579
00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking tattle tales.</v>

580
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:44.260
<v Speaker 3>And it was really weird as he steals </v>
<v Speaker 3>from people that if he had any common </v>

581
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:44.260
<v Speaker 3>sense that you</v>

582
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:49.040
<v Speaker 2>would not steal from Matt Besser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know Matt Besser </v>

583
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 2>from back in the days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's old school.</v>

584
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:54.771
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's one of the founders of UCB </v>

585
00:26:54.771 --> 00:26:54.890
<v Speaker 2>or if not the founder of UCB.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

586
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.060
<v Speaker 2>he stole from him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put it.</v>

587
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 2>How many potheads does it take to screw </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a light bulb?</v>

588
00:26:58.351 --> 00:27:00.240
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to keep it mellow here.</v>

589
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Funny Little Joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fat Jews stole it.</v>

590
00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's like in the comedy world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like insane.</v>

591
00:27:07.351 --> 00:27:08.580
<v Speaker 2>If you steal from Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

592
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's a lot of people out there </v>

593
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.300
<v Speaker 3>that don't know who he is and they think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can get away with it.</v>

594
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:15.600
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

595
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 3>what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got away with up until now when you </v>

596
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.140
<v Speaker 3>get away with something for that long </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's that profitable.</v>

597
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people have been mad at him for</v>

598
00:27:23.811 --> 00:27:27.210
<v Speaker 3>that or you're stealing money from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people really see what you're doing.</v>

599
00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the.</v>

600
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Or are they making money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird situation because it's like</v>

601
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.200
<v Speaker 3>some people just doing it for fun and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're profiting off of their fun.</v>

602
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.560
<v Speaker 3>But that's Kinda like there was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an artist once that was taking</v>

603
00:27:43.101 --> 00:27:48.101
<v Speaker 3>photos of other people's are and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawing like pretty much exact </v>

604
00:27:48.101 --> 00:27:52.481
<v Speaker 3>duplicates of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a cartoon and it's happened </v>

605
00:27:52.481 --> 00:27:53.140
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

606
00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:57.710
<v Speaker 3>there was one story that was on this one</v>
<v Speaker 3>cartoon that this guy was doing where he</v>

607
00:27:57.711 --> 00:28:00.570
<v Speaker 3>had stolen like so many of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

608
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.280
<v Speaker 3>this guy's images and just put his own </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of it,</v>

609
00:28:04.281 --> 00:28:09.281
<v Speaker 3>but like so similar and some people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how this guy can </v>

610
00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:13.130
<v Speaker 3>get away with this for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's just too much to pay</v>

611
00:28:13.131 --> 00:28:18.080
<v Speaker 3>attention to for you to connect the dots</v>
<v Speaker 3>on two different images like that.</v>

612
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he probably was dumb or ridiculous </v>

613
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:23.300
<v Speaker 3>or thought he can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is his last post right here.</v>

614
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually watermarked with that name</v>

615
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.120
<v Speaker 3>at Burt Bondi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny you say that,</v>

616
00:28:29.121 --> 00:28:34.121
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is the one that took me in </v>

617
00:28:34.121 --> 00:28:35.060
<v Speaker 3>one of the ones that took me over half </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour to research that you think is the,</v>

618
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.590
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

619
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.090
<v Speaker 3>the original line was looking at his </v>
<v Speaker 3>page too and yeah,</v>

620
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.420
<v Speaker 3>it seems like the guy has his twitter </v>
<v Speaker 3>name is actually in the pitcher Joe and,</v>

621
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.790
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't credit the guy even though</v>
<v Speaker 3>his name is actually in there.</v>

622
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's one of the fake ones.</v>

623
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one that I researched and found </v>

624
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.830
<v Speaker 3>out that there was actually somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>before that person.</v>

625
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.490
<v Speaker 3>So that person tagged his name in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying it was his,</v>

626
00:28:55.550 --> 00:29:00.550
<v Speaker 3>when it wasn't even his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that could be one of the ones where </v>

627
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.100
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he banked it.</v>

628
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.570
<v Speaker 3>What is this right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you looking at?</v>

629
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bert bonded from supposedly,</v>

630
00:29:05.501 --> 00:29:07.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposedly.</v>

631
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.070
<v Speaker 3>But this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody else had it before him.</v>

632
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.680
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

633
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.450
<v Speaker 3>I was my point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to bring up on this.</v>

634
00:29:14.451 --> 00:29:19.451
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of weird because this is where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get into like parody law and </v>

635
00:29:19.451 --> 00:29:20.720
<v Speaker 3>copyright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're taking photographers photos</v>

636
00:29:20.721 --> 00:29:23.060
<v Speaker 3>and making money off of them without </v>
<v Speaker 3>paying the photographer,</v>

637
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.510
<v Speaker 3>but because it's parody you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to do that to a certain extent.</v>

638
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:31.490
<v Speaker 3>So at what point are you allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>parody a joke and that's okay.</v>

639
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't word for word it,</v>

640
00:29:34.041 --> 00:29:36.020
<v Speaker 3>but I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See I'm torn here.</v>

641
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Here's why I'm torn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love memes.</v>

642
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I think these are fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I enjoy them</v>

643
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:47.070
<v Speaker 1>when when someone sends me a funny one </v>
<v Speaker 1>or when I get a funny one on instagram </v>

644
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 1>and I scroll through it and I laugh with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

645
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I have to,</v>

646
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.100
<v Speaker 1>but I want people to keep but I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

647
00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:00.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to necessarily like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to discredit the fact that </v>

648
00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.921
<v Speaker 1>someone made it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really give a fuck that </v>

649
00:30:04.921 --> 00:30:04.921
<v Speaker 1>someone made it like I do now.</v>

650
00:30:04.921 --> 00:30:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Even as book cover fat Jew as a stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

651
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Even as far as look cover is a copy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Steve Jobs Book.</v>

652
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's on pop on appropriate.</v>

653
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just funny that everything he </v>

654
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.080
<v Speaker 1>does is completely unoriginal and fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hairstyle was?</v>

655
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Hairstyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a kung po from the </v>

656
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.160
<v Speaker 1>kickboxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving Tong Po.</v>

657
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Remember that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Claude van Damme before I'd spend </v>

658
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got the crazy haircut.</v>

659
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I just got to kind of a tongue po thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

660
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Was there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

661
00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.440
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

662
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you're not his friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what you're trying to say?</v>

663
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

664
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just amazed by it.</v>

665
00:30:40.101 --> 00:30:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm just shocked by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it when I see my friends of</v>

666
00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 2>mine that he's stolen from it and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

667
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:49.180
<v Speaker 2>why am I just finding out about this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

668
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:54.540
<v Speaker 2>And then I remember when I heard his </v>
<v Speaker 2>name around on TMZ and twitter and all </v>

669
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.711
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't want to ever click on the </v>

670
00:30:58.711 --> 00:30:58.711
<v Speaker 2>link because I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about this fat Jew guy,</v>

671
00:30:58.711 --> 00:30:58.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't give a shit.</v>

672
00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 2>But then now I kind of want to stop it </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't have to see more of him,</v>

673
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future.</v>

674
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't bother me when I saw him </v>

675
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:08.270
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

676
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.311
<v Speaker 1>well this is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's figuring out how to profit </v>

677
00:31:10.311 --> 00:31:10.311
<v Speaker 1>off of these memes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was saying,</v>

678
00:31:10.311 --> 00:31:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm wonder if this is going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that happens in the future.</v>

679
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:17.390
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what he's doing is just going </v>

680
00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:17.670
<v Speaker 1>finding pictures and then they say funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and put it on the picture.</v>

681
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It was he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how he was describing it.</v>

682
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.610
<v Speaker 1>And he was saying it to Katie couric </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has a staff and they go,</v>

683
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:27.630
<v Speaker 1>they comb the Internet for funny things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really they're just ganking memes </v>

684
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.480
<v Speaker 1>and he's doing it as a corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing it like as a business.</v>

685
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:35.850
<v Speaker 2>One of the ones that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went the farthest back as being the </v>

686
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.901
<v Speaker 2>oldest joke I could find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He found off of a 2001 a website that </v>

687
00:31:41.591 --> 00:31:46.591
<v Speaker 2>still existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this might not even be the first </v>

688
00:31:46.591 --> 00:31:46.591
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was one of those news mail,</v>

689
00:31:46.591 --> 00:31:48.520
<v Speaker 2>email newsletters that you would send,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

690
00:31:48.521 --> 00:31:50.210
<v Speaker 2>here's Alicia funny jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ha.</v>

691
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.190
<v Speaker 2>And it's just a list of like 50 jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just started taking from that</v>

692
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:58.420
<v Speaker 1>list as one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say I'm shocked.</v>

693
00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

694
00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:02.580
<v Speaker 1>now that you know his modus operandi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I've,</v>

695
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I've heard him talk and they never seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

696
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I'm hearing him talk,</v>

697
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guys doesn't seem like a funny guy.</v>

698
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:12.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>

699
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:14.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Pereira,</v>

700
00:32:14.531 --> 00:32:16.120
<v Speaker 1>let's use him as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

701
00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:21.121
<v Speaker 1>if Kevin was on some show there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would listen to him talk and you'd </v>

702
00:32:21.121 --> 00:32:22.750
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if he wasn't trying to be funny,</v>

703
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:23.260
<v Speaker 1>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

704
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:25.370
<v Speaker 1>here's a guy that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that I'd be funny.</v>

705
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I could see him have a clever point on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

706
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone presented him with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecological point of view,</v>

707
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.070
<v Speaker 1>he would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

708
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.440
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You started making fun of it.</v>

709
00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.360
<v Speaker 1>That's his instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

710
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:37.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

711
00:32:37.991 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 1>your instinct comics instincts and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

712
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that you have on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a funny person would say funny </v>

713
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:45.510
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never seemed funny.</v>

714
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.050
<v Speaker 1>It seems like this like corporate guy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

715
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wacky haircut.</v>

716
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like a tall package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

717
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:56.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people are telling me is that he </v>

718
00:32:56.951 --> 00:32:56.990
<v Speaker 1>was one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grew up in a super rich family.</v>

719
00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It's been kind of just thrown and given </v>
<v Speaker 1>favors and that's one of those guys,</v>

720
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:06.260
<v Speaker 1>one of those motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the problem is I could make that</v>

721
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 1>argument about myself not being funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes too,</v>

722
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:11.260
<v Speaker 1>if I'm doing something serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I do a conversation,</v>

723
00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.270
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's about mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

724
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.860
<v Speaker 1>But then I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it about that I guess.</v>

725
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you listen to a lot of his </v>

726
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.070
<v Speaker 1>interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've watched a lot,</v>

727
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 1>he pretty much repeats the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just need to get a guacamole and </v>

728
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.270
<v Speaker 1>a in a bathtub and a wine.</v>

729
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see what happened.</v>

730
00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Ca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

731
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.560
<v Speaker 1>You're the folks who signed mints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delia,</v>

732
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 1>after all that shit went down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

733
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took them from Gersh,</v>

734
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.530
<v Speaker 1>they ganged them from grocery at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst moment ever.</v>

735
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

736
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the shit was hitting the fan,</v>

737
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:43.130
<v Speaker 1>they jumped in with a dick in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

738
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.140
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who knows.</v>

739
00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:50.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean they probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they were aware in the </v>

740
00:33:50.141 --> 00:33:53.801
<v Speaker 1>entirety of the situation that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with that and I think there </v>

741
00:33:53.801 --> 00:33:55.250
<v Speaker 1>probably weren't aware about this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>either because,</v>

742
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:56.270
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't aware.</v>

743
00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ignorantly,</v>

744
00:33:58.321 --> 00:33:58.910
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

745
00:33:58.911 --> 00:34:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I just takes beams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts them up there.</v>

746
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>plagiarism,</v>

747
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.480
<v Speaker 1>but when pat and wrote it and then when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had.</v>

748
00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw the actual instances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

749
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

750
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I see what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

751
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:10.670
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely.</v>

752
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't just reposting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

753
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.950
<v Speaker 1>he could have got the same success by </v>
<v Speaker 1>reposting,</v>

754
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I repost stuff.</v>

755
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.260
<v Speaker 1>If you post something funny and I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to repost it,</v>

756
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I go to the repost APP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I repost that and I do it specifically </v>

757
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.041
<v Speaker 1>so that people will know that it came </v>
<v Speaker 1>from you and hopefully they'll click on </v>

758
00:34:30.041 --> 00:34:32.390
<v Speaker 1>your link and sign up and be one of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>followers or whatever.</v>

759
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the spirit of the </v>

760
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

761
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.890
<v Speaker 1>when someone says something funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always retweet stuff.</v>

762
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I never copy and paste someone's tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

763
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I just don't unless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you have their name in the tweet </v>

764
00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:48.880
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

765
00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.080
<v Speaker 1>and then you put in the quote marks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other than that,</v>

766
00:34:51.081 --> 00:34:53.150
<v Speaker 1>but then then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows it comes from them.</v>

767
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.960
<v Speaker 1>But other than that I use a retweet or </v>
<v Speaker 1>repost app or quote tweet,</v>

768
00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you quoted if you using the APP on the </v>

769
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.230
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

770
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just unethical.</v>

771
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.200
<v Speaker 1>It's unethical and it's against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of what the Internet is supposed </v>

772
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:08.200
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All about.</v>

773
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.981
<v Speaker 1>The free exchange of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody comes in and just fucking </v>

774
00:35:11.981 --> 00:35:14.840
<v Speaker 1>sticks a syringe in this pipeline of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

775
00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Just starts pulling it out and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>profiting,</v>

776
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're doing instead of </v>

777
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.071
<v Speaker 1>contributing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of like jumping into this free </v>

778
00:35:24.071 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 1>exchange and then offering up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful pipeline.</v>

779
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:30.190
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this guy could have been a </v>

780
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 1>successful pipeline for all these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I bet he would have still got nearly</v>

781
00:35:30.831 --> 00:35:35.831
<v Speaker 1>the same amount of tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are nearly the same amount of likes and </v>

782
00:35:35.831 --> 00:35:36.350
<v Speaker 1>followers and all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he was just a,</v>

783
00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just gave everybody</v>

784
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.500
<v Speaker 5>credit and then people would like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't be mad.</v>

785
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is both twitter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Instagram,</v>

786
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:48.480
<v Speaker 2>I've heard hire a band him in the past </v>
<v Speaker 2>and with instagram they,</v>

787
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:51.960
<v Speaker 2>he tied his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tied himself up to their headquarters</v>

788
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.900
<v Speaker 2>until they let him back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

789
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly I mean bag.</v>

790
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

791
00:35:58.231 --> 00:36:03.030
<v Speaker 2>But it worked and a lot of people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been trying to tell people to.</v>

792
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Twitter has that new copyright thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can copyright tweets or </v>

793
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:12.291
<v Speaker 2>whatever and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to be the originator of </v>

794
00:36:12.291 --> 00:36:15.081
<v Speaker 2>that joke in order to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's only people if these people </v>

795
00:36:15.081 --> 00:36:15.480
<v Speaker 2>stood up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

796
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And made that and read,</v>

797
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.220
<v Speaker 2>wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would they have any,</v>

798
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

799
00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:21.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

800
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:27.370
<v Speaker 5>to do that or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember when that guy was </v>

801
00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:27.370
<v Speaker 5>stealing patrice o'neal's material and </v>
<v Speaker 5>do it as Youtube rants?</v>

802
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:32.890
<v Speaker 5>And then he was trying to say that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>did it because it was an homage to </v>

803
00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:33.980
<v Speaker 5>portray.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was trying to pretend he did it like all</v>

804
00:36:33.981 --> 00:36:36.680
<v Speaker 5>angry too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like so gross and fake the way he</v>

805
00:36:36.681 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 5>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

806
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.760
<v Speaker 5>he's like channeling patrice or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something while he did it and trying to </v>

807
00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:42.760
<v Speaker 5>be smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And everybody's like,</v>

808
00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.320
<v Speaker 5>oh you fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a thief.</v>

809
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.660
<v Speaker 5>You know you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a liar too.</v>

810
00:36:47.661 --> 00:36:52.661
<v Speaker 5>Like the way you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're lying to all these people that </v>

811
00:36:52.661 --> 00:36:53.540
<v Speaker 5>thought you came up with these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are not your ideas at all.</v>

812
00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:55.940
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to come back from that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>From that.</v>

813
00:36:55.941 --> 00:36:57.620
<v Speaker 5>You can come back for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>

814
00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.620
<v Speaker 5>The only way you can come back from that</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to admit that you did that.</v>

815
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:06.010
<v Speaker 5>Talk about how you did it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>got to reestablish yourself as being </v>

816
00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:06.560
<v Speaker 5>completely original.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good fucking luck.</v>

817
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.720
<v Speaker 5>We've talked about this before with joke</v>
<v Speaker 5>thieves.</v>

818
00:37:08.721 --> 00:37:13.721
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a bunch of guys that </v>
<v Speaker 5>were joke thieves and one of the things </v>

819
00:37:13.721 --> 00:37:18.041
<v Speaker 5>that you could clearly see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could see the difference between </v>

820
00:37:18.041 --> 00:37:18.230
<v Speaker 5>their material and other people's </v>
<v Speaker 5>material.</v>

821
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:23.530
<v Speaker 5>The other people's material was funny </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then in between there like this </v>

822
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:27.910
<v Speaker 5>funny shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would have their shit and like </v>

823
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.090
<v Speaker 5>stand out like a sore thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a guy,</v>

824
00:37:29.091 --> 00:37:31.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to mention his name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody knows who the fuck I'm talking</v>

825
00:37:31.401 --> 00:37:36.401
<v Speaker 5>about who stole a lot of shit from Bill </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hicks and he had one good special and </v>

826
00:37:36.401 --> 00:37:39.320
<v Speaker 5>then his second special was hot dog </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

827
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:44.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a parody of his first </v>

828
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:48.761
<v Speaker 5>special is because there was no content </v>
<v Speaker 5>in it because he had burned all these </v>

829
00:37:48.761 --> 00:37:48.890
<v Speaker 5>bridges,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stole all this content,</v>

830
00:37:48.891 --> 00:37:50.480
<v Speaker 5>was scared and sad.</v>

831
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.770
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it myself,</v>

832
00:37:51.771 --> 00:37:54.170
<v Speaker 5>I'll make my own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he couldn't make his own shit.</v>

833
00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:59.370
<v Speaker 5>His new shit was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's like this really clear </v>

834
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:00.310
<v Speaker 5>difference between the two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I maintained.</v>

835
00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:05.311
<v Speaker 5>It's because the mindset of creativity </v>
<v Speaker 5>is the exact opposite of the mindset of </v>

836
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:10.510
<v Speaker 5>plagiarism because plagiarism is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to pretend that this is all my </v>

837
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:14.621
<v Speaker 5>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to pretend to take this and I'm </v>

838
00:38:14.621 --> 00:38:14.621
<v Speaker 5>going to go get all the love for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get.</v>

839
00:38:14.621 --> 00:38:17.530
<v Speaker 5>Whereas like a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a hilarious person is like,</v>

840
00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.800
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's funny?</v>

841
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:20.150
<v Speaker 5>Where's the funny?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

842
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:21.980
<v Speaker 5>Is it this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it that like you've got.</v>

843
00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.130
<v Speaker 5>You're not thinking about you like what </v>
<v Speaker 5>all you are.</v>

844
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:29.360
<v Speaker 5>You're this vessel for getting the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>in its best form.</v>

845
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.360
<v Speaker 5>You're like a a boat that carries the </v>
<v Speaker 5>joke to the people.</v>

846
00:38:32.361 --> 00:38:34.190
<v Speaker 5>You got to figure out how the fuck do I </v>
<v Speaker 5>do this?</v>

847
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 5>Like how many times have any of us</v>

848
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.340
<v Speaker 1>had been sitting around going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta figure out a better way to set </v>

849
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.310
<v Speaker 1>this up or there's a better way to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this or do you got to figure out this?</v>

850
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:47.311
<v Speaker 1>Or if someone comes along and just yanks</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and just doesn't have any of the </v>

851
00:38:47.311 --> 00:38:49.360
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know how to do that.</v>

852
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:54.570
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that process of creating is like </v>

853
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:55.960
<v Speaker 1>learning a language and when those </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking joke,</v>

854
00:38:55.961 --> 00:38:59.440
<v Speaker 1>these have to go out and relearn the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

855
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:04.620
<v Speaker 1>They're essentially like open minker's </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've seen a couple guys that we </v>

856
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 1>know of that are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that got hot from stealing stuff.</v>

857
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.950
<v Speaker 1>But then if you see him now you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did the fucking creativity go?</v>

858
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Or they don't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like our old friend who I found out the </v>

859
00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:20.170
<v Speaker 1>other day that a steel steel's I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

860
00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:21.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say.</v>

861
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

862
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Tosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

863
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he knows how to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he does it and I think </v>

864
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:28.570
<v Speaker 1>he's scared to bomb as one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had always said.</v>

865
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.300
<v Speaker 1>He's like a lot of comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about Hubby bummed.</v>

866
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I never bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bombed all the time,</v>

867
00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.870
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

868
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Because I write stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try shit out.</v>

869
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

870
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 1>when you're writing all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

871
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna fucking have some duds.</v>

872
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:45.940
<v Speaker 1>You're going to throw them out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta go fuck.</v>

873
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.840
<v Speaker 1>And it might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

874
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be all of them,</v>

875
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.610
<v Speaker 1>but it might be one out of 10 you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cut off and throw it into the ocean.</v>

876
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.000
<v Speaker 1>So there's no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never working.</v>

877
00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:00.240
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of people are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you do that bit until you decide </v>

878
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.271
<v Speaker 1>that it sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to fuck around </v>

879
00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:03.271
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

880
00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:03.420
<v Speaker 1>You going to try because sometimes I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if you do those,</v>

881
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know doc does it.</v>

882
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:08.500
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys do this where you kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like set yourself up in a position where</v>

883
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 1>you really don't know where this bit's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go.</v>

884
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something funny in it.</v>

885
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 1>So you hope that it comes out on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's ways of writing where you</v>

886
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:21.541
<v Speaker 1>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke a joint suit in front of a </v>

887
00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:23.560
<v Speaker 1>computer or your notebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking trying to figure out how to</v>

888
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:24.230
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll,</v>

889
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll play little games with myself.</v>

890
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll say like brian red band is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

891
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:31.730
<v Speaker 1>like a Walrus is</v>

892
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.640
<v Speaker 6>two.</v>

893
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:38.730
<v Speaker 1>No peacock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to find ways that this subject</v>

894
00:40:38.731 --> 00:40:40.440
<v Speaker 1>interacts with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to find,</v>

895
00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.570
<v Speaker 1>not because of fashion years peacock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm pretty cocked,</v>

896
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.630
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll,</v>

897
00:40:45.631 --> 00:40:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

898
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll do little tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll set up lists.</v>

899
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:55.070
<v Speaker 1>This is like that and I'll do like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>list of different things because I want </v>

900
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:58.821
<v Speaker 1>to try to find out what the best bit is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you just got to go on </v>

901
00:40:58.821 --> 00:41:02.121
<v Speaker 1>stage and sometimes you go on stage with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this premise and you're pretty sure </v>

902
00:41:02.121 --> 00:41:02.490
<v Speaker 1>there's something funny about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>premise,</v>

903
00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.920
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know where it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead and then boom,</v>

904
00:41:04.921 --> 00:41:08.940
<v Speaker 1>when you're on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jokes like the punchline will reveal</v>

905
00:41:08.941 --> 00:41:12.290
<v Speaker 1>itself to you or the angle will reveal </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself to you and then you record.</v>

906
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:17.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like you take this little ember </v>
<v Speaker 1>ticket back to the lab and you fucking </v>

907
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:18.420
<v Speaker 1>put some tinder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tinder on it.</v>

908
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Kindling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it kill?</v>

909
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.200
<v Speaker 1>What's tinder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tinder is that APP,</v>

910
00:41:22.201 --> 00:41:23.450
<v Speaker 1>but is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a thing too,</v>

911
00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:28.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Publicist chick doesn't have something </v>

912
00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:28.460
<v Speaker 1>to do with fire tender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

913
00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:28.460
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tinder,</v>

914
00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:28.740
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tinder box.</v>

915
00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

916
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

917
00:41:30.991 --> 00:41:35.400
<v Speaker 1>you don't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cindy Archer</v>

918
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.780
<v Speaker 5>for fires.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about fires.</v>

919
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 5>You fuck the point being that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole process.</v>

920
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:46.750
<v Speaker 5>You have to learn how to do and if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't learn how to create like you,</v>

921
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.860
<v Speaker 5>your video editing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you you have to,</v>

922
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:53.980
<v Speaker 5>you gotta learn how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to do some that you didn't </v>

923
00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:53.980
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to do something like you.</v>

924
00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:57.260
<v Speaker 5>If you go back and look at your earlier </v>
<v Speaker 5>videos like they weren't as good as your</v>

925
00:41:57.261 --> 00:41:58.820
<v Speaker 5>later videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got better at it.</v>

926
00:41:58.821 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 5>As time went on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when you start doing it,</v>

927
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 5>you know all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just get smoother.</v>

928
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:09.430
<v Speaker 5>It's the same with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those guys are fucked because their </v>

929
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:10.220
<v Speaker 5>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a wrong mindset,</v>

930
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.640
<v Speaker 5>so they become superstars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not good.</v>

931
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:15.510
<v Speaker 5>They're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They live.</v>

932
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like being a superstar track and </v>
<v Speaker 5>field athlete,</v>

933
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.330
<v Speaker 5>but you really don't run fast at all.</v>

934
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.760
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody thinks like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God damn,</v>

935
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:25.730
<v Speaker 5>this guy's like the fastest guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

936
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:30.880
<v Speaker 5>you've been just been like teleporting </v>
<v Speaker 5>down the fucking down the path and </v>

937
00:42:31.161 --> 00:42:33.980
<v Speaker 5>stealing people's spots and pretending </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're in first place,</v>

938
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:39.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just running through the ribbon I </v>

939
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:39.160
<v Speaker 5>will on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they was like,</v>

940
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:39.160
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that dude's fast.</v>

941
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:39.890
<v Speaker 5>He won again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you didn't really want.</v>

942
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:44.891
<v Speaker 5>You can't really run fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost the exact same thing with </v>

943
00:42:44.891 --> 00:42:44.930
<v Speaker 5>people who are plagiarists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They lose,</v>

944
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 5>they literally don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>creativity.</v>

945
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.640
<v Speaker 5>They've never developed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's Kinda fucked.</v>

946
00:42:49.641 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be fucking really terrifying</v>

947
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.260
<v Speaker 5>because like Charlie Murphy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the ballsiest things that Charlie</v>

948
00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 5>Murphy did was Charlie Murphy was famous</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

949
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:04.670
<v Speaker 5>for being the brother of a really </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking famous comedian.</v>

950
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.300
<v Speaker 5>And second of all for being on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>greatest sketch comedy show,</v>

951
00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:11.090
<v Speaker 5>the world's ever known and being a big </v>
<v Speaker 5>part of it.</v>

952
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:16.270
<v Speaker 5>He was huge on the Chappelle show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Charlie Murphy stories or stories that </v>

953
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:17.180
<v Speaker 5>he would tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the prince story.</v>

954
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.110
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

955
00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:23.111
<v Speaker 5>he was famous for telling hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories and people would like look </v>

956
00:43:23.111 --> 00:43:27.491
<v Speaker 5>forward to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would be on the stage or on the </v>

957
00:43:27.491 --> 00:43:30.941
<v Speaker 5>screen and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just just waist up telling a story and </v>

958
00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:33.500
<v Speaker 5>then you'd see like it be playing out </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Dave Chappelle being prince and all</v>

959
00:43:33.501 --> 00:43:35.870
<v Speaker 5>the crazy shit that it would be a part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of those stories.</v>

960
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.930
<v Speaker 5>And then Charlie started doing stand up </v>
<v Speaker 5>after that.</v>

961
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 5>So after that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

962
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:43.700
<v Speaker 5>there's some legendary bad sets that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's had.</v>

963
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.760
<v Speaker 5>He had some bad sets like that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>captured on video where one of them we </v>

964
00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.421
<v Speaker 5>did a college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're booing him and he went back and </v>

965
00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:53.030
<v Speaker 5>got the check and tore it up in front of</v>
<v Speaker 5>them and threw it out to him left.</v>

966
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

967
00:43:55.130 --> 00:44:00.130
<v Speaker 5>he took fucking crazy chances because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a famous open miker and you know as</v>

968
00:44:00.411 --> 00:44:03.650
<v Speaker 5>well as I know that process cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 5>duplicated.</v>

969
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:06.470
<v Speaker 5>The process of becoming good at doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>standup,</v>

970
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.910
<v Speaker 5>going from an open miker to being like </v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

971
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.750
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an established professional is a fucking</v>

972
00:44:11.751 --> 00:44:14.510
<v Speaker 5>bloody grind and it's filled with dead </v>
<v Speaker 5>bodies.</v>

973
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.880
<v Speaker 5>Some people that just don't make it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't make it.</v>

974
00:44:17.881 --> 00:44:18.590
<v Speaker 5>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

975
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:23.120
<v Speaker 5>it's like any kind of bootcamp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it lasts even longer than it's going</v>

976
00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:24.100
<v Speaker 5>to high school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

977
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like four years and then you graduate,</v>

978
00:44:26.001 --> 00:44:29.020
<v Speaker 5>but some people don't graduate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get held back and killed,</v>

979
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 5>killed by terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And along the way,</v>

980
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Charlie is famous so long this way he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking famous for being hilarious and </v>

981
00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:42.720
<v Speaker 1>he's just starting out or just starting </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and he's headlining.</v>

982
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Remember when we did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a maximum real men,</v>

983
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:46.530
<v Speaker 1>a comedy tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

984
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.860
<v Speaker 1>he had only been doing comedy like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>or three years,</v>

985
00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:55.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's doing 45 minutes in front of </v>

986
00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:56.670
<v Speaker 1>theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people balls,</v>

987

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got balls.</v>

988
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.440
<v Speaker 1>But that's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like being a famous,</v>

989
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:02.630
<v Speaker 1>open miker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

990
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:07.640
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's like for these guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are plagiarists and then all of a </v>

991
00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:07.640
<v Speaker 1>sudden they start trying to write their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own material.</v>

992
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like this dark man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so dark place to be.</v>

993
00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.730
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named Freddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

994
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:15.830
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

995
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Carerra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

996
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.180
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be opening up for Joey </v>
<v Speaker 2>Diaz,</v>

997
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

998
00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.430
<v Speaker 2>later this month in Reno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven to 25 and seven,</v>

999
00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.840
<v Speaker 2>26.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He posted a video,</v>

1000
00:45:25.841 --> 00:45:30.841
<v Speaker 2>he sent me a video the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the heckler spartacus </v>

1001
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:32.920
<v Speaker 2>kick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you feel about this?</v>

1002
00:45:32.921 --> 00:45:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of people actually got mad</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this video.</v>

1003
00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1004
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:41.410
<v Speaker 2>but then I think it makes complete sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you watched that guy.</v>

1005
00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.470
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude is on stage.</v>

1007
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:46.540
<v Speaker 1>This guy comes over to him and touches </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1008
00:45:46.541 --> 00:45:51.541
<v Speaker 1>He says something to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pushes them or touching them </v>

1009
00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:51.541
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

1010
00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:51.880
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking touch me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get your fucking hands off me.</v>

1011
00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:55.420
<v Speaker 1>The guy leaves and it's a tiny ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>little crowd.</v>

1012
00:45:55.421 --> 00:46:00.421
<v Speaker 1>There's a very small amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people apparently like this </v>

1013
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:00.490
<v Speaker 1>heckler guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the heckler guy,</v>

1014
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this comic get into it again and the</v>

1015
00:46:04.451 --> 00:46:06.640
<v Speaker 1>comic says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking come anywhere near.</v>

1016
00:46:06.641 --> 00:46:11.641
<v Speaker 1>It says like raids zone was given a </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning several times to not put his </v>

1017
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:16.531
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes running up to the stage in </v>

1018
00:46:16.531 --> 00:46:19.321
<v Speaker 1>full stride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this dude just front kicks right in </v>

1019
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:19.321
<v Speaker 1>the chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:20.870
<v Speaker 2>300 style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:46:20.871 --> 00:46:22.760
<v Speaker 2>I guess the guys in front kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good technique.</v>

1022
00:46:22.761 --> 00:46:24.170
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's named red zone,</v>

1023
00:46:24.171 --> 00:46:26.120
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's a local comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1024
00:46:26.121 --> 00:46:28.190
<v Speaker 2>this guy that has the aluminum foil on </v>
<v Speaker 2>his head.</v>

1025
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.780
<v Speaker 2>He's a local comic that just one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys that you know doesn't work.</v>

1026
00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:36.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not working out really for him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he never gets off stage.</v>

1027
00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:40.790
<v Speaker 2>He always does is he won't get off stage</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole time.</v>

1028
00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.290
<v Speaker 2>He had called</v>

1029
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:44.430
<v Speaker 1>people in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's one of those guys that is like a</v>

1030
00:46:44.431 --> 00:46:49.431
<v Speaker 1>social retard that wants attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes to these comedy clubs and </v>

1031
00:46:49.431 --> 00:46:51.930
<v Speaker 1>becomes a part of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as this guy's back in a way,</v>

1032
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:57.230
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm torn because I love the fact that </v>

1033
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Vegas has a comedy scene and open mics </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though there's no one in it.</v>

1034
00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1035
00:46:59.581 --> 00:47:04.581
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas got a little funky little open </v>

1036
00:47:04.581 --> 00:47:04.581
<v Speaker 1>mics because vegas is a weird place.</v>

1037
00:47:04.581 --> 00:47:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you turn this up because it's.</v>

1038
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Audio is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kind of making fun of me.</v>

1039
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Says my room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sits down and some woman is like,</v>

1040
00:47:21.921 --> 00:47:22.760
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love your way.</v>

1041
00:47:22.761 --> 00:47:25.220
<v Speaker 2>She's trying to get some Dick Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it comes.</v>

1042
00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.000
<v Speaker 2>What I tell you</v>

1043
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:36.140
<v Speaker 1>what telling you call an ambulance </v>
<v Speaker 1>should call an ambulance when the guy </v>

1044
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:42.331
<v Speaker 1>goes down like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never know because he could have hit </v>

1045
00:47:42.331 --> 00:47:42.400
<v Speaker 1>his head and he could die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1046
00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1047
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:45.280
<v Speaker 1>so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1048
00:47:45.281 --> 00:47:50.281
<v Speaker 1>you're being melodramatic note.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone front kicks you in the </v>

1049
00:47:50.281 --> 00:47:52.621
<v Speaker 1>chest like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall back easily can hit your head </v>

1050
00:47:52.621 --> 00:47:52.621
<v Speaker 1>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see if he hit his head or not.</v>

1051
00:47:52.621 --> 00:47:53.800
<v Speaker 1>We could watch it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got way back again?</v>

1052
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Fell off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it didn't protect them as unlimited.</v>

1053
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.660
<v Speaker 1>What's not real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1054
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see it and back it up.</v>

1055
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Back it up so I can see it.</v>

1056
00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could easily hit his head.</v>

1057
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1058
00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:18.520
<v Speaker 1>We're playing one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It his legs though.</v>

1059
00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:22.450
<v Speaker 1>He's balanced as you guys go unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>to legs like that.</v>

1060
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.720
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt back like that and it's kind of </v>

1061
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:36.910
<v Speaker 1>like he was doing a pushup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know Brian,</v>

1062
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.230
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1063
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:39.970
<v Speaker 1>That guy got kicked really hard in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>

1064
00:48:39.971 --> 00:48:42.490
<v Speaker 1>He fell back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's lucky that his feet are planted.</v>

1065
00:48:42.491 --> 00:48:47.491
<v Speaker 1>Dairy's not unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he definitely could have banged his </v>

1066
00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:47.491
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would not.</v>

1067
00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:50.080
<v Speaker 1>I would not say that he's faking it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any stretch of the imagination.</v>

1068
00:48:50.081 --> 00:48:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Does a hard kick to the chest and by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1069
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:55.710
<v Speaker 1>the kid is through the kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows how to kick and like go,</v>

1070
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:58.070
<v Speaker 1>go do it one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take it to the kid.</v>

1071
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:00.160
<v Speaker 1>The kid who threw the kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go.</v>

1072
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Just go there to slow motion.</v>

1073
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it like this.</v>

1074
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a guys kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People before guaranteed.</v>

1075
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.700
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even bother taking his hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>off of the mic stand.</v>

1076
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Noticed that death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys know how he knows how to kick.</v>

1077
00:49:12.431 --> 00:49:17.431
<v Speaker 1>He's got some martial arts experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent or someone taught </v>

1078
00:49:17.431 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 1>them how to throw a nasty front kick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows how to do it because the way he</v>

1079
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:22.750
<v Speaker 1>timed it and the way you hit that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit him fucking hard.</v>

1080
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm torn because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy is the guy on the ground is </v>

1081
00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:28.660
<v Speaker 1>obviously a con.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1082
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:30.360
<v Speaker 1>he's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably terrible.</v>

1083
00:49:30.361 --> 00:49:35.361
<v Speaker 1>If you're a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to work with this guy and he </v>

1084
00:49:35.361 --> 00:49:36.150
<v Speaker 1>gets in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1085
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.780
<v Speaker 1>does it mean that he should have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked in the chest like that?</v>

1086
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1087
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.680
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is he was in full </v>
<v Speaker 1>stride to get in that guy's face and if </v>

1088
00:49:46.291 --> 00:49:47.880
<v Speaker 1>the guy didn't want to grapple with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1089
00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:51.870
<v Speaker 1>you get two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy ran right up to him.</v>

1090
00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at him,</v>

1091
00:49:52.951 --> 00:49:55.410
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's walking like he's.</v>

1092
00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:59.250
<v Speaker 1>He got stopped by that kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going to get right to that guy.</v>

1093
00:49:59.251 --> 00:50:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in mid stride,</v>

1094
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.890
<v Speaker 1>not slowing down at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could have pushed that guy.</v>

1095
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:07.170
<v Speaker 1>He could look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's reaching out to them.</v>

1096
00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that guy.</v>

1097
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.670
<v Speaker 1>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1098
00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1099
00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:14.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the fact that he banged his</v>

1100
00:50:14.731 --> 00:50:18.870
<v Speaker 1>head and literally he could get really </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly hurt in a situation like that.</v>

1101
00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:19.230
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1102
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.570
<v Speaker 2>at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the video also,</v>

1103
00:50:21.571 --> 00:50:23.640
<v Speaker 2>the guy had already grabbed him like </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1104
00:50:23.641 --> 00:50:28.641
<v Speaker 2>don't grab me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the beginning of the video is </v>

1105
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:28.641
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1106
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:28.641
<v Speaker 2>I'm warning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not come up here.</v>

1107
00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:29.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1108
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:30.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1109
00:50:30.831 --> 00:50:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm for it.</v>

1110
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think the guy's a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is the club should have </v>

1111
00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:41.171
<v Speaker 1>got rid of that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't let somebody grab people like </v>

1112
00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:41.171
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

1113
00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Someone run up the stage like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1114
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably can't afford security.</v>

1115
00:50:44.301 --> 00:50:45.710
<v Speaker 1>There's only five people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

1116
00:50:45.711 --> 00:50:50.711
<v Speaker 1>We're going to hire some guy was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat up your profits to stand around </v>

1117
00:50:50.711 --> 00:50:53.090
<v Speaker 1>there looking big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's fucked.</v>

1118
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:58.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg Fitzsimmons gotten a scrap once it </v>

1119
00:50:58.330 --> 00:50:58.490

<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1120
00:50:58.491 --> 00:50:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I missed the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

1121
00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1122
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 1>some guy was in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy was heckling greg tool them.</v>

1123
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy ran up onto the stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and grab greg and they fucking scuffled </v>

1124
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.340
<v Speaker 1>like they literally got into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fistfight.</v>

1125
00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.400
<v Speaker 1>The bouncers came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragged guy offstage.</v>

1126
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Greg stood up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brushed himself off and goes,</v>

1127
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:17.930
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

1128
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:22.130

<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1129
00:51:22.131 --> 00:51:23.750
<v Speaker 1>who's next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:30.821
<v Speaker 1>The fights are interesting except that </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily at the comedy store anywhere on </v>

1133
00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:34.601
<v Speaker 1>sunset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easily more like he's going to gun </v>

1134
00:51:34.601 --> 00:51:37.451
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been so many of those nights </v>

<v Speaker 1>chick shows and was mocking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing about how it must've looked </v>

1180
00:53:23.381 --> 00:53:23.720
<v Speaker 1>like spinning around in a circle.</v>

1181

<v Speaker 1>You never heard that dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Play a jam because it's really awful </v>

1183
00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:34.870
<v Speaker 1>because imagine if there was a show like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man's show and it's,</v>

1185
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:38.940

<v Speaker 1>And on that show,</v>

1186
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:43.830
<v Speaker 1>a guy had cut his wife's clit off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it in a garbage disposal,</v>

1187
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian style,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1190
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:52.890
<v Speaker 1>that horrible genital mutilation they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a young lady's.</v>

1191
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Imagine someone who was on TV marketing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>

1192
00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:59.010
<v Speaker 1>imagine what the Luke Luke just spinning</v>
<v Speaker 1>around in circles.</v>

1193
00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 1>This guy's life is ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the circumstances.</v>

1194
00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:07.071
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he filed the divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what was going on between </v>

1195
00:54:07.071 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1196
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I do think it's quite fabulous.</v>

1197
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:15.820
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's quite fabulous.</v>

1198
00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.320
<v Speaker 7>Cool.</v>

1199
00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>

1200
00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.100

1201
00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:32.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awful that someone would say </v>

1202
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:32.550
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1203
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:32.980
<v Speaker 1>what is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something else,</v>

1204
00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:35.440
<v Speaker 1>why she cut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1205
00:54:35.441 --> 00:54:39.400
<v Speaker 1>it does depend on the reasons why does </v>
<v Speaker 1>it fuck her.</v>

1206
00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Poor Ozzie married to that monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible thing to think.</v>

1207
00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would anybody think that unless the </v>

1208
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.410
<v Speaker 1>guy had done something horrible like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to her and she got a hold of him,</v>

1209
00:54:53.411 --> 00:54:58.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he cut her clit off and she waited </v>

1210
00:54:58.411 --> 00:54:58.411
<v Speaker 1>until he went to bed and cut his dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1211
00:54:58.411 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an eye for an eye and they're </v>

1212
00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Speaker 1>both blind now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what happened.</v>

1213
00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Whenever the fuck he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1214
00:55:04.511 --> 00:55:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that she could mark that.</v>

1215
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what my original point was.</v>

1216
00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.020
<v Speaker 2>What do you think are those explosions </v>
<v Speaker 2>in China?</v>

1217
00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's just what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying it is?</v>

1218
00:55:15.141 --> 00:55:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Or do you think that's like a secret </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear underground,</v>

1219
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear base that there.</v>

1220
00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you talking about nuclear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1221
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:23.150
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1222
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:25.870
<v Speaker 2>we recently found out that China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly it was,</v>

1223
00:55:25.871 --> 00:55:28.820
<v Speaker 2>it China that hack the Pentagon and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just seems like,</v>

1224
00:55:28.821 --> 00:55:33.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of weeks later now there's </v>

1225
00:55:33.821 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 2>nuclear size explosions in their cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a conspiracy theory.</v>

1226
00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:37.190
<v Speaker 2>China is enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1227
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying China is.</v>

1228
00:55:38.691 --> 00:55:38.840
<v Speaker 2>If</v>

1229
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:40.580
<v Speaker 1>it's like this fucking one block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1230
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Like we're attacking compton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like China's an enormous spot and </v>

1231
00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:49.630
<v Speaker 1>China's a big industrial spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's constantly a bunch of shit </v>

1232
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:50.420
<v Speaker 1>that can go wrong and blow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1233
00:55:50.421 --> 00:55:52.100
<v Speaker 1>that's just what happens when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>building things.</v>

1234
00:55:52.101 --> 00:55:57.101
<v Speaker 1>You're using engines and fire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline compression and it easily.</v>

1235
00:55:57.331 --> 00:55:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It can be what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A chemical plant blew up.</v>

1236
00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:01.160
<v Speaker 1>They blow up all the time when they blow</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1237
00:56:01.161 --> 00:56:03.650
<v Speaker 1>it's God damn terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just never seen it that bad.</v>

1238
00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:06.010
<v Speaker 2>It looks like some of the new angles </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1239
00:56:06.011 --> 00:56:06.840
<v Speaker 2>show some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1240
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I sent one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the same one that I was </v>

1241
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:12.220
<v Speaker 2>talking about where it literally goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's three explosions.</v>

1242
00:56:12.221 --> 00:56:13.150
<v Speaker 2>The first one's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1243
00:56:13.151 --> 00:56:14.230
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying like,</v>

1244
00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:19.260
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a gas station maybe blew </v>

1245
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:19.260
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the second one,</v>

1246
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:19.260
<v Speaker 2>it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1247
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:22.741
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is starting to look like a </v>

1248
00:56:22.741 --> 00:56:22.741
<v Speaker 2>transformers the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the third one just like,</v>

1249
00:56:22.741 --> 00:56:24.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the end of rural explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1250
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:29.610
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a video that I think it's the right one </v>

1251
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.680
<v Speaker 2>is literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it's across the street </v>

1252
00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:34.680
<v Speaker 2>almost and it's a great angle.</v>

1253
00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:39.680
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen the one where the guys inside </v>

1254
00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.090
<v Speaker 5>the convenience store and the blast hits</v>
<v Speaker 5>him and the wall just knocks him back.</v>

1255
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:44.800
<v Speaker 5>The windows knock him back and he looks </v>
<v Speaker 5>like he got fucked up.</v>

1256
00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what happened to the dude </v>
<v Speaker 5>in that picture,</v>

1257
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.370
<v Speaker 5>but the blast from it.</v>

1258
00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

1259
00:56:49.581 --> 00:56:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Now this is cool because the </v>

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.540
<v Speaker 5>I like your bad accent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the most harsh.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1321
01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.760
<v Speaker 5>left the gas on and set like some sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a timer and set some sort of a device</v>

1322
01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:26.850
<v Speaker 5>to ignite it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it blew the house up,</v>

1323
01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:31.880
<v Speaker 5>he was doing it for an insurance scam </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he went to jail for murder because </v>

1324
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:32.820
<v Speaker 5>you wind up killing his neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>

<v Speaker 5>done from a line inside a person's house</v>

<v Speaker 5>you could just do that.</v>

1330
01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 5>Like if you were a nut and you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to turn your gas on and sit </v>

1334
01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:04.700
<v Speaker 5>This makes sure that this is the right </v>
<v Speaker 5>one because there have been like </v>

1335

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's Indiana too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1340
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.150
<v Speaker 5>that's where it happened at famous </v>
<v Speaker 5>video.</v>

1341
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:17.520
<v Speaker 5>The house blowing up at that came out a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of years ago where,</v>

1342
01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1343
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:23.091
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm talking about Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Nice house where the helicopter </v>

1344
01:01:23.091 --> 01:01:23.091
<v Speaker 5>going around the house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1345
01:01:23.091 --> 01:01:23.790
<v Speaker 5>It was a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a fire going on,</v>

1346
01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:28.791
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the house exploded in the </v>

1347
01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:28.791
<v Speaker 5>middle of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this guy just left the fucking gas on</v>

1348
01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:31.050
<v Speaker 5>and then said we're going to make some </v>
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>

1349
01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:36.380
<v Speaker 5>but just look at these three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get caught at the guy on the far </v>

1350
01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.230
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You almost don't blame him.</v>

1351
01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:40.170
<v Speaker 5>Right whenever that chicken in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle says,</v>

1352
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.300
<v Speaker 5>I'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How hard was that guy's life?</v>

1353
01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.430
<v Speaker 5>The guy in the far right with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>glasses.</v>

1354
01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:47.760
<v Speaker 5>How hard must have his life had been his</v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

1355
01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:52.110
<v Speaker 5>We're looking at this guy who looks like</v>
<v Speaker 5>William h macy,</v>

1356
01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.050
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had sex with</v>

1357
01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.990
<v Speaker 5>somebody to the left and somebody to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1358
01:01:58.991 --> 01:02:02.110
<v Speaker 5>Now it looks like William h macy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>vandelay Silva is,</v>

1359
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.120
<v Speaker 5>knows postsurgery with a one wonky I </v>
<v Speaker 5>poor bastard.</v>

1360
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.090
<v Speaker 5>Look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1361
01:02:10.091 --> 01:02:14.020
<v Speaker 5>I think was just a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guys just lived a life of misery,</v>

1362
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.150
<v Speaker 5>misery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and very little love.</v>

1363
01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:21.540
<v Speaker 5>It's just got this feel about them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they decided they were going to </v>

1364
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:24.990
<v Speaker 5>make some money from a insurance money </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you have a sideways.</v>

1365
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:29.991
<v Speaker 5>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you actually have better vision than </v>

1366
01:02:29.991 --> 01:02:30.600
<v Speaker 5>print it from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1367
01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:32.610
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe you have a way better vision </v>
<v Speaker 5>that way.</v>

1368
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:37.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think actually fucks up your straight </v>

1369
01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 5>vision because you're always getting a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit of this side stuff in there.</v>

1370
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.460
<v Speaker 5>It's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's probably fucks with your.</v>

1371
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.570
<v Speaker 5>Your straight ahead vision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

1372
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:46.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it would.</v>

1373
01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:48.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you can move them independently,</v>

1374
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:53.780
<v Speaker 5>like some sort of a chameleon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're supposed to have eyes in front of </v>

1375
01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:54.210
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1376
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:57.720
<v Speaker 5>The idea being that's one of the main </v>
<v Speaker 5>indicators that were predators.</v>

1377
01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:02.750
<v Speaker 5>We have eyes in front of us because </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're looking forward to killing things </v>

1378
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:06.231
<v Speaker 5>were not looking on our sides like deer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the reason why deer have on the </v>

1379
01:03:06.231 --> 01:03:06.231
<v Speaker 5>side of their head because they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrified.</v>

1380
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.130
<v Speaker 5>They have to look at what's over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's over there.</v>

1381
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.900
<v Speaker 5>You know they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can look.</v>

1382
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:14.960
<v Speaker 5>They can be going sideways like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their head can be totally facing </v>

1383
01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:14.960
<v Speaker 5>sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can look right at you.</v>

1384
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:18.390
<v Speaker 5>We can't do that because we don't need </v>
<v Speaker 5>to worry as much about getting flanked.</v>

1385
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.920
<v Speaker 5>We're usually the pursuers and not to </v>
<v Speaker 5>pursue.</v>

1386
01:03:20.921 --> 01:03:23.230
<v Speaker 5>He's speaking of pursuers and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>pursuing.</v>

1387
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:26.880
<v Speaker 5>He's running with the Bulls was </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly successful this season.</v>

1388
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:31.650
<v Speaker 5>The bowls scored seven kills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1389
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:34.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the highest risk is a big one.</v>

1390
01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.360
<v Speaker 5>It's a big year for them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're very excited.</v>

1391
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:37.290
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1392
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:42.291
<v Speaker 5>they went back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the slaughterhouse and we're pretty </v>

1393
01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:42.630
<v Speaker 5>pumped before they got killed because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1394
01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.800
<v Speaker 5>I think they killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1395
01:03:43.801 --> 01:03:48.801
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what happens with the </v>

1396
01:03:48.801 --> 01:03:48.801
<v Speaker 5>bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens with the Bulls and they run</v>

1397
01:03:48.801 --> 01:03:49.230
<v Speaker 5>with the Bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like bullfighting,</v>

1398
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:54.260
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they just fight and fight and </v>

1399
01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:54.260
<v Speaker 5>fight and fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to have to talk.</v>

1400
01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:58.520
<v Speaker 5>We can't just only look at laptops here </v>
<v Speaker 5>because otherwise I'm only talking to </v>

1401
01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.730
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm listening and interacting.</v>

1402
01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.570
<v Speaker 5>Sending new links.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1403
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:04.200
<v Speaker 5>well let's just talk about the bowl </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing because it's so ridiculous.</v>

1404
01:04:04.201 --> 01:04:05.100
<v Speaker 5>Pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Champion,</v>

1405
01:04:05.101 --> 01:04:07.140
<v Speaker 5>because it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's seven people died.</v>

1406
01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.880
<v Speaker 5>Why the fuck do they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

1407
01:04:08.881 --> 01:04:11.250
<v Speaker 5>that's what I guess it's a thrill.</v>

1408
01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:14.430
<v Speaker 5>Is that the idea behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a tradition.</v>

1409
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:16.230
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1410
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.680
<v Speaker 5>So slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should we go back to that tradition?</v>

1411
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:22.680
<v Speaker 5>The inquisition was kind of a tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Slavery still exists,</v>

1412
01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:25.590
<v Speaker 5>you just get paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 people died at 10 now.</v>

1413
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:27.660
<v Speaker 5>Three more for this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1414
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:32.100
<v Speaker 5>it's been this really good week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bowls are and pull it up,</v>

1415
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.030
<v Speaker 5>put,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put some shit up.</v>

1416
01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:39.020
<v Speaker 5>Look at this for more gored to death </v>
<v Speaker 5>across Spain as surge and bull run </v>

1417
01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:44.751
<v Speaker 5>casualties continue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope the bowls are just getting </v>

1418
01:04:44.751 --> 01:04:47.511
<v Speaker 5>smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look how fucking big they are and look </v>

1419
01:04:47.511 --> 01:04:47.511
<v Speaker 5>how many people there are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's fucked up.</v>

1420
01:04:47.511 --> 01:04:49.800
<v Speaker 5>There's way too many people to get out </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the way.</v>

1421
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:55.040
<v Speaker 5>You just can't get out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She got these bowls and they're real </v>

1422
01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.241
<v Speaker 5>bowls with full on horns and these real </v>
<v Speaker 5>bowls are just running into these packed</v>

1423
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.880
<v Speaker 5>avenues of people and just knowing them </v>
<v Speaker 5>over and killing them fucking </v>

1424
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:09.810
<v Speaker 5>ridiculously stupid has got to be one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dumbest ways to die.</v>

1425
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:14.670
<v Speaker 5>I wrote this article about this long </v>
<v Speaker 5>time ago joking around about how dumb it</v>

1426
01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:19.671
<v Speaker 5>was and this guy got really mad at me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like my teacher,</v>

1427
01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.770
<v Speaker 5>my professor did that and it's all about</v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciating the culture and like,</v>

1428
01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.530
<v Speaker 5>how come you can't just go to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country?</v>

1429
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.560
<v Speaker 5>Why do you have to run from a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal to appreciate the culture?</v>

1430
01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:32.410
<v Speaker 5>Did you say thing burt was doing this </v>
<v Speaker 5>week and I've seen it before.</v>

1431
01:05:32.411 --> 01:05:35.770
<v Speaker 5>They chase cheese down a hill and these </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys run down a hill and get hurt.</v>

1432
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:37.900
<v Speaker 5>Similar done thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1433
01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.450
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to chase the cheese </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheeses and trying to kill you.</v>

1434
01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 5>This is totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is so gross,</v>

1435
01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:48.841
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Spain's economic crisis is forced to </v>

1436
01:05:48.841 --> 01:05:50.620
<v Speaker 5>sharp drop in the number of bull fights </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the country with about 300 fewer bull</v>

1437
01:05:50.621 --> 01:05:54.070
<v Speaker 5>fights scheduled for this year as </v>
<v Speaker 5>compared to the years before the crisis.</v>

1438
01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:59.250
<v Speaker 5>Yet the number of ranchers who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>raising fighting bowles has stayed the </v>

1439
01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:02.761
<v Speaker 5>same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only way out for these ranchers </v>

1440
01:06:02.761 --> 01:06:05.761
<v Speaker 5>would be in the festivals and these </v>
<v Speaker 5>municipalities so suggests that many of </v>

1441
01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:08.860
<v Speaker 5>the bowls that would have been destined </v>
<v Speaker 5>for bull fights or instead running along</v>

1442
01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:13.861
<v Speaker 5>the streets of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking crazy because those are </v>

1443
01:06:13.861 --> 01:06:18.210
<v Speaker 5>really big bowls and they're really </v>
<v Speaker 5>ferocious and they come from a long line</v>

1444
01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:22.180
<v Speaker 5>of Bulls that have been almost bred for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that shit.</v>

1445
01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 5>They're doing it in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

1446
01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:28.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like little set of bull runs and you can</v>

1447
01:06:28.121 --> 01:06:30.640
<v Speaker 5>go run through these things right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It says right there,</v>

1448
01:06:30.641 --> 01:06:35.290
<v Speaker 5>these are bulls with more power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more capacity to charge a said Lorca,</v>

1449
01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:38.050
<v Speaker 5>whoever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a of the bowls being used for small town</v>

1450
01:06:38.051 --> 01:06:43.051
<v Speaker 5>bull runs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said that an encounter with one of </v>

1451
01:06:43.051 --> 01:06:45.001
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of these would likely do more harm </v>

1452
01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:45.001
<v Speaker 5>than the bowls of previous years.</v>

1453
01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 5>Obviously you've got fucking 11 deaths </v>
<v Speaker 5>this year.</v>

1454
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.560
<v Speaker 5>What a cluster fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in the US they're using them to </v>

1455
01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.830
<v Speaker 5>clean out homeless populations by </v>
<v Speaker 5>putting them downtown at night.</v>

1456
01:06:55.380 --> 01:07:00.380
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine if they did that though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had like a bull run every once a </v>

1457
01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:01.450
<v Speaker 5>week and they just play almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>home was like,</v>

1458
01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:02.620
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll get this bolt.</v>

1459
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:04.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the real problem is not the fatality.</v>

1460
01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.750
<v Speaker 5>It's the homeless people that survive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be even worse.</v>

1461
01:07:07.751 --> 01:07:09.820
<v Speaker 5>You're going to take care of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>people for the rest of their lives.</v>

1462
01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.020
<v Speaker 5>This is the whole thing is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>gross.</v>

1463
01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:19.350
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is completely ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 5>as well as the bull fights are fucking </v>

1464
01:07:19.481 --> 01:07:21.740
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because first of all there,</v>

1465
01:07:21.741 --> 01:07:23.890
<v Speaker 5>you're not really fighting that bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1466
01:07:23.891 --> 01:07:26.710
<v Speaker 5>You're stabbing it with spears and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're running around.</v>

1467
01:07:26.711 --> 01:07:29.610
<v Speaker 5>Other people get to stab it and some of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the spears are.</v>

1468
01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:34.830
<v Speaker 5>They have a poisoning them man gored to </v>
<v Speaker 5>death filming bull run in Spain on </v>

1469
01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:37.800
<v Speaker 5>mobile phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>World store.</v>

1470
01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:46.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a great video of a guy getting </v>

1471
01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:46.780
<v Speaker 5>one up the asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean great really,</v>

1472
01:07:46.781 --> 01:07:47.890
<v Speaker 5>but I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1473
01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.840
<v Speaker 5>You seen that one where the guy gets the</v>
<v Speaker 5>horns right up the ass hole.</v>

1474
01:07:50.841 --> 01:07:52.810
<v Speaker 5>So horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like Jesus Christ.</v>

1475
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:57.730
<v Speaker 5>He got his fingers torn open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His rectum was torn apart.</v>

1476
01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.020
<v Speaker 5>Rectum nearly killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1477
01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that was when the first animated</v>

1478

01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:12.190
<v Speaker 5>but you just from it loading so slow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's ugly.</v>

1481

<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people know that this guy's got </v>

1482
01:08:17.191 --> 01:08:17.191
<v Speaker 5>one in the face.</v>

1483
01:08:17.191 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's go through all these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go through all these please,</v>

1486

<v Speaker 1>seems like it's going right through his </v>

1487
01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:28.690
<v Speaker 1>cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what's happening here?</v>

1488
01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1489
01:08:29.571 --> 01:08:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right through his cheek.</v>

1490
01:08:31.131 --> 01:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Look at the fucking impact through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1491
01:08:34.071 --> 01:08:35.900
<v Speaker 1>It's going through his eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

1492
01:08:35.901 --> 01:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Brian will get it through his eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1493
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:45.430
<v Speaker 1>as a confirmed member of team people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot say that I'm happy about this,</v>

1494
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.110
<v Speaker 1>but there are too many people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five and I think the only way to</v>

1495
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:56.111
<v Speaker 1>stop that is to kill off a few retards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to kill off the good </v>

1496
01:08:56.111 --> 01:08:57.740
<v Speaker 1>people and they're not saying this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was retarded,</v>

1497
01:08:57.770 --> 01:09:00.190
<v Speaker 1>but his occupation most certainly was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1498
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe just as a hard way out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1499
01:09:01.941 --> 01:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get off that photo.</v>

1500
01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:07.770
<v Speaker 1>He was a bull fighter and his family's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullfighters like,</v>

1501
01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.140
<v Speaker 1>don't be a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

1502
01:09:09.141 --> 01:09:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1503
01:09:09.701 --> 01:09:14.701
<v Speaker 1>this is a different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get one of the face is a different one </v>

1504
01:09:14.701 --> 01:09:14.701
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different dude,</v>

1505
01:09:14.701 --> 01:09:15.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

1506
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Is it because the horns look different </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the other one,</v>

1507
01:09:19.161 --> 01:09:22.070
<v Speaker 1>the horns were black and this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're white.</v>

1508
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:26.390
<v Speaker 1>See the tips are white and black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a blue thing sticking out of his</v>

1509
01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:27.410
<v Speaker 1>net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to the first one again.</v>

1510
01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the same guy.</v>

1511
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Might be the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might just be the resolution.</v>

1512
01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Picked up the actual cover color of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms better.</v>

1513
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:39.220
<v Speaker 1>That's dark shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1514
01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Having horns go through your fucking eye</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's his eyeball.</v>

1515
01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Blown out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No shoe either.</v>

1516
01:09:44.891 --> 01:09:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Lost a shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor bastard.</v>

1517
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.370
<v Speaker 3>I got something better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That will clean the palate of seeing all</v>

1518
01:09:52.371 --> 01:09:57.371
<v Speaker 3>that disgusting shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that little Asian girl </v>

1519
01:09:57.371 --> 01:09:57.371
<v Speaker 3>that can hypnotize animals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She puts.</v>

1520
01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.030
<v Speaker 3>She puts like seven different animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1521
01:10:00.031 --> 01:10:03.140
<v Speaker 3>on this table and at first it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lizard and she's like.</v>

1522
01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.440
<v Speaker 3>And then the lizard just passes out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then she goes to a dog and that dog </v>

1523
01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.130
<v Speaker 3>passes out and then a frog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See this?</v>

1524
01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:14.780
<v Speaker 3>This involves two things for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It involves Asian girls.</v>

1525
01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1526
01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:18.590
<v Speaker 3>the baby might not be real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1527
01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:20.630
<v Speaker 3>this is on a game show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1528
01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:21.920
<v Speaker 3>And it's definitely real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1529
01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1530
01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:27.020
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty interesting because at one </v>
<v Speaker 3>point she's like,</v>

1531
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:29.960
<v Speaker 3>she has like a certain time limit to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>down all these animals.</v>

1532
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:34.010
<v Speaker 3>At one point the dog wakes up was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck happened?</v>

1533
01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.900
<v Speaker 3>I just sent you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is amazing though.</v>

1534
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:36.280
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1535
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.560
<v Speaker 1>like it would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>

1536
01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.100
<v Speaker 1>how can someone hypnotize a dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1537
01:10:42.101 --> 01:10:46.390
<v Speaker 1>So here's the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what does the sky ladder.</v>

1538
01:10:46.391 --> 01:10:47.320
<v Speaker 1>What is all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1539
01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:52.390
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog lays down</v>

1540
01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:57.090
<v Speaker 3>and then the guys pretending that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>falling asleep too.</v>

1541
01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the dog just.</v>

1542
01:10:59.650 --> 01:11:02.970
<v Speaker 3>She just hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a puppy that's lying down.</v>

1543
01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1544
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the dog</v>

1545
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:18.030
<v Speaker 3>is just good at laying down like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cute lizard though.</v>

1546
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:23.510
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] ad lizards awake by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She flips the lizard upside down and </v>

1547
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:26.100
<v Speaker 3>then just starts rubbing the belly and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1548
01:11:26.101 --> 01:11:28.590
<v Speaker 3>well do you know that that's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to put lizards asleep.</v>

1549
01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:30.690
<v Speaker 3>That's why you do that with crocodiles </v>
<v Speaker 3>and alligators.</v>

1550
01:11:30.691 --> 01:11:35.691
<v Speaker 3>You put them on their back and rub their</v>
<v Speaker 3>belly and they pass out and I didn't </v>

1551
01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:35.691
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of cool.</v>

1552
01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:37.950
<v Speaker 3>I like seeing her do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially.</v>

1553
01:11:37.951 --> 01:11:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Sure that that's the case with lizards </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

1554
01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 3>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you lay on their back,</v>

1555
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:48.470
<v Speaker 3>it's the way they're designed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that's what I read about a </v>

1556
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.110
<v Speaker 3>sharks as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like sharks,</v>

1557
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:54.111
<v Speaker 3>if you flip them upside down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about the way they're </v>

1558
01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:56.841
<v Speaker 3>designed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they're designed by the big guy </v>

1559
01:11:56.841 --> 01:11:59.091
<v Speaker 3>upstairs that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do that to them for whatever </v>

1560
01:11:59.091 --> 01:11:59.130
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't stay conscious.</v>

1561
01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:01.710
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's something about structure to</v>

1562
01:12:01.711 --> 01:12:04.950
<v Speaker 3>like push them if they get stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they can't move or something.</v>

1563
01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Do you know I'm talking about what do </v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean they can't move like a few </v>

1564
01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:14.330
<v Speaker 3>reinserted shark in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kind of have to give it a little </v>

1565
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:14.330
<v Speaker 3>scoot or it won't be able to swim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1566
01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:19.890
<v Speaker 3>That kind of makes sense because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>always constantly in motion in some ways</v>

1567
01:12:19.891 --> 01:12:21.780
<v Speaker 3>that make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they might not know what to do.</v>

1568
01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.550
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I'm bill Nye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Factors entered my brain.</v>

1569
01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:25.080
<v Speaker 3>That's all I was asking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be true.</v>

1570
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:31.070
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not impressed with the lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is fraud figured out that it was on its </v>

1571
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.470
<v Speaker 3>back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You flipped back over.</v>

1572
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.500
<v Speaker 3>Why is it so interesting too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because she,</v>

1573
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.010
<v Speaker 3>she does it to a bunny rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She does it to a bird.</v>

1574
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:41.970
<v Speaker 3>She does it to a dog and she covered the</v>
<v Speaker 3>birds face.</v>

1575
01:12:41.970 --> 01:12:44.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do if you cover the face</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a,</v>

1576
01:12:44.131 --> 01:12:46.980
<v Speaker 3>like a blanket like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The verge freaks out and just lays there</v>

1577
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.380
<v Speaker 3>like I was just trying to get off of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussing bowl.</v>

1578
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is stupid as fuck.</v>

1579
01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:57.050
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you made me watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about the truck crashing into a </v>

1580
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:59.570
<v Speaker 3>highway sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This truck was driving down the highway </v>

1581
01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:00.270
<v Speaker 3>and somebody dashboard cam catches the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truck.</v>

1582
01:13:00.271 --> 01:13:05.271
<v Speaker 3>Hit one of those overpass signs that say</v>
<v Speaker 3>like up ahead I five and stuff like </v>

1583
01:13:05.271 --> 01:13:05.730
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1584
01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:09.540
<v Speaker 3>it was too tall for the overpass and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very scary.</v>

1585
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1586
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:13.860
<v Speaker 3>it's a very scary video that to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it scary?</v>

1587
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:15.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

1588
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.880
<v Speaker 3>it hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a car accident.</v>

1589
01:13:17.881 --> 01:13:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were behind that and here it</v>

1590
01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:23.250
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

1591
01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.620
<v Speaker 3>And that's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1592
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:28.380
<v Speaker 3>didn't even tip over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking impressive as shit.</v>

1593
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:33.770
<v Speaker 3>So what did they had to load up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've forgotten the loader was up and </v>

1594
01:13:33.770 --> 01:13:33.770
<v Speaker 3>they were driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1595
01:13:33.770 --> 01:13:36.860
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like a dump truck thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was up and they didn't know.</v>

1596
01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.410
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked for you,</v>

1597
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:40.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you fucking dope.</v>

1598
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.440
<v Speaker 3>You can even just look before you drive </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the highway,</v>

1599
01:13:43.441 --> 01:13:45.930
<v Speaker 3>you fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1600
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.560
<v Speaker 3>That's probably a big problem with </v>
<v Speaker 3>running a company though,</v>

1601
01:13:49.561 --> 01:13:51.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That you have idiots.</v>

1602
01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1603
01:13:52.441 --> 01:13:55.140
<v Speaker 3>If you have people drive and shit around</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you like rocks,</v>

1604
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:59.520
<v Speaker 3>you've got a bucket of rocks in the back</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that thing or you know,</v>

1605
01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.650
<v Speaker 3>tractor trailer full of rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1606
01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:05.520
<v Speaker 3>And you have these dummies that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>working for you dumping these rocks off.</v>

1607
01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:09.810
<v Speaker 3>And then we dropped it off with Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we should lower that thing.</v>

1608
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 3>The time</v>

1609
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:17.970
<v Speaker 5>I do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just takes on the highway like that </v>

1610
01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:17.970
<v Speaker 5>destroys that sign.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Flux.</v>

1611
01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:18.980
<v Speaker 5>You got to pay for that sign too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1612
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:20.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure that company has to pay for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>sign.</v>

1613
01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:24.640
<v Speaker 5>We used to have employees because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>used to be a manager for a long time.</v>

1614
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:29.660
<v Speaker 5>You still have two gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those people out there with an </v>

1615
01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:31.270
<v Speaker 5>actual job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we them Brian being your boss.</v>

1616
01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:35.410
<v Speaker 5>The worst though is that when you hire </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody and then you realized,</v>

1617
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was such a mistake and you can't.</v>

1618
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:41.440
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard just to fire somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to go through like certain,</v>

1619
01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>laws and stuff like that.</v>

1620
01:14:43.451 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're were like,</v>

1621
01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:46.780
<v Speaker 5>especially the government jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>government jobs is real hard,</v>

1622
01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:47.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we learned that.</v>

1623
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.930
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I kind of always knew it,</v>

1624
01:14:49.931 --> 01:14:54.931
<v Speaker 5>but we really learned that when it came </v>
<v Speaker 5>to Nevada and referees and judges for </v>

1625
01:14:54.931 --> 01:14:58.180
<v Speaker 5>mma really hard to get a judge fired </v>
<v Speaker 5>really hard.</v>

1626
01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:03.270
<v Speaker 5>Like they can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they could prove to be absolutely </v>

1627
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.430
<v Speaker 5>totally incompetent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's like working at the DMV,</v>

1628
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:05.620
<v Speaker 5>like once you have one of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>government jobs,</v>

1629
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:10.830
<v Speaker 5>like you're a government official,</v>
<v Speaker 5>official officiator a someone who judges</v>

1630
01:15:11.351 --> 01:15:14.890
<v Speaker 5>fights like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might as well have a job working for</v>

1631
01:15:14.891 --> 01:15:18.190
<v Speaker 5>any other government agency.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's super difficult to fire you.</v>

1632
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Especially with something like like </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights,</v>

1633
01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:23.650
<v Speaker 5>because if you watch a fight and you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>seen a bunch of fights,</v>

1634
01:15:23.651 --> 01:15:25.270
<v Speaker 5>you kind of know who won,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who doesn't want,</v>

1635
01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:30.271
<v Speaker 5>but it's subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you might decide that one person </v>

1636
01:15:30.271 --> 01:15:33.361
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Jamie might decide that another </v>

1637
01:15:33.361 --> 01:15:35.161
<v Speaker 5>person one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there are fights where people </v>

1638
01:15:35.161 --> 01:15:36.580
<v Speaker 5>adamantly like argue one way or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>

1639
01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.760
<v Speaker 5>but there's some that are just </v>
<v Speaker 5>undeniable.</v>

1640
01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.430
<v Speaker 5>And when you get those undeniable ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

1641
01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.600
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck were you watching?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did this guy win?</v>

1642
01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:45.820
<v Speaker 5>And those undeniable ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to step in,</v>

1643
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:46.660
<v Speaker 5>you've got to fire people.</v>

1644
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:48.010
<v Speaker 5>And they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just can't.</v>

1645
01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:51.880
<v Speaker 5>You can't because it's a subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All this person has to do is say,</v>

1646
01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:52.310
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1647
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:56.530
<v Speaker 5>I officiated 100,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a hundred different fighting shows and I</v>

1648
01:15:56.531 --> 01:16:00.760
<v Speaker 5>was a never criticized for any of those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most time you don't get criticized.</v>

1649
01:16:00.761 --> 01:16:03.430
<v Speaker 5>It has to be completely egregious before</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get criticized.</v>

1650
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:06.280
<v Speaker 5>But it's fucking hard as shit to fire </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those people,</v>

1651
01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.540
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1652
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:12.590
<v Speaker 5>they dig their heels in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if they're a part of a </v>

1653
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.590
<v Speaker 5>minority group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1654
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:14.140
<v Speaker 5>then they can get people behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1655
01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.160
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've literally heard that conversation </v>

1656
01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:19.160
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like someone say,</v>

1657
01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:23.940
<v Speaker 5>well there'd be two different problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of firing someone is hard and then </v>

1658
01:16:24.191 --> 01:16:28.150
<v Speaker 5>firing someone who might be black or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman they go is even harder.</v>

1659
01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 5>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to be kidding me.</v>

1660
01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:31.660
<v Speaker 5>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you fire a judge,</v>

1661
01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.840
<v Speaker 5>it's not based on their competency,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some of it has to be considered </v>

1662
01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:36.840
<v Speaker 5>whether or not they're black or a woman.</v>

1663
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:37.840
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely,</v>

1664
01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:39.040
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1665
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:40.780
<v Speaker 5>you might as well be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

1666
01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:42.700
<v Speaker 5>firing someone who works for any other </v>
<v Speaker 5>government,</v>

1667
01:16:42.701 --> 01:16:44.590
<v Speaker 5>government agency,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to treat it like that.</v>

1668
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:47.920
<v Speaker 5>Whereas like you would just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like roast battle.</v>

1669
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:49.690
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's put roast battle and contexts,</v>

1670
01:16:49.691 --> 01:16:54.691
<v Speaker 5>which is an awesome show that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>judge and it's very rare that anybody </v>

1671
01:16:54.691 --> 01:16:56.410
<v Speaker 5>disagrees on who won the roast battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it can get close,</v>

1672
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:57.460
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can get closed.</v>

1673
01:16:57.490 --> 01:16:58.990
<v Speaker 5>It gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets weird.</v>

1674
01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:00.970
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes people are biased,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1675
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get biased or they're just doing it</v>

1676
01:17:02.531 --> 01:17:04.910
<v Speaker 5>because they want to see another round,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the scoring part.</v>

1677
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:08.140
<v Speaker 5>Not really even real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know sometimes that does happen,</v>

1678
01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:11.570
<v Speaker 5>that definitely happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when a guy gets trounced,</v>

1679
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.630
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1680
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:18.620
<v Speaker 5>But in fights guys have gotten trounced </v>
<v Speaker 5>and still lost or still one,</v>

1681
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:20.210
<v Speaker 5>I think I got his ass kicked.</v>

1682
01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:22.100
<v Speaker 5>It's still want a decision that has </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>

1683
01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:27.190
<v Speaker 5>Not just once a gang of times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a lady that was doing that in </v>

1684
01:17:27.190 --> 01:17:30.980
<v Speaker 5>Vegas and she was responsible for like </v>
<v Speaker 5>two or three really bad decisions.</v>

1685
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:33.550
<v Speaker 5>One of them was packy out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1686
01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Timothy Bradley and uh,</v>

1687
01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.410
<v Speaker 5>there was another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was another big fight.</v>

1688
01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.500
<v Speaker 5>I forget what the other one was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Her.</v>

1689
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.460
<v Speaker 5>She had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like an initial name,</v>

1690
01:17:43.461 --> 01:17:45.940
<v Speaker 5>like a tj something or another </v>
<v Speaker 5>instrument.</v>

1691
01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:48.140
<v Speaker 5>Tired Blonde.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1692
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:49.550
<v Speaker 5>remember?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember what she looked like,</v>

1693
01:17:49.551 --> 01:17:54.551
<v Speaker 5>but I remember people saying that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>very well could have been that she was </v>

1694
01:17:54.551 --> 01:17:55.980
<v Speaker 5>paid off by people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1695
01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.680
<v Speaker 5>That was the one she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think she's retired.</v>

1696
01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.480
<v Speaker 5>She just took so much heat because </v>
<v Speaker 5>people can gamble on those fights.</v>

1697
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.010
<v Speaker 5>Especially a packing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll fight.</v>

1698
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.160
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about millions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 5>being exchanged.</v>

1699
01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Millions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1700
01:18:09.261 --> 01:18:11.300
<v Speaker 5>how many fucking people bet on a pack?</v>

1701
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:13.700
<v Speaker 5>I'll fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That gets pretty nutty,</v>

1702
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:19.030
<v Speaker 5>so who knows who came up to that lady </v>
<v Speaker 5>and told her look like a fucking draw.</v>

1703
01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:21.900
<v Speaker 5>It was a close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a close.</v>

1704
01:18:21.901 --> 01:18:22.580
<v Speaker 5>It's close,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1705
01:18:22.581 --> 01:18:24.320
<v Speaker 5>It's cold sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's draw.</v>

1706
01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:28.460
<v Speaker 5>So judges in like an appointed elected </v>
<v Speaker 5>or not elected or appointed official.</v>

1707
01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can't be replaced.</v>

1708
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.030
<v Speaker 5>It's very hard in a system be changed at</v>
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

1709
01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.230
<v Speaker 5>Like the way the very hard is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1710
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.630
<v Speaker 5>very hard to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1711
01:18:35.631 --> 01:18:38.310
<v Speaker 5>he's got a great judging idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is Anthony Hard?</v>

1712
01:18:38.311 --> 01:18:41.030
<v Speaker 5>Donk who used to fight for the UFC now </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a.</v>

1714
01:18:44.991 --> 01:18:49.991
<v Speaker 5>Trains a lot of UFC fighters but he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>out a great idea for scoring system and </v>

1715
01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:51.710
<v Speaker 5>his idea first coding scoring system is </v>
<v Speaker 5>totally different than the one they have</v>

1716
01:18:51.711 --> 01:18:53.450
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they have now is it's called the 10</v>

1717
01:18:53.451 --> 01:18:55.790
<v Speaker 5>point must system and that's what boxing</v>
<v Speaker 5>uses.</v>

1718
01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:00.020
<v Speaker 5>So everybody starts out with 10 points,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if say you knocked me down,</v>

1719
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:04.370
<v Speaker 5>then you get like you have 10 and I have</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight because you're knocked me down.</v>

1720
01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:09.400
<v Speaker 5>If I lost the round and it's nine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but 10 nines can guide and go either </v>

1721
01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:09.770
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 10,</v>

1722
01:19:09.771 --> 01:19:11.780
<v Speaker 5>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I might think you won ten nine,</v>

1723
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:14.120
<v Speaker 5>but somebody else might think Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1:10,</v>

1724
01:19:14.121 --> 01:19:15.440
<v Speaker 5>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It says real subjective.</v>

1725
01:19:15.441 --> 01:19:16.670
<v Speaker 5>But once I got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets knocked down,</v>

1726
01:19:16.671 --> 01:19:18.200
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty universally 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight.</v>

1727
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:22.160
<v Speaker 5>Unless a guy was dominating the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>round and then got knocked down,</v>

1728
01:19:22.161 --> 01:19:23.270
<v Speaker 5>then it will be nine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nine,</v>

1729
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.910
<v Speaker 5>then it'd be a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's,</v>

1730
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:27.630
<v Speaker 5>that's usually not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Usually when the guy gets knocked down,</v>

1731
01:19:27.631 --> 01:19:30.140
<v Speaker 5>it's tonight would hard dog is saying is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1732
01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:33.380
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that all of the scores,</v>

1733
01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:36.290
<v Speaker 5>I know his name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's from Holland.</v>

1734
01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:41.000
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of the scores for all the techniques</v>

1735
01:19:41.001 --> 01:19:41.600
<v Speaker 5>should count.</v>

1736
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:46.900
<v Speaker 5>So like the first round might be six.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might have six and he might have to </v>

1737
01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.120
<v Speaker 5>because like you beat him up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did a bunch of things to um,</v>

1738
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:54.560
<v Speaker 5>and all those things count as points.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the next round it might be a,</v>

1739
01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:59.120
<v Speaker 5>you have four and you have three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So even though there's two rounds in the</v>

1740
01:19:59.121 --> 01:20:01.370
<v Speaker 5>books and you won the first round and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted the second round,</v>

1741
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:03.470
<v Speaker 5>he only won the second round by one </v>
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>

1742
01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:08.740
<v Speaker 5>Whereas you were on the first round by a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of points because you're counting </v>

1743
01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:08.740
<v Speaker 5>up all the different things that you did</v>
<v Speaker 5>during that</v>

1744
01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:09.720
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's accumulative.</v>

1745
01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:12.390
<v Speaker 1>So instead of this 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine system where you can have two,</v>

1746
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:13.410
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine rounds,</v>

1747
01:20:13.411 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 1>but 1:10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine round,</v>

1748
01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.730
<v Speaker 1>you totally kick Jamie's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the next 10,</v>

1749
01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:18.630
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine round,</v>

1750
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Jamie barely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely squeaks by you.</v>

1751
01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost like a roast battle situation </v>

1752
01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:28.761
<v Speaker 1>where you give it to him because he came</v>
<v Speaker 1>back from that first round and then </v>

1753
01:20:28.761 --> 01:20:29.610
<v Speaker 1>you're even going into this third and </v>
<v Speaker 1>final round,</v>

1754
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:34.700
<v Speaker 1>but you're not even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is you fucked him up way </v>

1755
01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.401
<v Speaker 1>more than he fucked you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's got a really good point with </v>

1756
01:20:37.401 --> 01:20:40.641
<v Speaker 1>that because the idea of having to 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine rounds and one of them is just </v>

1757
01:20:41.101 --> 01:20:42.480
<v Speaker 1>vastly different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 10,</v>

1758
01:20:42.481 --> 01:20:45.300
<v Speaker 1>nine rounds where a guy literally does </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to the other guy,</v>

1759
01:20:45.301 --> 01:20:47.730
<v Speaker 1>just gets his ass kicked all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and just survives,</v>

1760
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:50.490
<v Speaker 1>still loses 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine and then in the other one,</v>

1761
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:55.680
<v Speaker 1>two guys go toe to toe and it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>in site indiscernible who won and that's</v>

1762
01:20:55.681 --> 01:20:57.480
<v Speaker 1>also ten nine stupid.</v>

1763
01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:02.720
<v Speaker 1>He's totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what his idea is a score shouldn't </v>

1764
01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:03.150
<v Speaker 1>be like 49,</v>
<v Speaker 1>48,</v>

1765
01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:08.180
<v Speaker 1>49,</v>
<v Speaker 1>47 and the third Georgia judge scores </v>

1766
01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:08.180
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1767
01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:13.130
<v Speaker 1>it really should be a number like 30 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 or 37 and six or 45 and 13 or 45 and </v>

1768
01:21:20.341 --> 01:21:24.600
<v Speaker 1>40 like where there's a big numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the fight has a lot of action,</v>

1769
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.630
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of Schutz shit's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just ten nine.</v>

1770
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:30.780
<v Speaker 1>There's head kicks and take downs and or</v>
<v Speaker 1>there could be a 10,</v>

1771
01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:34.130
<v Speaker 1>nine round where both guys like Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silva versus tonsillitis.</v>

1772
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva fought tirelessly and </v>

1773
01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:40.050
<v Speaker 1>neither one exchanged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither one did anything.</v>

1774
01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:45.140
<v Speaker 1>There was many times in that fight it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was boring as fuck because Anderson's </v>

1775
01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:45.660
<v Speaker 1>counter striker and Talus is a Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

1776
01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:50.460
<v Speaker 1>So Anderson knew that he could pick them</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart on the outside and not do much and</v>

1777
01:21:50.461 --> 01:21:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Talis knew that if he ran at Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like running into a meat chipper or</v>

1778
01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:55.770
<v Speaker 1>a wood chipper.</v>

1779
01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:00.920
<v Speaker 1>So he had to figure out which way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>which way to to to play the fight out.</v>

1780
01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So there was very little action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a really boring fight.</v>

1781
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Well that's still 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

1782
01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.290
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine round.</v>

1783
01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean that these are 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine rounds.</v>

1784
01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:15.170
<v Speaker 1>How could that be a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine round when you come up with </v>

1785
01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:16.410
<v Speaker 1>something fucking completely crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic.</v>

1786
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:21.590
<v Speaker 1>That could also be a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine round like shogun versus Dan </v>

1787
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They beat the fuck out of each other and</v>

1788
01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.720
<v Speaker 1>that could also be a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine round,</v>

1789
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1790
01:22:26.371 --> 01:22:31.371
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fights where there's a lot of </v>

1791
01:22:31.371 --> 01:22:34.671
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the score should be higher and I think </v>

1792
01:22:34.671 --> 01:22:37.401
<v Speaker 1>that would also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would also show like how exciting </v>

1793
01:22:37.401 --> 01:22:38.170
<v Speaker 1>fighters are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1794
01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you could say like Michael Jordan scored</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 points playing for the Chicago Bulls </v>

1795
01:22:43.190 --> 01:22:43.560
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

1796
01:22:43.561 --> 01:22:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Jordan here.</v>

1797
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Jordan scored 50 last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have Ronda rousey flights a batch </v>

1798
01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Kohala again and beat the fucking shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of her for the first round,</v>

1799
01:22:53.281 --> 01:22:58.281
<v Speaker 1>but somehow or another batch makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the second round and you look at </v>

1800
01:22:58.281 --> 01:23:01.431
<v Speaker 1>the score.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her score for the first round was a </v>

1801
01:23:01.431 --> 01:23:01.431
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 62 co.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1802
01:23:01.431 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I had one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know like if you see sometHing like </v>

1803
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's like holy shit.</v>

1804
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I actually think it makes it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you say you do it though?</v>

1805
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:14.401
<v Speaker 1>Would you just break the round up into </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters and each each quarter you get </v>

1806
01:23:14.401 --> 01:23:15.070
<v Speaker 1>like 10 points or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1807
01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:20.100
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have to be just lIke scoring </v>

1808
01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:20.100
<v Speaker 1>and basketball and have to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques that land.</v>

1809
01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:24.570
<v Speaker 1>So like say if you and jamie are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and you hit him with a like </v>

1810
01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:25.720
<v Speaker 1>five leg kicks in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to.</v>

1811
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantify those leg kicks.</v>

1812
01:23:29.201 --> 01:23:34.201
<v Speaker 1>Like what is worth more is a leg kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth two points and a jab worth one </v>

1813
01:23:34.201 --> 01:23:38.971
<v Speaker 1>point is a right hand that rocks you </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth five points and one that grazes </v>

1814
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:42.160
<v Speaker 1>off you worth one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to figure out,</v>

1815
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:47.750
<v Speaker 1>and it have to be at least partially </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective because the real quiet,</v>

1816
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:53.100
<v Speaker 1>like the real undeniable measurable </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and a fight is the knockout.</v>

1817
01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:58.890
<v Speaker 1>In the submission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tko even is problematic because </v>

1818
01:23:58.890 --> 01:23:59.820
<v Speaker 1>there's fights there stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

1819
01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:02.620
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the guy was fucking that guy up,</v>

1820
01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:05.950
<v Speaker 1>but I would have liked to see the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a chance to survive and then there's</v>

1821
01:24:05.951 --> 01:24:10.180
<v Speaker 1>other referees were the guy could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up way worse,</v>

1822
01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:12.100
<v Speaker 1>and the referee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a go on.</v>

1823
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:15.130
<v Speaker 1>The guy winds up winning the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankie edgar versus gray maynard,</v>

1824
01:24:15.131 --> 01:24:16.690
<v Speaker 1>one or two and three.</v>

1825
01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.210
<v Speaker 1>The first time they fought edgar beaten </v>
<v Speaker 1>by decision.</v>

1826
01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:23.320
<v Speaker 1>The second time they fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>edgar almost knocked him out or a gray.</v>

1827
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Maynard almost knocked first fight gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maynard won a decision.</v>

1828
01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Second fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gray,</v>

1829
01:24:29.381 --> 01:24:33.220
<v Speaker 1>almost knocked him out and then frankie </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up making it to the end and it was</v>

1830
01:24:33.221 --> 01:24:35.410
<v Speaker 1>a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the third fight,</v>

1831
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:41.070
<v Speaker 1>gray almost knocked him out again in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first round and frankie wound up </v>

1832
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:43.600
<v Speaker 1>knocking him out later in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in fights like that,</v>

1833
01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:48.810
<v Speaker 1>like a worse referee would have called </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight in the first round and gray </v>

1834
01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:50.290
<v Speaker 1>maynard would have knocked them out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>won the title.</v>

1835
01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:53.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's one of those weird things where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just got to.</v>

1836
01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:58.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision making that's going to be </v>

1837
01:24:58.890 --> 01:25:03.391
<v Speaker 1>involved in fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think if the score was based on </v>

1838
01:25:03.391 --> 01:25:07.381
<v Speaker 1>the actual damage that was done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd have to figure out what it's worth </v>

1839
01:25:07.381 --> 01:25:07.381
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1840
01:25:07.381 --> 01:25:09.190
<v Speaker 1>What's it worth to have someone's back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it worth to mount someone.</v>

1841
01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:11.560
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it's a bad thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that out.</v>

1842
01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be worth a lot for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sport to get outside of this boxing </v>

1843
01:25:16.770 --> 01:25:17.950
<v Speaker 1>system isn't damaged subjective to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1844
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Because totally one hit from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1845
01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:24.930
<v Speaker 1>You could hit me and brian both the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way and it's going to hurt us a </v>

1846
01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:26.010
<v Speaker 1>different way and counted the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

1847
01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:31.210
<v Speaker 1>And some guys can take a shot away </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than other guys can In the same </v>

1848
01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:31.930
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you hit Mark Hunt with it and he'll</v>

1849
01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:34.360
<v Speaker 1>eat it and smile at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same shot,</v>

1850
01:25:34.361 --> 01:25:36.620
<v Speaker 1>you hit another guy with it and his leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>go out and he,</v>

1851
01:25:36.650 --> 01:25:37.600
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done.</v>

1852
01:25:38.230 --> 01:25:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say,</v>

1853
01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1854
01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:45.160
<v Speaker 1>you base it on how hard her hurt the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1855
01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:47.890
<v Speaker 1>what the impact was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how clear the impact was.</v>

1856
01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:50.980
<v Speaker 1>There'd be a lot of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of factors that would play</v>

1857
01:25:50.981 --> 01:25:53.450
<v Speaker 1>in when you would deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1858
01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:56.410
<v Speaker 1>with scoring a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's got.</v>

1859
01:25:56.430 --> 01:25:59.080
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be way better than what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing right now.</v>

1860
01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.210
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just terrible.</v>

1861
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:03.040
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many.</v>

1862
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a ramsey and a gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gym he hates when I say new gym,</v>

1863
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I always fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ramsey nejame,</v>

1864
01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:13.970
<v Speaker 1>he got robbed in his last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gentleman who he fought,</v>

1865
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter,</v>

1866
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.940
<v Speaker 1>but ran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought ramsey,</v>

1867
01:26:16.941 --> 01:26:19.280
<v Speaker 1>clearly one of the fight and they gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to the other dude.</v>

1868
01:26:19.670 --> 01:26:20.810
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tHat's bullshit.</v>

1869
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.420
<v Speaker 1>That guy did what he was supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>won the fight.</v>

1870
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:26.000
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't win the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1871
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Because the judges were incompetent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody ringside.</v>

1872
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:29.900
<v Speaker 1>That was with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quayside.</v>

1873
01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Joe silva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean shelby rather,</v>

1874
01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:34.610
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaking her head like,</v>

1875
01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:35.660
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1876
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.490
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dana was shaking his head.</v>

1877
01:26:37.491 --> 01:26:39.620
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people shaking their head like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

1878
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:41.600
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is terrible.</v>

1879
01:26:41.601 --> 01:26:46.601
<v Speaker 1>This is god damn terrible decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was another one recently where </v>

1880
01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dana was on record talking about it.</v>

1881
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:49.730
<v Speaker 1>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big.</v>

1882
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Johnson.</v>

1883
01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Michael johnson and biennials are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people thought Michael Johnson </v>

1884
01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:59.801
<v Speaker 1>won that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a little closer than a </v>

1885
01:26:59.801 --> 01:27:02.621
<v Speaker 1>lot of people were thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought she did a lot of stuff that </v>

1886
01:27:02.621 --> 01:27:02.621
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason people weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving them credit for,</v>

1887
01:27:02.621 --> 01:27:06.440
<v Speaker 1>but I still thought johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was real fucking clothes thought.</v>

1888
01:27:06.441 --> 01:27:11.441
<v Speaker 1>Johnson probably got the nod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to go over it again with the </v>

1889
01:27:11.441 --> 01:27:12.800
<v Speaker 1>sound off maybe and really trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze it point by point,</v>

1890
01:27:12.801 --> 01:27:15.980
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people were pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people watched it live.</v>

1891
01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:20.980
<v Speaker 1>We're really pissed and it'd be cool in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future at the technology would be </v>

1892
01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:25.421
<v Speaker 1>there to be able to act accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out how strong each punch is and </v>

1893
01:27:25.731 --> 01:27:26.990
<v Speaker 1>like every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1894
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:32.200
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you could wear a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bracelet that can detect that almost in </v>

1895
01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.321
<v Speaker 1>the future or something like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>detect the amount of damage you </v>

1896
01:27:35.321 --> 01:27:35.540
<v Speaker 1>sustained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if video games right?</v>

1897
01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:40.120
<v Speaker 1>So like one big punch is Worth like </v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four week ones,</v>

1898
01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:40.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being,</v>

1899
01:27:40.701 --> 01:27:41.930
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being or boom.</v>

1900
01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1901
01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.820
<v Speaker 1>That's all done by pressure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vibration of the actual hit.</v>

1902
01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I think also the idea of having three </v>
<v Speaker 1>judges is not necessarily.</v>

1903
01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:52.780
<v Speaker 1>I think there's more than three judges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mind,</v>

1904
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:54.140
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they would probably.</v>

1905
01:27:54.141 --> 01:27:56.840
<v Speaker 1>If you get five experts and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to find judges,</v>

1906
01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:00.020
<v Speaker 1>you could go on the underground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go out and mixed martial arts.com</v>

1907
01:28:00.021 --> 01:28:05.021
<v Speaker 1>and find a hundred people there are way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more competent than anybody's working </v>

1908
01:28:05.021 --> 01:28:06.640
<v Speaker 1>today or as competent as the best people</v>
<v Speaker 1>working today.</v>

1909
01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I really stand by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think fans like really big time</v>

1910
01:28:10.881 --> 01:28:15.881
<v Speaker 1>fans that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably know more about mma than </v>

1911
01:28:15.881 --> 01:28:17.240
<v Speaker 1>most referees are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most judges rather because most judges,</v>

1912
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a good percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them that really don't even give a fuck </v>

1913
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:22.510
<v Speaker 1>about the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just they're doing it.</v>

1914
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are fans of the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them definitely aren't.</v>

1915
01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:30.190
<v Speaker 1>So I think that having more judges would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be good and I think another thing would </v>

1916
01:28:30.190 --> 01:28:31.370
<v Speaker 1>be good is allowing the people at home </v>
<v Speaker 1>devote,</v>

1917
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:36.590
<v Speaker 1>allowing them to vote online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe draws would be broken up by the</v>

1918
01:28:36.591 --> 01:28:38.210
<v Speaker 1>online score.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1919
01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should totally be more interactive.</v>

1920
01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The technology's there and that's.</v>

1921
01:28:42.810 --> 01:28:45.920
<v Speaker 1>That would make more sense to know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>dope that would be if they went,</v>

1922
01:28:45.921 --> 01:28:47.090
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go to the internet,</v>

1923
01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:52.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a draw so we're going to go to the </v>

1924
01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.200
<v Speaker 1>internet or just have a score based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet and a score based on reality.</v>

1925
01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.620
<v Speaker 1>So the internet score I won by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>landslide,</v>

1926
01:28:57.621 --> 01:29:00.260
<v Speaker 1>but gets really biased that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it does.</v>

1927
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:04.110
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the funding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All star games get ruined in some sports</v>

1928
01:29:04.111 --> 01:29:08.160
<v Speaker 1>because of those fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can vote stuff like baseball,</v>

1929
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.410
<v Speaker 1>the whole american thing to do one team </v>
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>

1930
01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take ticket back,</v>

1931
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.490
<v Speaker 1>take it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus some fighters that people hate.</v>

1932
01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Everybody hates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1933
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:21.200
<v Speaker 1>they like to hate them to goes to cocky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people that would </v>

1934
01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.521
<v Speaker 1>like try to like vote against conor </v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor just because he's doing too </v>

1935
01:29:25.521 --> 01:29:27.300
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that guy falls on his face.</v>

1936
01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:30.660
<v Speaker 1>If you're up in the third round in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario where you can score that way in</v>

1937
01:29:30.661 --> 01:29:31.510
<v Speaker 1>your app,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know,</v>

1938
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.340
<v Speaker 1>35 to 15 and you kind of just stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're up.</v>

1939
01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

1940
01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:37.410
<v Speaker 1>how do you prevent that?</v>

1941
01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Or can you not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is that just a project to deal with?</v>

1942
01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just part of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guy who's down,</v>

1943
01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:45.570
<v Speaker 1>it's his job to go after you now and try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to score and win.</v>

1944
01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Try to knock you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to stop the fight.</v>

1945
01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.920
<v Speaker 1>And there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we're a guy,</v>

1946
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:55.070
<v Speaker 1>we all know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where guys going into the third round </v>

1947
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:56.010
<v Speaker 1>and he got his ass kicked the first two </v>
<v Speaker 1>rounds in this corner says,</v>

1948
01:29:56.011 --> 01:29:58.350
<v Speaker 1>you've got to stop him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to finish this fight.</v>

1949
01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.870
<v Speaker 1>He knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows and the other guy knows it.</v>

1950
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:03.090
<v Speaker 1>If he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone is clearly one,</v>

1951
01:30:03.091 --> 01:30:08.091
<v Speaker 1>two rounds in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is fucking dance </v>

1952
01:30:08.091 --> 01:30:11.181
<v Speaker 1>around in that third round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys have done that before and it wound </v>

1953
01:30:11.181 --> 01:30:11.650
<v Speaker 1>up fucking them over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

1954
01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the system sucks.</v>

1955
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:17.910
<v Speaker 1>The system is terrible but hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onx ideas the best I've ever heard.</v>

1956
01:30:17.970 --> 01:30:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Doc hamilton who's a very good judge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1957
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:26.810
<v Speaker 1>a long time martial arts practitioner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a good system and his system was </v>

1958
01:30:27.241 --> 01:30:30.300
<v Speaker 1>a half point system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His system was instead of 10 points,</v>

1959
01:30:30.330 --> 01:30:35.330
<v Speaker 1>you use half points too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like in cases where it's like real </v>

1960
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.330
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could say,</v>

1961
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:39.681
<v Speaker 1>well that guy won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he only won by half a point or he </v>

1962
01:30:39.681 --> 01:30:42.681
<v Speaker 1>won by a point where it's really clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>or he won by two points if he's really </v>

1963
01:30:42.681 --> 01:30:47.061
<v Speaker 1>got his ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like utilize the point system and make </v>

1964
01:30:47.061 --> 01:30:49.851
<v Speaker 1>it a bit more obvious that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gap and that'll accumulative that we'll </v>

1965
01:30:49.851 --> 01:30:54.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll add up towards the end of a </v>

1966
01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:54.820
<v Speaker 1>third round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would be able to add that like,</v>

1967
01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:55.950
<v Speaker 1>well the first round he won by half a </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1968
01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.800
<v Speaker 1>but the second round he won by two </v>
<v Speaker 1>points and then we'll all like,</v>

1969
01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.270
<v Speaker 1>it would show up better.</v>

1970
01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I just think the 10 point system as they</v>
<v Speaker 1>use it right now,</v>

1971
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:08.040
<v Speaker 1>really lame and it comes from boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not a good system for mma.</v>

1972
01:31:08.041 --> 01:31:12.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a good system for boxing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing is pretty much boxing and mma has</v>

1973
01:31:12.691 --> 01:31:17.691
<v Speaker 1>so many different kinds of scoring that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be on the ground and hadn't </v>

1974
01:31:17.691 --> 01:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>been choked out the whole entire round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that has to mean something.</v>

1975
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also like,</v>

1976
01:31:22.441 --> 01:31:24.090
<v Speaker 1>who decides?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you say,</v>

1977
01:31:24.091 --> 01:31:29.091
<v Speaker 1>if you beat a guy upstanding you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you beat them up for like the first </v>

1978
01:31:29.091 --> 01:31:30.090
<v Speaker 1>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit him with a ton of punches,</v>

1979
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:35.270
<v Speaker 1>but then it takes you down and gets on </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of you for four minutes but doesn't </v>

1980
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:38.901
<v Speaker 1>do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits you with like a few pitty pat </v>

1981
01:31:38.901 --> 01:31:41.091
<v Speaker 1>punches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time you defend </v>

1982
01:31:41.091 --> 01:31:42.441
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times people will think that </v>

1983
01:31:42.441 --> 01:31:44.330
<v Speaker 1>that guy who was on the bottom getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit with a pitty pat punches by the guy </v>

1984
01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:45.060
<v Speaker 1>was on top of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost the round.</v>

1985
01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Even though he beat the shit out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy for the first minute.</v>

1986
01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Like he did way more damage that first </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

1987
01:31:50.221 --> 01:31:53.490
<v Speaker 1>That guy's cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's beat up his eyes swelling.</v>

1988
01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:58.610
<v Speaker 1>He got hit with bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he survived enough to get the take </v>

1989
01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:01.000
<v Speaker 1>down and then because he was on top for </v>
<v Speaker 1>more people would give him that round.</v>

1990
01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:02.740
<v Speaker 1>So it's goofy as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1991
01:32:02.741 --> 01:32:07.720
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to figure out how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better job of scoring it.</v>

1992
01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:12.960
<v Speaker 1>But I think the doc has the best idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard and I'm going to have </v>

1993
01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.520
<v Speaker 1>him on the podcast someday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someday,</v>

1994
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:15.970
<v Speaker 1>soon because he's out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's out near woodland hills,</v>

1995
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:21.390
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to have him on soon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have them talk about it and talk about </v>

1996
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.720
<v Speaker 1>training and stuff like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think his,</v>

1997
01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:27.060
<v Speaker 1>his system is way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something I wanted to bring up </v>

1998
01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:27.060
<v Speaker 1>because it's pretty fucking crazy.</v>

1999
01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a new study that was out in a </v>

2000
01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:31.400
<v Speaker 1>reset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

2001
01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amber Lyons company.</v>

2002
01:32:33.370 --> 01:32:34.140
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2003
01:32:34.141 --> 01:32:36.400
<v Speaker 1>it's become a complete drawing around </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2004
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a total.</v>

2005
01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:40.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2006
01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.000
<v Speaker 1>kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that in the nicest way.</v>

2007
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Amber common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a calling.</v>

2008
01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.120
<v Speaker 1>He's got the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's become like a complete psychedelic</v>

2009
01:32:49.121 --> 01:32:49.970
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just,</v>

2010
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:54.990
<v Speaker 1>all she does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just traveled around the world </v>

2011
01:32:54.990 --> 01:32:54.990
<v Speaker 1>doing psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she wrote this,</v>

2012
01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:59.050
<v Speaker 1>she's got this new website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called reset.me</v>

2013
01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:04.590
<v Speaker 1>obviously to a sort of signify the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the profound effects of psychedelics.</v>

2014
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:07.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2015
01:33:07.681 --> 01:33:12.681
<v Speaker 1>the name of the website and what many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that psychedelics do.</v>

2016
01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And so this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor david nutt,</v>

2017
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.830
<v Speaker 1>had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2018
01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:20.380
<v Speaker 1>that's his name too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as funny as hard dog,</v>

2019
01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:23.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both guys three,</v>

2020
01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:28.290
<v Speaker 1>we had a three day conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called breaking convention that's </v>

2021
01:33:28.290 --> 01:33:28.750
<v Speaker 1>held in london and basically what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>

2022
01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:31.330
<v Speaker 1>it's to explore the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>

2023
01:33:31.331 --> 01:33:36.331
<v Speaker 1>but they're saying this psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 1>switches off part of the brain that </v>

2024
01:33:36.331 --> 01:33:38.530
<v Speaker 1>causes depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is insane.</v>

2025
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:39.550
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2026
01:33:39.551 --> 01:33:41.530
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like go to that story.</v>

2027
01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2028
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these problems that they </v>

2029
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.260
<v Speaker 1>have with trying to legalize different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are beneficial,</v>

2030
01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:58.261
<v Speaker 1>like legalized for soldiers with ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they found a lot of different drugs </v>

2031
01:33:58.261 --> 01:34:01.150
<v Speaker 1>that can help people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>through traumatic situations.</v>

2032
01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Psilocybin is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mtma is a big one.</v>

2033
01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Mtma apparently has profound effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people have seen horrific things </v>

2034
01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:15.780
<v Speaker 1>and profound in the fact that it lets </v>
<v Speaker 1>them change their perspective on it and </v>

2035
01:34:16.061 --> 01:34:21.061
<v Speaker 1>literally changed their memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed what it beans to them to have </v>

2036
01:34:21.061 --> 01:34:25.321
<v Speaker 1>had this experience and allows </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness in a way that's really </v>

2037
01:34:25.321 --> 01:34:27.400
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2038
01:34:27.401 --> 01:34:29.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

2039
01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:31.390
<v Speaker 1>professor nut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really interesting article.</v>

2040
01:34:31.391 --> 01:34:33.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics in it,</v>

2041
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:34.880
<v Speaker 1>but about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2042
01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:39.710
<v Speaker 1>the potential for drugs like psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 1>lsd and a,</v>

2043
01:34:39.711 --> 01:34:44.711
<v Speaker 1>and cannabis too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he's talking about how because </v>

2044
01:34:44.711 --> 01:34:46.330
<v Speaker 1>these drugs are illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2045
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:51.390
<v Speaker 1>patients are suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>committing suicide because they're not </v>

2046
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:53.770
<v Speaker 1>getting treated for their depressions as</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain or their pain rather.</v>

2047
01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:58.880
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because I think more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more as time's going on,</v>

2048
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:01.760
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing these things become </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream.</v>

2049
01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:06.170
<v Speaker 1>These subjects become mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The John Hopkins psilocybin study,</v>

2050
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:11.410
<v Speaker 1>there's been quite a few different </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies that have come out that have </v>

2051
01:35:11.410 --> 01:35:14.831
<v Speaker 1>shown the benefits of a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs to dealing with things that are </v>

2052
01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:18.230
<v Speaker 1>conventionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they give you for depression?</v>

2053
01:35:18.231 --> 01:35:20.630
<v Speaker 1>They give you an ssri or they give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>

2054
01:35:20.631 --> 01:35:25.631
<v Speaker 1>but this is a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect and that's actually what ari </v>

2055
01:35:25.631 --> 01:35:29.870
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arias said that psilocybin was what </v>

2056
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:30.170
<v Speaker 1>really helped his depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helped it in a big way.</v>

2057
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:31.790
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in toronto,</v>

2058
01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:36.230
<v Speaker 2>I allegedly maybe have eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some shrooms both nights.</v>

2059
01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I was there because it illegal to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you hate shrooms and I,</v>

2060
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:40.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays they,</v>

2061
01:35:40.711 --> 01:35:44.010
<v Speaker 2>they check your twitter when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through the airport wides.</v>

2062
01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2063
01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Every time I go travel now me and tony </v>
<v Speaker 2>both get put into a room and they check </v>

2064
01:35:50.481 --> 01:35:52.670
<v Speaker 2>your twitter to see like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you working tonight?</v>

2065
01:35:52.671 --> 01:35:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2066
01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.290
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

2067
01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Tony uncle tony actually got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly what?</v>

2068
01:35:59.270 --> 01:36:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think they recently passed </v>

2069
01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.760
<v Speaker 2>this law where you don't have to do this</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

2070
01:36:04.761 --> 01:36:09.761
<v Speaker 2>but when you work in Canada as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian you have to get a work permit </v>

2071
01:36:09.761 --> 01:36:12.581
<v Speaker 2>and that causes the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's like a really small little </v>

2072
01:36:12.581 --> 01:36:13.130
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a lot of places like,</v>

2073
01:36:13.131 --> 01:36:13.580
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2074
01:36:13.581 --> 01:36:15.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're here on vacation or whatever.</v>

2075
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:18.340
<v Speaker 2>And I think who said that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that are booking the shell.</v>

2076
01:36:18.730 --> 01:36:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

2077
01:36:20.811 --> 01:36:25.811
<v Speaker 2>We found this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like early on eddie bravo to </v>

2078
01:36:25.811 --> 01:36:25.811
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2079
01:36:25.811 --> 01:36:25.970
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2080
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.060
<v Speaker 2>but tony said that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2081
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.970
<v Speaker 2>just went on his twitter page and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>as like where,</v>

2082
01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:36.240
<v Speaker 2>where are you at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they grounded him and made him fly </v>

2083
01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:36.240
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should've told me those number.</v>

2084
01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Twitter was retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2085
01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.300
<v Speaker 2>they just googled his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2086
01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:39.900
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2087
01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:42.680
<v Speaker 2>so that's one thing that's good about </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a fake last name.</v>

2088
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2089
01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:46.880
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about right before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2090
01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.360
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

2091
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:52.460
<v Speaker 2>This was the first time where I actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

2092
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:55.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't eat to try to trip hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

2093
01:36:55.161 --> 01:36:56.870
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take a little bit while I'm</v>

2094
01:36:56.871 --> 01:37:01.871
<v Speaker 2>at this bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was just enough that I </v>

2095
01:37:01.871 --> 01:37:04.871
<v Speaker 2>immediately felt insane amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness and I wasn't seeing anything </v>

2096
01:37:05.991 --> 01:37:07.910
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like it wasn't like,</v>

2097
01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.590
<v Speaker 2>like a trippy experience.</v>

2098
01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2099
01:37:11.121 --> 01:37:16.121
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where you eat a little bit of </v>

2100
01:37:16.121 --> 01:37:16.121
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard about that?</v>

2101
01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:21.570
<v Speaker 2>And I wonder if that has something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because that could be almost like a</v>

2102
01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:26.210
<v Speaker 2>imagine being prescribed like a happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>pill every day and it was just ground up</v>

2103
01:37:26.211 --> 01:37:29.390
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just a smaller amount a where</v>

2104
01:37:29.391 --> 01:37:33.260
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing anything but you still</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel happy because that's how I felt and</v>

2105
01:37:33.261 --> 01:37:35.240
<v Speaker 2>it caused me to eat more when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2106
01:37:35.241 --> 01:37:36.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is great mushroom.</v>

2107
01:37:36.591 --> 01:37:41.591
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I got out of that just </v>

2108
01:37:41.591 --> 01:37:41.591
<v Speaker 2>happiness and then I start tripping and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing things.</v>

2109
01:37:41.591 --> 01:37:44.630
<v Speaker 2>But the small amount that I originally </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight made me feel really happy.</v>

2110
01:37:44.631 --> 01:37:46.300
<v Speaker 2>I was bouncing off the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2111
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Common thing that people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they microdose and they'd take it all </v>

2112
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.510
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2113
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:54.950
<v Speaker 1>That's real common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do that and it definitely has an </v>

2114
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:57.180
<v Speaker 1>interesting effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've small doses before and it makes you</v>

2115
01:37:57.181 --> 01:38:02.181
<v Speaker 1>just feel relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also makes the things that you </v>

2116
01:38:02.181 --> 01:38:02.400
<v Speaker 1>thought were super important seems so </v>
<v Speaker 1>silly.</v>

2117
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Like things that were bothering you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2118
01:38:04.201 --> 01:38:05.640
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever.</v>

2119
01:38:05.850 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you feel like if someone was mad at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and like,</v>

2120
01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:13.320
<v Speaker 1>oh as that person mad at me to take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little micro dose of mushrooms and </v>

2121
01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:17.601
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel almost feel bad for them being </v>

2122
01:38:17.601 --> 01:38:17.601
<v Speaker 1>mad at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2123
01:38:17.601 --> 01:38:18.840
<v Speaker 1>like people talking shit about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas it would hurt your feelings.</v>

2124
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.510
<v Speaker 1>You take a little mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2125
01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:25.520
<v Speaker 1>feel bad for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this person is lashing out in this </v>

2126
01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:26.370
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms are beautiful man.</v>

2127
01:38:26.371 --> 01:38:29.280
<v Speaker 1>They're so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So gross that they're illegal.</v>

2128
01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:33.120
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre that after all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different years,</v>

2129
01:38:33.190 --> 01:38:35.700
<v Speaker 1>all these different studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never been one that's shown that</v>

2130
01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:40.701
<v Speaker 1>it kills people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never been one that's shown that it </v>

2131
01:38:40.701 --> 01:38:40.800
<v Speaker 1>causes you to lose your brain or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>get diarrhea.</v>

2132
01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:42.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just nothing.</v>

2133
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:44.400
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why it should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

2134
01:38:44.401 --> 01:38:49.401
<v Speaker 1>There's no like glaring health issue and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet still you could go to jail as much </v>

2135
01:38:51.691 --> 01:38:55.380
<v Speaker 1>as you would go to jail if yet had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably more so than heroin isn't.</v>

2136
01:38:55.381 --> 01:39:00.381
<v Speaker 1>Heroin is scheduled today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've gone over this before like </v>

2137
01:39:00.381 --> 01:39:03.051
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The schedule ones like a lot of the </v>

2138
01:39:03.051 --> 01:39:05.760
<v Speaker 1>schedule ones are like super beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're the most illegal.</v>

2139
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.730
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the schedule one versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheduled to chart,</v>

2140
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I think scheduled to his cocaine because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have medical cocaine.</v>

2141
01:39:12.871 --> 01:39:15.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of scheduled one is no medical,</v>

2142
01:39:15.610 --> 01:39:20.610
<v Speaker 1>no known medical use and to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and mill psilocybin to have </v>

2143
01:39:21.301 --> 01:39:26.301
<v Speaker 1>the most beneficial plants of all time </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the no known medical use category </v>

2144
01:39:26.301 --> 01:39:30.090
<v Speaker 1>just shows how corrupt these criminals </v>
<v Speaker 1>are because that's just a lie.</v>

2145
01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Like anybody could go to them with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>series of links,</v>

2146
01:39:33.601 --> 01:39:35.880
<v Speaker 1>like I can email them to tell me who it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2147
01:39:35.881 --> 01:39:39.300
<v Speaker 1>It's the head of the drug czar guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll email you just a gang of links.</v>

2148
01:39:39.450 --> 01:39:42.390
<v Speaker 1>You click on those links and then tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>me if you think it's still scheduled one</v>

2149
01:39:42.391 --> 01:39:45.060
<v Speaker 1>after it's over and if you do think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a crook.</v>

2150
01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I think the only difference between like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cocaine or psychedelic is that it will</v>

2151
01:39:49.561 --> 01:39:54.561
<v Speaker 1>speed up schizophrenia and crazy people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll just have way too much </v>

2152
01:39:54.561 --> 01:39:55.960
<v Speaker 1>crazy people in this world if mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2153
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:58.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe or maybe they're going to be crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

2154
01:39:58.790 --> 01:40:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is an argument for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's there's a certain amount of </v>

2155
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:06.621
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the what was in the culture </v>

2156
01:40:06.621 --> 01:40:08.691
<v Speaker 1>high where they talked about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerating psychosis and paranoia and </v>

2157
01:40:08.691 --> 01:40:11.430
<v Speaker 1>all the different issues and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying there's no jump.</v>

2158
01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Even though more people are smoking pot </v>
<v Speaker 1>than ever.</v>

2159
01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:18.530
<v Speaker 1>There's no statistical jump in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people that are psychotic for </v>

2160
01:40:18.530 --> 01:40:22.311
<v Speaker 1>weed but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But mushrooms I think will definitely </v>

2161
01:40:22.311 --> 01:40:25.251
<v Speaker 1>break you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have mild schizophrenia and </v>

2162
01:40:25.251 --> 01:40:27.051
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get it later in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably speed it up by twice </v>

2163
01:40:27.051 --> 01:40:30.630
<v Speaker 1>your scientists throwing that around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do think that pot,</v>

2164
01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:35.660
<v Speaker 1>if you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just as likely to do a un maybe even </v>

2165
01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:36.750
<v Speaker 1>more so because pot if you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not reassuring.</v>

2166
01:40:37.190 --> 01:40:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no sweetness to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the overdose when you're,</v>

2167
01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.230
<v Speaker 1>when you're eating pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fear,</v>

2168
01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:48.330
<v Speaker 1>fear and death and spiral and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you trip out about when you,</v>

2169
01:40:48.331 --> 01:40:53.331
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you take my shrimps heart or not </v>

2170
01:40:53.331 --> 01:40:53.331
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>edible pot,</v>

2171
01:40:53.331 --> 01:40:57.651
<v Speaker 1>but for it's always like mortality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of friends and people getting </v>

2172
01:40:57.651 --> 01:41:01.330
<v Speaker 1>sick around you and the body ceasing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work properly.</v>

2173
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Especially people that I know like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that smoke cigarettes and shit like </v>

2174
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:06.990
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I freak out about you when I eat pot.</v>

2175
01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I do because I feel like there's people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around me that are poisoning themselves.</v>

2176
01:41:10.871 --> 01:41:12.370
<v Speaker 1>They don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2177
01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.990
<v Speaker 1>oh jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he doing?</v>

2178
01:41:14.050 --> 01:41:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Fuck they eating pot is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

2179
01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:22.890
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like one of the big paranoia </v>

2180
01:41:22.890 --> 01:41:22.890
<v Speaker 1>inducers of all the different</v>

2181
01:41:22.890 --> 01:41:25.500
<v Speaker 8>secretarial part anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't be a pussy,</v>

2182
01:41:25.501 --> 01:41:30.501
<v Speaker 8>get back in their head of the dea.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Tried to highlight this statement so you</v>

2183
01:41:30.631 --> 01:41:32.760
<v Speaker 8>can read it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This was like two weeks ago.</v>

2184
01:41:32.761 --> 01:41:35.160
<v Speaker 8>He said this in a report with conference</v>
<v Speaker 8>call.</v>

2185
01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.710
<v Speaker 8>If you want me to say that marijuana is </v>
<v Speaker 8>not dangerous.</v>

2186
01:41:37.711 --> 01:41:39.780
<v Speaker 8>I'm not going to say that because I </v>
<v Speaker 8>think it is.</v>

2187
01:41:40.170 --> 01:41:42.240
<v Speaker 8>Do I think it's as dangerous as heroin?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Probably not.</v>

2188
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:44.850
<v Speaker 8>I'm not an expert or who's the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 8>expert.</v>

2189
01:41:45.250 --> 01:41:50.250
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the head of the dea and he's not </v>

2190
01:41:50.250 --> 01:41:51.280
<v Speaker 1>an expert and saying stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That marijuana is dangerous.</v>

2191
01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think it's dangerous?</v>

2192
01:41:54.161 --> 01:41:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Chuck rosenberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking dunce.</v>

2193
01:41:57.130 --> 01:41:59.350
<v Speaker 1>That's so goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's not dangerous.</v>

2194
01:41:59.351 --> 01:42:01.090
<v Speaker 1>You know what's dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idiots.</v>

2195
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous.</v>

2196
01:42:02.321 --> 01:42:07.321
<v Speaker 1>If you give them wiffle ball bats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give them spoons and electrical </v>

2197
01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:07.321
<v Speaker 1>sockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2198
01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:09.040
<v Speaker 1>give him a fork and a toaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dangerous.</v>

2199
01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:10.420
<v Speaker 1>People are dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2200
01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Heroin is clearly more dangerous than </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

2201
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that.</v>

2202
01:42:15.610 --> 01:42:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then this week,</v>

2203
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:22.590
<v Speaker 1>rosenberg evolved further after a press </v>
<v Speaker 1>briefing on wednesday where people's </v>

2204
01:42:22.810 --> 01:42:26.440
<v Speaker 1>shit in his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told reporters that heroin is clearly</v>

2205
01:42:26.441 --> 01:42:28.810
<v Speaker 1>more dangerous than marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to huffington post.</v>

2206
01:42:28.811 --> 01:42:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Rosenberg said he's still considers </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana to be harmful and dangerous,</v>

2207
01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:37.440
<v Speaker 1>but was willing to make a firm </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between it and other </v>

2208
01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:37.440
<v Speaker 1>substances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While he's a fool,</v>

2209
01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.970
<v Speaker 1>you can't say harmful and dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you have data.</v>

2210
01:42:40.150 --> 01:42:43.810
<v Speaker 1>You are a dea agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the head guy.</v>

2211
01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:45.660
<v Speaker 1>You should have data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2212
01:42:45.670 --> 01:42:46.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2213
01:42:47.110 --> 01:42:49.660
<v Speaker 1>can you say that aspirin is dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2214
01:42:49.661 --> 01:42:50.650
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

2215
01:42:50.770 --> 01:42:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Because aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular old aspen kills a fuckload of </v>

2216
01:42:55.770 --> 01:42:56.350
<v Speaker 1>people every year a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands.</v>

2217
01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:58.900
<v Speaker 1>They die from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He overdosed from aspirin.</v>

2218
01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.520
<v Speaker 1>If you take too much as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2219
01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:05.760
<v Speaker 1>let's guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess how many do you think die every </v>

2220
01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:05.760
<v Speaker 1>year from aspirin?</v>

2221
01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Now that you know that people die from </v>
<v Speaker 1>asthma,</v>

2222
01:43:07.451 --> 01:43:07.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2223
01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:11.840
<v Speaker 8>I'd probably say 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>

2224
01:43:11.930 --> 01:43:12.950
<v Speaker 8>30,000</v>
<v Speaker 8>people here.</v>

2225
01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.930
<v Speaker 8>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was going to say a few hundred.</v>

2226
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:19.990
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>now I'm just thinking that a lot of </v>

2227
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:19.990
<v Speaker 8>people have aspirin and that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 8>something that people try to overdose to</v>

2228
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:24.200
<v Speaker 8>kill himself on a.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know aspirin also saves people's lives</v>

2229
01:43:24.201 --> 01:43:26.180
<v Speaker 8>because that's what you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 8>take if you're feeling like you're going</v>

2230
01:43:26.181 --> 01:43:29.180
<v Speaker 8>to have a heart attack and also they say</v>
<v Speaker 8>as a preventative measure,</v>

2231
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:34.470
<v Speaker 1>taken a little bit of aspirin because </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspirin is an antiinflammatory and taken</v>

2232
01:43:34.691 --> 01:43:39.691
<v Speaker 1>anti-inflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big issue with health or one of the </v>

2233
01:43:39.691 --> 01:43:42.751
<v Speaker 1>big issues I should say is inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big cars or have a lot of </v>

2234
01:43:42.751 --> 01:43:44.290
<v Speaker 1>different diseases and that's why they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that if you clean up your diet,</v>

2235
01:43:44.530 --> 01:43:46.540
<v Speaker 1>your body becomes less inflamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have.</v>

2236
01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:49.750
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the benefits of cryogenic </v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber to.</v>

2237
01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:51.500
<v Speaker 1>They think that the cryo</v>

2238
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:57.070
<v Speaker 5>cryo treatments provide those cold shock</v>
<v Speaker 5>proteins and anti inflammation responses</v>

2239
01:43:57.801 --> 01:44:01.730
<v Speaker 5>and they clean up inflammation inside </v>
<v Speaker 5>the body leading to less disease.</v>

2240
01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:05.060
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the theories behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long do you do that at a time.</v>

2241
01:44:05.061 --> 01:44:07.370
<v Speaker 5>Three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it like torture?</v>

2242
01:44:07.371 --> 01:44:08.810
<v Speaker 5>Three minutes or it says like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2243
01:44:08.811 --> 01:44:09.860
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is fun.</v>

2244
01:44:09.861 --> 01:44:11.780
<v Speaker 5>Almost too long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's cold as fuck dude.</v>

2245
01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:15.410
<v Speaker 5>Fda reverses its position on daily </v>
<v Speaker 5>aspirin.</v>

2246
01:44:15.411 --> 01:44:20.411
<v Speaker 5>Use this man they used to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need to take aspirin if you haven't </v>

2247
01:44:20.411 --> 01:44:23.390
<v Speaker 5>had a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>step away from the asprin bottle.</v>

2248
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:25.040
<v Speaker 5>If you're one of the 40 million </v>
<v Speaker 5>americans,</v>

2249
01:44:25.041 --> 01:44:26.630
<v Speaker 5>take aspirin every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2250
01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.280
<v Speaker 5>40 million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fda says,</v>

2251
01:44:28.281 --> 01:44:33.281
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see how many people have you had a </v>

2252

<v Speaker 5>Seven hundred 50.</v>

2254
01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:38.630
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2255
01:44:38.631 --> 01:44:39.480

<v Speaker 5>40,000</v>

2256
01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:42.620
<v Speaker 5>each year.</v>

2258
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:50.560
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15,000,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh my god.</v>

<v Speaker 5>15,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people die in 100,000</v>

2262
01:44:56.781 --> 01:45:01.781
<v Speaker 5>people are hospitalized as a result of </v>
<v Speaker 5>aspirin and other n s a nonsteroidal </v>

2263
01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:08.030
<v Speaker 5>antiinflammatories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they have a fever.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2267
01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:19.120

<v Speaker 5>Aspirin kills 400 percent more people </v>

2268
01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:21.950
<v Speaker 5>than the swine flu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nearly 100,000</v>

2269
01:45:21.951 --> 01:45:26.951
<v Speaker 5>americans die every year from his </v>
<v Speaker 5>adverse reactions to fda approved </v>

2270
01:45:27.411 --> 01:45:28.610
<v Speaker 5>prescription drugs.</v>

<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>

<v Speaker 5>God damn.</v>

<v Speaker 5>This.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible,</v>

2275
01:45:44.241 --> 01:45:46.280
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred and 7,000</v>

2276
01:45:46.281 --> 01:45:51.281
<v Speaker 5>patients are hospitalized annually for </v>
<v Speaker 5>nonsteroidal antiinflammatories,</v>

2277
01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.390
<v Speaker 5>which also includes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

2278
01:45:53.391 --> 01:45:58.391
<v Speaker 5>ibuprofen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ibuprofen is also a nonsteroidal anti </v>

2279
01:45:58.391 --> 01:45:59.570
<v Speaker 5>inflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the period one,</v>

2280
01:45:59.571 --> 01:46:00.650
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2281
01:46:00.710 --> 01:46:02.210
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ibuprofen,</v>

2282
01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:03.650
<v Speaker 5>advil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>headache stuff.</v>

2283
01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:04.970
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>advils the best.</v>

2284
01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.150
<v Speaker 5>So best for headaches and anything you'd</v>
<v Speaker 5>like muscle aches,</v>

2285
01:46:08.210 --> 01:46:09.910
<v Speaker 5>torn muscles or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you,</v>

2286
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:14.950
<v Speaker 5>why do you like advil or ibuprofen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tylenol sorta like I think if I had to </v>

2287
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:18.770
<v Speaker 5>guess,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think dulls the pain more,</v>

2288
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:21.590
<v Speaker 5>whereas ibuprofen gets the source of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>pain more,</v>

2289
01:46:21.591 --> 01:46:24.430
<v Speaker 5>which is inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

2290
01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:29.920
<v Speaker 5>most athletes prefer ibuprofen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like less risk factors </v>

2291
01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:34.691
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but apparently a lot of people get </v>

2292
01:46:34.691 --> 01:46:35.810
<v Speaker 5>fucked up by antiinflammatories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just can't believe it's that high.</v>

2293
01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.340
<v Speaker 5>The numbers are nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2294
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:42.760
<v Speaker 5>Swine flu is safer than aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A 16,500</v>

2295
01:46:44.661 --> 01:46:49.661
<v Speaker 5>nonsteroidal anti inflammatory deaths </v>
<v Speaker 5>occur among patients with rheumatoid </v>

2296
01:46:49.661 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 5>arthritis</v>

2297
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.490
<v Speaker 3>or osteoarthritis each year in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

2298
01:46:53.730 --> 01:46:56.160
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a nutty number,</v>

2299
01:46:56.161 --> 01:46:59.370
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixteen thousand 500 deaths</v>

2300
01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:06.200
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from anti-inflammatory pills from </v>

2301
01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:06.600
<v Speaker 3>ibuprofen and aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2302
01:47:06.601 --> 01:47:10.290
<v Speaker 3>So those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those drugs are 1000 percent more deadly</v>

2303
01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:12.690
<v Speaker 3>than swine flu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was accidental deaths.</v>

2304
01:47:12.691 --> 01:47:15.130
<v Speaker 3>Does it say that like does anyone use </v>
<v Speaker 3>note to commit suicide?</v>

2305
01:47:15.131 --> 01:47:16.830
<v Speaker 3>And people definitely use to commit </v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide,</v>

2306
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all bad suicide apparently.</v>

2307
01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.480
<v Speaker 3>That's a rough one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a long time.</v>

2308
01:47:21.481 --> 01:47:23.850
<v Speaker 3>Then to my headaches gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel great.</v>

2309
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.030
<v Speaker 3>I feel too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2310
01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:28.110
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is the number one </v>
<v Speaker 3>method of suicide?</v>

2311
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

2312
01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:33.090
<v Speaker 3>Or cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cutting.</v>

2313
01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:38.180
<v Speaker 3>Cutting your nanny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know girls cut in their name and </v>

2314
01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:38.500
<v Speaker 3>trying to kill themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would imagine cutting it after they</v>

2315
01:47:38.670 --> 01:47:39.390
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2316
01:47:39.391 --> 01:47:40.800
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something.</v>

2317
01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:42.240
<v Speaker 3>I've known a lot of cutters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

2318
01:47:42.241 --> 01:47:44.880
<v Speaker 3>How many cutters are out in los angeles </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've done many cutters.</v>

2319
01:47:44.881 --> 01:47:47.820
<v Speaker 3>It's all the girls you're dating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the pool you're drawing from.</v>

2320
01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Most guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is he talking about?</v>

2321
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:52.320
<v Speaker 3>People are listening to this right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

2322
01:47:52.321 --> 01:47:53.760
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people don't cut themselves.</v>

2323
01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:56.190
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't cut themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

2324
01:47:56.700 --> 01:48:00.510
<v Speaker 3>have you seen that new?</v>

<v Speaker 3>The subject dying.</v>

2326
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:05.760
<v Speaker 3>I would just want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before we get into that,</v>

2327
01:48:05.761 --> 01:48:10.761
<v Speaker 3>I just really wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think the number one method </v>

2328
01:48:10.761 --> 01:48:11.100
<v Speaker 3>for suicide is or to see if you had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gas cutting,</v>

2329
01:48:11.670 --> 01:48:13.890
<v Speaker 3>cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting risks.</v>

2330
01:48:14.010 --> 01:48:15.600
<v Speaker 3>Really cutting throat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jumping off.</v>

2331
01:48:15.601 --> 01:48:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jumping off.</v>

2332
01:48:16.531 --> 01:48:19.190
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to say overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say overdose,</v>

2333
01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.090
<v Speaker 3>but gunshots got to be in there </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

2334
01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:24.030
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's let's google the number one method</v>

2335
01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.880

<v Speaker 3>homicide comes up first.</v>

2339
01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.990
<v Speaker 3>That's what the google suggestion to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank.</v>

2340
01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>method of homicide.</v>

2341
01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:48.970
<v Speaker 3>How many people just google them because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fucking hate their wife or their </v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2346
01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:55.850

<v Speaker 3>I have two different things.</v>

2347
01:48:55.851 --> 01:48:57.630
<v Speaker 3>When I type in stuff at different things</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up,</v>

2348
01:48:57.631 --> 01:49:01.430
<v Speaker 3>but then you have your stuff please in </v>
<v Speaker 3>google if you never googled that before,</v>

2349
01:49:01.431 --> 01:49:02.840
<v Speaker 3>I've never googled that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

2350
01:49:02.841 --> 01:49:04.490
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put type in number one.</v>

2351
01:49:04.491 --> 01:49:09.491
<v Speaker 3>Method of for one method of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say I see fuck off.</v>

2352
01:49:11.850 --> 01:49:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Do you know though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're logged in,</v>

2353
01:49:12.970 --> 01:49:13.670
<v Speaker 3>you're logged in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2354
01:49:13.690 --> 01:49:16.730
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it comes up different because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I said something like,</v>

2355
01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:18.380
<v Speaker 3>we're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're way wrong.</v>

2356
01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:20.390
<v Speaker 3>What were really wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>

2357
01:49:20.391 --> 01:49:23.790
<v Speaker 3>his firearm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so shooting 50 percent makes sense.</v>

2358
01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:26.510
<v Speaker 3>Fifty percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shoot themselves 24 percent.</v>

2359
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:30.080
<v Speaker 3>They hang themselves or suffocate </v>
<v Speaker 3>poisoning,</v>

2360
01:49:30.081 --> 01:49:32.150
<v Speaker 3>which I thought was number one is only </v>
<v Speaker 3>16 percent.</v>

2361
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:37.930
<v Speaker 3>Jumping off shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jamie thought two point three percent </v>

2362
01:49:37.930 --> 01:49:38.210
<v Speaker 3>cut one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One point,</v>

2363
01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:42.260
<v Speaker 3>one point eight percent drowning is one </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

2364
01:49:42.261 --> 01:49:47.060
<v Speaker 3>One percent fire is zero point four </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

2365
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who would do</v>

2366
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.840
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

2367
01:49:50.110 --> 01:49:55.110
<v Speaker 5>Transporter related.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That means you jump in front of a truck </v>

2368
01:49:55.110 --> 01:49:59.640
<v Speaker 5>transporter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a weird euphemism transporter </v>

2369
01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:01.180
<v Speaker 5>related.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's zero point four percent.</v>

2370
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:03.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to die by transporting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2371
01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:08.960
<v Speaker 5>How weird men firearms 50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's America though as America shall </v>

2372
01:50:09.131 --> 01:50:11.350
<v Speaker 5>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When in doubt,</v>

2373
01:50:12.130 --> 01:50:17.130
<v Speaker 5>take it out so we scary way to die </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowing that you're gonna pull that </v>

2374
01:50:18.701 --> 01:50:23.701
<v Speaker 5>trigger and it's all going to go blank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've known more than one person </v>

2375
01:50:23.701 --> 01:50:27.901
<v Speaker 5>that's done it in my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've known several people that have </v>

2376
01:50:27.901 --> 01:50:27.901
<v Speaker 5>killed themselves with guns.</v>

2377
01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:32.370
<v Speaker 5>The are the weird article.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like when someone doesn't like that</v>

2378
01:50:32.371 --> 01:50:32.970
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2379
01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.040
<v Speaker 5>we need to change the gun laws.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when someone kills someone with a </v>

2380
01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:38.850
<v Speaker 5>gun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need to change gun laws.</v>

2381
01:50:39.450 --> 01:50:42.330
<v Speaker 5>Well I guess it's kind of easier to kill</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone if you have a gun,</v>

2382
01:50:42.331 --> 01:50:44.940
<v Speaker 5>but if somebody wants to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's because they want to kill you.</v>

2383
01:50:44.941 --> 01:50:49.941
<v Speaker 5>It's not because they have a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you have a gun and go </v>

2384
01:50:49.941 --> 01:50:49.941
<v Speaker 5>talking about fucking killing somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that I got this gun.</v>

2385
01:50:50.250 --> 01:50:55.250
<v Speaker 5>No you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You only use a gun to kill somebody </v>

2386
01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:56.430
<v Speaker 5>because you want to kill them unless </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an accidental gun shooting and then</v>

2387
01:50:56.431 --> 01:50:58.170
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

2388
01:50:58.830 --> 01:51:02.730
<v Speaker 5>But the idea that giving someone a gun </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes them more likely to kill people.</v>

2389
01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:03.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if I buy that.</v>

2390
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:11.550
<v Speaker 3>When the la riots were going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people had their own personal </v>

2391
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:15.481
<v Speaker 3>firearms and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy I know he said he had to like </v>

2392
01:51:15.481 --> 01:51:19.710
<v Speaker 3>go on the roof of his apartment with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gun because they were trying to break </v>

2393
01:51:19.710 --> 01:51:23.311
<v Speaker 3>into his house and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he actually had to shoot somebody </v>

2394
01:51:23.311 --> 01:51:24.940
<v Speaker 3>shot somebody that in like the arm or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2395
01:51:24.941 --> 01:51:27.010
<v Speaker 3>I think he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is this guy?</v>

2396
01:51:27.370 --> 01:51:29.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be a bullshitter.</v>

2397
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.920
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you off air is a bullshitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2398
01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:33.430
<v Speaker 3>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally.</v>

2399
01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:35.170
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2400
01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:40.500
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it dictates like a popcorn.</v>

2401
01:51:41.010 --> 01:51:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Your poop.</v>

2402
01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:51.800
<v Speaker 5>I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anthony bordain covered that on one of </v>

2403
01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:51.800
<v Speaker 5>his shows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2404
01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:55.800
<v Speaker 5>the riots in Korea town where the </v>
<v Speaker 5>koreans had to arm themselves,</v>

2405
01:51:55.801 --> 01:51:58.950
<v Speaker 5>get on top of their buildings because </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the cops were in beverly hills.</v>

2406
01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:02.250
<v Speaker 5>Remember that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Korea town just sorta got ransacked.</v>

2407
01:52:02.670 --> 01:52:05.010
<v Speaker 5>And these guys were on top of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>roofs with rifles.</v>

2408
01:52:05.011 --> 01:52:06.930
<v Speaker 5>They were getting in trouble for having </v>
<v Speaker 5>guns out.</v>

2409
01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:08.850
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look,</v>

2410
01:52:08.851 --> 01:52:12.510
<v Speaker 5>there was like this giant wall of cars </v>
<v Speaker 5>that guarded beverly hills.</v>

2411
01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:15.840
<v Speaker 5>It was really kind of fucked up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>racist and creepy.</v>

2412
01:52:16.410 --> 01:52:21.300
<v Speaker 5>There was a creepy moment the way that </v>
<v Speaker 5>police shielded parts of los angeles for</v>

2413
01:52:21.301 --> 01:52:24.330
<v Speaker 5>the riots and didn't do anything to </v>
<v Speaker 5>protect other parts.</v>

2414
01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:29.660
<v Speaker 5>And obviously they were given mandates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously there was someone that was </v>

2415
01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:31.080
<v Speaker 5>telling them what they're supposed to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not supposed to do,</v>

2416
01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:32.610
<v Speaker 5>but the weird choice.</v>

2417
01:52:32.770 --> 01:52:36.780
<v Speaker 5>It was just so openly and clearly defend</v>
<v Speaker 5>wealthy people.</v>

2418
01:52:37.110 --> 01:52:42.110
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot to lose in the wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's houses and worth millions and </v>

2419
01:52:42.110 --> 01:52:43.990
<v Speaker 5>billions of dollars in light of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Total stories and.</v>

2420
01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:44.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2421
01:52:44.650 --> 01:52:49.650
<v Speaker 5>but so the poor people and their stores </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't worth as much as I can get </v>

2422
01:52:49.650 --> 01:52:54.311
<v Speaker 5>replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Easier than like a painting that was </v>

2423
01:52:54.311 --> 01:52:54.311
<v Speaker 5>made by the vinci.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2424
01:52:54.311 --> 01:52:54.311
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2425
01:52:54.311 --> 01:52:54.311
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2426
01:52:54.311 --> 01:52:56.630
<v Speaker 5>You're not looking at it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're talking about businesses.</v>

2427
01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:58.640
<v Speaker 5>The talk there was these people were on </v>
<v Speaker 5>businesses.</v>

2428
01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:01.620
<v Speaker 5>These businesses probably got a million </v>
<v Speaker 5>dollars worth of merchandise and their.</v>

2429
01:53:01.621 --> 01:53:06.621
<v Speaker 5>Their business is getting broken into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really not that much different than</v>

2430
01:53:06.921 --> 01:53:11.921
<v Speaker 5>a rich person's house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just the fact that it's a business </v>

2431
01:53:11.921 --> 01:53:14.291
<v Speaker 5>in Korea town that was in new nwa movie </v>
<v Speaker 5>was cool seeing them remake that riot.</v>

2432
01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:18.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2433
01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:24.160
<v Speaker 5>There's an article about art thieves and</v>
<v Speaker 5>about how little do you read that today </v>

2434
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:30.950

<v Speaker 5>ever get recovered when there's art </v>

2435
01:53:31.851 --> 01:53:33.680
<v Speaker 5>theft is really interesting.</v>

2436
01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:38.980
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I lived in boston about 25 years </v>

2437
01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:38.980
<v Speaker 5>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was this big art,</v>

2438

<v Speaker 5>people broke into the.</v>

2439
01:53:45.081 --> 01:53:47.510

01:53:51.010 --> 01:53:51.530
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2444
01:53:51.531 --> 01:53:56.531
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a museum in boston and it was a </v>

<v Speaker 5>big time museum and these guys broke </v>
<v Speaker 5>into a 25 years ago and stole a shitload</v>

<v Speaker 5>I guess 25 years ago.</v>

2449

<v Speaker 5>But they are.</v>

<v Speaker 5>with the masterpieces in 1990 or dead.</v>

2455
01:54:21.561 --> 01:54:26.561
<v Speaker 5>The fbi say two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>investigators announced they knew who </v>

2456
01:54:26.561 --> 01:54:30.701

<v Speaker 5>including paintings by rembrandt and </v>

2457
01:54:30.701 --> 01:54:30.701
<v Speaker 5>vermeer.</v>

2458
01:54:30.701 --> 01:54:31.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who that dude is from </v>
<v Speaker 5>boston,</v>

2459
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:34.220
<v Speaker 5>isabella stewart gardner museum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where it is,</v>

2460
01:54:34.730 --> 01:54:39.730
<v Speaker 5>but they refused to elaborate saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>only the investigator was investigation </v>

2461
01:54:39.730 --> 01:54:43.280
<v Speaker 5>was focused on recovering the artwork so</v>
<v Speaker 5>this the suspects are dead.</v>

2462
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:48.310
<v Speaker 5>What's butts interested in $500,</v>
<v Speaker 5>million dollars worth of art and no </v>

2463
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:50.360
<v Speaker 5>one's ever recovered the art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So someone's got the art.</v>

2464
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:55.130
<v Speaker 5>Do you think it's just like North Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just have like a bunch of galleries</v>

2465
01:54:55.131 --> 01:55:00.131
<v Speaker 5>like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have all the most famous american </v>

2466
01:55:00.131 --> 01:55:00.131
<v Speaker 5>paintings and you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think it's rich people.</v>

2467
01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:05.460
<v Speaker 5>I think it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really rich people that don't give a </v>

2468
01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:07.511
<v Speaker 5>fuck where that art came from and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a private collection and they walk </v>

2469
01:55:07.511 --> 01:55:08.720
<v Speaker 5>by it and they laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You kNow that they bought a rembrandt,</v>

2470
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:13.580
<v Speaker 5>that they have a picasso,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that it's dangerous for them</v>

2471
01:55:13.581 --> 01:55:16.400
<v Speaker 5>because if they get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they know what that fucking thing is.</v>

2472
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:18.060
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a ram brand,</v>

2473
01:55:18.061 --> 01:55:19.400

<v Speaker 5>Someone to have to tell me,</v>

2475
01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:27.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as someone who's like a serious art </v>

2476
01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:28.700
<v Speaker 5>collector enough that they're willing to</v>
<v Speaker 5>spend millions of dollars on a painting,</v>

2477
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:30.470
<v Speaker 5>they're going to know exactly what that </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing is,</v>

2478
01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:35.820
<v Speaker 5>but people are creepy man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People that are collectors and </v>

2479
01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:38.481
<v Speaker 5>collectors of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People get real creepy about real </v>

2480
01:55:38.481 --> 01:55:40.070
<v Speaker 5>specifics like they want it picasso.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a rim brand.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they've needed picasso,</v>

2482
01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:48.620
<v Speaker 5>picasso,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but nothing is on the market and then </v>

2483
01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:50.781
<v Speaker 5>some guy comes up to you and says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know something that's about to go on </v>

2484
01:55:50.781 --> 01:55:54.351
<v Speaker 5>the market and right now it is in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>collection that is public and it will no</v>

2485
01:55:56.251 --> 01:55:59.310
<v Speaker 5>longer be public and someone will own it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it could be you.</v>

2486

<v Speaker 5>Would you be interested in this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2493
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:18.471
<v Speaker 5>I think we could work something out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then they have to figure out how to </v>

2494
01:56:18.471 --> 01:56:21.081
<v Speaker 5>exchange money or it doesn't get traced </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then have it looked at a praise to </v>

2495
01:56:21.081 --> 01:56:21.740
<v Speaker 5>make sure it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

2496
01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:22.860
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's tough.</v>

2497
01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:26.100
<v Speaker 5>That whole black market thing where </v>
<v Speaker 5>people have been busted doing that,</v>

2498
01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:28.350
<v Speaker 5>they'd been busted doing that with </v>
<v Speaker 5>statues.</v>

2499
01:56:28.351 --> 01:56:31.080
<v Speaker 5>There was a rome roman statue that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>brought.</v>

2500
01:56:31.081 --> 01:56:36.081
<v Speaker 5>This guy in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bryan county told me the story and then </v>

2501
01:56:36.081 --> 01:56:38.601
<v Speaker 5>I went and listened to it on something </v>
<v Speaker 5>else where this guy had this statue and </v>

2502
01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:44.900
<v Speaker 5>all day had spent so much money at </v>
<v Speaker 5>praising it and they bought it and they </v>

2503
01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:47.190
<v Speaker 5>brought in this expert and the expert </v>
<v Speaker 5>literally looked at it for a few minutes</v>

2504
01:56:47.191 --> 01:56:48.600
<v Speaker 5>and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you get your money back?</v>

2505
01:56:49.290 --> 01:56:50.190
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you talking about?</v>

2506
01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.330
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you get your money back?</v>

2507
01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:53.400
<v Speaker 5>This is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to get your money back.</v>

2508
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:58.430
<v Speaker 5>It's like why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And apparently he had bought it from a </v>

2509
01:56:58.430 --> 01:57:00.651
<v Speaker 5>legitimate source,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the legitimate source had been </v>

2510
01:57:00.651 --> 01:57:03.141
<v Speaker 5>swindled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they can figure out a way to </v>

2511
01:57:03.141 --> 01:57:05.880
<v Speaker 5>actually add mold shit to make it look </v>
<v Speaker 5>super old.</v>

2512
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:09.570
<v Speaker 5>They burry things underground and add </v>
<v Speaker 5>mold to them.</v>

2513
01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:14.490
<v Speaker 5>Like they figure out a way to have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if you can find something like,</v>

2514
01:57:14.491 --> 01:57:19.491
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's like really old like </v>

2515
01:57:19.491 --> 01:57:19.491
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody gave me a coin mark.</v>

2516
01:57:19.491 --> 01:57:23.250
<v Speaker 5>Gordon gave me a coin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an 1800 year old coin from rome,</v>

2517
01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:25.050
<v Speaker 5>but it is a fuck load of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2518
01:57:25.051 --> 01:57:26.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they made a bunch of them.</v>

2519
01:57:26.150 --> 01:57:31.150
<v Speaker 5>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoever the guy was at the time had a </v>

2520
01:57:31.150 --> 01:57:32.400
<v Speaker 5>shitload of his coins made.</v>

2521
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:34.080
<v Speaker 5>You can get ahold of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not cheap,</v>

2522
01:57:34.290 --> 01:57:37.080
<v Speaker 5>but you can get them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But a statue from back then,</v>

2523
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:42.470
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a really complex well worked piece </v>

2524
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:46.251
<v Speaker 5>of sculpture is probably worth insane </v>
<v Speaker 5>amounts of money if there's only one of </v>

2525
01:57:46.251 --> 01:57:48.360
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's 1800 years old,</v>

2526
01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:51.030
<v Speaker 5>2000 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably worth millions of dollars.</v>

2527
01:57:51.031 --> 01:57:53.520
<v Speaker 5>So if someone could sit around and </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to fake it.</v>

2528
01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:56.250
<v Speaker 5>so you make one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you make it real close,</v>

2529
01:57:56.270 --> 01:58:01.270
<v Speaker 5>then you slowly chip away at it and add </v>
<v Speaker 5>to it and then figure out a way to </v>

2530
01:58:01.351 --> 01:58:05.610
<v Speaker 5>simulate erosion and then figure out a </v>
<v Speaker 5>way to get this,</v>

2531
01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:07.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this mold in it.</v>

2532
01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.920
<v Speaker 5>And this mold was apparently the right </v>
<v Speaker 5>mold for the area,</v>

2533
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:16.100
<v Speaker 5>so it had a lot of people fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this one art expert just looked at </v>

2534
01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:16.100
<v Speaker 5>it and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2535
01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:17.760
<v Speaker 5>this is not right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not real.</v>

2536
01:58:18.210 --> 01:58:21.630
<v Speaker 5>Like he just knew you could just tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he'd just seen so many of them.</v>

2537
01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.390
<v Speaker 5>Whereas most people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you're a guy who's your,</v>

2538
01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:28.410
<v Speaker 5>your expertise is in appraising ancient </v>
<v Speaker 5>statues,</v>

2539
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:32.550
<v Speaker 5>you develop a finely honed sense of what</v>
<v Speaker 5>an ancient statue it looks like.</v>

2540
01:58:32.850 --> 01:58:35.730
<v Speaker 5>So for him it was like really obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like right away,</v>

2541
01:58:35.731 --> 01:58:38.460
<v Speaker 5>like the hue is off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something's off,</v>

2542
01:58:38.461 --> 01:58:40.050
<v Speaker 5>this can't be real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy shit.</v>

2543
01:58:40.051 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 5>You got to get your money back quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas,</v>

2544
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uri,</v>

2545
01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:43.360
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2546
01:58:43.361 --> 01:58:45.760
<v Speaker 3>do you dislike 3000 years old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard it's 5,000</v>

2547
01:58:45.761 --> 01:58:48.280
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd both be retarded fucking staring at</v>

2548
01:58:48.281 --> 01:58:49.470
<v Speaker 3>the stupid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

2549
01:58:49.690 --> 01:58:52.380
<v Speaker 3>mike from calabasas made it fat jermaine</v>

2550
01:58:52.690 --> 01:58:57.690
<v Speaker 8>jew and it doesn't make anything,</v>
<v Speaker 8>doesn't mean what does this movie </v>

2551
01:58:57.690 --> 01:59:01.551
<v Speaker 8>documentary tim's vermeer that for me or</v>
<v Speaker 8>just came up on here and it made me </v>

2552
01:59:01.551 --> 01:59:05.331
<v Speaker 8>think of it someone.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't remember which guest brought it </v>

2553
01:59:05.331 --> 01:59:05.331
<v Speaker 8>up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but this is a really,</v>

2554
01:59:05.331 --> 01:59:08.340
<v Speaker 8>really great documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Pendula made a millionaire guy.</v>

2555
01:59:08.341 --> 01:59:12.930
<v Speaker 8>He actually runs the company that makes </v>
<v Speaker 8>the newtek tricaster we use here.</v>

2556
01:59:14.850 --> 01:59:18.150
<v Speaker 8>He figured out this really long process </v>
<v Speaker 8>of how to recreate a.</v>

2557
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:23.270
<v Speaker 8>He made a forgery but no one knew how to</v>
<v Speaker 8>make the forgery and he spent years </v>

2558
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:27.830
<v Speaker 8>figuring out how this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>vermeer actually was making these photo </v>

2559
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:30.111
<v Speaker 8>realistic paintings and then figured out</v>
<v Speaker 8>how to do it himself and was making </v>

2560
01:59:30.111 --> 01:59:34.431
<v Speaker 8>paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I like a factory almost that we're </v>

2561
01:59:34.431 --> 01:59:36.750
<v Speaker 8>indecipherable from actual vermeer </v>
<v Speaker 8>distinguishable.</v>

2562
01:59:36.770 --> 01:59:38.030
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh wow.</v>

2563
01:59:38.250 --> 01:59:40.680
<v Speaker 8>Amazing art guys.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a really cool documentary.</v>

2564
01:59:40.710 --> 01:59:43.470
<v Speaker 8>Really worth checking out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I heard good things about this.</v>

2565
01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:46.110
<v Speaker 8>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

2566
01:59:46.111 --> 01:59:51.111
<v Speaker 8>I'd really like to watch it again just </v>
<v Speaker 8>to get inspired to the amount of work </v>

2567
01:59:51.111 --> 01:59:51.111
<v Speaker 8>this guy put in.</v>

2568
01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Anytime penn jillette gets involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's always going to kick </v>

2569
01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:56.240
<v Speaker 3>his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a smart dude.</v>

2570
01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:57.420
<v Speaker 3>He looks weird now though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's lost a lot of weight.</v>

2571
01:59:58.110 --> 02:00:03.110
<v Speaker 3>I never say that it's bad for someone to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be healthy or unhealthy for so long and </v>

2572
02:00:03.110 --> 02:00:07.791
<v Speaker 3>kind of recognize them as being this big</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat guy and now all of a sudden he's </v>

2573
02:00:07.791 --> 02:00:07.791
<v Speaker 3>like super thin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually.</v>

2574
02:00:07.791 --> 02:00:10.220
<v Speaker 3>Norton is like really thin right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>

2575
02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Se folks healthiest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He texted me the other day about cryo </v>

2576
02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:19.611
<v Speaker 3>chambers wants to start freezing that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>sent you guys that link a three new </v>

2577
02:00:20.641 --> 02:00:22.800
<v Speaker 3>three d display that doesn't require </v>
<v Speaker 3>glasses.</v>

2578
02:00:22.801 --> 02:00:25.060
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about it in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of uh,</v>

2579
02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:29.010
<v Speaker 3>what would be so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not three d tvs but not having to</v>

2580
02:00:29.011 --> 02:00:34.011
<v Speaker 3>wear glasses and watch a tv and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And gizmodo actually had a pretty good </v>

2581
02:00:34.410 --> 02:00:39.410
<v Speaker 3>article uSing care santa maria as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>example of the three d technology and </v>

2582
02:00:39.781 --> 02:00:43.470
<v Speaker 3>it's using a whole bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>projectors and screens.</v>

2583
02:00:43.470 --> 02:00:48.470
<v Speaker 3>But I guess it's really realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're staring at and you walk </v>

2584
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.470
<v Speaker 3>around her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2585
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:53.270
<v Speaker 3>it looks like her standing right in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of you and then they have a low.</v>

2586
02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:56.210
<v Speaker 3>So it's a hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kind of is a hologram.</v>

2587
02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:59.230
<v Speaker 3>But I think the goal of fullscreen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the young Jamey.</v>

2588
02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so here's,</v>

2589
02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:03.030
<v Speaker 3>that's a fake dude or real dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2590
02:01:03.031 --> 02:01:08.031
<v Speaker 3>this is a real dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how they're actually showing </v>

2591
02:01:08.031 --> 02:01:08.820
<v Speaker 3>they make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are all cameras around him.</v>

2592
02:01:08.821 --> 02:01:11.250
<v Speaker 3>I believe her lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it said 30 cameras.</v>

2593
02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:16.380
<v Speaker 3>So those are just lights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the 30 cameras are capturing 30 </v>

2594
02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:16.380
<v Speaker 3>different images.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2595
02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:18.150
<v Speaker 3>And so the three rows of 10 images.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2596
02:01:18.690 --> 02:01:21.330
<v Speaker 3>So they're recording all of him and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the different angles.</v>

2597
02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:25.920
<v Speaker 3>A morgan spurlock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the supersize me guy.</v>

2598
02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:31.530
<v Speaker 3>And so they're recording him moving and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of different ways.</v>

2599
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:34.950
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they do with it?</v>

2600
02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see now this is showing what their </v>

2601
02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:40.240
<v Speaker 3>feeling</v>

2602
02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:42.020
<v Speaker 8>of filming,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like if you were to walk around.</v>

2603
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:45.810
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

2604
02:01:45.811 --> 02:01:50.811
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they can take this w what we're </v>

2605
02:01:50.811 --> 02:01:53.030
<v Speaker 5>looking at and somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 5>project it in front of you,</v>

2606
02:01:53.031 --> 02:01:54.050
<v Speaker 5>like a hologram,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2607
02:01:54.110 --> 02:01:59.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you like that magic leap technology </v>

2608
02:01:59.110 --> 02:01:59.350
<v Speaker 5>server thing kind of a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

2609
02:01:59.351 --> 02:02:04.351
<v Speaker 5>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's turn this up a little so we can </v>

2610
02:02:04.351 --> 02:02:04.351
<v Speaker 5>hear what's going on.</v>

2611
02:02:04.351 --> 02:02:07.570
<v Speaker 9>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 9>led lights and 50 high definition </v>

2612
02:02:07.570 --> 02:02:09.300
<v Speaker 9>cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 9>After they captured all this data,</v>

2613
02:02:09.570 --> 02:02:12.810
<v Speaker 9>they put it together to make a three d </v>
<v Speaker 9>model of me.</v>

2614
02:02:12.811 --> 02:02:17.730
<v Speaker 9>And then they were able to project that </v>
<v Speaker 9>onto this screen as you see me now.</v>

2615
02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:22.010
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it looks like it is a screen,</v>

2616
02:02:22.011 --> 02:02:24.230
<v Speaker 8>but it's a three d screens.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you were to stare at it,</v>

2617
02:02:24.231 --> 02:02:26.540
<v Speaker 8>you would be able to walk to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to the left,</v>

2618
02:02:26.541 --> 02:02:27.020
<v Speaker 8>to the right,</v>

2619
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:29.380
<v Speaker 5>the hit this guy who was a holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 5>survivor.</v>

2620
02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:35.820
<v Speaker 5>Imagine going through the holocaust all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way to 2015 and they turned you into</v>

2621
02:02:36.221 --> 02:02:41.221
<v Speaker 5>a crazy three d animated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What series of generational jumps that </v>

2622
02:02:42.911 --> 02:02:44.100
<v Speaker 5>guys pass through?</v>

2623
02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:49.620
<v Speaker 8>Just think how cool it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 8>when this gets a little bit better in </v>

2624
02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:52.291
<v Speaker 8>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like the hall of presidents at </v>

2625
02:02:52.291 --> 02:02:52.291
<v Speaker 8>disneyland,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2626
02:02:52.291 --> 02:02:52.291
<v Speaker 8>and stuff like that where you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>actually,</v>

2627
02:02:52.291 --> 02:02:57.001
<v Speaker 8>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>abraham lincoln sitting right in front </v>

2628
02:02:57.001 --> 02:02:57.001
<v Speaker 8>of me.</v>

2629
02:02:57.001 --> 02:02:58.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get real holographs real</v>

2630
02:02:58.031 --> 02:03:03.031
<v Speaker 5>holograms rather that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you probably be shocked when your hand </v>

2631
02:03:03.031 --> 02:03:05.050
<v Speaker 5>goes through them and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get to a point,</v>

2632
02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:10.080
<v Speaker 5>especially if this magic leap is in any </v>
<v Speaker 5>way indicative of what it's going to </v>

2633
02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:13.270
<v Speaker 5>really look like when it's done because </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now you're looking at it and it's </v>

2634
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.930
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much of that is proof of concept?</v>

2635
02:03:13.931 --> 02:03:16.060
<v Speaker 5>How much of that is the actual video of </v>
<v Speaker 5>magic leap?</v>

2636
02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:18.220
<v Speaker 5>If you don't know what magic leap is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Google.</v>

2637
02:03:18.221 --> 02:03:23.221
<v Speaker 5>It's a wild new hologram thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're doing where they have like a,</v>

2638
02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:27.130
<v Speaker 5>an elephant dancing inside a person's </v>
<v Speaker 5>palm.</v>

2639
02:03:27.170 --> 02:03:32.170
<v Speaker 5>TheY had a um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little ballerina that was on a girl's </v>

2640
02:03:32.170 --> 02:03:32.860
<v Speaker 5>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a four inch ballerina,</v>

2641
02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:35.410
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know like how much of that is?</v>

2642
02:03:35.730 --> 02:03:38.970
<v Speaker 8>That was a demo.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I think that's not real.</v>

2643
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:41.520
<v Speaker 8>I think that just saying what in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>future will look like.</v>

2644
02:03:41.650 --> 02:03:44.940
<v Speaker 8>I remember reading someone has tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he had to be very careful about what</v>

2645
02:03:44.941 --> 02:03:47.950
<v Speaker 8>he was allowed to say.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You actually experienced it.</v>

2646
02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:50.220
<v Speaker 8>You had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 8>very rudimentary,</v>

2647
02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:52.650
<v Speaker 8>very early version of as a giant </v>
<v Speaker 8>football house,</v>

2648
02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:54.390
<v Speaker 8>how helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 8>size thing you had to wear.</v>

2649
02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:58.620
<v Speaker 8>It was projecting things in front of his</v>
<v Speaker 8>eyes on it to us screen like thing,</v>

2650
02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:03.300
<v Speaker 8>but they're doing some called light </v>
<v Speaker 8>field augmentation.</v>

2651
02:04:03.301 --> 02:04:08.301
<v Speaker 8>It's there make.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like brand new technology that no </v>

2652
02:04:08.301 --> 02:04:08.840
<v Speaker 8>one else has used,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so we can't compare it to you.</v>

2653
02:04:08.930 --> 02:04:11.310
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how they're projecting it.</v>

2654
02:04:11.550 --> 02:04:16.550
<v Speaker 5>Like if.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So right now he's got to wear this </v>

2655
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:18.531
<v Speaker 5>helmet thing and then eventually they'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>break it down to like a google glass </v>

2656
02:04:18.531 --> 02:04:19.260
<v Speaker 5>type size or sunglasses or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

2657
02:04:19.261 --> 02:04:22.380
<v Speaker 5>but I wonder how they're projecting it </v>
<v Speaker 5>in front of you.</v>

2658
02:04:22.381 --> 02:04:26.460
<v Speaker 5>Like how is it just a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it a recreation of three d?</v>

2659
02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:27.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're</v>

2660
02:04:27.150 --> 02:04:32.150
<v Speaker 8>putting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're actually projecting light into </v>

2661
02:04:32.150 --> 02:04:32.150
<v Speaker 8>your eye.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like we're,</v>

2662
02:04:32.150 --> 02:04:32.260
<v Speaker 8>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're expecting,</v>

2663
02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:34.740
<v Speaker 8>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>accepting light into our eyes right now.</v>

2664
02:04:34.741 --> 02:04:39.741
<v Speaker 8>Like throw irises,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they're going to shoot light your </v>

2665
02:04:39.741 --> 02:04:39.741
<v Speaker 8>eye,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like lasers</v>

2666
02:04:39.741 --> 02:04:41.040
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long before someone goes blind or as</v>

2667
02:04:41.041 --> 02:04:46.041
<v Speaker 1>I cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying now that cell phones </v>

2668
02:04:46.041 --> 02:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>absolutely cause cancer was serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2669
02:04:46.990 --> 02:04:51.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a study that says that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty positive that cellphones cause </v>

2670
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:51.990
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

2671
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:56.690
<v Speaker 2>It's going to good to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or most people's is there a such thing </v>

2672
02:04:56.690 --> 02:04:57.900
<v Speaker 2>as hand cancer because that's what would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the most right from texting all day.</v>

2673
02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people get hand cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>that much.</v>

2674
02:04:59.791 --> 02:05:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Hands are pretty durable.</v>

2675
02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2676
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:10.310
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This cell phones cause cancer cell </v>

2677
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>phones in the cancer risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2678
02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:14.690
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent article about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were talking about.</v>

2679
02:05:14.710 --> 02:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find the recent version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2680
02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Don't smoke yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Own berkeley.</v>

2681
02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley says cell phones cause tumors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from a just a couple months ago.</v>

2682
02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley is the first city to,</v>

2683
02:05:28.330 --> 02:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>of the park is filled with hippies </v>
<v Speaker 1>firstly to mandate cell phone carriers,</v>

2684
02:05:32.471 --> 02:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>informed buyers of potential radiation </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure.</v>

2685
02:05:35.530 --> 02:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>A neuroscientist on why it's premature </v>
<v Speaker 1>to claim co phones costing answer.</v>

2686
02:05:40.090 --> 02:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>That might've been when I left read from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daily beast.</v>

2687
02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:44.570
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>

2688
02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes sense though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is probably.</v>

2689
02:05:49.570 --> 02:05:53.860
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not good to have all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>wifi signals running through our fucking</v>

2690
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>houses constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2691
02:05:56.021 --> 02:06:01.021
<v Speaker 1>how could it be good that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing hundreds of megabytes around </v>

2692
02:06:01.021 --> 02:06:02.230
<v Speaker 1>the room in the air?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2693
02:06:02.410 --> 02:06:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this phone is.</v>

2694
02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:08.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this laptop's downloading shit right </v>

2695
02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:08.890
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely unconnected by wires.</v>

2696
02:06:08.891 --> 02:06:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Yours is as well.</v>

2697
02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:14.980
<v Speaker 2>We there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's movies in the air right now </v>

2698
02:06:14.980 --> 02:06:17.650
<v Speaker 2>around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like dick pics right next to </v>

2699
02:06:17.650 --> 02:06:17.650
<v Speaker 2>your team</v>

2700
02:06:17.650 --> 02:06:17.700
<v Speaker 1>radios,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio signals in the air,</v>

2701
02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.340
<v Speaker 1>cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signals or signals or in the air?</v>

2702
02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they say that fucks with bees.</v>

2703
02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:26.340
<v Speaker 1>That bs apparently they hear it like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>jackhammer,</v>

2704
02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:30.150
<v Speaker 1>like the ways the way bees communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>

2705
02:06:30.810 --> 02:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I think they're pretty positive that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bees are negatively impacted by the </v>

2706
02:06:35.810 --> 02:06:37.950
<v Speaker 1>sounds and the signals that are flying </v>
<v Speaker 1>around them all the time.</v>

2707
02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Why fi cell phone radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that jazz.</v>

2708
02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:43.230
<v Speaker 1>That it's fucking with their peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2709
02:06:43.231 --> 02:06:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much we feel or how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much it impacts us,</v>

2710
02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>but what I do know is every time I go </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere where there's no cell phone </v>

2711
02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:57.250
<v Speaker 1>was like Alaska or Montana or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that where you're out in the real </v>

2712
02:06:57.250 --> 02:06:58.020
<v Speaker 1>wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems different.</v>

2713
02:06:58.410 --> 02:07:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Like the actual physical environment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air seems different.</v>

2714
02:07:01.951 --> 02:07:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're standing out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2715
02:07:05.071 --> 02:07:06.390
<v Speaker 1>what is this is a different kind of.</v>

2716
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Solitude is a different kind of silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like real silence.</v>

2717
02:07:10.441 --> 02:07:13.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something missing in the air and</v>

2718
02:07:13.711 --> 02:07:17.130
<v Speaker 1>it could be just totally bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a placebo.</v>

2719
02:07:17.370 --> 02:07:22.370
<v Speaker 1>It could be just the fact that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't get a cell phone signal </v>

2720
02:07:22.370 --> 02:07:25.671
<v Speaker 1>and there's no one for miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see anybody that it just like </v>

2721
02:07:25.671 --> 02:07:26.760
<v Speaker 1>gives you this feeling of solitude that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of accentuates the,</v>

2722
02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:30.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quiet of the environment,</v>

2723
02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:31.890
<v Speaker 1>but it might not be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be.</v>

2724
02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:36.900
<v Speaker 1>There might be an actual physical thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're feeling in your brain that </v>

2725
02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:39.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't quite put your finger on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's there all the time.</v>

2726
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:44.870
<v Speaker 8>It just makes me wonder though,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if we could look at it like something </v>

2727
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.870
<v Speaker 8>like a nap though and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2728
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:46.230
<v Speaker 8>day would feel it first.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2729
02:07:46.231 --> 02:07:51.231
<v Speaker 8>they're so small that just a tiny gnat </v>
<v Speaker 8>or what are those little red dots that </v>

2730
02:07:51.231 --> 02:07:54.630
<v Speaker 8>are insects that are always like walking</v>
<v Speaker 8>around on bricks and stuff.</v>

2731
02:07:54.660 --> 02:07:57.420
<v Speaker 8>Even though I'm taLking about like a </v>
<v Speaker 8>bright orange dot and you're like,</v>

2732
02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:59.370
<v Speaker 8>I'll just accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's a bug.</v>

2733
02:07:59.430 --> 02:08:01.000
<v Speaker 8>That orange dot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2734
02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:01.280
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

2735
02:08:01.281 --> 02:08:03.390
<v Speaker 8>we in talk to him about this little </v>
<v Speaker 8>dots.</v>

2736
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:08.510
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're like these little insects that </v>

2737
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.510
<v Speaker 8>looks like a little red dot and it's </v>
<v Speaker 8>like a pixel,</v>

2738
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:13.390
<v Speaker 8>but they're super small.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if they haven't been </v>

2739
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:13.390
<v Speaker 8>California.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maybe</v>

2740
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:15.060
<v Speaker 1>there's two articles in a row here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's official.</v>

2741
02:08:15.061 --> 02:08:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Cellphones are killing bees and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>right below it,</v>

2742
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:22.230
<v Speaker 1>cell phones don't kill bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is from 2011,</v>

2743
02:08:22.231 --> 02:08:25.910
<v Speaker 1>May 21st.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one is may 20,</v>

2744
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:27.630
<v Speaker 1>May 19th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2011.</v>

2745
02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:31.110
<v Speaker 1>So hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's the fuck?</v>

2746
02:08:31.111 --> 02:08:33.690
<v Speaker 1>His sermon is supposed to figure it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be squirt.</v>

2747
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I think they were saying that interferes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

2748
02:08:38.450 --> 02:08:42.660
<v Speaker 1>So let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bees and still a cell phones interfere.</v>

2749
02:08:42.661 --> 02:08:47.661
<v Speaker 1>Let's do this turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear study links.</v>

2750
02:08:48.751 --> 02:08:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Bees declined to cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was on cnn.</v>

2751
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're saying the cell phone </v>

2752
02:08:58.990 --> 02:09:01.730
<v Speaker 1>signals somehow or another cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation may be contributing to the </v>

2753
02:09:01.730 --> 02:09:03.720
<v Speaker 1>decline in bee populations in some areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

2754
02:09:04.090 --> 02:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radiolab.</v>

2755
02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I had this interesting story about bees </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in China.</v>

2756
02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:11.150
<v Speaker 1>They because of what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you.</v>

2757
02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>What are you pulling up here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie says it doesn't say the government</v>

2758
02:09:15.721 --> 02:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2759
02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Those are criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a criminal website.</v>

2760
02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:20.270
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be.</v>

2761
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Might as well be isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

2762
02:09:22.710 --> 02:09:25.710
<v Speaker 1>They're telling you the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a.</v>

2763
02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:28.650
<v Speaker 1>But this is the huffington post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro says it's real.</v>

2764
02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:30.840
<v Speaker 1>What was I just saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2765
02:09:30.841 --> 02:09:35.841
<v Speaker 1>decline and bs in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did this study where they found out</v>

2766
02:09:36.331 --> 02:09:40.020
<v Speaker 1>that they had rapidly declining bee </v>
<v Speaker 1>populations for whatever reasons,</v>

2767
02:09:40.021 --> 02:09:40.860
<v Speaker 1>pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2768
02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:46.220
<v Speaker 1>And so they decided that they were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to figure out another way to </v>

2769
02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:48.060
<v Speaker 1>pollinate some of their plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these apple trees,</v>

2770
02:09:48.330 --> 02:09:53.330
<v Speaker 1>so they hand pollinated the apple trees </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their yield went through the roof </v>

2771
02:09:53.670 --> 02:09:56.730
<v Speaker 1>because apparently when you have bees do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2772
02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>bees are sloppy fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know what they're doing.</v>

2773
02:09:59.350 --> 02:10:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're asking someone to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and they don't even know what </v>

2774
02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:04.350
<v Speaker 1>they're doing and they're idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2775
02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:05.280
<v Speaker 1>bees are just little robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little insect robots,</v>

2776
02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:07.340
<v Speaker 1>they just run around and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2777
02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:11.010
<v Speaker 1>they get this pollen and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally spread it.</v>

2778
02:10:11.310 --> 02:10:16.310
<v Speaker 1>They're not doing it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you have people do it on </v>

2779
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:18.711
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had people doing it with paint </v>

2780
02:10:18.711 --> 02:10:18.900
<v Speaker 1>brushes and when they had the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it with paint brushes,</v>

2781
02:10:19.170 --> 02:10:24.170
<v Speaker 1>like significant increase in yield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then people wanted more money and </v>

2782
02:10:24.961 --> 02:10:26.310
<v Speaker 1>then they realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2783
02:10:26.311 --> 02:10:31.311
<v Speaker 1>in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the more lucrative the business </v>

2784
02:10:31.311 --> 02:10:35.061
<v Speaker 1>became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more people organized and said we </v>

2785
02:10:35.061 --> 02:10:37.191
<v Speaker 1>want more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more they decided it was cost </v>

2786
02:10:37.191 --> 02:10:37.191
<v Speaker 1>prohibitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they tried.</v>

2787
02:10:37.191 --> 02:10:39.020
<v Speaker 1>This is all from a radio lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts call,</v>

2788
02:10:39.021 --> 02:10:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't quote me on that though,</v>

2789
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:43.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was all about how much are things</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth.</v>

2790
02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:46.370
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about were how much,</v>

2791
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:52.330
<v Speaker 1>how much is it worth to have bees </v>
<v Speaker 1>pollinate these plants that you don't </v>

2792
02:10:52.330 --> 02:10:53.720
<v Speaker 1>think about it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about it like,</v>

2793
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:54.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a part of nature,</v>

2794
02:10:55.130 --> 02:10:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but if you had to put a monetary value </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>

2795
02:10:57.051 --> 02:11:02.051
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you would think more </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully about maintaining healthy bee </v>

2796
02:11:02.091 --> 02:11:07.091
<v Speaker 1>populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the number they were using </v>

2797
02:11:07.091 --> 02:11:09.881
<v Speaker 1>was in the billions that having healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>bee populations that pollinate plants is</v>

2798
02:11:10.101 --> 02:11:12.170
<v Speaker 1>worth x amount of billions of dollars in</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor.</v>

2799
02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2800
02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:19.020
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you could eat like those </v>
<v Speaker 3>little robot drone things.</v>

2801
02:11:19.021 --> 02:11:21.330
<v Speaker 3>We could almost make her own robot bees </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the future.</v>

2802
02:11:21.410 --> 02:11:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have done that.</v>

2803
02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have done that.</v>

2804
02:11:23.530 --> 02:11:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto has drone bees.</v>

2805
02:11:26.031 --> 02:11:27.680
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing them now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull them up.</v>

2806
02:11:27.681 --> 02:11:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto drone bees.</v>

2807
02:11:29.871 --> 02:11:34.871
<v Speaker 1>Where you see this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the idea I think is once we </v>

2808
02:11:34.871 --> 02:11:36.710
<v Speaker 1>pollute the atmosphere to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where bees can't live anymore,</v>

2809
02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:41.060
<v Speaker 1>they're going to release these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>insect hordes traveling to the field.</v>

2810
02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:42.620
<v Speaker 1>He's horrible little monster</v>

2811
02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:47.660
<v Speaker 3>spice and dynamics just released a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>robot video running through a forest and</v>

2812
02:11:49.131 --> 02:11:53.540
<v Speaker 3>it's very creepy looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like an army soldier.</v>

2813
02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Those fucking things are terrifying man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston dynamics or they make some of the</v>

2814
02:11:57.921 --> 02:12:02.921
<v Speaker 3>scariest shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you find any monsanto bs drone be I </v>

2815
02:12:03.591 --> 02:12:06.140
<v Speaker 3>sent you the link of the other robot </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're going to look at that while</v>

2816
02:12:06.141 --> 02:12:08.120
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to.</v>

2817
02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:13.300
<v Speaker 3>The only stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine on this monsanto or sites that </v>

2818
02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:13.300
<v Speaker 3>don't look legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2819
02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Robotic bees to pollinate monsanto </v>
<v Speaker 3>crops.</v>

2820
02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:20.730
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First news that wordpress dot jude.</v>

2821

<v Speaker 3>Says the harvard monolithic be harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2826
02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Microbiotics lab had been working with </v>
<v Speaker 1>its micro air vehicles projects since </v>

2827
02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:43.550
<v Speaker 1>2009 working on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's borrowing from the biomechanics and</v>

2828
02:12:43.551 --> 02:12:48.551
<v Speaker 1>social organization of bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That team of researches is undergoing </v>

2829
02:12:48.551 --> 02:12:51.170
<v Speaker 1>the creation of a tiny wing robot.</v>

2830
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Look at this fucking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2831
02:12:53.670 --> 02:12:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems real so size of a penny.</v>

2832
02:12:58.830 --> 02:12:59.280
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2833
02:12:59.330 --> 02:13:01.610
<v Speaker 1>So they cut that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be out of that thing.</v>

2834
02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:05.460
<v Speaker 1>The little circuit board publish </v>
<v Speaker 1>reports.</v>

2835
02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:08.180
<v Speaker 1>no lab also described potential military</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses,</v>

2836
02:13:08.181 --> 02:13:10.490
<v Speaker 1>surveillance and mapping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the dime size,</v>

2837
02:13:10.491 --> 02:13:13.770
<v Speaker 1>cyber bees have yet to be outfitted with</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuro</v>

2838
02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:15.490
<v Speaker 3>hacks and tips.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This looks real as fuck.</v>

2841
02:13:18.041 --> 02:13:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is fake.</v>

2842
02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:22.240
<v Speaker 3>This is a really elaborate sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hoax that are.</v>

2843
02:13:22.241 --> 02:13:25.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like final at some college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2844
02:13:25.210 --> 02:13:27.280
<v Speaker 3>some engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say that was my final.</v>

2845
02:13:27.670 --> 02:13:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be,</v>

2846
02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:32.610
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it's anything of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>realm of possibility.</v>

2847
02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:33.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>

2848
02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:37.560
<v Speaker 3>It is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

2849
02:13:37.890 --> 02:13:42.150
<v Speaker 3>Look at this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the little tiny fake bug.</v>

2850
02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:47.400
<v Speaker 3>So how's this thing fly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See you.</v>

2851
02:13:48.090 --> 02:13:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things go so fast you can't even </v>

2852
02:13:53.090 --> 02:13:54.480
<v Speaker 3>see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they move just like a real bug,</v>

2853
02:13:54.630 --> 02:13:55.830
<v Speaker 3>like the same sort of thing.</v>

2854
02:13:56.170 --> 02:14:01.170
<v Speaker 10>Printed circuit madness,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a versatile process for creating </v>

2855
02:14:01.170 --> 02:14:04.390
<v Speaker 10>machines at the millimeter scale.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They can't create complex electrical and</v>

2856
02:14:04.391 --> 02:14:07.660
<v Speaker 10>mechanical systems using a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 10>techniques.</v>

2857
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't see it flying</v>

2858
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:14.030
<v Speaker 10>process well suited to mass production.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It seems like some parallel </v>

2859
02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:16.470
<v Speaker 10>manufacturing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>large numbers of robotic device</v>

2860
02:14:16.530 --> 02:14:19.820
<v Speaker 3>sounds like an idea again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2861
02:14:19.821 --> 02:14:24.821
<v Speaker 3>they didn't fly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just showed the wings buzzing when </v>

2862
02:14:24.821 --> 02:14:25.190
<v Speaker 3>she could've just hooked up to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>battery.</v>

2863
02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:30.540
<v Speaker 3>Fine bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you show us something that </v>

2864
02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.940
<v Speaker 3>flies but not have it fly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems silly,</v>

2865
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2866
02:14:32.670 --> 02:14:37.670
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that boston dynamics robot is real </v>

2867
02:14:37.670 --> 02:14:42.520
<v Speaker 3>and it looks like a soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like star wars running through </v>

2868
02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:43.490
<v Speaker 3>a look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so awful.</v>

2869
02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:46.940
<v Speaker 3>There's a video also have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just an animated gif,</v>

2870
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:50.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>

2871
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:56.210
<v Speaker 3>It's weird because it's hooked up right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now to a giant tube in the back of it,</v>

2872
02:14:56.211 --> 02:15:01.211
<v Speaker 3>but that's just for now is aren't they </v>
<v Speaker 3>owned by google now or something like </v>

2873
02:15:01.211 --> 02:15:01.850
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prostitute dynamics.</v>

2874
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Skynet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean that they're showing all their </v>

2875
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:08.450
<v Speaker 3>different robots right now in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>

2876
02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:11.000
<v Speaker 3>My friend who worked for google doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>work for google anymore,</v>

2877
02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:12.950
<v Speaker 3>so now I can't find out when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to attack.</v>

2878
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:18.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was hoping that she could at least </v>

2879
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:19.961
<v Speaker 3>send me the batsignal skynet's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go live and these robots are going to </v>

2880
02:15:19.961 --> 02:15:20.900
<v Speaker 3>start attacking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but does she,</v>

2881
02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:23.780
<v Speaker 3>does she works somewhere better like </v>
<v Speaker 3>apple or something like that?</v>

2882
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:26.030
<v Speaker 3>She moved to another corporation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you about later.</v>

2883
02:15:26.210 --> 02:15:27.260
<v Speaker 3>But look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2884
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:29.480
<v Speaker 3>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking on those uneven rocks.</v>

2885
02:15:29.570 --> 02:15:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2886
02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:35.620
<v Speaker 3>it gets hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lifts his leg up and check the leg </v>

2887
02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:37.880
<v Speaker 3>kick balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a 20 pound ball that slammed into</v>

2888
02:15:37.881 --> 02:15:41.750
<v Speaker 3>it at 20 pound piece of metal or 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>kilograms.</v>

2889
02:15:41.751 --> 02:15:44.240
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagining these things during riots.</v>

2890
02:15:44.330 --> 02:15:46.280
<v Speaker 3>They're just going to throw these robots</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>

2891
02:15:46.281 --> 02:15:48.620
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to have any real </v>
<v Speaker 3>judgment skills.</v>

2892
02:15:48.621 --> 02:15:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Just grab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2893
02:15:51.110 --> 02:15:55.610
<v Speaker 3>keep out the real worries that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>how we're going to do our wars,</v>

2894
02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.070
<v Speaker 3>that these things are going to go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities and just kill people.</v>

2895
02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:03.440
<v Speaker 3>And this is a robot versus robot until </v>
<v Speaker 3>robots get to people and they decimate </v>

2896
02:16:03.590 --> 02:16:05.630
<v Speaker 3>human populations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we,</v>

2897
02:16:05.631 --> 02:16:07.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the wars we have.</v>

2898
02:16:07.551 --> 02:16:10.510
<v Speaker 3>We send robots to kill people and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>we sell,</v>

2899
02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:15.580
<v Speaker 3>send robots to kill robots that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to kill people and then we send </v>

2900
02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:17.200
<v Speaker 3>our robots to kill the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>created a robot to kill the people.</v>

2901
02:16:17.201 --> 02:16:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Know we got robot wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2902
02:16:18.710 --> 02:16:19.880
<v Speaker 3>that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2903
02:16:19.881 --> 02:16:21.320
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna start off.</v>

2904
02:16:21.321 --> 02:16:22.220
<v Speaker 3>Pretty cool though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2905
02:16:22.221 --> 02:16:23.420
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting attacked,</v>

2906
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:27.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's a robot attack and we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>robots and we're just watching robots on</v>

2907
02:16:27.410 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 3>tv here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2908
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:31.900
<v Speaker 5>for a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So jamie,</v>

2909
02:16:31.901 --> 02:16:36.901
<v Speaker 5>there is a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just look up robotic bees could change </v>

2910
02:16:36.901 --> 02:16:40.111
<v Speaker 5>the world and then go to a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty far down like maybe seven </v>

2911
02:16:40.661 --> 02:16:45.661
<v Speaker 5>eighth into the video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll see this thing is attached with a</v>

2912
02:16:45.761 --> 02:16:49.300
<v Speaker 5>very small wire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it actually is flying.</v>

2913
02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:54.930
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking crazy to look at man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's really weird.</v>

2914
02:16:55.100 --> 02:17:00.100
<v Speaker 5>It's a three minute videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go to bella to 40 something and you can </v>

2915
02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:03.210
<v Speaker 5>see the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a fake bug flying,</v>

2916
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:05.860
<v Speaker 5>but it's connected just like that robot </v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2917
02:17:06.370 --> 02:17:11.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the road was connected with a hose in </v>

2918
02:17:11.370 --> 02:17:13.251
<v Speaker 5>the back with wires.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is connected with a very small </v>

2919
02:17:13.251 --> 02:17:13.251
<v Speaker 5>wire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's real.</v>

2920
02:17:13.251 --> 02:17:18.110
<v Speaker 5>So it's not just a proof concept.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just have to figure out a power </v>

2921
02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:21.621
<v Speaker 5>source that makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not as the robot bees are </v>

2922
02:17:24.111 --> 02:17:29.111
<v Speaker 5>fucking crazy and creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what's really creepy is see that </v>

2923
02:17:29.571 --> 02:17:31.490
<v Speaker 5>thing will get that thing flying when </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's real.</v>

2924
02:17:31.970 --> 02:17:34.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's mimicking a hummingbird or a</v>
<v Speaker 5>b.</v>

2925
02:17:34.930 --> 02:17:36.040
<v Speaker 5>But look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll see.</v>

2926
02:17:36.050 --> 02:17:37.790
<v Speaker 5>This is an actual baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but look at it right there.</v>

2927
02:17:38.630 --> 02:17:39.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is flying.</v>

2928
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:41.000
<v Speaker 5>That's nuts man.</v>

2929
02:17:42.510 --> 02:17:42.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2930
02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:45.790
<v Speaker 5>here's what's scarier though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go to 10.</v>

2931
02:17:45.850 --> 02:17:49.930
<v Speaker 5>Incredible micro robots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is fucking nuts,</v>

2932
02:17:49.931 --> 02:17:52.180
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What way do you see this video?</v>

2933
02:17:52.510 --> 02:17:54.910
<v Speaker 5>Ten.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Incredible micro robots.</v>

2934
02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:00.700
<v Speaker 5>Micro and then dash robots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Top one.</v>

2935
02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:01.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

2936
02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:07.020
<v Speaker 5>Check this shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is one style that flies around like</v>

2937
02:18:07.601 --> 02:18:09.700
<v Speaker 5>little helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at these fucking things,</v>

2938
02:18:09.701 --> 02:18:11.470
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They come out of these boxes.</v>

2939
02:18:11.710 --> 02:18:14.290
<v Speaker 5>So imagine that you're sitting in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>office.</v>

2940
02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:14.990
<v Speaker 5>This is fake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2941
02:18:15.090 --> 02:18:17.830
<v Speaker 5>This is proof of context.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

2942
02:18:18.370 --> 02:18:20.830
<v Speaker 5>but look at some of these ones that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're creating.</v>

2943
02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:22.800
<v Speaker 5>These are all the different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2944
02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:25.990
<v Speaker 5>so this is self organizing systems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>research lab from harvard,</v>

2945
02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:30.230
<v Speaker 5>these things organized and they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out where to go look,</v>

2946
02:18:30.231 --> 02:18:33.100
<v Speaker 5>look at this elapsed time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>11 hours elapsed time,</v>

2947
02:18:33.101 --> 02:18:35.440
<v Speaker 5>five hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they form shapes.</v>

2948
02:18:36.130 --> 02:18:37.660
<v Speaker 5>They go into certain positions like </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2949
02:18:37.661 --> 02:18:42.661
<v Speaker 5>one of them climb up a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So some of these are prototypes,</v>

2950
02:18:43.091 --> 02:18:46.630
<v Speaker 5>some of these proof of concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of these are just theories,</v>

2951
02:18:46.631 --> 02:18:49.570
<v Speaker 5>but these eggheads work on this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2952
02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:52.570
<v Speaker 2>So awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the video of the,</v>

2953
02:18:52.571 --> 02:18:57.571
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they downloaded the brain of a </v>

2954
02:18:57.571 --> 02:18:59.971
<v Speaker 2>worm and put it into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little lego robot thing and it's </v>

2955
02:18:59.971 --> 02:19:01.280
<v Speaker 2>just like running around hitting walls </v>
<v Speaker 2>and going up.</v>

2956
02:19:01.310 --> 02:19:03.350
<v Speaker 2>So I thought this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched it,</v>

2957
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:09.150
<v Speaker 2>I watched it twice in the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a woman's brain and I </v>

2958
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.370
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

2959
02:19:09.371 --> 02:19:14.371
<v Speaker 2>did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They download a woman's brain into a </v>

2960
02:19:14.371 --> 02:19:14.371
<v Speaker 2>machine to my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2961
02:19:14.371 --> 02:19:14.371
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

2962
02:19:14.371 --> 02:19:14.371
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2963
02:19:14.371 --> 02:19:18.391
<v Speaker 2>And I like put them like this worm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the whole time I thought this woman </v>

2964
02:19:19.691 --> 02:19:20.430
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just getting here.</v>

2965
02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:27.030
<v Speaker 5>Well she's a worm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She can't think she's a lego or </v>

2966
02:19:27.030 --> 02:19:29.731
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's funny when you think they </v>

2967
02:19:29.731 --> 02:19:29.731
<v Speaker 5>would do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you put your brand a lego,</v>

2968
02:19:29.731 --> 02:19:31.490
<v Speaker 5>definitely probably go in circles and </v>
<v Speaker 5>hit a wall.</v>

2969
02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:36.580
<v Speaker 5>It would just run over to a laptop and </v>
<v Speaker 5>just research fat jew all day just </v>

2970
02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:40.730
<v Speaker 5>hanging out on mfc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch more in that,</v>

2971
02:19:40.731 --> 02:19:43.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that video to one of them is a typer.</v>

2972
02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:48.340
<v Speaker 5>One of them is typing with the top 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>organizing ones.</v>

2973
02:19:48.351 --> 02:19:53.200
<v Speaker 5>One of them is this little thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes over a piece of paper and a,</v>

2974
02:19:53.410 --> 02:19:56.270
<v Speaker 5>like a typewriter would do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but types it.</v>

2975
02:19:56.330 --> 02:20:01.250
<v Speaker 5>So like you put a message in this little</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and then you put this little thing</v>

2976
02:20:01.251 --> 02:20:06.251
<v Speaker 5>on a piece of paper and it will print </v>
<v Speaker 5>out like a typewriter would what your </v>

2977
02:20:06.251 --> 02:20:07.310
<v Speaker 5>message is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is really weird.</v>

2978
02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:10.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see that one at like,</v>

2979
02:20:10.461 --> 02:20:12.530
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's see here.</v>

2980
02:20:13.010 --> 02:20:14.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>check it out jamie.</v>

2981
02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:16.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For labs.</v>

2982
02:20:16.611 --> 02:20:19.210
<v Speaker 5>How hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's the same info,</v>

2983
02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:22.970
<v Speaker 5>but it's like a 2:25</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to 2:25.</v>

2984
02:20:24.410 --> 02:20:26.310
<v Speaker 5>Look at this fucking thing brian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2985
02:20:26.311 --> 02:20:30.680
<v Speaker 5>I think that typing's kind of the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a typewriter is kind of outdated.</v>

2986
02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:32.960
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

2987
02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:38.020
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just floats across a piece of paper </v>

2988
02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:40.550
<v Speaker 5>and writes what you wanted to say was </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking very strange.</v>

2989
02:20:40.551 --> 02:20:42.200
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Zuta labs,</v>

2990
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:44.290
<v Speaker 5>ufa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

2991
02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:49.360
<v Speaker 5>It's really neat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it seems like that's old technology </v>

2992
02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:52.811
<v Speaker 5>that's just not even created yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He ain't know that seems like I had </v>

2993
02:20:52.811 --> 02:20:52.811
<v Speaker 5>already been made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they like it seems.</v>

2994
02:20:52.811 --> 02:20:57.161
<v Speaker 5>What would be more like having paper </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you could just take a flash and </v>

2995
02:20:57.161 --> 02:21:00.941
<v Speaker 5>print it by just doing like a xerox </v>
<v Speaker 5>machine on nights where you're just </v>

2996
02:21:00.941 --> 02:21:02.720
<v Speaker 5>flashing some paper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a negative photo or something,</v>

2997
02:21:02.810 --> 02:21:04.390
<v Speaker 5>but that's 100 percent going to happen.</v>

2998
02:21:04.390 --> 02:21:09.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think also what we were looking at </v>

2999
02:21:09.390 --> 02:21:09.390
<v Speaker 5>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cara santa marina thing,</v>

3000
02:21:09.390 --> 02:21:13.601
<v Speaker 5>the three d,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna be able to do that with </v>

3001
02:21:13.601 --> 02:21:15.641
<v Speaker 5>just going to take a video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something when your cell phone and be </v>

3002
02:21:15.641 --> 02:21:19.001
<v Speaker 5>able to send it to jamie and jamie will </v>
<v Speaker 5>watch like princess leia help will be </v>

3003
02:21:19.001 --> 02:21:19.190
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're my only hope.</v>

3004
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:20.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's going to happen.</v>

3005
02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:26.160
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a matter of us staying alive </v>

3006
02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:26.160
<v Speaker 5>long enough to see things that we'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>never thought could be real.</v>

3007
02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:30.890
<v Speaker 5>It's not that far away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is people that we don't even know.</v>

3008
02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:32.780
<v Speaker 5>You don't even know they're working on </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things.</v>

3009
02:21:32.781 --> 02:21:37.781
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yet they are like that close to </v>

3010
02:21:37.781 --> 02:21:40.991
<v Speaker 5>going public on their fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody has to swipe key cards before </v>

3011
02:21:40.991 --> 02:21:42.290
<v Speaker 5>they go into the building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They check your bag.</v>

3012
02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:44.000
<v Speaker 5>They make sure you don't bring your </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone.</v>

3013
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.870
<v Speaker 5>Your phone has to go into a bucket when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you go into the,</v>

3014
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:48.650
<v Speaker 5>into the laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because this is all propriety.</v>

3015
02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:50.980
<v Speaker 5>Proprietary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're checking their.</v>

3016
02:21:51.130 --> 02:21:54.680
<v Speaker 5>They probably have those fucking fake </v>
<v Speaker 5>buttons that are cameras and shit.</v>

3017
02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:57.380
<v Speaker 5>I guess your glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking glasses.</v>

3018
02:21:57.950 --> 02:22:02.950
<v Speaker 5>Glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they have glasses with little tiny </v>

3019
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.950
<v Speaker 5>cameras and I'm literally like so hard </v>
<v Speaker 5>to see.</v>

3020
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:07.270
<v Speaker 5>If you look at yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he camera look a little that goddamn </v>

3021
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:09.380
<v Speaker 5>lenses like the selfie one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the one on the back is tiny,</v>

3022
02:22:09.381 --> 02:22:10.550
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at my iphone here,</v>

3023
02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:13.730
<v Speaker 5>but the one the front is fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tiny.</v>

3024
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:17.900
<v Speaker 5>It's so little and it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really good.</v>

3025
02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:20.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look how good a selfie camera is.</v>

3026
02:22:20.900 --> 02:22:25.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do a fucking incredible job of </v>

3027
02:22:25.900 --> 02:22:25.950
<v Speaker 5>capturing your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3028
02:22:25.951 --> 02:22:28.320
<v Speaker 5>look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>

3029
02:22:28.490 --> 02:22:31.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a tiny ass little little pinpoint</v>

3030
02:22:31.471 --> 02:22:36.471
<v Speaker 5>camera and it's got everyone in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>room to the point where you could </v>

3031
02:22:36.471 --> 02:22:39.861
<v Speaker 5>broadcast periscope from this thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like a sharpie if you took a </v>

3032
02:22:40.351 --> 02:22:42.240
<v Speaker 5>sharpie and dotted a page with it.</v>

3033
02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:46.170
<v Speaker 5>Just that's how big that camera is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And yet it's crystal clear.</v>

3034
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:49.170
<v Speaker 5>So that could be in your button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That could be in any.</v>

3035
02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:54.220
<v Speaker 5>They're not physically patting you down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could easily have something like </v>

3036
02:22:54.220 --> 02:22:54.220
<v Speaker 5>that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3037
02:22:54.220 --> 02:22:55.680
<v Speaker 5>The one I used in massage parlors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a car.</v>

3038
02:22:55.681 --> 02:22:58.460
<v Speaker 5>A car alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See you're on the air kitchen.</v>

3039
02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:01.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh the fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's a video.</v>

3040
02:23:01.621 --> 02:23:06.390
<v Speaker 5>I filmed a 10 80 film massage parlors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you?</v>

3041
02:23:06.690 --> 02:23:07.920
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

3042
02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:11.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one right now,</v>

3043
02:23:11.970 --> 02:23:12.940
<v Speaker 5>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

3044
02:23:12.941 --> 02:23:17.941
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually just looks like a little key </v>

3045
02:23:17.941 --> 02:23:17.941
<v Speaker 5>chain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if it does,</v>

3046
02:23:17.941 --> 02:23:17.941
<v Speaker 5>it does 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>80 p,</v>

3047
02:23:17.941 --> 02:23:21.861
<v Speaker 5>like you had little memory card,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just put it in your computer and next </v>

3048
02:23:21.861 --> 02:23:21.861
<v Speaker 5>thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like,</v>

3049
02:23:21.861 --> 02:23:22.520
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got full video.</v>

3050
02:23:22.580 --> 02:23:24.270
<v Speaker 5>You just put it on the nightstand next </v>
<v Speaker 5>to it,</v>

3051
02:23:24.271 --> 02:23:28.230
<v Speaker 5>pointed towards the girl hats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anything that's really illegal though.</v>

3052
02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:29.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it.</v>

3053
02:23:29.521 --> 02:23:34.521
<v Speaker 5>That's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you think about what you could do </v>

3054
02:23:34.521 --> 02:23:36.990
<v Speaker 5>that with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Belts would be an easy one,</v>

3055
02:23:37.050 --> 02:23:42.050
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you could actually hide the </v>

3056
02:23:42.050 --> 02:23:43.590
<v Speaker 5>battery and everything in the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could literally hide the whole thing</v>

3057
02:23:43.591 --> 02:23:48.591
<v Speaker 5>and a belt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would have to give you your own </v>

3058
02:23:48.591 --> 02:23:51.171
<v Speaker 5>outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would have to make you come into </v>

3059
02:23:51.171 --> 02:23:51.171
<v Speaker 5>the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to take off all your clothes,</v>

3060
02:23:51.171 --> 02:23:54.890
<v Speaker 5>put them in a locker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then were some scrub suit that they </v>

3061
02:23:54.890 --> 02:23:55.080
<v Speaker 5>provide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You remember that movie?</v>

3062
02:23:55.081 --> 02:23:58.060
<v Speaker 5>A new jack city where they're making </v>
<v Speaker 5>cocaine naked titties.</v>

3063
02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:04.520
<v Speaker 5>That's how they had to do it because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't trust anybody and people </v>

3064
02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:04.880
<v Speaker 5>would leave with the product.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the same thing with these,</v>

3065
02:24:04.940 --> 02:24:08.310
<v Speaker 5>these laboratories that are about to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>live with all this crazy technology.</v>

3066
02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:13.580
<v Speaker 5>They have to take every precaution </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible to make sure that people don't </v>

3067
02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:16.851
<v Speaker 5>go public with their stuff because for </v>
<v Speaker 5>every one of the things about big </v>

3068
02:24:16.851 --> 02:24:21.531
<v Speaker 5>inventions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's the light bulb or the </v>

3069
02:24:21.531 --> 02:24:21.720
<v Speaker 5>telephone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when these things are being worked on,</v>

3070
02:24:21.810 --> 02:24:26.810
<v Speaker 5>there's usually a bunch of other people </v>
<v Speaker 5>working on the exact same thing like </v>

3071
02:24:26.810 --> 02:24:27.000
<v Speaker 5>scientific minds.</v>

3072
02:24:27.330 --> 02:24:30.240
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing about like innovative </v>
<v Speaker 5>minds are brilliant people.</v>

3073
02:24:30.390 --> 02:24:35.390
<v Speaker 5>They don't work in a vacuum for every </v>
<v Speaker 5>nicola tesla who comes up with shit </v>

3074
02:24:35.390 --> 02:24:36.240
<v Speaker 5>completely independent of other people's</v>
<v Speaker 5>thoughts.</v>

3075
02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:40.020
<v Speaker 5>There's most people what their ideas are</v>
<v Speaker 5>based on.</v>

3076
02:24:40.021 --> 02:24:45.021
<v Speaker 5>It's based on the ideas of a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people that are sort of like </v>

3077
02:24:45.021 --> 02:24:48.120
<v Speaker 5>extrapolated to a point that maybe a few</v>
<v Speaker 5>people saw coming.</v>

3078
02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:49.230
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's,</v>

3079
02:24:49.231 --> 02:24:54.231
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea of a telephone or the idea of </v>

3080
02:24:54.231 --> 02:24:54.380
<v Speaker 5>holograms or three d printers are all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these different things.</v>

3081
02:24:54.381 --> 02:24:57.630
<v Speaker 5>It's like people kind of see it common </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're all working on it.</v>

3082
02:24:57.631 --> 02:25:02.631
<v Speaker 5>And then this one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thomas edison motherfucker comes out </v>

3083
02:25:02.631 --> 02:25:02.631
<v Speaker 5>with that light bulb and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3084
02:25:02.631 --> 02:25:03.090
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a genius.</v>

3085
02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:06.750
<v Speaker 5>Thomas edison invented the light bulb </v>
<v Speaker 5>and America was changed.</v>

3086
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:09.690
<v Speaker 5>Where would we be for not the work of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this great man?</v>

3087
02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:15.260
<v Speaker 5>Well there's probably about five other </v>
<v Speaker 5>dudes who were working on exactly the </v>

3088
02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:18.321
<v Speaker 5>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's sort of what always happens with </v>

3089
02:25:18.321 --> 02:25:18.930
<v Speaker 5>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a lot of it becomes a rush to getting</v>

3090
02:25:18.931 --> 02:25:23.931
<v Speaker 5>the funding and getting the patents and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then figuring out how to get it </v>

3091
02:25:23.931 --> 02:25:24.310
<v Speaker 5>produced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's usually</v>

3092
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:26.680
<v Speaker 1>probably a bunch of people working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar shit.</v>

3093
02:25:27.370 --> 02:25:31.180
<v Speaker 1>So like right now when you see this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like these little micro robots,</v>

3094
02:25:31.181 --> 02:25:36.181
<v Speaker 1>when you see those big crazy boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic robots and you see artificial </v>

3095
02:25:36.181 --> 02:25:40.030
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and this is all stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going public with their probably</v>

3096
02:25:40.031 --> 02:25:43.950
<v Speaker 1>so close and so many different labs </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing something that's really gonna</v>

3097
02:25:43.970 --> 02:25:46.630
<v Speaker 1>make you shit your pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3098
02:25:46.750 --> 02:25:51.750
<v Speaker 8>I got one I thought today.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Would you say some researchers have got </v>

3099
02:25:52.961 --> 02:25:57.961
<v Speaker 8>a pig heart to work inside of a primate </v>
<v Speaker 8>for 945 days and it's something they </v>

3100
02:25:58.751 --> 02:26:00.400
<v Speaker 8>didn't think was actually possible </v>
<v Speaker 8>before.</v>

3101
02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:06.520
<v Speaker 8>They've got a kidney working for 136 </v>
<v Speaker 8>days and it says that they're probably </v>

3102
02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:11.400
<v Speaker 8>geo engineering some of these pigs to be</v>
<v Speaker 8>better to suit human organ transplants.</v>

3103
02:26:12.170 --> 02:26:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3104
02:26:13.581 --> 02:26:15.450
<v Speaker 1>here's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3105
02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gordon,</v>

3106
02:26:16.460 --> 02:26:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Mark Gordon told me about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3107
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:23.830
<v Speaker 1>I was telling him about the success that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had with getting stem cell shot in my </v>

3108
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:25.640
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of creeping me out,</v>

3109
02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:29.300
<v Speaker 1>like my shoulders still makes kinda some</v>
<v Speaker 1>clicks.</v>

3110
02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:32.150
<v Speaker 1>It does some weird clicking stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3111
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:33.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda,</v>

3112
02:26:33.531 --> 02:26:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I kinda feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't say there's any pain.</v>

3113
02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:39.290
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm practicing archery everyday,</v>

3114
02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:41.900
<v Speaker 1>so I'm shooting arrows with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on pulling back.</v>

3115
02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:47.320
<v Speaker 1>This new bowl I have is only 70 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pulling back 70 pounds 100 times</v>

3116
02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:52.840
<v Speaker 1>a day every day and it's not hurting </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the next day it feels like a </v>

3117
02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:54.050
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something's going on with it,</v>

3118
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:59.230
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas it would definitely be hurting </v>

3119
02:26:59.230 --> 02:27:01.331
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the stem cells and like lifting </v>

3120
02:27:01.331 --> 02:27:02.900
<v Speaker 1>weights doesn't bother it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like chin ups,</v>

3121
02:27:02.901 --> 02:27:05.090
<v Speaker 1>don't bother it rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't bother it.</v>

3122
02:27:05.090 --> 02:27:07.850
<v Speaker 1>All these pushups don't bother it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these different things that bothered</v>

3123
02:27:07.851 --> 02:27:09.920
<v Speaker 1>it used to bother and it's only been </v>
<v Speaker 1>four weeks,</v>

3124
02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:12.110
<v Speaker 1>which freaking me out is how quick it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

3125
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I talked to daniel cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's ufc light,</v>

3126
02:27:14.751 --> 02:27:19.751
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same shit with the asterisks next to </v>

3127
02:27:19.751 --> 02:27:20.450
<v Speaker 1>champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm the same shit.</v>

3128
02:27:20.540 --> 02:27:23.810
<v Speaker 1>He had an mcl tear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got some stem cell shot in there.</v>

3129
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more swelling.</v>

3130
02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Feels great and they don't even know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

3131
02:27:27.980 --> 02:27:32.980
<v Speaker 1>They have ideas of how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really sure how it's </v>

3132
02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:35.471
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are nonspecific cells and these </v>

3133
02:27:35.471 --> 02:27:38.621
<v Speaker 1>cells go to the injured area and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another know what's injured </v>

3134
02:27:38.621 --> 02:27:42.850
<v Speaker 1>through the immune system or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The utilization of these stem cells </v>

3135
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:46.910
<v Speaker 1>causes injuries to heal way quicker than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ever did before.</v>

3136
02:27:47.350 --> 02:27:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gordon was telling me about this guy </v>

3137
02:27:52.350 --> 02:27:52.350
<v Speaker 1>have gotten a car accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets his chest crushed,</v>

3138
02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:53.540
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the steering wheel,</v>

3139
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:56.390
<v Speaker 1>down to 30 percent heart capacity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucked.</v>

3140
02:27:56.420 --> 02:27:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Can't have sex anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can barely walk.</v>

3141
02:27:59.150 --> 02:28:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just severely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>severely diminished.</v>

3142
02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Get some stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot into his heart,</v>

3143
02:28:03.530 --> 02:28:04.910
<v Speaker 1>bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to 100 percent,</v>

3144
02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:08.090
<v Speaker 1>just a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

3145
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:13.630
<v Speaker 1>A few months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few months and it's fucking hard to </v>

3146
02:28:13.630 --> 02:28:14.900
<v Speaker 1>work 100 percent now and this is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently this is going on all over the</v>

3147
02:28:14.901 --> 02:28:16.670
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just going,</v>

3148
02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:17.080
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3149
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.900
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3150
02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

3151
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:22.640
<v Speaker 1>but that's really happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's experiments</v>

3152
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:25.730
<v Speaker 3>because they don't exactly know why this</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit works.</v>

3153
02:28:25.940 --> 02:28:28.280
<v Speaker 3>They have some theories and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying it out,</v>

3154
02:28:28.281 --> 02:28:30.200
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people are real cautious </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

3155
02:28:31.250 --> 02:28:36.250
<v Speaker 3>but they're having some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible results with stem cells to </v>

3156
02:28:36.250 --> 02:28:40.661
<v Speaker 3>the point where it makes you wonder like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they going to have in five </v>

3157
02:28:40.661 --> 02:28:44.351
<v Speaker 3>years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they didn't even have this 10 </v>

3158
02:28:44.351 --> 02:28:44.351
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago.</v>

3159
02:28:44.351 --> 02:28:47.981
<v Speaker 3>Someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you told someone you got stem cells </v>

3160
02:28:47.981 --> 02:28:47.981
<v Speaker 3>shot and injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be like,</v>

3161
02:28:47.981 --> 02:28:51.281
<v Speaker 3>what are you from the future?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I wonder if there's also because </v>

3162
02:28:51.281 --> 02:28:52.220
<v Speaker 3>you're adding something new to the body </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of foreign.</v>

3163
02:28:52.221 --> 02:28:54.660
<v Speaker 3>If that passes on through dna or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3164
02:28:55.020 --> 02:29:00.020
<v Speaker 3>like in the future with a clever </v>
<v Speaker 3>question like you have like a baby that </v>

3165
02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:03.551
<v Speaker 3>has an external face or something to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>or only works like that,</v>

3166
02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:09.010
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's their cells that are natural to </v>

3167
02:29:09.010 --> 02:29:09.010
<v Speaker 3>your body.</v>

3168
02:29:09.380 --> 02:29:11.600
<v Speaker 3>They can do It that way or they can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it with placenta.</v>

3169
02:29:11.601 --> 02:29:12.780
<v Speaker 3>That's how I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mine.</v>

3170
02:29:12.781 --> 02:29:17.781
<v Speaker 3>Mine was from human placenta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from chicks of vets and sarah and </v>

3171
02:29:17.781 --> 02:29:19.310
<v Speaker 3>sections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take their placenta in.</v>

3172
02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Did you get to choose the girl?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3173
02:29:21.770 --> 02:29:24.350
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they would let you creep,</v>

3174
02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:26.840
<v Speaker 3>but they also can take it out of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>

3175
02:29:27.650 --> 02:29:28.960
<v Speaker 3>You can have some of my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3176
02:29:29.050 --> 02:29:30.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't want your fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My fat.</v>

3177
02:29:30.890 --> 02:29:34.280
<v Speaker 3>The idea is you use your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you get lipo?</v>

3178

<v Speaker 3>you were like fucking determined to look</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

3205
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:55.750
<v Speaker 3>You decided this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of being fat and waddling </v>

3206
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.750
<v Speaker 3>around everywhere I was 10 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3207
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

3208
02:30:56.270 --> 02:30:57.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

3209
02:30:57.061 --> 02:30:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you feel like it's harder now because</v>

3210
02:30:58.941 --> 02:31:03.941
<v Speaker 3>you're 41,</v>
<v Speaker 3>31 that changed like maybe five years </v>

3211
02:31:03.941 --> 02:31:04.700
<v Speaker 3>ago where I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>

3212
02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Like the energy was already low to begin</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

3213
02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Now I wake up tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's where I have a sleep nap,</v>

3214
02:31:13.140 --> 02:31:16.180
<v Speaker 3>sleep apnea because I really do wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go like,</v>

3215
02:31:16.210 --> 02:31:21.210
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just need to stay awake enough to go </v>

3216
02:31:21.210 --> 02:31:21.210
<v Speaker 3>to starbucks and then starbucks</v>

3217
02:31:21.210 --> 02:31:22.710
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem like it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with finding out if you have</v>

3218
02:31:22.711 --> 02:31:25.380
<v Speaker 1>sleep apnea and you got to go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those sleep studies and those are</v>

3219
02:31:25.381 --> 02:31:26.020
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3220
02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:28.740
<v Speaker 1>I just saW that picture of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have all those electrodes stuck to my</v>

3221
02:31:28.741 --> 02:31:30.570
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had it on my blog somewhere.</v>

3222
02:31:31.500 --> 02:31:33.520
<v Speaker 1>It's probably still up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a.</v>

3223
02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I had these electrodes stuck all over my</v>
<v Speaker 1>head and like,</v>

3224
02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:40.700
<v Speaker 1>like around my eyes and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

3225
02:31:40.701 --> 02:31:45.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to sleep and this fucking weird </v>

3226
02:31:45.701 --> 02:31:45.701
<v Speaker 1>bed and some weird room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the hardest time sleeping,</v>

3227
02:31:45.701 --> 02:31:50.270
<v Speaker 1>but once I did I was choking like </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly they can tell like when your,</v>

3228
02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:51.480
<v Speaker 1>when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is,</v>

3229
02:31:51.570 --> 02:31:55.620
<v Speaker 1>there's me covered up with a c.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the home version of that.</v>

3230
02:31:55.621 --> 02:32:00.621
<v Speaker 1>I just put a drop cam next to my bed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had it tell me anytime it hears noises</v>

3231
02:32:01.400 --> 02:32:05.190
<v Speaker 1>a or movement and then it would record </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in the clouds.</v>

3232
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Then I can just go back and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3233
02:32:06.481 --> 02:32:10.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a noise here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's me snoring or that's me moving.</v>

3234
02:32:10.350 --> 02:32:15.350
<v Speaker 1>And I noticed that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been doing it for like a </v>

3235
02:32:15.350 --> 02:32:15.350
<v Speaker 1>couple months that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3236
02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:20.540
<v Speaker 1>that it's mostly I'll snore on nights </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I heavily drink or something like </v>

3237
02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:21.600
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's always at,</v>

3238
02:32:21.690 --> 02:32:23.640
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of my sleep and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3239
02:32:23.730 --> 02:32:28.730
<v Speaker 1>it's only for like a half hour or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not the whole night going like </v>

3240
02:32:28.730 --> 02:32:32.271
<v Speaker 1>that or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But well heavily when you're drunk and </v>

3241
02:32:32.271 --> 02:32:32.700
<v Speaker 1>really exhausted when I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausted,</v>

3242
02:32:32.701 --> 02:32:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I snore horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the worst,</v>

3243
02:32:36.390 --> 02:32:38.400
<v Speaker 1>like a one of these hunting trips that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went on,</v>

3244
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:41.550
<v Speaker 1>me and steven rinella had a hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This pig down the sun.</v>

3245
02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Well I shot this pig and it rolled down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the side of a hill and it was really far</v>

3246
02:32:46.831 --> 02:32:50.040
<v Speaker 1>down the hill and the hill was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously steep like this.</v>

3247
02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean like you couldn't walk up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had to crawl up the hill.</v>

3248
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:55.290
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could crawl up it,</v>

3249
02:32:55.650 --> 02:32:57.270
<v Speaker 1>but you literally couldn't stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>

3250
02:32:57.560 --> 02:33:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just that steep and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big pig.</v>

3251
02:33:00.391 --> 02:33:04.470
<v Speaker 1>It was like 200 plus pound pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the pig goes rolling down the side of</v>

3252
02:33:04.471 --> 02:33:07.710
<v Speaker 1>this hill and we had to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get it up the hill so we attach it to</v>

3253
02:33:07.711 --> 02:33:10.470
<v Speaker 1>these cables and we had this truck pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3254
02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:14.910
<v Speaker 1>but the cables were rubbing on the rocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the hill and they kept snapping.</v>

3255
02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:20.180
<v Speaker 1>The cable snapped twice and the pig came</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling back down and then we had to </v>

3256
02:33:20.180 --> 02:33:23.571
<v Speaker 1>stop the pig from rolling down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the guide from the home ranch </v>

3257
02:33:24.211 --> 02:33:24.690
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3258
02:33:24.691 --> 02:33:27.920
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna roll the pig downhill,</v>

3259
02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:33.240
<v Speaker 1>going to roll the pig downhill and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you just roll it downhill </v>

3260
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:38.750
<v Speaker 1>you'll get down to the road at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and I'll just drIve around and </v>

3261
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:38.750
<v Speaker 1>pick you up the road.</v>

3262
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:43.520
<v Speaker 1>So we figured okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably won't be that far and he </v>

3263
02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:44.510
<v Speaker 1>totally misjudged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>

3264
02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:49.940
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot this pig with like five minutes </v>

3265
02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:51.750
<v Speaker 1>left of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like if it gets dark at 6:00,</v>

3266
02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I shot the picket 5:55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all this stuff we're doing at in dark</v>

3267
02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:00.270
<v Speaker 1>and this is a place that to hone ranch </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a,</v>

3268
02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:03.570
<v Speaker 1>they have a trail camera that picks up </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

3269
02:34:03.571 --> 02:34:05.850
<v Speaker 1>takes photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have this waterhole,</v>

3270
02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:11.180
<v Speaker 1>they got pictures of 16 different </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions in this one waterhole and</v>

3271
02:34:12.421 --> 02:34:16.230
<v Speaker 1>it's just me and rinella with one gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even,</v>

3272
02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:17.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he even had a gun with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3273
02:34:17.621 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it</v>

3274
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:19.840
<v Speaker 5>was just me and him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One gun,</v>

3275
02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:25.260
<v Speaker 5>16 mountain lions and a dead pig.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we're rolling it down this hill.</v>

3276
02:34:25.450 --> 02:34:30.450
<v Speaker 5>But you can only go so far because we </v>
<v Speaker 5>got to this point where it's just like </v>

3277
02:34:30.450 --> 02:34:32.710
<v Speaker 5>so heavily wooded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had to cut up the pig and then we had</v>

3278
02:34:32.711 --> 02:34:35.070
<v Speaker 5>to carry it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we have to,</v>

3279
02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:38.980
<v Speaker 5>we had to gut this pig would take out </v>
<v Speaker 5>the heart because you eat the heart.</v>

3280
02:34:39.340 --> 02:34:42.130
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got rid of the rest of the organs and</v>

3281
02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:47.160
<v Speaker 5>he put one half on his shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put one half on my shoulder and then </v>

3282
02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:48.130
<v Speaker 5>we had to carry this thing the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way.</v>

3283
02:34:48.131 --> 02:34:51.010
<v Speaker 5>So we're carrying it for miles through </v>
<v Speaker 5>the woods.</v>

3284
02:34:51.220 --> 02:34:53.680
<v Speaker 5>And the woods alert gets super steep </v>
<v Speaker 5>hills.</v>

3285
02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:58.920
<v Speaker 5>He gets to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're trying to climb over logs mean </v>

3286
02:34:58.920 --> 02:34:58.960
<v Speaker 5>it's fucked and it takes hours.</v>

3287
02:34:59.230 --> 02:35:01.930
<v Speaker 5>So from 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>PM to midnight,</v>

3288
02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:04.270
<v Speaker 5>this is what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just carried this.</v>

3289
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:09.280
<v Speaker 5>You each had 100 pounds on her back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>climbing over woods and trying to figure</v>

3290
02:35:09.281 --> 02:35:12.010
<v Speaker 5>out how to get to the fucking where this</v>
<v Speaker 5>truck is.</v>

3291
02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:17.340
<v Speaker 5>We finally get to where this truck as we</v>
<v Speaker 5>got back to the cabin and just conked </v>

3292
02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:21.541
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And apparently I snored so bad that </v>

3293
02:35:21.541 --> 02:35:21.541
<v Speaker 5>everybody else in the building didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleep.</v>

3294
02:35:21.541 --> 02:35:23.830
<v Speaker 5>I went out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got shot with a tranquilizer dart.</v>

3295
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:26.500
<v Speaker 5>Even I even had a mouthpiece and I had a</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty one at the time.</v>

3296
02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:29.470
<v Speaker 5>So you have a better one now you have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever tried this new strips,</v>

3297
02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:33.160
<v Speaker 5>those work or that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not gonna help that I had already</v>

3298
02:35:33.161 --> 02:35:34.990
<v Speaker 5>had my nose fixed by then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't that.</v>

3299
02:35:34.991 --> 02:35:36.370
<v Speaker 5>It's just my.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you,</v>

3300
02:35:36.371 --> 02:35:38.980
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a big issue with a weight lifters.</v>

3301
02:35:39.610 --> 02:35:42.460
<v Speaker 5>Your neck gets big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your hole gets smaller,</v>

3302
02:35:42.630 --> 02:35:45.940
<v Speaker 5>like the air hole actually gets smaller </v>
<v Speaker 5>and have a big ton.</v>

3303
02:35:46.260 --> 02:35:48.390
<v Speaker 5>And so my tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean to brag,</v>

3304
02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:53.090
<v Speaker 5>so you've got a tight thrill and a nice </v>
<v Speaker 5>fat tongue.</v>

3305
02:35:54.310 --> 02:35:57.370
<v Speaker 5>And my fat tongue would fall if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>lying on my back,</v>

3306
02:35:57.371 --> 02:36:02.230
<v Speaker 5>especially falls over the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the air hole and it just chokes.</v>

3307
02:36:02.470 --> 02:36:07.470
<v Speaker 5>And so apparently that's what it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>

3308
02:36:07.930 --> 02:36:10.060
<v Speaker 5>I never listened to my snore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've heard you start before.</v>

3309
02:36:10.090 --> 02:36:10.990
<v Speaker 5>It's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3310
02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:13.180
<v Speaker 5>I remember you snored only.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We went to Japan,</v>

3311
02:36:15.870 --> 02:36:17.140
<v Speaker 5>my mouthpiece,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when I went to sleep,</v>

3312
02:36:17.141 --> 02:36:19.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just remember on the plane.</v>

3313
02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:19.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3314
02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:20.930
<v Speaker 5>That'll happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3315
02:36:21.290 --> 02:36:23.710
<v Speaker 5>They killed a mountain lion on the five </v>
<v Speaker 5>freeway the other day.</v>

3316
02:36:23.810 --> 02:36:28.810
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kill them all from the santa monica </v>

3317
02:36:28.810 --> 02:36:28.810
<v Speaker 5>mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cons.</v>

3318
02:36:28.810 --> 02:36:29.860
<v Speaker 5>People are too happy about those things </v>
<v Speaker 5>being around.</v>

3319
02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:32.740
<v Speaker 5>They're cute though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's cool looking.</v>

3320
02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:38.040
<v Speaker 5>They just shouldn't be around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People believe you shouldn't be around </v>

3321
02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:38.040
<v Speaker 5>with your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shut up.</v>

3322
02:36:38.470 --> 02:36:40.560
<v Speaker 5>I hate that fucking line of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3323
02:36:40.590 --> 02:36:43.630
<v Speaker 5>that isn't annoying line of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're dangerous.</v>

3324
02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:48.660
<v Speaker 5>Mountain lions will fuck you up if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>never seen a picture of someone who got </v>

3325
02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:52.141
<v Speaker 5>bit by a mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was some poor lady who was on one </v>

3326
02:36:52.141 --> 02:36:54.520
<v Speaker 5>of the new shows and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was so graphic.</v>

3327
02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:56.800
<v Speaker 5>She'd been attacked by a mountain lion </v>
<v Speaker 5>on a bike,</v>

3328
02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:00.370
<v Speaker 5>pulled her off of her bike.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone else tried to beat the thing off</v>

3329
02:37:00.371 --> 02:37:03.850
<v Speaker 5>of her and it just had a hold of her </v>
<v Speaker 5>head and just tore face apart.</v>

3330
02:37:04.210 --> 02:37:04.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>

3331
02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:09.400
<v Speaker 5>it was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a video on huff post of a,</v>

3332
02:37:09.610 --> 02:37:14.610
<v Speaker 5>a woman's beautiful lullaby to her sick </v>
<v Speaker 5>pig and I don't know if you saw it or </v>

<v Speaker 5>Pigs are really smart man.</v>

3341
02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:36.180
<v Speaker 5>They're smart and they kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like vermin in Texas,</v>

3342
02:37:37.550 --> 02:37:40.060
<v Speaker 5>in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They shoot them out of airplanes there.</v>

3343
02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:42.420
<v Speaker 5>They're constantly fucking shoot no </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter airplanes.</v>

3349
02:37:59.511 --> 02:38:02.230
<v Speaker 3>And I guess that one of the things is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that uh,</v>

3350
02:38:02.780 --> 02:38:07.780
<v Speaker 3>there's so many loud noises at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital that it gets scared and she </v>

<v Speaker 3>comes there when she can and sings to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3362
02:38:49.890 --> 02:38:52.160
<v Speaker 5>stopped up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like a joke.</v>

3363
02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:57.490
<v Speaker 5>Let's see if you listen to the song </v>
<v Speaker 5>sound of tractor trailers falling off </v>

3364
02:38:57.711 --> 02:38:58.730
<v Speaker 5>cliffs in the background.</v>

3365
02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:01.080
<v Speaker 3>It's an old irish lullaby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's singing,</v>

3366
02:39:01.110 --> 02:39:03.390
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a nine month old.</v>

3367
02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:05.040
<v Speaker 3>A 14 pound piglet.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There was a picture of this fucking </v>

3372
02:39:17.670 --> 02:39:17.740
<v Speaker 5>vulture that someone posted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a meme,</v>

3373
02:39:17.890 --> 02:39:20.890
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it wasn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So fat jewish didn't use it,</v>

3374
02:39:20.891 --> 02:39:25.891
<v Speaker 5>but it was a meme of a vulture hovering </v>
<v Speaker 5>over a black baby in africa waiting for </v>

3375
02:39:26.171 --> 02:39:28.240
<v Speaker 5>this kid to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3376
02:39:28.241 --> 02:39:31.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was about how many people cared about</v>

3377
02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:33.760
<v Speaker 5>this lion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how few people care about the amount</v>

3378
02:39:33.761 --> 02:39:37.330
<v Speaker 5>of people that starve to death every </v>
<v Speaker 5>year in africa.</v>

3379
02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:43.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Justin wren is going to be on the </v>

02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:48.840
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's back on the podcast I think in a </v>

3382
02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:50.470
<v Speaker 5>week or so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta I gotta go check the calendar,</v>

3383
02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:54.170
<v Speaker 5>but he's back soon to talk about his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3384
02:39:54.220 --> 02:39:59.220
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the 20 Fourth a week from today </v>

3385
02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:01.180
<v Speaker 5>to talk about black widow babies </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting for bella tour.</v>

3386
02:40:01.180 --> 02:40:02.710
<v Speaker 5>And one of the reasons why he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

3387
02:40:02.711 --> 02:40:04.720
<v Speaker 5>to try to raise awareness for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pygmies.</v>

3388
02:40:05.110 --> 02:40:07.120
<v Speaker 5>He's such an amazing dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3389
02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:09.380
<v Speaker 5>he's a real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I always look for likE,</v>

3390
02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:14.640
<v Speaker 5>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always think like maybe somewhere </v>

3391
02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:16.801
<v Speaker 5>along the line he'll reveal and it turns</v>
<v Speaker 5>out that he was really just doing this </v>

3392
02:40:16.801 --> 02:40:18.510
<v Speaker 5>for his own profit than these.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's not,</v>

3393
02:40:19.170 --> 02:40:21.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that about him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you think that about someone usually</v>

3394
02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:26.370
<v Speaker 5>when they have some big car.</v>

3399
02:40:45.771 --> 02:40:46.230
<v Speaker 5>person kony was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then something happened to homeboy,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you can't,</v>

3403
02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:01.410
<v Speaker 5>you have to be a perfect person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't have a great cause.</v>

3404
02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:05.220
<v Speaker 5>And also be a nut because then people </v>
<v Speaker 5>just immediately dismiss your cars.</v>

3405
02:41:05.430 --> 02:41:10.430
<v Speaker 5>we never heard a peep out of joseph kony</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever since it was 2012 areas.</v>

3406
02:41:11.670 --> 02:41:15.540
<v Speaker 5>he's totally naked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crank this up so we could hear this guy.</v>

3407
02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:25.570
<v Speaker 11>He's running around naked and he's </v>
<v Speaker 11>clapping.</v>

3408
02:41:26.050 --> 02:41:29.000
<v Speaker 11>WhaT do you think it was on that?</v>

3409
02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:31.520
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

3410
02:41:31.570 --> 02:41:34.930
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's gay or then the day is long.</v>

3411
02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:37.870
<v Speaker 5>There's no way you could even pretend to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be that gay.</v>

3412
02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:39.390
<v Speaker 5>Like faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3413
02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:43.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems like alcohol and molly maybe.</v>

3414
02:41:44.010 --> 02:41:47.170
<v Speaker 5>I think that's like some serious drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's like a meth move.</v>

3415
02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:47.860
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3416
02:41:47.861 --> 02:41:52.861
<v Speaker 5>That's like a mifi sort of behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 5>running around slapping concrete and </v>

3417
02:41:52.861 --> 02:41:53.000
<v Speaker 5>angry at everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all methy.</v>

3418
02:41:53.060 --> 02:41:53.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>matthew,</v>

3419
02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:55.270
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3420
02:41:55.570 --> 02:41:59.950
<v Speaker 5>it seems method.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's more popular than I ever thought it</v>

3421
02:41:59.951 --> 02:42:04.951
<v Speaker 5>would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was it seen as I learned more about </v>

3422
02:42:04.951 --> 02:42:06.460
<v Speaker 5>people doing meth and heroin in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>city than I've ever.</v>

3423
02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:10.030
<v Speaker 5>Five was actually real life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Math is super popular.</v>

3424
02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:14.020
<v Speaker 5>Math is real popular and an adderalls </v>
<v Speaker 5>real popular too.</v>

3425
02:42:14.410 --> 02:42:17.620
<v Speaker 5>And do you talk to doctors and they say </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's not that much difference?</v>

3426
02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:23.320
<v Speaker 5>Depends on how much you're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but math in we associate meth with </v>

3427
02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:25.810
<v Speaker 5>addiction and we associate math with </v>
<v Speaker 5>addiction.</v>

3428
02:42:25.810 --> 02:42:27.700
<v Speaker 5>That shitty behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're going to take math,</v>

3429
02:42:27.910 --> 02:42:30.130
<v Speaker 5>you're definitely going to go out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>get whacked out and do a bunch of stupid</v>

3430
02:42:30.131 --> 02:42:32.650
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not necessarily the case.</v>

3431
02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:37.680
<v Speaker 5>Some people do maTh and they're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it cranked up and then the next </v>

3432
02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:38.710
<v Speaker 5>day they feel like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they don't do it every day.</v>

3433
02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:42.940
<v Speaker 5>Whereas we only think of math by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that quote unquote abused math.</v>

3434
02:42:43.330 --> 02:42:47.470
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if meth became something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>alcohol where you could just go buy it.</v>

3435
02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:52.680
<v Speaker 5>Like if you run into someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you're at a park and you run </v>

3436
02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:52.680
<v Speaker 5>into some dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's hammered like,</v>

3437
02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:54.520
<v Speaker 5>oh great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a fucking drunk as annoying.</v>

3438
02:42:55.450 --> 02:42:57.670
<v Speaker 5>Why is that any different than running </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who's left out?</v>

3439
02:42:57.940 --> 02:43:01.270
<v Speaker 5>Like there's people that can drink like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you jamie,</v>

3440
02:43:01.271 --> 02:43:06.271
<v Speaker 5>you can drink and you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen you a little silly but you </v>

3441
02:43:06.271 --> 02:43:07.010
<v Speaker 5>don't get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we all know someone any.</v>

3442
02:43:07.100 --> 02:43:09.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every group of people knows at least one</v>

3443
02:43:09.551 --> 02:43:11.960
<v Speaker 5>person that can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They turned this</v>

3444
02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:14.320
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoEver it is,</v>

3445
02:43:14.470 --> 02:43:19.470
<v Speaker 1>they go off the rails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get crazy and if you ran into that </v>

3446
02:43:19.470 --> 02:43:22.240
<v Speaker 1>person in a park and they'll man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck these bitches,</v>

3447
02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:23.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running around drunk,</v>

3448
02:43:23.561 --> 02:43:24.580
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh great.</v>

3449
02:43:24.610 --> 02:43:27.490
<v Speaker 1>A drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the same thing with math.</v>

3450
02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you do math and you'd be like all </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking speedy and you clean your house </v>

3451
02:43:32.760 --> 02:43:33.550
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd be the same guy.</v>

3452
02:43:33.551 --> 02:43:34.830
<v Speaker 1>The next day you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

3453
02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I did some good math last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a little fucked up.</v>

3454
02:43:37.270 --> 02:43:39.100
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we associate,</v>

3455
02:43:39.101 --> 02:43:42.580
<v Speaker 1>like if you do math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're off the rails out of your fucking</v>

3456
02:43:42.581 --> 02:43:44.070
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done like jesus,</v>

3457
02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:46.480
<v Speaker 1>brian's doing meth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

3458
02:43:46.570 --> 02:43:51.340
<v Speaker 1>But what if alcohol was illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But meth was legal and you know,</v>

3459
02:43:51.341 --> 02:43:53.590
<v Speaker 1>you know what brian didn't last line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got drunk,</v>

3460
02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:56.560
<v Speaker 1>no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was drinking alcohol.</v>

3461
02:43:56.710 --> 02:43:57.580
<v Speaker 1>What an idiot.</v>

3462
02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:00.280
<v Speaker 1>And you're out there drinking booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting fucked up,</v>

3463
02:44:00.281 --> 02:44:05.281
<v Speaker 1>which is totally norMal to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's only normal because it's a </v>

3464
02:44:05.281 --> 02:44:08.491
<v Speaker 1>society sanctioned drug would have math </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just as good or bad for you or just </v>

3465
02:44:09.071 --> 02:44:13.030
<v Speaker 1>as just as problematic as alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not sanctioned.</v>

3466
02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:18.180
<v Speaker 1>So we don't think about that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only associated with those people </v>

3467
02:44:18.180 --> 02:44:19.360
<v Speaker 1>fucking claw their face off and lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>their teeth and shit.</v>

3468
02:44:20.110 --> 02:44:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Is that what people were referring to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A speed and like the eighties.</v>

3469
02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that something else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3470
02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:25.300
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means.</v>

3471
02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Different types and schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different classifications of </v>

3472
02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:33.721
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like that was a big thing in </v>

3473
02:44:33.721 --> 02:44:35.130
<v Speaker 1>professional pool was guys would uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play on amphetamines.</v>

3474
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:37.300
<v Speaker 1>They'd play for 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>48 hours.</v>

3475
02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:40.870
<v Speaker 1>They would play until the other guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped and they would,</v>

3476
02:44:40.871 --> 02:44:42.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would gamble the entire time.</v>

3477
02:44:42.371 --> 02:44:45.430
<v Speaker 1>And apparently when you're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>aMphetamines you can see things better.</v>

3478
02:44:45.610 --> 02:44:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you see like the path of the balls </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

3479
02:44:48.490 --> 02:44:50.320
<v Speaker 1>You see like where the ball's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

3480
02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Like someone described it to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to do meth and he said,</v>

3481
02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:56.560
<v Speaker 1>when you play pool on meth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3482
02:44:56.561 --> 02:44:59.020
<v Speaker 1>you look at a ball and the ball looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>circular.</v>

3483
02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:03.910
<v Speaker 1>When I would play on meth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said I would see flat surfaces.</v>

3484
02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:09.180
<v Speaker 1>So it seemed like a series of flat </v>
<v Speaker 1>surfaces around the ball and I wouldn't </v>

3485
02:45:09.180 --> 02:45:12.430
<v Speaker 1>know exactly what flat surface to hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ball collisions,</v>

3486
02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:17.640
<v Speaker 1>like when you play pool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a ball and trying to cut </v>

3487
02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:18.430
<v Speaker 1>a ball on the side pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just kind of estimating where the</v>

3488
02:45:18.431 --> 02:45:20.200
<v Speaker 1>ball's going to collide with the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>

3489
02:45:20.201 --> 02:45:24.880
<v Speaker 1>And that collIsion point you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume there's going to be like a little</v>

3490
02:45:24.881 --> 02:45:29.881
<v Speaker 1>bit of friction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna move the ball off the line a </v>

3491
02:45:29.881 --> 02:45:29.881
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're cutting a ball.</v>

3492
02:45:29.881 --> 02:45:31.480
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to kind of compensate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3493
02:45:31.630 --> 02:45:35.500
<v Speaker 1>And you add a little spin to it to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to compensate for the deflection.</v>

3494
02:45:35.620 --> 02:45:38.440
<v Speaker 1>So there's all these variables that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to kinda like play on feel.</v>

3495
02:45:38.650 --> 02:45:41.440
<v Speaker 1>He said it wasn't on feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said when he was on meth he would see</v>

3496
02:45:41.441 --> 02:45:46.441
<v Speaker 1>like flat surfaces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we knew at this flat surface had to </v>

3497
02:45:46.441 --> 02:45:49.490
<v Speaker 1>collide with that flat surface and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would make like a direct tangent line </v>

3498
02:45:49.490 --> 02:45:50.140
<v Speaker 1>that would go into the pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3499
02:45:50.141 --> 02:45:51.370
<v Speaker 1>how come you can't see that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sober?</v>

3500
02:45:51.371 --> 02:45:56.371
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even describe to you what it's </v>

3501
02:45:56.371 --> 02:45:56.371
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3502
02:45:56.371 --> 02:45:56.371
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm fucked up on meth,</v>

3503
02:45:56.371 --> 02:46:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I would see like flat surfaces instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a curve was probably a way to mimic </v>

3504
02:46:01.020 --> 02:46:03.370
<v Speaker 1>that using some kind of eyewear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3505
02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

3506
02:46:04.510 --> 02:46:07.480
<v Speaker 1>But maybe not because I think what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen as a hallucination,</v>

3507
02:46:07.870 --> 02:46:09.020
<v Speaker 1>what he's seen and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3508
02:46:10.370 --> 02:46:14.780
<v Speaker 5>you get confident in their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been big in baseball for ever.</v>

3509
02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:15.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forever.</v>

3510
02:46:15.951 --> 02:46:17.180
<v Speaker 5>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>make sense?</v>

3511
02:46:17.181 --> 02:46:22.181
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you would be able to see the ball </v>

3512
02:46:22.181 --> 02:46:22.400
<v Speaker 5>coming at you quicker and you maybe will</v>
<v Speaker 5>see the edges of the ball better.</v>

3513
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:24.860
<v Speaker 5>Somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody did say that,</v>

3514
02:46:25.060 --> 02:46:26.810
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they were on meth,</v>

3515
02:46:27.260 --> 02:46:29.780
<v Speaker 5>like someone was talking about adderall </v>
<v Speaker 5>not on meth,</v>

3516
02:46:29.781 --> 02:46:34.781
<v Speaker 5>but adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they could see the stitches of the </v>

3517
02:46:34.781 --> 02:46:36.580
<v Speaker 5>ball as it's coming towards them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

3518
02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:42.620
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff was invented to make </v>

3519
02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:42.620
<v Speaker 5>people better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's weird.</v>

3520
02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:43.340
<v Speaker 5>All,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these things that,</v>

3521
02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:48.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like math and infect means they're all </v>

3522
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:49.460
<v Speaker 5>designed to give you more energy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>make you better at certain tasks.</v>

3523
02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:52.550
<v Speaker 5>But we just associated with abuse </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're illegal.</v>

3524
02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:54.950
<v Speaker 5>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

3525
02:46:55.100 --> 02:47:00.100
<v Speaker 5>if adderall and meth really are that </v>
<v Speaker 5>close and no one in this room are smart </v>

3526
02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:00.940
<v Speaker 5>enough to understand whether that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3527
02:47:01.850 --> 02:47:03.800
<v Speaker 5>But if they really are and no one in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this room's done math.</v>

3528
02:47:03.801 --> 02:47:05.460
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that true bro?</v>

3529
02:47:06.050 --> 02:47:08.810
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you've done adderall,</v>

3530
02:47:08.811 --> 02:47:09.440
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3531
02:47:09.441 --> 02:47:10.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish it did both.</v>

3532
02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:14.740
<v Speaker 5>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matthew snort might've.</v>

3533
02:47:15.050 --> 02:47:16.910
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I've done it before.</v>

3534
02:47:16.970 --> 02:47:18.080
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can smoke it,</v>

3535
02:47:18.230 --> 02:47:19.550
<v Speaker 5>you can smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>snort it.</v>

3536
02:47:19.551 --> 02:47:21.410
<v Speaker 5>The idea is to get it directly into your</v>
<v Speaker 5>bloodstream,</v>

3537
02:47:21.411 --> 02:47:26.411
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're taking the adderall as you're </v>

3538
02:47:26.411 --> 02:47:26.411
<v Speaker 5>taking them as a pill so it has to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>through,</v>

3539
02:47:26.411 --> 02:47:28.010
<v Speaker 5>your body will start to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3540
02:47:28.011 --> 02:47:28.820
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do.</v>

3541
02:47:29.390 --> 02:47:34.390
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was one of the things that the </v>

3542
02:47:34.390 --> 02:47:34.390
<v Speaker 5>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stronger,</v>

3543
02:47:34.390 --> 02:47:36.011
<v Speaker 5>faster guy had said that when they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They changed oxycontin's and made them </v>

3544
02:47:36.011 --> 02:47:37.640
<v Speaker 5>to where you couldn't smoke them or </v>
<v Speaker 5>snort them.</v>

3545
02:47:37.820 --> 02:47:39.380
<v Speaker 5>When you crush them and turn them into a</v>
<v Speaker 5>pill,</v>

3546
02:47:39.381 --> 02:47:42.830
<v Speaker 5>their profit margin jumped or dropped by</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 80 percent of you said,</v>

3547
02:47:42.831 --> 02:47:46.420
<v Speaker 5>I think it happened after they were here</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's been approved for 11 year olds</v>

3548
02:47:46.970 --> 02:47:51.470
<v Speaker 5>did however know oxycontin's for eight </v>
<v Speaker 5>to 11 year olds.</v>

3549
02:47:51.710 --> 02:47:54.560
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because everybody knows.</v>

3550
02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:57.110
<v Speaker 5>That's why sesame street's on hbo now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

3557
02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:18.710
