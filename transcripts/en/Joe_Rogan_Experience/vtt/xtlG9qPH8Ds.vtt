3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Guys sexually want to dominate me,</v>

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>That did happen in my twenties when I was broke though.</v>

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>When I was 20 and my brain broke,</v>

10
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to cuddle me and contact and grab your face and we're done.</v>

11
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Now that I have money,</v>

12
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:24.721
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting choked.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I gotta I gotta I gotta tell me what this is.</v>

15
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy put his four fingers in my mouth and just leave them there for like</v>

16
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:34.704
<v Speaker 1>two minutes.</v>

17
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.493
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.333
<v Speaker 1>Wash your hands.</v>

19
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Have a seven year old.</v>

20
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>She's sick because she touches things and then touches her mouth.</v>

21
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:48.564
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>just learn so much about you.</v>

25
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>You could never be single by the way today.</v>

26
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>You better make this marriage work forever because you're not gonna be able to</v>

27
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:55.731
<v Speaker 1>handle it.</v>

28
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause the hands in the mouth.</v>

29
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>It's very unsanitary out there,</v>

30
00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

31
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

32
00:00:58.831 --> 00:00:59.191
<v Speaker 1>hands on.</v>

33
00:00:59.191 --> 00:00:59.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried about myself.</v>

35
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>So he stuck his hand in my mouth and it was,</v>

36
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I've spent every night,</v>

37
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store for 10 years.</v>

38
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>My immune system is on point.</v>

39
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I know I've got a thousand hands at night.</v>

40
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think that sharing a microphone with 3,300 road comics every night does a</v>

41
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>number on your immune system.</v>

42
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I never get sick.</v>

43
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.211
<v Speaker 1>Never gets it.</v>

44
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>She can hold those hands.</v>

46
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Does it or just believe that sharing a microphone with Jay London,</v>

47
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.430
<v Speaker 1>you're good for a while.</v>

48
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>pig pen,</v>

50
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>everyone's googling j London and no results found on last comic standing.</v>

51
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>So he stuck his hand in my mouth and I was like,</v>

52
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>this did not happen in my twenties and I,</v>

53
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:43.104
<v Speaker 1>and I'm thinking,</v>

54
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.943
<v Speaker 1>am I,</v>

55
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>are we gagging me?</v>

56
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I've lost the plot at this point.</v>

57
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Did you ask them?</v>

58
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

59
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there and I'm like,</v>

61
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.850
<v Speaker 1>just waiting for something that happened.</v>

62
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.101
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait.</v>

63
00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to talk about.</v>

64
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.933
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

65
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm sitting there and I'm like,</v>

66
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>and then for a minute I was like,</v>

67
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe he lost his balance and he just had,</v>

68
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.423
<v Speaker 1>and he just</v>

69
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>like had to commit to it because it'd be too weird to be like,</v>

70
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:10.321
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

71
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:10.921
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>

72
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe he was worried I was going to speak or because I am one,</v>

73
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe he just wanted to stop me from talking.</v>

74
00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was,</v>

75
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>but this did not happen in my twenties and I was broke.</v>

76
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

77
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>got spit on in the face.</v>

78
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Spit in the face.</v>

79
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.370
<v Speaker 1>That's dark.</v>

80
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

81
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.863

<v Speaker 1>actually yes.</v>

84
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.063
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Maybe more wealthy than you.</v>

86
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

87
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.593
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

88
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.493
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Everyone thinks I have way more than I have and it's been in the press that I</v>

<v Speaker 1>have all this money.</v>

95
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.660

00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Why are you jamming my head on it?</v>

150
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>And then so I just thought that's how you did it.</v>

151
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And then I dated this guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know how many times this happened?</v>

200
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>That happened a few times where girls would like want to like go out with me</v>

201
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:23.930
<v Speaker 1>just to take pictures so they can tell their Facebook friends and oh,</v>

202
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>so they became friends with you because you were on television.</v>

203
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:27.671
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

204
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:28.271
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

205
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:29.870
<v Speaker 1>So that romance I think,</v>

206
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I think when that stuff was happening that's also,</v>

207
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

208
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing here.</v>

209
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the exact answers.</v>

210
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking out loud,</v>

211
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's maybe sort of around the same time when I started worrying</v>

212
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 1>about like bloggers and shit,</v>

213
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:43.520
<v Speaker 1>like shitting on it.</v>

214
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

215
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:48.751
<v Speaker 1>my friend Eddie has this theory about bill Cosby about a bill Cosby when he</v>

216
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:55.531
<v Speaker 1>started doing that to women and he thinks that that might have been the similar</v>

217
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>type of situation where these women wanted to be around him,</v>

218
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>but they were turning him down and he started drugging them that he started</v>

219
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>raping of,</v>

220
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.770

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.630

226
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean?</v>

227
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Like that can happen where someone is attracted to you simply because you're a</v>

228
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>famous person who think,</v>

<v Speaker 1>my boyfriend's waiting for me that she just casually mentioned him about</v>

259
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:46.911
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

260
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:47.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

261
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>my boyfriend said this or something.</v>

262
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

263
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

264
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.570
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

265
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

266
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 1>And this happened more than once.</v>

267
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

268

<v Speaker 1>take off and become this.</v>

270
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>So she's fine either way but issue because do people want to see those movies</v>

271
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:06.750
<v Speaker 1>the same way they want to see those movies when she was smashing Alexis Davis</v>

272
00:07:06.751 --> 00:07:09.830
<v Speaker 1>and armbarring Misha Tate knocking out Batchko Hey,</v>

274
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll say this,</v>

275
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people are going to Rhonda movies cause she's a phenomenal</v>

276
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.013
<v Speaker 1>actress.</v>

277
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

278
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.191
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

279
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to see Ron's moocs.</v>

280
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>You got to see her.</v>

281
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 1>You got to see her act in this sheet is amazing.</v>

282
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.410
<v Speaker 1>She is because she's,</v>

283
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>because she's supposedly the baddest woman on the planet now Holly Holm shut her</v>

284
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

285
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

286
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>So now Holly is thought to be the baddest woman on the planet,</v>

287
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:35.931
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

288
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

289
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

290
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

291
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>unless she fights cyborg.</v>

292
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:39.890
<v Speaker 1>If they figured out a catch weight fight,</v>

293
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

294
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:40.661
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

295
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:41.494

<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

323
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I love that character.</v>

324
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.170
<v Speaker 1>The fight like you did with Chad and we got the biggest fight.</v>

00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 1>is if you look at the,</v>

329
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:31.460

<v Speaker 1>if I'm a businessman,</v>

331
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

332
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 1>not as much water as fun,</v>

333
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 1>but a businessman,</v>

334
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Conor winning is the golden ticket button play too,</v>

335
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:39.960
<v Speaker 1>because Josie,</v>

336
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

337

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

339
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:45.170

340
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't need to know.</v>

341
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily the best thing.</v>

342
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Dana's still scrooge.</v>

346
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:55.950

347
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
