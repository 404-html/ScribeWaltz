00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.760
Hey,
you fuckers,
what are you doing?
Uh,

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.850
got to meet the Squarespace people this weekend,
uh,

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.840
in Manhattan with the Great Tony Bones bones in the house,
ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.070
and a,
they couldn't be fucking cool.

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.240
They were exactly what I thought they'd be a bunch of.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.100
Does that mean a bunch of smart looking young cats and very cool guys?

7
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:28.080
It was really fun.
It was a New York was fucking fantastic.
God Damn,

8
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.920
that was fun.
It's a great time.
Whoo.
It was fun in so many ways.

9
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:35.760
I fucking show was intense that the show.
Well,
we'll talk about that later,

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.570
but the Squarespace guys were cool as fuck.
And it's always nice when you,
um,

11
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.270
you have a sponsor that not only you believe in,

12
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:45.990
but you meet the people that are behind the sponsorship,
the company,
whatever,

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.230
and they're really cool.
Uh,
and they were super happy too.

14
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.870
You could tell that their product is actually awesome,

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.320
that so many people use it and enjoy it.
Uh,

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.070
what Squarespace is a website that allows you to make your own websites super

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.670
easy to do.
If you can do any of the normal functions on your computer,

18
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.570
drag and drop and Click and point and all that shit,
you can make a website.

19
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.090
A Kara Santa Maria was on the podcast last week,

20
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:10.680
runs her website through Squarespace.

21
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:13.560
She was talking about how easy it is for her to organize all of our media.

22
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.910
If you've got a store,

23
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.970
you put an online store up super quick and easy with Squarespace,

24
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.250
they have awesome support.
24,
seven,

25
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.160
if you're confused and you can't figure out what to do,

26
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:28.500
they can help you through it.
And they,

27
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.240
they also have it so that if you're a musician,

28
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:32.880
you could sell music on your site.
You can,
it's,

29
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:37.500
there's so much cool shit about Squarespace and the most beautiful thing is I've

30
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:39.840
never heard one person say that it's not awesome.

31
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.290
<v 1>I love it.
I love Squarespace has use it.
Well.
I've,
um,</v>

32
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.880
I've been to the side a lot and,
um,
I work with them too and I feel like it's a,

33
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.420
the thing that I always think about is the fact that in today's Day and age,

34
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.840
it blows your mind when someone still doesn't have a website.

35
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.890
If you have this as a tool,
like it just makes sense.
Like no matter what,

36
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.550
if you cut grass,
yeah.
It's like,
why wouldn't you have,
hey,

37
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:05.970
go here and you'll see me and contact me here and see what I do.

38
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.310
You have no excuse to not have a site so easy.

39
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.261
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:14.261
We gave away for a different one year memberships to Squarespace and for new

41
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.750

which have all been restocked.

42
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:21.310
The higher primary t shirts been restocked.
I'm sorry,
I'm slow with that shit.
Um,

43
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.590
but uh,

46
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:36.770
Just Joe.
And remember when there was numbers behind it.
Apparently not anymore.

47
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.800
They give up.
They realized that shit is ridiculous.
Joe.
One Joe to Joe Three Joe,

48
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.440
stop.
One joke.
I'm Randy.
There's plenty of Joe's.
That's not true at all.

49
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.220
It's like God damn pilot with them.

50
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.020
That is the most overused name in the world,
probably right next to one

51
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.900
<v 1>was that the world of podcasts,
there's one judge oh</v>

52
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.690
<v 2>was two or three.
That's why you're here.
Uh,
go to squares.</v>

53
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.980
<v 0>Bailey's and uh,
they have also launched a logo creator.</v>

54
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:12.160
We can create a clean,
simple logo.

55
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:14.710
Design yourself in minutes.

56
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.670
How fucking awesome is this website and could it get more awesome?

57
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.990
I say it can't.

58
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.220
So go there and enjoy Codeword Joe,

59
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.030
we've also been sponsored for quite a while now by legal zoom,

60
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.070
another outstanding website that makes it so easy to do shit that you used to

61
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:37.300
normally struggle to do.
Like any sort of a legal issue,

62
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:41.610
incorporating forming an LLC or making a will,

63
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.610
all those things.
You used to have to go to an attorney probably more than once.

64
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:48.370
You'd have to fill out a bunch of paperwork,
pay a bunch of money,

65
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.470
way cheaper,
cheaper,
cheaper beer.

66
00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:56.290
That's a new word to do on legals.
Legal Zoom,
legal zoom.

67
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:00.010
You can form an LLC starting at $99 that's outrageous.

68
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.040
If you think about how much fucking time it takes to actually go to a lawyer's

69
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:09.370
office,
drive there,
Park,
take the bus,
whatever the fuck you do,
get out,

70
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.340
go in,
sit there,
go throw the bullshit,

71
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.300
pay a stupid amount of money and then go home.

72
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.210
That's all that can be eliminated simply and easily.

73
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:20.860
For 99 bucks on legal zoom,

74
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:25.000
you can protect your family with a will for just $69 and get a living trust

75
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:28.330
power of attorney.
They get the job done right ladies and gentlemen,

76
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:32.260
nine at a 10 customers would recommend the service to their friends and family

77
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.460
and you know that.

78
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:37.900
I know that one out of every 10 people is a fucking idiot for sure.

79
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.390
At least that accounts for that one out of 10

80
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.930
<v 2>Ooh,
click.
You can do it for me.</v>

81
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.050
Ooh,
is this clever marketing?
Look,

82
00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:51.380
it says here you gave the person a legal plan and like that's for babies,

83
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.100
but a business legal plan that's for adults and that is interesting.

84
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.460
I would think that that's actually for family.
That's how I would look at it.

85
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.400
Do you need a will though?
You need a way.
If you're,

86
00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:04.130
if you don't have a will and you're an adult,
you know you're going to die.
Well,

87
00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:07.550
the government just says we'll take it.
Just snatch up most of your money.

88
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.790
Didn't you?
Gotta fuck it.
Scrapped for it and figure out who,
who deserves it.

89
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.630
Yeah,
that sucks.
Right?
Like they get to top it off with the actual laws are,

90
00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:17.210
as far as I'm saying,
the government scratched his up all your money.

91
00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:20.930
But I know they definitely get a little bit.
Yeah,
I don't know how it works.
It's,

92
00:05:20.931 --> 00:05:22.780
you know,
it's fuck man.
What's really fucked

93
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.790
<v 0>is inheritance tax,</v>

94
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.620
which means that say if you Tommy bonds leave behind a child,

95
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.270
uh,
some money,

96
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.530
like say one day you're a wealthy man and he got to tie you work your ass off

97
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:38.220
and you love the shit out of your kid.
Your kid wants to be a surfer for

98
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.680
<v 2>whatever the fuck can you like,
how to give my kid all my money?
Well,</v>

99
00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:41.790
you kid doesn't get all your money.

100
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.030
The kid gets the money that is left over after he pays taxes on the money that

101
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.720
you already paid taxes on,
right.
It's money that you earn.

102
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:54.960
Is that a state tax?
Is that what that is called?
Yeah,
it's creepy.

103
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.210
It's just I would like a piece.
But you had your piece.

104
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.870
<v 0>Yeah,
this is all clean money.
It's like if a guy gives you $100 he says,
Tommy,</v>

105
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:06.110
I like you and I know you would want $100 I'm gonna give you $100 do you really

106
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:08.870
have to report that for earning and do you have to pay taxes on that?

107
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:12.500
That's a gift.
Like what are you doing?
You creepy cuts.
You know,
like,

108
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.870
you know when someone's working for someone and someone's not,

109
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.720
you know when someone's actually getting a paycheck or someone's getting a gift

110
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.320
and you know that inheritance is money that somebody already fucking paid for.

111
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.470
Man,
if you want to leave your kid $10,000 and it turns out to be,
you know,

112
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:27.320
6,000 why not?

113
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.610
Why isn't it 10,000 why do you get for you fucking creed?
It's changed hands.

114
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.470
So we get it,
we get paid again.
They've doubled t double tap.

115
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.030
That's why you need to leave your kids money in bip bitcoin.

116
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.820
Now you need to leave them better than shut down without stumbling or maybe cash

117
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.200
in a mattress.
We stuff it in there.
Yeah.

118
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:48.410
I mean I have a hole in the ground with a fucking vault in it.
You know?

119
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:49.040
It's just,
it's,

120
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.480
it's bizarre that people think it's okay to pay taxes on something twice and

121
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:55.310
every,
you know,
here's another issue too,

122
00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:59.960
when it comes to taxes and inheritance and shit,
people who are broke,

123
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.590
there's a lot of people that are ambitious and they're hard working and the

124
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:04.790
struggling and trying to put it together.

125
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.630
But there's a lot of also people that are broke that are cunts and they want

126
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:09.950
everybody else to be broke too.

127
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.140
And they think that somehow if you pay more taxes,

128
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:15.170
it's going to help the economy or help them or no,
it's not.

129
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.630
It's going to give money to some fucking people that are going to be in

130
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:18.464
competent with it.

131
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.020
Let's be honest about what the fuck's going on with your taxes.

132
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.990
This is not like an to fix the fucking homeless problem.

133
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.940
It's not going to fix the school system.

134
00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:29.750
If you take 10% of this guy's money that his dad left him,
just stop.

135
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:30.584
You're stealing,

136
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.830
you're stealing and you're throwing it into and competence system that has

enzyme supplement,

to give your life what it needs on it.
One eighties,

161
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:04.350
one of my favorite things that I take with me on the road every time and it's a

162
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:08.310
nutrient based rejuvenating energy drink mix.

163
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.360
I mean when I say energy,
I don't mean like like a speed.
It's like Alpha brain.

164
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.330
It's got a bunch of different shit in it,
but it's got shroom tech,

165
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:20.190
it's got five HTP from new mood.
It's got the um,

166
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:20.880
neuro,

167
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.910
all the neurotransmitter support of Alpha brain with a bunch of different shit

168
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.510
into it as well.
That's great.
When I travel,
when I do,
um,

169
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.840
you fcs or something and I have to spend a lot of time on planes and uh,

170
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.770
also working out when I'm there and dehydrated and you know,

171
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.730
God forbid if you're out drinking,
uh,
this will help.

172
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.140
It will help in a big way.
Give your body the nutrients it deserves,

173
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:48.180
ladies and gentlemen,
it will change your life.

174
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.980
There's a lot of fucking talk online from a lot of salacious headlines about

175
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.780
multivitamins don't work.

176
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.290
When you look into those multivitamins don't work claims.

177
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.320
What you find is that the test that they were using in order to determine that

178
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:06.750
multivitamins don't work,
we're really ridiculous.

179
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.140
What they're doing is they're saying that people who are over 50 65 who have had

180
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:16.230
heart attacks don't benefit from multivitamins,

181
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.790
synthetic multivitamins,

182
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:22.230
that's essentially one of their main port up points of their study.

183
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.550
Their study had three parts to it.
It's really bizarre study.

184
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.120
One of them was that they showed that high dose multivitamins had no effect on

185
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:36.000
the progression of heart disease and heart attacks a virus.

186
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:41.090
The other one was the male physicians over 65 showed no improvement in cognitive

187
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:45.660
decline using generic multivitamin supplementation.

188
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.810
So what they're doing is they're taking people that are really fucked up already

189
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:53.610
and dying old people that giving them multivitamins that are synthetic,
generic,

190
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.240
generic,
but they're,
and they're not showing improvement in cognitive decline.

191
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.010
Well,
let's be honest,
first of all,
and when someone's having cognitive decline,

192
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.520
it's over.
You're not going to get younger.
You're going to get older.

193
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.790
There's almost nothing that improves cognitive decline in people who are old and

194
00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:12.144
they're falling apart.

195
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.960
Almost nothing unless there's some new miracles that come out.

196
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.950
So what they're saying is essentially vitamins can't do miracles.

197
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.230
They can't do any of the miracles of modern science.

198
00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:24.150
And modern medicine hasn't been able to do it either.

199
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.410
There's no medicines that they can give you that slow cognitive decline in old

200
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:29.640
people.
I mean,

201
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:33.510
you can maybe cut out a few things in your life that you're doing that are

202
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:36.870
hurting you,
like drinking or cleaning up your diet,

203
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.060
giving yourself less inflammation.

204
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.870
There's a bunch of things you can do to slow down the process,

205
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.690
but when you're fucking dying,
your fucking dying,
you know you're falling apart.

206
00:11:45.691 --> 00:11:50.691
So for someone to make a study saying that vitamins don't work and they're a

207
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:55.390
waste of money based on these,
that shit is so irresponsible.

208
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.470
It's so irresponsible.
And this is coming from,
we don't even sell multivitamins.

209
00:11:59.680 --> 00:11:59.981
You know?

210
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:04.000
I think that the best vitamins that you can get into your body are the closest

211
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:07.660
to how nature intends them.
Meaning food based vitamins,

212
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.520
things that are based on the nutrients that are based on actual food,

213
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:16.060
not synthetics and synthetics I'm sure are better than nothing.

214
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.160
The idea that they're not as ridiculous.

215
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.340
The idea that there's a reason why they know that vitamin C cure scurvy prevent

216
00:12:23.661 --> 00:12:28.030
scurvy.
There's a reason why they know that when you have a lack of calcium,

217
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:31.690
your body can get osteoporosis there.
They've no,

218
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.880
this is all facts and science.

219
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:39.300
People love to shit on things that are controversial when they do not have all

220
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:42.400
the evidence.
They love to be a naysayer.

221
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.150
They love to call bullshit and they love to call bullshit when they're fucking

222
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:49.450
wrong.
And with,
with vitamins and supplementation,

223
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.040
I think they're wrong in a huge way.
I prefer to get my vitamins,

224
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.920
I take a lot of different nutrients and a lot of different vitamins,

225
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.970
but I prefer to get my vitamins mostly from like green drink powders,

226
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.830
powders that are essentially dehydrated greens.
Um,

227
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.590
we sell superfoods on,
uh,
on,
it's called,

228
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:12.550
we call them earth grown nutrients on,
um,
on a.com.

229
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.290
And it's based on that idea,

230
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.440
based on the idea that the things that are the closest to what you eat in the

231
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.261
real world,

232
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:23.140
if you have a healthy diet or they're going to be the things that your body

233
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.460
digest the best.
And what we have in this,
in this,

234
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.710
this super food power,
food,
um,

235
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.010
combination is first of all,
we,
we have various Greens,

236
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.780
we have antioxidants,

237
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.470
the Greens that we have all these earth grown nutrients.

238
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.640
It's essentially food that did just take the water out and all the nutrients are

239
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:49.480
left.
Is it as good as eating fresh vegetables?
Absolutely not,

240
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.560
but it's close.
It's close enough so that if your diet is off,

241
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:55.060
if you're not getting enough vegetables,

242
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:57.760
if you're not getting enough raw nutrients and minerals,

243
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.770
you're going to have a much better time adding something to your diet.

244
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:06.220
Then just allowing your body to be in that sort of a situation where it's at a

245
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:09.160
deficit.
Um,
we're going to have some,

246
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.180
some doctors on some scientists and the in the near future that are extreme

247
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:15.640
advocates for multivitamin supplementation.

248
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:20.080
And we've had many conversations with these people because of,
uh,
these,
uh,

249
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.650
sort of salacious headlines that people are really pissed off because they've

250
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:27.370
seen some improvement in their patients and with various things.
I mean,

251
00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:30.670
there's been several studies that have showed an improvement in preventing

252
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:35.440
infectious illnesses,
uh,
improvement in mood and stress,
cognition,
work,

253
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:40.441
stress and even juvenile delinquency and noted help multivitamins.

254
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:45.770
And this is not,
these,
these are not like bullshit studies on,
you know,

255
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.290
fucking the daily mail or some shit.
These,

256
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.800
this is all on like pub pub med sites.

257
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.270
These are all like published papers and the effect of Multivitamin and mineral

258
00:14:56.271 --> 00:15:00.050
supplementation on juvenile delinquency amongst American school children,

259
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
a randomized,
double blind placebo controlled trial.

260
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:07.710
So shut the fuck up about vitamins don't help you because they do,
they're there.

261
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.220
They are the building blocks of life.

262
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.260
They are nutrients there what you need in order to live your life optimized.

263
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.790
Okay.
And,
uh,

264
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.480
obviously I'm not a scientist and obviously I barely get through the shit that
I,

265
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:22.610
I do understand.

266
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.870
But the reality of all this stuff is that the more healthy nutrients you get

267
00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:30.200
into your body,
the better your body's going to work.
It's really that simple.
Uh,

268
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:32.810
use the code word,
Rogan,
R,
O,
g,
a,

269
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:36.020
N and you will save 10% off any and all supplements.

270
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.640
One of the key points about on its supplements is we have a 90 pill,
30 day,

271
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.060
100% money back guarantee.
You don't even have to return the product.

272
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:47.570
If you try something like Alpha brain or shroom tech and you don't like it,

273
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.180
you just say you don't like it and you get your money back.

274
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.340
You can't just keep doing that every month.
He's silly bitch.

275
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:56.300
But the idea is that we're selling you something that we believe in so much that

276
00:15:56.301 --> 00:15:59.000
we want to make it as accessible as possible.

277
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:02.930
We want to make it so that when you,
when you have this relationship with us,

278
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:06.860
if you're,
you're buying the supplements,
you feel like this is,
this is good.

279
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.800
This is a,
an ethical good way to do this.

280
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.460
They sell me something at a reasonable rate that is the best stuff that they can

281
00:16:13.461 --> 00:16:15.260
find.
And if I don't agree with it,

282
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.370
I get my money back and that's w w no one does that.

283
00:16:19.371 --> 00:16:23.060
And the reason why we do it is because we are selling you the best shit we can

284
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:27.180
find.
Uh,
the shit that we use,
everything we sell,
we use.
Um,

285
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.810
I use all of the strength and conditioning equipment.

286
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:33.230
I use all the supplements and I talked too much on a.com.

287
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.550
Oh and it used the codeword Rogan save yourself 10% of any and all supplements.

288
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.150
And in the higher primates shirts,
they're all in stock there.
Um,

289
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.040
I know I'm fucking real slow at getting them bitches going,
but uh,

290
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.280
they're all in stock now and some new ones coming.
That's a higher primate.com.

291
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:54.250
Boom.
Tommy Buns is here.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.

292
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.940
<v 3>Okay,</v>

293
00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:58.790
<v 0>well good</v>

294
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.850
<v 3>Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

295
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.040
<v 0>Nick Diaz doesn't fight in the UFC or it hasn't fought in the UFC for a long</v>

296
00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:12.010
time.
That that soundbite is even cooler.
Yeah,
it is.

297
00:17:12.011 --> 00:17:16.000
It's like so lucky moment in time.

298
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.880
Hilarious.
Yeah.
This,
uh,

299
00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:22.930
this weekend Tommy buns and I were in New York having a good time in the big

300
00:17:22.931 --> 00:17:26.800
apple.
That was fun,
man.
It was fun.
It was a good time to show is insane.

301
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.730
They were the nicest fucking people on the planet earth.
It's so nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.

302
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:30.861
He's,

303
00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:33.790
you don't always look at when you started talking about sizeable crowds when you

304
00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:35.610
started talking about over a thousand people.
Yeah.

305
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.340
But for them to be that nice felt like a room of,
what was it that,
you know,

306
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.680
it was kind of a screwy situation.
Excuse me.
Because,
um,
we,

307
00:17:44.681 --> 00:17:47.650
uh,
we're at this old venue and this place,

308
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.100
the only way you could get to the floor where

309
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.270
<v 2>the auditorium is,</v>

310
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.020
is you had to take an elevator and add the bank of four elevators.

311
00:17:55.021 --> 00:18:00.021
Two of them were broken and don't forget the building had thousands of people in

312
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:05.160
it for other massive events to massive events.
The stern show party,

313
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:07.950
like birthday bash,
birthday bash,
that was on the fungus.
Yeah.

314
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:10.990
He was on one floor and there was,
what was that other,
there was another fee.

315
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.500
Hawks Superbowl party was on.
Exactly.
Yeah.

316
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:16.170
There's a Seahawks part houses thousands of people.

317
00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:20.010
And then our show was sold out for months.
So it was like,

318
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.180
it was madness and it was all these people having to go from floor to floor on

319
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.020
elevators.
It's so weird.
The two like to um,

320
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.620
to do a room that big that is not a ground floor room,

321
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.840
10th floor and 10th floor.
It's oldest shit theater.
The places oldest shit,

322
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:39.750
it's really fucking cool.
Building is bad ass.

323
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:44.070
It's like there's a lot of those old buildings in New York City that are like,

324
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.310
you feel it if you feel different when you're in them.
Yeah.
Cause you know,

325
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:49.560
like when was this building made 1909.
Whoa.

326
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:54.120
And you're walking around it and first of all there's solid as fuck.
You know,

327
00:18:54.121 --> 00:18:56.610
think about a building that's been there for a hundred fucking years and it's

328
00:18:56.611 --> 00:19:01.500
still rock solid.
I mean they made some goddamn buildings back then.
But,
uh,

329
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.970
on top of that,
it's just got all this history in it.
You know,
these,
these,

330
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.500
all these people have been through it and it had some strange design,

331
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.410
I guess a flaw or I don't know what you would say,

332
00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:16.230
but just a byproduct of the design.

333
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.850
There was a wind whistling through the entire hotel,

334
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.920
the entire,
it was not a hotel.
The entire convention said,
whatever you call it,

335
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.640
Manhattan Center.
Yeah.
The entire place.
Like a 30 mile an hour wind.

336
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.060
Like you would open doors and when would comment,
but it was warm.

337
00:19:33.061 --> 00:19:36.180
You couldn't find the source of the,
you couldn't be like,
oh,
this windows open.

338
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:37.080
That's where the wins from.

339
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:41.430
It was some sort of an effect of all these doors being open and the wind coming

340
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.300
in from the front door.

341
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.540
So the wind would come in from the front door with such momentum that it would

342
00:19:45.541 --> 00:19:48.630
go down these hallways and literally make it upstairs.

343
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.430
So you'd be on the 10th floor and the wind would come whistling through,
I mean,

344
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.930
strong wind.
And the weird thing is that like to get to our,

345
00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.000
to the room,
to bike to backstage,
you go up,

346
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.900
you know you go up to the 10th floor and you go down like eight hallways with

347
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:07.170
turns.
So you feel like you're in this weird labyrinth.
You know,

348
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.750
there's not like you go,
well this is open.
It's right here.

349
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:13.350
That's where winds coming from you.
We've all the way into this area.

350
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.430
And then the wind is hitting you from every angle and it's warm.

351
00:20:17.431 --> 00:20:20.070
It's not even cold wind cause it's freezing outside.

352
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.270
But by the time the wind gets to you,
it's been heated up by the building.

353
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.730
So we've got let's like some sort of an intern,

354
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.950
internal baby tornado thing going on.
It was a,
yeah.
You know how tornadoes,

355
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.700
I think part of what causes tornadoes in some hurricanes is the two different

356
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.640
heats colliding with each other.
Like a warm water and cold air or yeah,

357
00:20:40.641 --> 00:20:44.380
I did that.
And warm.
Yeah.
There's something about,
you know,

358
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.610
weather fronts and conditions colliding and wonder if that has any factor.

359
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:51.220
And the cold air becoming,
you know,

360
00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:53.980
like whipping around that building like that and,
and becoming warm.

361
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.950
Even when we went into the green room,
um,
we felt the,
you know,
the,

362
00:20:58.951 --> 00:21:02.140
that wind.
Yeah.
And I was like,
Oh I moved,
cause there's a curtain there,

363
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.380
you move the curtain and there's no window.
I thought window was open.

364
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.860
It was so I just didn't know where it was confusing like where it was coming

365
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:12.640
from.
It's how's it hitting us right now?
Yeah,
it's really weird.
And you know,

366
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:16.600
when you think about like wind and buildings,
like I think about things like,

367
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.270
like remember that movie backdraft Oh yeah.

368
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:24.390
And then like that was like the first open doors that when you are in a fire,

369
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:24.971
the,

370
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:29.140
when you open windows and you open doors affects the amount of oxygen coming to

371
00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:29.651
the fire.

372
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:34.651
And sometimes it's almost like an explosion like comes at you and all this wind

373
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:37.540
in air and heat and temperature that those are the,
we,

374
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.470
we deal with them so often.
Like on a stable basis.

375
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.730
Air conditioned rooms,
like especially in California,
pretty stagnant climates,

376
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.410
pretty static climate.

377
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.250
But when things change like radically and have these weird effects,

378
00:21:51.251 --> 00:21:55.000
like you realize like how bizarre the whole idea really is in the first place.

379
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.230
Yeah.
Air is invisible air around us all the time.
Whipping,

380
00:21:58.231 --> 00:22:00.580
being around and moving and you could feel it when it blows on it.

381
00:22:00.581 --> 00:22:02.590
If you don't see shit you don't see shit.

382
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.620
It's also like one of the basic kind of building blocks of the world of life.

383
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.630
And I think most people know very little like me about it.

384
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.530
Like you kind of go like,
how do I not know more about how that works?

385
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.400
And I don't,
I'm just like,
yeah,
no oxygen feeds fire.

386
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.440
And that's like kind of my extent of my knowledge about it.

387
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.620
It would be weird if Manhattan put a big fucking wall around it.

388
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.560
That would be the way to avoid the,
the uh,
the window.
That would certainly,
yeah,

389
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.540
just put a huge wall.

390
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.630
The top of the buildings would still be wiggling probably.
Yeah.
Well,

391
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.560
the engineer that in them,
the fact that they can sway,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

392
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.470
I mean all new buildings will definitely like buildings in the last 20 years.

393
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:49.020
Yeah.
All Wa like sway,
especially if they're built well,
I'm sure in New York,

394
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.790
San Francisco,
La,
you know,

395
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.810
they expect them to have a tolerance for earthquakes.

396
00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:00.940
I was in a ray Kurzweil's house in San Francisco.
He's that Google guy.

397
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:02.770
He works for Google now.
Um,

398
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.490
the guy who will works with the artificial technology and you know,

399
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:11.491
he's a proponent of the idea of the trends in dental man,

400
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.180
that one day we're going to be able to transcend our biological existence and

401
00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:19.930
either become a part of a computer or download consciousness to computers.

402
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.410
Fascinating.
Fascinating dude.
But he lives on the top of his fucking building,

403
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.930
you know,
and like,
this is San Francisco man.

404
00:23:25.931 --> 00:23:29.890
Like this is a crazy place to live like this.
This fucking thing moves,
man.

405
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.510
Don't you feel weird about those?
A Malibu homes on sticks.
Fuck yeah,

406
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.110
those people are crazy.
Craziest shit.

407
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.050
Remember when we were in New York this weekend when we were flying in,

408
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:46.040
we flew over areas that hurricane sandy hit in New Jersey and you see like

409
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.390
<v 1>we're buildings used to be.</v>

410
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.720
You see like these areas where shit is just wiped out.
Yeah.
It's very,

411
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:55.790
you fucking real scary man.
Like it doesn't happen that often.
No.

412
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:59.990
But when it does happen,
your fucked and it can happen.
We just,

413
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.670
we're basing everything on such a short timeline.
You know,
our ideas of what,

414
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:08.210
whether it's possible.
It was only based on the last couple of hundred years.

415
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.800
It's true.
It's basically on a couple years.
And then you also only live so long.

416
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:17.110
Like can you talk about like history time in history,
you know,
a,

417
00:24:17.111 --> 00:24:19.370
a human lifespan is not even like,

418
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.930
you don't even measure how often something happens by,
so we only have a rep,

419
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.260
we only refer to things happening through like,
oh,
it hasn't happened since.

420
00:24:27.261 --> 00:24:30.540
Like my grandfather was rambling.
It's not that long ago.
Yeah.

421
00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.590
That happened fucking yesterday in terms of history.
So yeah,

422
00:24:33.591 --> 00:24:35.930
it happens pretty often actually to put it in perspective,

423
00:24:35.931 --> 00:24:38.870
think about the lifetime of like say a house fly.
What do they live?

424
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.350
They live like seven days,
10 days or something like that out.
Okay,

425
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.580
let's find out.
How long has the house,

426
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:48.620
I think it's a couple of days thinking about how many horrific things have

427
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:53.480
happened in like modern recorded history weather wise.
If you,

428
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:57.920
if you lay that over time over stuff we don't know about like really bad natural

429
00:24:57.921 --> 00:25:02.250
disasters happen all the time.
Seven days.
That's how long it fly lives.
Yeah,

430
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:06.470
most of them.
Seven days.
Sometimes as long as two months.
Hello,
so two bucks.

431
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.170
I'm old school pen here for a minute.

432
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:12.890
Just think about how little change happens over the course of seven days in the

433
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:14.720
world.
I mean sometimes yes,
sometimes no,

434
00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:18.830
but the idea of basing the weather on what happens in seven day increments is

435
00:25:18.831 --> 00:25:21.650
fucking completely ridiculous.
Cause we know about seasons.

436
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:26.790
We'll seasons don't exist to a God damn fly rod and father's Day and world was

437
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:31.760
frozen,
things were dark,
life was terrifying.

438
00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.880
There was no shit anywhere to lend in.
You know,

439
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.700
my pappy was around last month when the shit would drop,

440
00:25:37.701 --> 00:25:40.610
it would freeze instantly.
We couldn't lay eggs.
You know what I mean?
They,

441
00:25:40.611 --> 00:25:43.510
that's what their version of the world.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah.

442
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.160
But then you talked to like 10 generations later.

443
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.950
It's sort of like a game of Thrones type of thing where they're talking about

444
00:25:48.951 --> 00:25:52.040
the winter being months or years instead of months.

445
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.750
I still haven't seen that show.
No take care of you.

446
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.990
I know one of the things about winter is winter is varying lengths in this crazy

447
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:04.550
world that they live in.
Sometimes winter lasts for years,
for years.
Fuck that.

448
00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:08.150
It's coming and they're all terrified.
At winter,
we're all terrified at winter.

449
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.780
It gives you a good perspective because we know that winter's going to be,

450
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.160
even if it's an Iowa,

451
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.360
even if it's somewhere like Michigan's fucking cold as shit.
It's four months,

452
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:22.400
you know,
tough it up.
Suck it up.
You'll be all right.
But if winter was 40 years,

453
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.750
you got to move.
I don't want to hear your argument for why you stayed.
Yeah.
Well,

454
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:29.860
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
You know,
the,
like the thinking behind that,

455
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.060
it's like that,
that really is what it's like,

456
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.210
the difference between living in Michigan and living in California.
Yeah.

457
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:36.200
I mean there's,

458
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.550
there's some places where people live that have pretty extensive and sometimes

459
00:26:40.551 --> 00:26:43.380
brutal winters,
nothing compared to 40 years.
But I'm saying there's,

460
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.190
you go further north into Canada.
Yeah.
It was definitely cities that have a,

461
00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.310
like you could argue that it's pretty seriously winter by October and then it

462
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:57.330
gets,
it just gets varying degrees of worse,
you know,
so like,
they're like,

463
00:26:57.331 --> 00:27:00.720
this doesn't winter yet.
I know it's five out,
but wait til next month.

464
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.610
And you're like,
okay.
And then you go into November,
December,
those are freezing.

465
00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:06.990
January,
February of the worst.

466
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.610
And it's still cold in that place in March and sometimes into April.
May.
Yeah.

467
00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:16.590
So you're talking about can go to Edmonton crazy snow storm and Matt and cold as

468
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:18.200
fuck wrong.
It's cold as fuck.
Yeah.

469
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:23.010
I ran into a couple in Phoenix that came to the shows or shows down there and

470
00:27:23.011 --> 00:27:24.960
they live in Edmonton and they said they uh,

471
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:28.380
they take the summer off or the winter off the winner and they just go to

472
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:31.830
Arizona.
So like fuck this,
fuck this.
Yeah.
Especially Phoenix.

473
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.490
Phoenix is great in the summertime.
Oh my God,
it's crazy.

474
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.470
But in the wear time it's dream.
It's beautiful.

475
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.770
That hundred and 30 degrees in the summertime is fucking retarded though.

476
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.620
It's horrible that,
that in like a,
in Vegas you're like,

477
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:47.010
what the fuck are we doing?
Yeah.
It gets like one 10 all the time.

478
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.860
We were just out there cooking like a hairdryer in your face.

479
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:53.370
If you happen to like walk on the pavement.
Oh my God.

480
00:27:53.371 --> 00:27:55.820
Or get into a car and then you're looking at your,

481
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.060
the thing you turned the car on,

482
00:27:57.061 --> 00:28:00.750
it says like one 22 and your dashboard and you're like,
what is happening?

483
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.140
That's the sun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
These people,

484
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.640
they live most of their life in Edmonton.
Then they were like,
fuck that.

485
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.600
We think about it.
Everybody would if they could.
Yeah.

486
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.810
I mean there's no such thing as like,
I really,
you know,

487
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:16.080
I understand people that like the seasons and all that and you know the change,

488
00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:21.081
but nobody wants to be around 20 below for extensive periods of times.

489
00:28:21.121 --> 00:28:23.440
Usually that's,
that's,
you know,
reasonable.
I think you,

490
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.860
you kind of want to get out of that naturally after a while.

491
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.290
Did you ever see that show a life below zero.

492
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.260
It's one of those Alaska shows.

493
00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.880
People are living in these strange climates and there's this woman who operates

494
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:40.881
this a refueling station and it's I think a hundred and something miles north of

495
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:44.220
the Arctic circle.

496
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:50.340
So this crazy leg hurts inside to think of that.
This is a bad ass bitch.

497
00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.940
She's by herself up there and uh,
she was attacked by a bear once.

498
00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:55.050
I don't know how she survived,

499
00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:59.040
but it broke her leg and I think maybe her hip to and bid into her head.

500
00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:00.990
That her,
yeah,
that's her.
Cause you have a beard.

501
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.110
She's got a little something going on.
Okay.
You went to if you were old lady.

502
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.150
Okay.
The more the bath.
Yeah.
Normally she doesn't look like that.
All right.

503
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.400
She doesn't have the frost and fast.
Don't be cruel to me.

504
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.580
I just saw a beard and I was like,
she has my beard.
She's a tough,

505
00:29:14.581 --> 00:29:17.220
broad math and I've been trying to figure this lady out.

506
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:20.040
I watched the show all the time and I'm trying to figure out this lady out.

507
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.860
I think,
um,
this is what it is.

508
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.950
I think she's a tough lady that enjoys challenges and so like her life is better

509
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:32.190
for her when it's just this constant struggle against nature and the elements.

510
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:37.020
She enjoys it.
She seems to like thrive off of it.
I think that's a,
you know,

511
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:41.230
there's individuals you put you,
you set up circumstances for,

512
00:29:41.231 --> 00:29:42.070
it's better for them.

513
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.050
<v 2>Like in a big picture.</v>

514
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:47.440
Like some people work better with structure and some people work better with no

515
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:51.280
structure,
you know,
and I think you keep progressing along that line.

516
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:56.040
Some people can thrive in harsher situate,

517
00:29:56.041 --> 00:30:00.540
like this is ideal for some people,
but I think it's not for a lot,
you know,
it's,

518
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:05.550
there's a minimum amount of people that actually want to be and will thrive in

519
00:30:05.981 --> 00:30:07.330
a,
in a,
an environment like that.

520
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.950
Well everyone is always looking for Phoenix to go to in the middle of the
winter,

521
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.900
everyone is looking for comfort,
right?

522
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.190
And what these people are doing is going the exact opposite way and they're

523
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:18.461
saying,

524
00:30:18.461 --> 00:30:23.290
we're just looking to make it exciting and struggle every day.

525
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.030
But we choose to do it this way.

526
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.780
Like these are all what you call subsistence hunting people.

527
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:31.480
Meaning they live completely off the land.

528
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.740
They get their vegetables from the grow on them.
They'd get their fish by chip.

529
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.930
That woman right there,
that uh,
in you went woman,

530
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.760
her fucking whole family has had massive loss because of people falling through

531
00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:47.500
the ice and drowning.
She lost her mother.
I think she lost her brother.

532
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:50.230
She was lost like several,
like close family members,

533
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.520
members fell through the ice and fucking froze to death.
You know.
I mean,

534
00:30:54.521 --> 00:30:59.350
this is some harsh shit.
Yeah.
This world is crazy and they have to do it.

535
00:30:59.351 --> 00:31:00.610
That's the only way you're going to get fish.

536
00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:03.130
So they're out there on this river that's flowing river,

537
00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:06.640
that freed the top of it freezes and you're standing on it and if you fall

538
00:31:06.641 --> 00:31:09.760
through,
that's a wrap,
son.
It's over.
But there's no other way,

539
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:12.190
like there's no other way to get the fish out of there,
but she also has,

540
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.570
there's purpose for her being up there.
In other words,
it's a refueling,

541
00:31:16.571 --> 00:31:20.860
like she's there for a service or no,
it's,
she's just there.
No women.
Just,

542
00:31:20.861 --> 00:31:23.590
that's how they live.
That's just how she lives.
That's how they make their money.

543
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:27.930
They don't,
they don't have jobs.
They just get fish out of the,
uh,

544
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.850
out of the river.
I mean,
this is,
there's several groups of people,

545
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.430
but she's looking at that at that.
Then you went woman and her husband.

546
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.880
Her husband,
yeah.
Yeah.
There's,
there's four or five different,

547
00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:39.220
do they sell fish or just fish to eat?
They self,

548
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:41.440
some things they do a lot of trading now.
They're like,

549
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:44.470
they'll trade like give you a half of a Caribou.
I need,
uh,

550
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.910
some fan belts from my car to repair my snowmobile or what have you.
They all,

551
00:31:48.911 --> 00:31:51.940
they'd traveled by snowmobile everywhere,
everywhere.
So when they're outside,

552
00:31:51.941 --> 00:31:53.110
they're outside man,
they're not,

553
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:57.150
there's no like heated trucks where they're driving around in,
no sir.
No.

554
00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:02.230
[inaudible] a crazy hard life.
But they like it.
They do like it.

555
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.220
There's,
this one lady is really fascinating because she said,

556
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:09.910
I mean it's hard to tell what someone's really like when you got a camera in

557
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:10.744
their face.
Yeah.

558
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.720
It's hard to tell who they are if they're relaxed and you just talking to them.

559
00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:17.400
Like sometimes it takes months to get to know someone defined.
You know,
what,

560
00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.930
what,
what goes on behind the scenes inside of their head.

561
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.380
So you don't really know that lady that well from watched her on that show.

562
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.150
But what you can tell is it's something that she's enjoying about being up there

563
00:32:28.151 --> 00:32:32.710
and this really scary environment where she's already been attacked by a fucking

564
00:32:32.711 --> 00:32:36.940
bear.
I mean,
Jesus,
she got attacked by,
and those are grizzly bears.

565
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.530
These are the big brown bears.

566
00:32:38.531 --> 00:32:42.000
They're not like black bears that you could scare away.
Like they're,

567
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.580
they're there to fuck you up.
Yeah.

568
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.360
She hunts Caribou and fucking small birds and whatever she's following up there.

569
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.520
That's where she gets her meet.
The bear was like,
I see your beard.

570
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.680
I'll give you a break.
We both had beards.

571
00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.010
No.
I think the bear,
she probably shot him or something.

572
00:33:01.011 --> 00:33:06.011
I don't know what the full story like there's not really much topping badass

573
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:11.090
stories as much as I got attacked by a bear and I fucked like I killed that
bear.

574
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.770
Yeah.
Like what's a better story than that?
Maybe a shark,
but sharks,

575
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.820
the idea of you fighting off a shark,
it gets crazy.
You know how much chance.

576
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.860
But if you did,
if you're like,
you know,

577
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.540
that's why I got this half arm right here.

578
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.960
It's like if a shark kicks your ass on the shore on a shore,

579
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:29.030
say if you have a giant knife in your hand,

580
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.830
you the keys shark kicks your ass on a shore.
But like a shark deserves it.
Yes.

581
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.980
Because you were just fucking,
well,
how's the shark and get you on the ground.

582
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.290
You can take a great white shark,
put it on the beach.

583
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:43.160
I will fuck that thing up is no chance I will get behind him.
I'll stab him.

584
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:46.220
Writing a stupid brain.
Yep.
I'll find it.
A little pea brain.

585
00:33:46.221 --> 00:33:49.250
I'll chop away at the top of his head afterwards and I'm sure he'll open his

586
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:52.310
jaws and shit would over.
Dude,
you're not in the ocean.
You fucked.

587
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.890
This is my world.
[inaudible] House.
Yeah.
You're not gonna bite me.

588
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.830
I'm going to stick fucking a knife in your brain and then I'm going to eat you.

589
00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.670
Yeah.
But if you're in the water and you have about the same amount of chance,

590
00:34:01.671 --> 00:34:03.800
except the only thing that saves you is that sharks are stupid.

591
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.390
So if there's some way that you could do like,

592
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.810
jab it in the nose with like a harpoon.

593
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:11.960
If you had like one of those fish harpoons,
like dudes to go,
um,

594
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.940
what do they call it?
A spear fishing.
Shoot.
The spheres.
Sure.
Yeah,
the spear guns.

595
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.740
If you could like stab it in the nose with that,

596
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:21.530
you might be able to get the fuck away from you because you know that they're

597
00:34:21.531 --> 00:34:24.920
kind of sensitive in their nose,
but you might not.
Yeah,
most likely you will.

598
00:34:24.921 --> 00:34:28.820
Probably not.
Most likely you'll miss no bite your arm off and you bleed out,

599
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.420
you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
They swim pretty fucking fast too.

600
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:34.550
Unless you can swim like 40 miles an hour,

601
00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.730
which I don't think some homeless guy in California yesterday got attacked by a

602
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:42.110
mountain lion.
Yeah,
that's crazy.
Yeah.
I got to get fucked up.
Homeless Guy.

603
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:45.870
Was He hiking?
Yeah,
it was outside.
It was like camping,
you know,

604
00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:49.970
talking about mountain mine.
Yeah.
Not good to there,

605
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.670
you know,
unusual homeless activity.

606
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:56.330
They're going to have more and more that they don't really camp when the hell

607
00:34:56.331 --> 00:34:58.520
knows.
It's more just they're always camping.

608
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:02.600
Cause the best campus homeless people that are constantly camping.
Well,

609
00:35:02.601 --> 00:35:04.400
it depends on what kind of homeless.
Obviously this guy,

610
00:35:04.401 --> 00:35:08.690
it seems like he might have been a crazy person at long week of being homeless

611
00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:12.290
in the city.
We'd go up to the hills for a little bit.
Yeah,
man,

612
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.780
that ain't fun man.
That sucks.
It's going to happen more.
You know,

613
00:35:17.781 --> 00:35:21.290
this is something we talked about on the opiate Anthony show when we were in New

614
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:26.240
York.
Talked about a mountain lion attacks and yeah,
man and a here.

615
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:29.330
There's a group of people right there.
Yeah.

616
00:35:29.331 --> 00:35:34.280
That was a guy in the back loans.
Uh,
Ricky Gervais',

617
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:38.600
Jim Norton and Opie and Anthony and,
and us.
What a fun room man.
Fuck you.

618
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.340
I was a lot of fun.
It was a good time.
It's so cool meeting.

619
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.940
I'm a big fan of Ricky Gervais'.
Nice Guy,
man.
Super Nice Guy.
Nice guy.

620
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:45.990
Really easy to talk to.

621
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.060
Very interesting wolf fact that you learned also about jaw.
The biting.

622
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:54.320
Yeah.
They have a bite that's like five times more powerful than a pitbull.

623
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.580
I can hear that.
Yeah.
I couldn't believe that either.
Man.

624
00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.390
Definitely thought that he was making that up or exaggerating it.
Well,
you know,

625
00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:03.720
sometimes it's,
it's sometimes it's like someone tells you something,

626
00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:06.960
it's just not correct and you repeat it.
I've done that before of course.

627
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:11.670
And sometimes you know,
you,
you're not even intending to mislead you.

628
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:14.640
You heard something or you,
you think you remember the number and you're like,

629
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:16.740
I think it's this number and you just throw it out.
I've done that.

630
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:20.700
I thought it was going to be bigger.
Obviously I think a wolf bites harder.
Yeah.

631
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:25.410
But I didn't think it was going to be five times fucking bananas.
It snap.

632
00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:30.660
They can snap the leg bone of an elk.
That's insane.

633
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.913
What a crazy,

634
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.480
you know the idea that people think that's a dog that's so silly.

635
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.790
And now when you think about like just that you right,

636
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.140
whatever you already knew about them,

637
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:44.370
you think about that added stat and you think about the fact that they hunt in

638
00:36:44.371 --> 00:36:45.204
packs.

639
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:49.110
I think about three or four of those mouths with those at what that's possible

640
00:36:49.111 --> 00:36:53.640
of doing in how quick amount of time,
you know,
I mean like those,
they ambush you.

641
00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:54.330
Yeah.
You know,

642
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:58.230
they come this way that way and pretty soon you're looking around like,
oh shit.

643
00:36:58.231 --> 00:37:01.230
And that's what happens to the animals,
you know,
they get,
they get trapped.

644
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.800
It's so funny.
Steve Rinella,
my friend,

645
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:09.090
hunter guy from the show meter was talking about there was this,
um,
uh,

646
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.650
one thing,
uh,

647
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:15.270
were where people were talking about running a and trying to keep up with wolves

648
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.370
and like,
I could a man tried to keep up with a wolf,
right?

649
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.580
And one of the ways that they tested it is they took these wolf dogs and they

650
00:37:20.581 --> 00:37:22.050
let these wolf dogs go.

651
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.870
And then they had these people run through the mountains and like see if they

652
00:37:24.871 --> 00:37:27.740
can keep up with the wolf dog.
Like,
you know,
see,
uh,

653
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.030
like wolves can run faster,

654
00:37:30.031 --> 00:37:34.680
but sometimes people can run longer instead of your base.
Well,
it,
the wolves,

655
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:39.360
dogs,
Wolf dogs are not wolves.
And he was like,
the way he described it as like,

656
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:44.130
that's like taking an alien in,
an alien comes down and finds the fattest,

657
00:37:44.131 --> 00:37:48.570
most add a shape guy with the worst diet and says,
run as fast as you can.

658
00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:52.830
We want to see how fast humans can run.
Oh,
really?
That's the equivalent of that.

659
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.890
Isn't that a good,
yeah.
Isn't that a great analogy?

660
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:59.730
Because he gives a wolf is a wolf these up.
They're not dogs and not getting fed.

661
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.240
They're out there running down elk and biting their legs in half.
Right.

662
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:08.340
And this is not a wolf dog.
They're fucking Wolfe's.

663
00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:12.880
Did you watch this past season of eastbound and down when he gets a,

664
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:17.790
he gets his kid a wolf,
see that or no?
No,
no he didn't.
It's so ridiculous.

665
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:22.320
You see that Brian?
Like he um,
uh,
what's his name?
Mcbride.

666
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.110
Kenny powers gets his kids a pet wolf

667
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.820
and like it just keeps it in the garage and he's like Jesus Christ.

668
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.350
And it's not like a big chain,
like a big,
like a chain fence is keeping it.

669
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.213
Oh my hat.

670
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.950
And it's just like salad and like I was growling at the kids and he was like,

671
00:38:38.951 --> 00:38:41.980
go feed it and they like have to throw meat at the,
at the wolf.

672
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.200
So that's a great show.
Yeah.
So I mean this is,

673
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.330
that's what he got.
So ridiculous.

674
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.340
<v 4>It seems legit debate.</v>

675
00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:01.220
It was a perfect gift for Toby.
My new high pay and television.
Y'All.

676
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:03.060
I'm not going to be around the house as much as I'd like to be.

677
00:39:03.061 --> 00:39:06.620
So it's very important that Toby has a strong male role models.

678
00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:11.560
The Spirit God
spirit count

679
00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.230
cause this opportunity off family's going to be taken care of forever.
Who knows?

680
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.720
Next stop to space camp.

681
00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:27.620
<v 2>It was so funny.
Funny.
It's such a good show.</v>

682
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:31.910
That dude is Goddamn hilarious.
Hysterical.
Did you see him?
And this is the end.

683
00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:33.890
Yes.
Holy Shit.
Is he good?

684
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:38.470
I mean that movie I ran into a um,
uh,

685
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:42.500
what the fuck's his name?
Craig Robinson the other night at the,
at the Improv.

686
00:39:42.501 --> 00:39:45.560
Who's in it where I was telling him I go,
dude,
that movie is so God damn funny.

687
00:39:45.561 --> 00:39:48.060
And you were so funny in it,
you know,
and uh,

688
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.590
we were talking about Kenny power scene.
Like when he comes in,
when he,

689
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.170
I mean like the movies outstanding and then he comes in and it just,

690
00:39:54.171 --> 00:39:56.780
the whole thing goes through this whole whole new level of craziness.

691
00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.890
He's hilarious.
This guy,
I love that character.

692
00:40:00.891 --> 00:40:04.820
Any powers of really cocky,
fucking complete idiot character,

693
00:40:04.821 --> 00:40:08.030
but just subtle enough of an idiot that like that kind of shit.

694
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.390
And I'm not going to be around a lot more than he has a strong role model.

695
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:16.250
It doesn't grow up to be a pansy.
He's,
he's such a buffoon.

696
00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:20.990
So fucking funny.
Those guy characters are really funny man.

697
00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.310
You're the best part about that character.

698
00:40:22.311 --> 00:40:27.230
I read interviews with him and like the other guys,
the uh,
the Jody hill,

699
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:30.320
I think Admin,
Ben,
I can't remember his name,
but they're like,

700
00:40:30.321 --> 00:40:32.990
all are behind this.
And they're saying like,
how,
you know,

701
00:40:32.991 --> 00:40:36.500
a lot of people appreciate the character and think it's funny for what it is.

702
00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:39.800
And then some people are big fans on another level where they're like,
yeah,

703
00:40:39.801 --> 00:40:42.740
he's right,
like came powers is,
that's how I think too.

704
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:47.150
Like they're that kind of fan where they're like,
fuck yeah man.

705
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.680
That's exactly how I am.
And that's,

706
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.720
we're fucking Americans who we are tired of this bullshit getting a wolf from my

707
00:40:53.721 --> 00:40:58.070
kid too.
Fucking bad ass shit,
Kenny.
Yeah,

708
00:40:58.071 --> 00:41:01.430
it's annoying if that dude's,
you're fucking neighbor.
But on TV,
they're awesome.

709
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.710
Awesome.
Yeah.
Fucking phenomenal.
It's,

710
00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:07.760
but it's almost better than a reality show because of a reality show.

711
00:41:07.761 --> 00:41:09.770
Like if you had a guy like Kenny powers to game reality show,

712
00:41:09.771 --> 00:41:12.290
he would become famous and he would get annoying.

713
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.920
Like essentially that's what you got with the duck dynasty people.

714
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:20.240
You've got a reality show where,
oh,
whoops,
you made someone famous.

715
00:41:20.241 --> 00:41:24.230
He's a fucking idiot and a homophobe and he will,
I don't get it.

716
00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.670
Why would a man choose a man's?
And they're not choosing dummy,
you know?

717
00:41:28.671 --> 00:41:30.200
But now this guys on TV,

718
00:41:30.201 --> 00:41:34.130
he's famous and then you look on Facebook and you've got these knuckle heads

719
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:37.670
with their fucking,
what about freedom of speech support?

720
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:41.330
Duck dynasty in the fort,
the Ma,
whatever memory is first amendment.

721
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.980
Then she didn't read the constitution.
Shut your hole.
And that's shown.

722
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:50.780
I'm amazed.
I mean I get that like stupid as fuck.
The fact that like that there,

723
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:51.320
you know,

724
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.840
you're following this family and you feel like this is how they really are.

725
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:59.150
It's all set up.
Like the show is like way over produced.

726
00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:02.710
So obvious guys,
AVN even that was creepy.

727
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.920
They're just hanging out at AVN like they have,
they have tech dynasty guys.

728
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.950
Duck beards.
Yeah.
It was really weird.

729
00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:14.180
And ABN warrants two words.
They were there like the weekend.

730
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.460
Why would they there?
Cause they,

731
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.800
that's the cool thing to do if you were the duck dynasty.

732
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:21.560
So they were there for the whole weekend doing press or no,

733
00:42:21.561 --> 00:42:25.010
they were just hanging out and they were at porn event.
So they're normal.

734
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.180
They're like watching people fuck good for them.
You know that,

735
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:29.950
but just not men's.

736
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:34.730
And Jesus is essentially like a Kenny powers in real life.

737
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.470
That's the problem with them in real life point.

738
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.420
So it's like having a guy like this in,
in the TV show eastbound and down.

739
00:42:41.421 --> 00:42:45.530
It's actually even better because it's so good.
It's better than a reality show.

740
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.400
A reality show.
You'd be making that asshole famous.
Right.

741
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.480
And there'd be people on Facebook.
I fucking agree with a man.
Yeah.

742
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.430
I'll support them.

743
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.640
Fucking support in the shit out of him and his right as an American.
Yeah.

744
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:03.010
You know these,
these ideas that,
what is this?
He says,

745
00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.920
will feral and Kenny powers and welfare owns a cardiac dealership.

746
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.330
It's like that.
It's the best fucking shit ever.
Is this a from eastbound down?

747
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:16.040
I need to watch that whole season,
man.
I really do.
But um,
yeah,

748
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:19.130
there's a lot of those people in real life and sometimes folks,

749
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.550
all they need is like one example like that.

750
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.410
And that'll little shift.

751
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.910
Like you could have people on the fence who are just thinking about like waking

752
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:31.210
up and going,
you know,
what do I care if someone's gay man?
What?
What?

753
00:43:31.211 --> 00:43:35.000
What is it in me that gets mad about these gates people and why?
Why?
Why do I,

754
00:43:35.001 --> 00:43:37.520
you know,
say they're going to burn in hell.
Maybe I should just fucking relax.

755
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.820
And then they see that guy on TV and they see he's been kicked off TV.

756
00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:44.880
You know what that Shit I'll fucking headed up to here with these queers,
Mike.

757
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:49.430
There's a tipping point where a guy like that I'm a television show and that,

758
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.460
that whole debate getting out there without any real rational response from

759
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:58.280
either the media,
from a and e from anybody.
No,

760
00:43:58.281 --> 00:44:00.620
no one liked gets on TV and says,
look,

761
00:44:00.621 --> 00:44:03.110
we're here to make a big statement about this.

762
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:07.430
This is what's wrong with this and this is why we have a problem with it,
okay?

763
00:44:07.431 --> 00:44:10.370
It's not about freedom of speech.
It's not about speaking your mind.

764
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:13.160
It's about what's on your mind,
man,
right?
What is on your mind,
your mind,

765
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:14.780
your mind is that they're going to burn in hell.

766
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.880
You're your mind is some fire and brimstone.

767
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:21.440
If someone is in love with another man and marries him,
you're an idiot,
okay?

768
00:44:21.441 --> 00:44:23.000
You're a dangerous idiot.
You,
you,

769
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:27.860
you're taking people that I know for a fact are born that way.
I'm no scientist,

770
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:32.220
but I know a gay kid in my neighborhood.
He's five [inaudible].
He's fucking

771
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.520
<v 0>gay,
okay?
There's nothing wrong with that,
but he's gay.
This kid's gay.</v>

772
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:37.080
His parents were trying to get him to play football.

773
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.790
He doesn't want to have nothing to do with football.

774
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:42.900
He's always dressing up in dresses.
He puts girls clothes on.
He plays with dolls.

775
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:46.560
He's a gay kid,
okay?
He,
he,
he likes boys.

776
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:50.160
It's the weirdest thing to see from the jump,

777
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.660
but his parents were very supportive,
you know what I mean?
They,

778
00:44:52.661 --> 00:44:54.660
they wanted them to try boy things.
He's not really into it,

779
00:44:54.661 --> 00:44:57.090
but there's no hate going on,
so he's going to be okay.

780
00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:59.790
Devin tried beating Madigan yet.
No,
but what,

781
00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:04.070
what happens if a kid like that is watching television and he realizes that he's

782
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:04.711
gay and you know,

783
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:08.730
maybe he's 12 or 13 he just thinking about sex and he's watching this and he

784
00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:11.250
feels horrible about himself,
which he probably does.

785
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.800
Cause that definitely happened.
You know?

786
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:16.530
Right over nothing or something he can't control over something he's born with.

787
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:17.640
That's why it's dangerous.

788
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.300
It's just as dangerous as being critical about people for a bunch of other

789
00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:23.850
things they can't control.
It's just as dangerous as being racist.

790
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.260
People don't understand that.
They don't see it that way.
But a person,

791
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:29.400
I don't know why anybody would want to choose.

792
00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:32.740
I hang out with a black man over hanging out with a white man.
Yeah.

793
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.090
I mean I just don't get it.
There's more there.
That's the same statement.

794
00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:40.680
It's the same statement really is.
There's no difference,
man.
That's the parallel

795
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:42.530
<v 1>when people talk about like,
Oh,
you know,</v>

796
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:47.630
you're not the same thing you've been through and are like comparing the civil

797
00:45:47.631 --> 00:45:50.310
rights movement to this,
but like what you're,

798
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:52.910
the thing that's similar is that you're just,

799
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.280
you're trying to put down and isolate a group of people for something that they

800
00:45:58.281 --> 00:46:01.280
can't control because you don't want any part of that.

801
00:46:01.281 --> 00:46:04.710
So that's the parallel is that,
you know,
whether it's a,

802
00:46:04.711 --> 00:46:07.580
you don't want to hang around or are you want to put down black people or Asian

803
00:46:07.581 --> 00:46:08.810
people or whoever it may be.

804
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.620
That's the same thing as putting down somebody and not wanting them to have the

805
00:46:12.621 --> 00:46:16.460
rights just because they were born with a certain sexual orientation.

806
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:17.500
<v 0>That's the parallel.
Well,</v>

807
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.310
people don't want anyone to make the comparisons to civil rights.

808
00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:23.980
They don't want anyone to be able to cause then they're like,
oh,

809
00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:26.050
we really are wrong.
Well,
no,
because,
no,

810
00:46:26.051 --> 00:46:28.900
because what I'm saying is people like civil rights,

811
00:46:28.901 --> 00:46:32.620
people don't like it because they feel that it's somehow or another diminishes

812
00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:34.870
the,
the,
the horrors of slavery.
Right?

813
00:46:34.871 --> 00:46:38.380
Like there's an issue that people have with like comparing something to racism,

814
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.830
you know,

815
00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:43.780
and black people in particular have an issue with gay people comparing

816
00:46:43.781 --> 00:46:48.580
themselves and the plight of Gay Americans to racism.
They,
I've seen it,

817
00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:51.490
I've heard people like scream and yell about it,

818
00:46:51.491 --> 00:46:55.150
about it's not the same and fuck you and you know,
and then,
yeah.
And Gay,

819
00:46:55.151 --> 00:46:56.590
some people gay is a choice.

820
00:46:56.591 --> 00:47:01.510
I've seen a lot of weirdness almost as if they're worried that it somehow or

821
00:47:01.511 --> 00:47:04.960
another diminishes what's horrible about slavery,
which is ridiculous.

822
00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:09.370
Slavery was horrible.
Still is.
Racism was horrible.
Still is,

823
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:12.570
but so's homophobia.
That's just as horrible.
Yeah.

824
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:16.510
Like the people that think it's not,
it's just because you're not gay.

825
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:17.590
It's that simple.

826
00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:21.070
If that was who you are and people were angry about who you are,

827
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:25.090
it would be just as bad as you being born Chinese and people hate Chinese people

828
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.400
and you're like,
what the fuck?
Man,
I didn't do anything.

829
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.980
You hate me because of the way I was.
Yeah.
It's the

830
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.120
<v 2>same goddamn thing,
you know.
And the idea is Whoa,
yeah,</v>

831
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.970
well nobody ever owned gay people,
but they killed them.

832
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:38.440
It's in the Bible.

833
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.740
It's in the Bible that you should be put to death for lying with another man.

834
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.260
You don't think that they'd been persecuted.
It's,
it's,

835
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:48.520
there's a hundred different religions where it's illegal or against their rules

836
00:47:48.521 --> 00:47:49.760
to be gay.
Yeah.

837
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:54.760
You could start with being with Islam and work your way up through a bunch of

838
00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:55.570
other different,
well there's,

839
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:59.320
there's countries that don't even again in fucking Russia.

840
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:02.580
Russia's that's insane that Russia is a,

841
00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.400
did you see for these discriminatory laws against gay people?
They do.
And they,

842
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:06.850
um,

843
00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:11.710
the Putin came out cause we were about to have the winter Olympics there and

844
00:48:11.711 --> 00:48:14.830
said that like gay athletes have nothing to worry about.

845
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:17.350
Like they're not going to be discriminated against when they're in the,

846
00:48:17.351 --> 00:48:21.550
in Russia for the Winter Olympics.
But,
um,
you know,

847
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:25.510
like rules still apply where like you're,
you're the,

848
00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:29.200
you're not supposed to be talking about it to anybody and giving your opinions

849
00:48:29.201 --> 00:48:32.440
on,
so like,
we're not going to do anything to you because you're getting,

850
00:48:32.441 --> 00:48:34.840
you're here,
but don't be talking about it.
Yeah.

851
00:48:34.841 --> 00:48:38.560
And stay away from kids and stay away from kids,
which was the most,
yeah,

852
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:43.750
that was the crime.
That's the part that I feel that's how big,
whoa.
Big.
Whoa.

853
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:44.890
Yeah.
I mean,
look,

854
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:50.110
they are fostering an environment of hate and fear and we should look at that

855
00:48:50.111 --> 00:48:54.370
very carefully as,
as people that understand human nature.
Okay.

856
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:59.470
Let's look at what you would want if you were trying to dominate a nation and

857
00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:01.750
control it in a sort of a dictatorship perform,

858
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.690
which is essentially what Putin's got going on there.
Yeah.
Call Him.

859
00:49:05.691 --> 00:49:07.300
He say he was voted in,

860
00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:10.360
or what if the guy's not going anywhere for you get voted out,
you know?
I mean,

861
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.620
he left his term,

862
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:15.100
put in someone who worked for him and then took over again after that guy has

863
00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:18.670
gotten me,
he's running Russia.
Yeah,
definitely.
The way to run,

864
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.950
the way to be a dictator and the way to run an empire.

865
00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:23.140
It's through fear to control and fear.

866
00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:26.860
And as many enemies as you have that you have to protect the people from the

867
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:27.520
better.

868
00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:32.470
And so one of the things that dictators do is they start pushing people against

869
00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:33.280
other people.

870
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.330
If you can get people to be inter conflicted amongst the ranks of the normal

871
00:49:37.331 --> 00:49:40.000
civilians,
you can guarantee that they're going to be busy,

872
00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:41.530
they're going to have conflict,

873
00:49:41.531 --> 00:49:45.730
they're not going to be able to deal with taxes or the rules or the military

874
00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.260
choices the military is making.

875
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.160
They're so busy with their own shit worried about these people going after this

876
00:49:51.161 --> 00:49:54.190
group and this ethnic group going after that group and you know,

877
00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:58.090
the gays were going to touch their kids.
I mean there's,
and then,
you know,

878
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:03.160
fostering violence against gay people is going to foster anger from gay people

879
00:50:03.161 --> 00:50:04.200
and straight people.
I mean,

880
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.800
there's a blowback on both sides and they get you guarantee conflict.

881
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:11.440
It's so,
it's so,
uh,
your guarantees is that kind of like,

882
00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:14.530
it's so crazy outrageous to,
you know,

883
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.120
suggest or imply that gays will want children,

884
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.940
you know,
like the idea that someone is trolling.
Yeah.

885
00:50:21.941 --> 00:50:26.170
Like the idea that they're not,
uh,
you know,
adults with natural,
you know,

886
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.210
sexual just happens

887
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.080
<v 1>to be through a different group,</v>

888
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:35.081
but that they would be not be able to control themselves and be attracted to it.

889
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:38.990
So,
so crazy.
It's so crazy and so stupid.

890
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:42.490
I think a thing by the way about like,
why you,
uh,

891
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:47.560
you say black people sometimes get 'em more fired up about the comparison is in

892
00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:51.710
my experience,
a lot of,
uh,

893
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.760
black people that come from like really Christian homes,

894
00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:01.580
view of their,
their Mo more intolerant towards gay people.

895
00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:05.180
A lot of times the ones who come from really Christian homes.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

896
00:51:05.181 --> 00:51:05.931
There's a lot of that.
Well,

897
00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:09.350
that's what happened with proposition eight in California.
I mean,

898
00:51:09.351 --> 00:51:14.180
that was a real embarrassment where they repealed gay people's right to,
to,

899
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.990
to marry,

900
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.320
and those was an embarrassment and a disproportionate amount of black people

901
00:51:18.321 --> 00:51:22.610
voted for that.
Yeah.
It was a weird number.
It was like over 50%.

902
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.830
But I think even like outside of the Christian homes,
you would find a,

903
00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:29.280
I think in a lot,
a lot of cases,
a more,
uh,

904
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:34.520
homophobia in the black community.
I think it exists more.
That's so weird.
Yeah,

905
00:51:34.521 --> 00:51:39.410
I do.
I think it does.
How much black worker you've done.
I'm done very,

906
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.970
I can dance,
I can do a lot of things.
Um,
I'm saying that like,

907
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.740
you know what,
I get black people are 13% of our population.
And what I'm,

908
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:53.600
all I'm saying is that I think a bigger percentage of the population is home.

909
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:58.430
I'm getting it from just having spoken and been exposed to a lot of,
uh,

910
00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.510
black people.
What's amazing,
apparently a lot of these,
uh,

911
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.260
African American churches were,
uh,

912
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:09.170
they're the organized drives to vote against proposition eight.

913
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.390
But it was upsetting that like the,
the,

914
00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:15.700
the church community is bigger in black culture.
Like going to the,

915
00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:18.230
that's a bigger thing.
And I think that,

916
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:23.590
that they're pretty openly most of the time saying that it's bad that you know,

917
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.160
gays are bad.

918
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.520
So I think that that kind of breeds that homophobia more in that community.

919
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:34.820
I'm not saying that all black people are homophobic or that they're all

920
00:52:34.821 --> 00:52:36.740
preaching that and all doing that.

921
00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:41.150
I'm saying that I think that exists more in that culture,
in that community.

922
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:46.430
That's interesting.
Um,
there's a,
there's not just that,

923
00:52:46.431 --> 00:52:51.230
but Mormons also spent a lot of money.
Mormons very much.
I mean,

924
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:55.310
I think a lot of people who have given the credit to the Mormons for defeating

925
00:52:55.311 --> 00:52:58.970
that eight,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well they put a lot of money until recently.
Yeah.

926
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:03.890
Which is,
I had a joke about it and,
uh,
talking monkey's in space.
Oh yeah.
About,

927
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:04.640
about,
um,

928
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.820
the Mormon should be afraid of gay people because if you sell him enough to be a

929
00:53:07.821 --> 00:53:10.400
Mormon,
yeah.
That was really nice.

930
00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:12.470
Someone could talk to you to be in the Mormon and they can talk you into soccer

931
00:53:12.471 --> 00:53:13.840
their day.
Yeah.
It's just,

932
00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.560
it's just a matter of how much time they spend with you and then you break down

933
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:23.180
the whole hit.
You know,
what Mormonism is like,

934
00:53:23.181 --> 00:53:26.100
which is like,
right,
isn't it?
The guy was like,
no,
I got

935
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.430
<v 2>all the rules they gave him to me.
But you know what's interesting is that this,</v>

936
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:33.120
um,
this also becomes another point of contention because now,

937
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:38.340
now black people are being persecuted by gay people,
right?

938
00:53:38.341 --> 00:53:41.340
I mean it puts this weird thing,
it's not another battle taking place.

939
00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:46.830
I don't believe in those kinds of conspiracies necessarily that like the whole

940
00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:51.420
social structure of this country's organized keep people poor.

941
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:53.700
So there's conflict and key people rich.

942
00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:56.580
So they keep voting for corporations and they want to protect their wealth.

943
00:53:56.581 --> 00:53:58.290
And this is and keep the,
the,
the,

944
00:53:58.291 --> 00:54:01.040
the divide between the two and every now and then,
you know,

945
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.250
organized chaos in a way that we were sort of kind of hinting that maybe Putin

946
00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:07.980
or someone does.
But if you're going to do it,
this is the way to do it.

947
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:12.330
The way to do it is to take like what's you ordinarily like liberals,
okay,

948
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:15.780
let's let's break down liberals.
Liberals like left wing,

949
00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.320
they are almost always voting pro minority.

950
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:22.680
They vote pro minority and almost always pro gay rights.

951
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:26.010
So what better to separate that mess.
And,
and,

952
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.840
and cause confusion amongst the ranks.

953
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:30.120
It's to get those two factors on your enemy,

954
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:34.830
these two like static constant factors and have them Duke it out,
right?

955
00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:38.790
So now you have people who support gay rights and people that support,
you know,

956
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:42.500
the,
the idea that gay should be married duking it out with,

957
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.070
with black people,

958
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:49.430
with minorities and Christian minorities who almost universally vote democratic.

959
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:54.110
So it's like Whoa,
you would,
that's a tricky thing you did there.
Oh right.

960
00:54:54.111 --> 00:54:57.510
Cause by causing trouble between those groups of people,

961
00:54:57.511 --> 00:55:01.530
you essentially weekend the entire Party.
And that's what happens if you,

962
00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:06.150
if you connect black people and gay people that black people keep gay people

963
00:55:06.151 --> 00:55:09.960
from voting,
the whole left wing becomes a fucking mess.
Right?

964
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.310
Comes cap because white guilt runs rampant through,

965
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.120
through the left,
like through like Democrats.
Like there's so many,

966
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:23.040
especially educated Democrats who are filled with white guilt and they don't

967
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:26.640
want to come down on black people and they don't want to come down on black

968
00:55:26.641 --> 00:55:29.280
people.
Even for something as heinous as proposition eight,

969
00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:33.870
proposition eight was being supported by a bunch of church going white people,

970
00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:36.560
much more like if it was being read,
you know,

971
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.980
strictly by Baptist but white baptists and there was all these white baptist

972
00:55:40.981 --> 00:55:41.850
leaders on TV talk.

973
00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:45.630
You would marginalize them as fools is buffoons they would joke about them,

974
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.730
but people weren't doing that about black people.

975
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:52.740
It was this weird sort of like touchy subject.
Tough to do.
You know,

976
00:55:52.741 --> 00:55:56.890
you didn't see people mocking all these black people like it,

977
00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:00.570
whether it's on the daily show or whether it's on any of these left wing

978
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:02.960
websites weren't mocking black people for,

979
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:06.150
for the majority of them voting for this.
Right?
Yeah.
You didn't,

980
00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:09.000
you didn't see that.
No.
It's,
it's true.
The whole,
the whole thing.

981
00:56:09.001 --> 00:56:13.470
It gets very tricky.
Yeah.
There's,
um,
it's interesting to like,
uh,
you know,

982
00:56:13.471 --> 00:56:18.210
the big thing now is for the last few years,
people trying to figure out,

983
00:56:18.211 --> 00:56:22.460
you know,
how the Republican party can,
um,

984
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.370
really compete again

985
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:28.630
<v 1>when the,
uh,
when the White House and when certain other elections in,</v>

986
00:56:28.631 --> 00:56:33.040
one of the things that keeps being brought up is that the younger,
there's,

987
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:37.270
there's certain like,
um,
constants right among the left and the right,

988
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.370
like if you go abortion,
like,
you know,

989
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:43.240
he's pro life was approached with and when with the,

990
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:48.250
the gay thing is that the far right won't let you know,

991
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.470
support that,
right.
They're not going to support it.

992
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:55.780
But the younger generation of new voters,
even ones who are conservative,

993
00:56:55.781 --> 00:56:57.010
have conservative values,

994
00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:02.160
grew up in a world where it's more like welcoming to the gay community and,

995
00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:07.960
and they're,
they're not necessarily like moderate ones can be.

996
00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:10.810
I tell you,
you're always going to try to win over,
right.

997
00:57:10.811 --> 00:57:12.640
Somebody who can kind of not an extremist,

998
00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:17.590
they're leaning left now younger voters because of some of these extreme

999
00:57:17.591 --> 00:57:20.620
constants.
And so it's like if the,
if that party,

1000
00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.680
the right could embrace something like that,

1001
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.490
would that even the playing field for them?
I think if most certainly.
Yeah.

1002
00:57:27.491 --> 00:57:32.040
And would they then be able to compete more for these maybe younger voters that

1003
00:57:32.041 --> 00:57:36.460
you know,
the more open minded young people who feel like that's a basic,
right.

1004
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:38.410
It's kind of an interesting way to look at it.

1005
00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:39.880
Like if you change your position on that,

1006
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:43.090
do you then get somebody who you want elected,

1007
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:47.260
you'll get a lot of the no nonsense people that just happened to vote left

1008
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:50.880
because of social issues.
Right.
You would get those and that's,

1009
00:57:50.881 --> 00:57:52.180
that's a pretty substantial number.

1010
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:56.050
70% of black people voted in favor for proposition eight.

1011
00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:01.480
70% of people of black people voted that gay people shouldn't be allowed to be

1012
00:58:01.481 --> 00:58:05.890
married and that they should take that right away from them.
That's incredible.

1013
00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:10.420
That's incredible.
That's fucking gross.
That's gross and terrifying.

1014
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:14.590
It's funny cause I'm reading an article on Huffington Post,

1015
00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:17.770
stop blaming California's black voters for proposition eight.

1016
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:21.310
That's what it says.
Yeah.
Okay.
Don't blame them because it's,

1017
00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:22.810
a lot of other people voted for it as well.

1018
00:58:22.811 --> 00:58:25.330
But if you don't think that it's embarrassing and gross,

1019
00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:30.690
that 70% of black people voted for some silly law that takes away the right for

1020
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:35.880
people that are in love to get married.
I think maybe it is,
because if,

1021
00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:39.940
I mean obviously it's religious,
that's the big thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a,

1022
00:58:39.941 --> 00:58:40.774
that's the big thing.

1023
00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:42.970
Maybe it's like black dudes just don't want to get married at all.

1024
00:58:42.971 --> 00:58:44.710
They were like,
man,
fuck this.
No one's getting married.

1025
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.510
Let's stop it with the gay people.
If I have less of them get married,

1026
00:58:48.511 --> 00:58:52.120
unless the US have to get married.
And I got the black agenda.
Marriage man,

1027
00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:55.990
tired of divorce.
I don't know.
It's uh,
it's just,

1028
00:58:55.991 --> 00:58:59.770
it's just how people are raised.
I think all of those.
Yeah.
And I mean that's,

1029
00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:04.720
people change later on in life.
You know,
you're young,
you think a certain way.

1030
00:59:04.721 --> 00:59:06.460
And then if,
uh,
you know,

1031
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:10.570
some of those people will be converted to thinking differently with time,

1032
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:14.680
but you know,
anybody,
you can have your own ideas in this life.

1033
00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:17.620
You can have your own thoughts and you can have your own unique point of view.

1034
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:22.220
The real problem is when your ideas start fucking with other people's

1035
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.390
<v 2>lives for no reason.</v>

1036
00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:28.580
When your ideas are based on just some shit that you believe that's 2000 plus

1037
00:59:31.191 --> 00:59:35.900
years old,
that notebook,
if you want to believe like the gay thing in the Bible,

1038
00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:36.351
man,

1039
00:59:36.351 --> 00:59:39.590
you're really cherry picking because there's a lot of other shit in there too.

1040
00:59:39.591 --> 00:59:40.670
Along with gay people,

1041
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:43.250
like you're not supposed to wear two different types of clothes,

1042
00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.690
like you're not supposed to wear like silk and cotton.
That's like punishable by,

1043
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:51.590
you know,
it was sins upon your life or smash your hand with the rocks.

1044
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:55.970
I mean there's some,
some great old sayings that they uh,

1045
00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.100
used to say,
but one of them is like,

1046
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:02.420
you threatened with death if you rent your clothes,
if you tear your clothes.

1047
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.630
So like people who have like holes where their needs are and shit like that.

1048
01:00:05.631 --> 01:00:08.180
Fashion in the Bible,
you're supposed to die for that.

1049
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.850
He's supposed to be put to death for that.
You know,

1050
01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:12.920
there's some neighborhoods we could really wipe out,
right?

1051
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.640
Go in there and clean house.
They're gone.
Silver Lake.
Yeah.
Several.

1052
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.510
Craig doesn't do that anymore.
Or they have a new fashion.
Yeah,

1053
01:00:20.511 --> 01:00:23.960
there are cardigans now,
right?
Oh Shit.
Maybe they like all hipsters.

1054
01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:28.850
Here's 19 things the Bible for forbids,
uh,
other than homosexuality.

1055
01:00:28.851 --> 01:00:32.720
I put this on Twitter the other day cause it's just,
it's so fucking silly.

1056
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.730
Here's the exact quote in Leviticus.
Uncover not your heads.

1057
01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.730
Neither render your closed yet he die.

1058
01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.170
And lest wrath come upon all the people.
Okay?
So if you,

1059
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.640
if you don't uncovered not your head's,
which means don't uncover your head,

1060
01:00:49.641 --> 01:00:53.150
keep your head covered.
Got It.
Okay.
If you don't keep your head covered,

1061
01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:56.630
that means you're going to die.
And wrath will come upon all the people.

1062
01:00:56.631 --> 01:01:00.980
So everyone not wearing a hat,
you fucked us up.
Magic.

1063
01:01:00.981 --> 01:01:04.550
If that was the key that all we had to do was all wear hats and God was like,

1064
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:09.290
good,
good.
Peace on earth.
Love hats.
I wrote that shit down a long time ago.

1065
01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:12.140
You motherfuckers didn't lizard.
Everyone's caught up in this gay shit.

1066
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:17.450
I want hats.
I want fucking everyone wearing a hat.
Wear a hat by God.

1067
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.720
God's orders are where?
Kangols I got stock in that company.

1068
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:23.310
It's like God's hair net.
Like if you work at the restaurant,

1069
01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:24.870
you have to wear a hair net.
I don't want to see.
Yes.

1070
01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.730
God's like you don't wear enhance.
You fuck.
Make a soup over here,
man.

1071
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.880
Make no mistake,
folks.
I'm not.
I'm not.
This is how I'm paraphrasing.

1072
01:01:31.881 --> 01:01:34.820
I'm directly quoting this from the English translation of the Bible.

1073
01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:39.770
Uncover not your heads.
Jesus.
Maybe it meant your their head.
Yeah.
Maybe.

1074
01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:43.970
Maybe keeps your Dick covered,
but they didn't call that a head back then.

1075
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:48.990
They called it a mushroom cap.
They thought it was a mushroom.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1076
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:50.540
You're not supposed to trim your beard by the way.

1077
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.990
Neither shout out mar the corners of thy beard.

1078
01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:57.740
Oh,
how come they're not going crazy about that

1079
01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:04.580
is clearly shaving his beard test will come upon us.

1080
01:02:04.671 --> 01:02:08.510
It's not convenient.
So fucking stupid.
You know what's even more stupid?

1081
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:13.160
Really religious people with religious tattoos because that's in the Bible.

1082
01:02:13.161 --> 01:02:15.620
Do fuck face.
You're not supposed to get tattoos.

1083
01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:20.370
You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor

1084
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:24.690
<v 0>print any marks upon you.
I am the Lord cuts in your flesh for the dead.</v>

1085
01:02:24.691 --> 01:02:26.670
Like instead of like,
like marking,

1086
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:30.780
like you have a picture of your mom like Eddie Bravo has got a Kat von d did a

1087
01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:33.450
tattoo of his grandma on his chest.
It's beautiful.

1088
01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:37.800
It reminds him of his grandma against the Bible death.
Yeah,
man,

1089
01:02:37.801 --> 01:02:39.810
you're not supposed to.
I mean,
that's essentially what it is.

1090
01:02:39.811 --> 01:02:42.810
Your print something on you.
So if we tend to follow it,

1091
01:02:42.811 --> 01:02:44.220
all the rules of the Bible,

1092
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:48.000
it would just be like a murderous rampage constantly.

1093
01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:52.140
We would be so lottery,
everyone would be fucked.
Well,

1094
01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:56.130
how about every Catholic would go,
would burn at the stake.
Okay.

1095
01:02:56.131 --> 01:02:59.640
You would all die in hell because you're not supposed to drink wine in church,

1096
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.200
right?
You're not.
You're not supposed to do that.
Let's says in the Bible.

1097
01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:08.550
Leviticus ten nine do not drink wine nor strong drink.

1098
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:14.240
Though it was a weird nor thy sons were with the,

1099
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:19.830
when you go into the Tabernacle of the congregation,
lest ye die.

1100
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.800
Okay?
So what that means is that you drink wine in church die.

1101
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:26.010
But everybody drinks wine in church,
part of the holy sacraments there.

1102
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:28.650
Even a quote that he said like,
I don't even want you to make a church.

1103
01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:33.390
I'd rather,
yes,
well that was Jesus.
See the Jesus stuff is very much different.

1104
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:37.950
The Jesus stuff you gotta get your piss on the Jesus stuff is very different

1105
01:03:37.951 --> 01:03:42.240
because Jesus and most of like what a lot of people quote about that is all from

1106
01:03:42.241 --> 01:03:46.080
the New Testament and the new testament is even sketchier than the old
testament.

1107
01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.640
The Old Testament is sketchy because it was originally written in ancient Hebrew

1108
01:03:50.641 --> 01:03:54.630
and the oldest versions of some of these stories are actually the Dead Sea

1109
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.340
Scrolls,
which are written in Aramaic.

1110
01:03:56.730 --> 01:04:00.960
And they're actually on animal skins that they found an area of Israel called

1111
01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:05.010
Qumran.
And they found these clay pots and inside these clay pots,

1112
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:07.860
they found these ancient ancient scrolls.

1113
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:11.400
And some of them are so fucked up that they have to piece them together with

1114
01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:13.040
like tweezers and they have to,

1115
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:16.770
and they've spent years and years and years and years to ciphering these things,

1116
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:20.640
man.
And you know,
you can see them online.
Actually,
they have photos.
Let me see.

1117
01:04:20.641 --> 01:04:22.890
I think there's a website.
Dead Sea Scrolls online,

1118
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:29.870
but that's the only version of the Bible that's in Aramaic.

1119
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.460
Yeah.
Dead Sea Scrolls online.
It's actually D,
s s.
Um,

1120
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:40.440
the website is d e s s.
Dot.
collections.img.org.

1121
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.300
Just look up Dead Sea Scrolls online and new address.
Yeah,

1122
01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:48.120
the Chits we're doing well,
it's some academic,
but you can read these scrolls,

1123
01:04:48.121 --> 01:04:49.620
like click on each one,
Brian,

1124
01:04:49.621 --> 01:04:54.330
and you can actually get an image of the actual scroll itself.
And,

1125
01:04:54.331 --> 01:04:58.560
uh,
all that stuff's on animal skins.
So this is an Aramaic,

1126
01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:01.950
which is the only version of the Bible I think that they know of.

1127
01:05:01.951 --> 01:05:04.710
That's in Aramaic.
So all this shit that we're,
uh,

1128
01:05:04.711 --> 01:05:08.020
we're reading here is the stuff that's from,
uh,

1129
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.020
essentially the oldest stories of the Bible.

1130
01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.370
The New Testament was actually commissioned by Constantine.

1131
01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:18.060
There's like Roman Emperor Constantine,
big chunks missing from,

1132
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:21.310
<v 2>it's like,
so there,
it could be like a word that says don't instead of do it.</v>

1133
01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:24.100
You know what I mean?
Like,
well it's,
it's,
it's clearly,
you know,

1134
01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:25.150
they don't have the full work,

1135
01:05:25.151 --> 01:05:27.790
but it's pretty amazing that they even have that because you know,

1136
01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:31.360
this is thousands and thousands and thousands of years old and it's made out of

1137
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:35.680
an animal skin.
I mean,
it's really pretty incredible that it exists at all.

1138
01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.680
I mean,
even if it's only pieces of it,

1139
01:05:38.681 --> 01:05:41.440
but it's so cool that they found that shit in clay pots.

1140
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:47.100
And these of course were stories that were told in like an oral tradition for a

1141
01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:50.050
thousand years before anybody figured out how to write them down.

1142
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:53.080
But then you're dealing with the new testament,

1143
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:56.200
which was Constantine and a bunch of bishops put together.

1144
01:05:56.201 --> 01:06:00.190
So it's much more recent and they actually know who the people were who put it

1145
01:06:00.191 --> 01:06:04.690
together.
And it was all like way after Jesus was dead.
Isn't that crazy though?

1146
01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:09.310
When you think about like when you really stop and think about the fact that

1147
01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:13.420
like some dudes putting this,
wrote this down and not just some dudes,

1148
01:06:13.421 --> 01:06:17.890
but an emperor who clearly wanted to convert all of his people to Christianity

1149
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:19.540
to control them,
but that we still are like,

1150
01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:21.670
well this is this thing we got to follow up.
Well,

1151
01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:25.300
the Dude Constantine didn't even get baptized until like right before he died.

1152
01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.490
Like,
you know,
I mean,
I think,
you know,

1153
01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:30.730
he had to get baptized so that the next people could say,
no,
no,
no,
we,
we got him.

1154
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:33.040
He's good.
You know,
stay Christian.
Everyone stays Christian.

1155
01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.120
Cause if he dies and he's not baptized,

1156
01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:37.990
you have to admit to the entire world that this guy,
you know,

1157
01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.090
somehow or another is going to hell.

1158
01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:44.270
The guy who converted everybody to Christianity ran the runway,

1159
01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:46.270
Roman Empire that way.
And yeah,

1160
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:49.000
hired all these bishops to put together the Bible.

1161
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.890
That's where the new test of it comes from.

1162
01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.380
So when you're dealing with the new testament you're dealing with and even

1163
01:06:53.381 --> 01:06:56.810
squirrely or piece of work because it's like the what?

1164
01:06:56.890 --> 01:06:59.530
Dubious fucking origins.
Like you're telling me,

1165
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:01.810
Constantine's got a direct line to God,

1166
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:06.370
some murderous Roman Empire guy.
He's got a direct line to God,

1167
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:08.920
bitch,
can I just get the fuck Outta here?

1168
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:14.320
The oldest oldest shit is ridiculous.
The newer,
older shit is ridiculous.

1169
01:07:14.410 --> 01:07:18.160
Yeah.
If there was no bible at all,
man,
somebody would try to make one up.

1170
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.680
Of course,
some,
some do.
It would be a right now.
Right?
You ever think about,

1171
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:26.130
you know how every year or a few years of a story will come about where a guy's

1172
01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:30.880
like,
I'm Christ like Jesus Christ,
I'm bad.
Yeah.
And then,
you know,
whatever,

1173
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:35.390
he'll fucking die in a shoot out or some shit or get arrested.
Uh,

1174
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.430
do you ever think about the fact that like 2000 years ago somebody had been
like,

1175
01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:42.070
I am God and that that's that guy.

1176
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.560
It's just that happened long ago and nothing happened to him.

1177
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.570
Of course if you just,
if you're just really good at it,

1178
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.380
you could dominate a huge group of people and by the way,

1179
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:53.770
you could also have some really cool shit to say as well as being a fucking nut.

1180
01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.890
You know,
like Depok show,
Bruh.
Like Depok shopper.

1181
01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:01.120
We were talking about him on Ona.
Yeah.
He's got some really cool shit to say.

1182
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:04.030
He's a silly man.
He says a lot of silly shit like,
ah.

1183
01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.370
I used to be an atheist until I realized I was God.

1184
01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.000
That was one of his quotes because we're all God.

1185
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.190
It's not that kind of what the fuck ever shut up.
You're not God.
You know,

1186
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:14.110
it turns the water into wine,
but Joe didn't do it.

1187
01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:17.900
You shut your mouth and we're all God.
Yeah,
I get it.
That's silly.

1188
01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:21.140
Shut your mouth.
Don't say shit like that.
It's stupid.

1189
01:08:21.141 --> 01:08:22.190
It makes people marginalize.

1190
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:25.690
You marginalizes the whole idea of universal consciousness when you talk and

1191
01:08:25.691 --> 01:08:30.410
such fucking vague and silly terms.
Joseph,
oh,
we're all God.
Oh,
please go on.

1192
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:34.490
Go on with your Gucci Sunglasses theory.
You are God though,
if that was true.

1193
01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:39.320
Well as simulation theory.
No,
you're a part of a program.
Um,
and you are,

1194
01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:41.990
you're running this program somehow or another in the background.

1195
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:44.270
That's the simulation theory is not that you're,

1196
01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:46.040
you were ticking off the secret more.

1197
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:48.500
You're thinking instead of simulation theory.

1198
01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:52.820
You think that of the power of suggestion or the power of positive thinking or

1199
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.133
the idea,

1200
01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.320
I was thinking of me somewhere in the future that I sitting there watching

1201
01:08:57.321 --> 01:08:59.880
myself sleep or you know,
like I,

1202
01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:03.860
I'm the one that started the program and I'm kind of playing a game right now.

1203
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.810
If my of me right here,
you know what I mean?

1204
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:09.980
Think anybody thinks that I think that,
that you created this whole thing.

1205
01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:11.210
I think that's somewhere in the future.

1206
01:09:11.211 --> 01:09:14.140
I'm sitting here doing a simulation of myself.
Well,

1207
01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:16.220
I don't think people think that they created it.

1208
01:09:16.221 --> 01:09:19.280
I think most people think that it's just something that's running that you're a

1209
01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:23.030
part of.
Right?
But if you think that you actually created itself,
you know,

1210
01:09:23.031 --> 01:09:24.650
why don't you know how to create anything now?

1211
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.630
Like how can we not like a computer programmer?

1212
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:29.510
You lost all that knowledge in the simulation?
No.

1213
01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:32.540
Cause this me is just a program.
So the you,

1214
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:35.620
it's like you can marginalize yourself and your computer program.

1215
01:09:35.621 --> 01:09:38.810
So it can be like some super genius who knows all and say I am going to give

1216
01:09:38.811 --> 01:09:42.330
myself limited knowledge and information and there's lots of good realistic

1217
01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:45.980
simulation as a,
as a goof to make life more difficult.

1218
01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:50.980
I'm going to make myself really dumb and lazy and I'm gonna give myself a club

1219
01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:55.010
foot and I'm going to give myself a one hand that works.

1220
01:09:55.011 --> 01:09:59.570
In other hand it's like semi paralyzed from birth.
Like it's so crazy like that.

1221
01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:00.471
We're all doing it.

1222
01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:03.410
We're all creating our own universe and just some people that are really shitty

1223
01:10:03.411 --> 01:10:06.470
job of designing themselves now that's just to make it look realistic.

1224
01:10:06.471 --> 01:10:08.420
You have to have like leg people around there.
Okay,

1225
01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:12.530
so they're not you so they're not real.
That's Melissa Etheridge type thing.

1226
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.940
Is that what she,
Melissa Etheridge says that she gets on an airplane.

1227
01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.280
She's a really happy for all the other people on the airplane because she knows

1228
01:10:20.281 --> 01:10:21.410
that an airplane not gonna Crash.

1229
01:10:21.411 --> 01:10:25.280
Cause she's on it cause she's a sort of creating her world.
That's awesome.

1230
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:29.300
The power of suggestion.
Really,
really proud of her.
What about,

1231
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:32.950
well maybe she's right.
You know,
here's,
here's the thing.
It's so,

1232
01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:36.770
it's so easy to goof on her or anybody who thinks that way,

1233
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:39.950
but we can't prove that that's not the case.
You can't,
we can't,

1234
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.010
we can't prove what,
uh,

1235
01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:46.190
what kind of power your consciousness has over the world itself.

1236
01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:50.630
We assume there's a lot of random factors that come into play in life,

1237
01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:55.840
whether it's with car accidents or meteor impacts or disease,

1238
01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:00.290
you name,
name,
name it,
fill in,
fill in the blank.
But we don't know that.

1239
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.660
And there's a lot of things about being a person that are very strange.

1240
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.500
There's a lot of things about our interactions with each other,
about energy,

1241
01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:13.100
about the,
the amount of energy you put out and what you get back,

1242
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.070
the way you interact

1243
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.731
<v 0>with humans.</v>

1244
01:11:14.731 --> 01:11:19.680
And how do we not know that those things in some way or another,

1245
01:11:19.681 --> 01:11:21.840
the way you interact with people,
flavor,

1246
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.090
not just your relationships with those people,

1247
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.130
but the entire reality that you live in.

1248
01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.920
It's very possible that there's more flexibility and that the world is more

1249
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:36.780
malleable than we think it is and that we have everything defined in terms of

1250
01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:39.180
what something weighs or how much distance this is,

1251
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:44.420
but these are just sort of crude static factors in a constantly changing and

1252
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:50.220
moving world and the human mind interacting with that world might be,

1253
01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:54.720
might be much more significant than we think it is and it's one of the reasons

1254
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:59.220
why these ideas of quantum entanglement becomes so strange when you find out

1255
01:11:59.221 --> 01:12:03.510
about these theories of quantum mechanics and quantum physics and string theory

1256
01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:07.320
and super particles in super position where they're moving and not moving at the

1257
01:12:07.321 --> 01:12:09.780
same time,
thing's blinking in and out of existence.

1258
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:14.900
So the lowest measurable portion of of the universe that we can find the lowest

1259
01:12:15.151 --> 01:12:19.970
measurable,
like the smallest tiniest thing.
It's magic.
It's all magic.
The,

1260
01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:23.310
when you get into quantum mechanics,
when you get into string theory,

1261
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.240
subatomic particles,
when you get into like really complex mathematics and and,

1262
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:33.090
and different experiments that they do on the smallest,
tiniest,

1263
01:12:33.091 --> 01:12:37.950
measurable parts of the world,
it's all magic.
It's all empty space.

1264
01:12:37.951 --> 01:12:42.510
Me Atoms are mostly empty space inside these subatomic particles,
they,

1265
01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:45.480
they're moving and they're still at the same time.

1266
01:12:45.481 --> 01:12:47.220
They blink in and out of existence.

1267
01:12:47.221 --> 01:12:50.370
They go somewhere and they disappear and then they come back.

1268
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:53.910
We have no idea where they go.
We just know they go somewhere.

1269
01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:55.890
They exhibit magic.

1270
01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:00.840
The lowest measurable part of the universe itself is magic.

1271
01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:03.810
The smallest portions that we can measure our magic.

1272
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:07.380
So just because everything is big and this table's made out of oak and this

1273
01:13:07.381 --> 01:13:11.280
microphone is metal,
that doesn't mean shit.
I mean,
it means shit.

1274
01:13:11.281 --> 01:13:12.240
If I hit you over the head with,

1275
01:13:12.241 --> 01:13:14.690
this is going to fucking hurt because that's the rules we've chosen.
Right?

1276
01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:19.080
But the,
the actual reality itself,
it's very malleable.

1277
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:20.850
There's a lot of weirdness to the world.

1278
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.920
I don't think Melissa Etheridge is totally right.

1279
01:13:22.921 --> 01:13:26.490
I think there's a lot of hubris involved and thinking that you have the answer

1280
01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:30.840
and that you use thinking good thoughts and you know this plane is never going

1281
01:13:30.841 --> 01:13:33.090
to crash.
I don't,
I don't believe that.

1282
01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:37.140
I mean this is coming from also from a person who was suffered from cancer.

1283
01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:40.410
So it's like,
it's like I don't,
you know,
I don't,
I think,

1284
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.560
I think it's a self serving philosophy to think that way.
Yeah.

1285
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:48.810
You might be right,
but to say you're right.
I think it's crazy.
Yeah.
And you,
you,

1286
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:52.230
you can't dictate.
I mean I think it positive thinking is a good thing too.

1287
01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:55.770
It's not all safe cause you walked in the room.
But it might be,

1288
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:58.050
that's what's fucked.
It might not be,

1289
01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.400
might be meaning it might be because it's her or it might because of,

1290
01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.740
cause if anybody,
anybody,
anybody who thinks a certain way,

1291
01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:08.880
anybody who lives their life with it,
it sounds like bullshit.
But trust me,

1292
01:14:08.881 --> 01:14:11.890
if people are going crazy right now listening to this,
I agree with you.

1293
01:14:11.891 --> 01:14:16.210
It's sounds like bullshit.
Most likely it's not true.
But it might be true.

1294
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:18.280
We can't prove that it's not.

1295
01:14:18.281 --> 01:14:23.281
We don't know all of the interactions that the human mind and consciousness have

1296
01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:26.890
on the universe itself.
We don't know.

1297
01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:31.480
We assume that it's simple as you are responsible for your life,

1298
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:33.220
you're responsible for your actions.

1299
01:14:33.221 --> 01:14:36.460
You're responsible for where you drive and where you go to school and what comes

1300
01:14:36.461 --> 01:14:37.180
out of your mouth.

1301
01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:41.320
We assume that that is just a part of the mathematical interaction of human

1302
01:14:41.321 --> 01:14:43.960
beings in this culture and this society and the civilization,

1303
01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:49.120
but we're not totally sure that it is possible that you were thinking and that

1304
01:14:49.121 --> 01:14:53.440
your mind itself might affect reality because the reality that you see in the

1305
01:14:53.441 --> 01:14:55.420
reality that I see is just what's in front of us.

1306
01:14:55.421 --> 01:14:58.750
We assume that this is constantly going on behind the scenes.

1307
01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:02.200
We assume you assume that when you go to home,
when you uh,

1308
01:15:02.201 --> 01:15:06.280
you go home and you sit in front of the TV,
you assume I exist until I text you.

1309
01:15:06.281 --> 01:15:10.390
You don't know for sure until you call me or we meet and we high five and get on

1310
01:15:10.391 --> 01:15:14.110
a plane,
go,
go tell some jokes.
We don't know that that we exist.

1311
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:19.500
We just assume based on the evidence that I've accumulated when when I go home,

1312
01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.530
I assume that you Tommy buns live your life,

1313
01:15:23.531 --> 01:15:27.010
but I don't know what the fuck you do.
The whole thing could be a joke.

1314
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.580
My life could be non real in your world.

1315
01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.350
I could be just what happens when you come around the program that is Joe Rogan.

1316
01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.070
Right?
I might not be real you.

1317
01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:41.050
You leave this room and you go out and this whole thing might shut down

1318
01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:45.460
and the only time it turns on is when you're watching sort of like the

1319
01:15:45.461 --> 01:15:49.090
difference between particles being observed and not being observed.
They have,

1320
01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:52.300
they exhibit different behavior because they're interacting with whatever the

1321
01:15:52.301 --> 01:15:53.260
fuck it is that measures them.

1322
01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:57.530
<v 1>It all goes back to reality is what you make of it.
Maybe.
Yeah,</v>

1323
01:15:58.570 --> 01:16:03.120
maybe.
But I mean,
you know,
you can really,
if you dig,

1324
01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:08.090
if you decide to live your life within that thought,

1325
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:12.570
that reality is what I make of it.
You know,
you dictate everything,
you know?

1326
01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.570
In a lot of ways.
Yeah.
You'll a lot of ways.
He do.

1327
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:15.441
<v 5>You didn't,
when people die,</v>

1328
01:16:15.441 --> 01:16:18.120
they always say they see the light and they always see I,
you know,

1329
01:16:18.230 --> 01:16:20.720
when they come back to life,
when they die,
they always see the light.

1330
01:16:20.721 --> 01:16:24.410
They always see it.
Like I saw my family was all there and it was all cloudy.

1331
01:16:24.411 --> 01:16:26.150
People are smoking weed.
What if?
What if?

1332
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:30.290
What if that was just you waking up going,
oh yeah,

1333
01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:34.640
this was a whole program that I did and my family's here and we're all just,

1334
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:37.590
<v 0>well that's a joke that I used to do right about the aliens about like,</v>

1335
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.450
well that's what the simulation theory,
what it really is.

1336
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.400
The reason why aliens exist.
That's us,

1337
01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:47.080
aliens or us in the future and what we are is where people that fucked up and we

1338
01:16:47.081 --> 01:16:50.380
evolve too far.
We,
we eliminated all the fun out of the world.

1339
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:55.180
We eliminated sacks,
blowjobs muscle cars,
cigarettes,
we exhibit,

1340
01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:59.120
we took out Whiskey,
we eliminated all human conflict and what we're,

1341
01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.930
what are we left with?
We're left with boring bullshit.

1342
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.560
We don't have bodies with these weird stick bodies anymore.
We don't have dicks.

1343
01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:07.270
We somewhere along the line,

1344
01:17:07.271 --> 01:17:10.910
people realize that Dixon vaginas are causing fucking problems.
Girl,
there's,

1345
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:13.670
there's too many women out there that are getting pregnant to keep a man.

1346
01:17:13.671 --> 01:17:16.850
There's too many men out there that are rate bang.
There's too much nonsense.

1347
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:19.550
It's too many people that are having babies that really don't support these

1348
01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:20.600
children correctly.

1349
01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:25.360
And so sex and sexual urges being what's responsible for breeding.
We got to,

1350
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:27.500
we got to factor that out.
We've got to take that out of the equation.

1351
01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:31.040
So one day they,
they got everything

1352
01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:38.260
changed and evolved to a point where they eliminated all the variables in the

1353
01:17:38.751 --> 01:17:39.860
world.
The Olympic,

1354
01:17:39.861 --> 01:17:44.030
they have too much power and they eliminated eliminated sex and emotions and we

1355
01:17:44.031 --> 01:17:44.690
don't like it.

1356
01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:49.690
So when we plug ourselves in two and a simulated version of the roaring twenties

1357
01:17:50.961 --> 01:17:55.700
of the digital age,
it's not a coincidence that we are at this moment in time,

1358
01:17:55.701 --> 01:17:59.330
the craziest moment the world has ever known where the world and the universe is

1359
01:17:59.331 --> 01:18:03.170
constantly changing every second of every day.
It's not a coincidence at all.

1360
01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.940
In fact,
this is what we asked for.
We asked to be born in this time.
We,

1361
01:18:07.941 --> 01:18:12.260
we right now,
I mean,
as I said this on stage a Friday night,
but I,
I,
I believe it,

1362
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:17.000
we live in the greatest time to be alive ever.
This is the strangest,

1363
01:18:17.001 --> 01:18:21.200
wildest,
most,
the most possible,

1364
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:26.120
most possibility filled time in life.
There's so many things going on constantly.

1365
01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:31.230
There was something in the news today that the first monkeys were born that have

1366
01:18:31.650 --> 01:18:36.390
they altered the genetics of them?
They're here.
I'll pull it up on,

1367
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:40.100
on,
on Twitter.
Cause this is such a strange,

1368
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.640
strange,
um,

1369
01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:48.050
scientific experiment and people that when I posted it,
everybody's like,

1370
01:18:48.051 --> 01:18:50.540
wait a minute,
isn't this how fucking planet of the apes got started?

1371
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:54.050
But it is a planet of the apes guys started these idea,

1372
01:18:54.051 --> 01:18:59.051
first monkeys with customized DNA programmed genetic mutations.

1373
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.600
So they are programmed genetic mutations and these monkeys were born.

1374
01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:09.950
So they,
they,
they're working on creating a perfect monkey.

1375
01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.850
They're going to alter the genes of these monkeys and they're going to continue

1376
01:19:13.851 --> 01:19:17.100
to alter genes of the monkeys until essentially they have a monkey that's a

1377
01:19:17.101 --> 01:19:18.290
smart as a fucking person.

1378
01:19:18.291 --> 01:19:22.930
Really or a monkey that has a giant Dick or a monkey that grows wings and flies

1379
01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:25.550
like a bat.
This program's in place.

1380
01:19:25.551 --> 01:19:28.190
This is something that's being monkeys are born,
these monkeys are born.

1381
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:33.310
We live in a fantastic time and the idea being that what the aliens are,

1382
01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:36.800
when everybody has these archetypal experiences,

1383
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:42.130
it's always these things that look very similar to what you would expect human

1384
01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:45.560
beings to eventually become.
If you go back to the lower hominids,

1385
01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:48.140
go back to monkeys.
You go back to chimpanzees,

1386
01:19:48.141 --> 01:19:52.520
you go back to the great apes and you look at them in comparison to us.

1387
01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:56.240
What do you see?
Well,
they have more hair.
They look much stronger.

1388
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:58.700
They're more veer,
more,
much more physically fit.

1389
01:19:58.701 --> 01:20:02.300
You take the average person that say it works in an office,
the average man,

1390
01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.630
and you compare them to the the great apes.

1391
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:07.890
They're all fat and they're skinny.

1392
01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:12.150
They have no muscle like what is going to be next?
What's going to be next?
Well,

1393
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:15.300
what's going to be next is that we're going to continue the trend to not need

1394
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:17.580
bronze,
to not need biological strength.

1395
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:20.520
The brains are going to get bigger telekinesis,

1396
01:20:20.521 --> 01:20:22.710
the ability to control things with the mind,

1397
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.340
the ability to talk without using language,
so the mouth is going to shrink up.

1398
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.280
The environment's going to be all fucked,

1399
01:20:28.281 --> 01:20:30.160
so you're going to have to need builtin sunglasses.

1400
01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:32.710
You get these fucking gigantic black eyes that are going to fall off because

1401
01:20:32.711 --> 01:20:35.010
we're going to ruin our fucking atmosphere.
I mean,

1402
01:20:35.011 --> 01:20:38.640
they literally are what we'd expect us to look like a million years from now.

1403
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.570
We would expect human beings to slowly but surely evolve into that.

1404
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:47.250
If we used to be hairy little furry rodents,
which is what we were,

1405
01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:51.780
the idea of,
you know,
there was no primates 65 million years ago,
okay?

1406
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:55.770
When the great extinction event happened that killed off the dinosaurs,

1407
01:20:55.771 --> 01:20:59.670
the giant piece of rock from the sky that hit the Yucatan.
There was no primates,

1408
01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:00.361
primates,

1409
01:21:00.361 --> 01:21:05.280
somehow or another evolved out of that of the shrews and the monkey and the rats

1410
01:21:05.281 --> 01:21:08.670
and wherever the fuck survived,
whatever mammalian life form survived.

1411
01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:11.550
So crazy to think of.
That's the only 65 million years ago,
man.

1412
01:21:11.670 --> 01:21:16.500
That's as far back as we know for sure.
There was no people.
No,

1413
01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:20.730
no,
no way.
No how,
and it's a blink of an eye.
That's in terms of the universe.

1414
01:21:20.730 --> 01:21:22.990
It's a blink of an eye 65 million years ago.
Yeah.

1415
01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:27.210
So were so positive that things got wiped out at 65 million years ago.

1416
01:21:27.211 --> 01:21:31.470
So positive,
so positive.
That's when the dinosaurs died off.
So from then on,

1417
01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:34.560
somehow or another people were created.
That's nothing.
Yeah,

1418
01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.780
that's a goddamn blink of the eye.

1419
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:41.500
And if you look at how much different we look than the early monkeys,
what,

1420
01:21:41.501 --> 01:21:46.470
what's next?
This is aliens is next.
That's next.
It's 100% next.

1421
01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:49.350
That's what you would think that if we're going to continue this trend of no

1422
01:21:49.351 --> 01:21:53.430
hair,
hair,
hair loss on the arms and the body,
people are getting less hairy,

1423
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:56.160
people are getting less strong.
There's was getting smaller.

1424
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:59.610
You're using your fingers and eventually going to use Google glasses so you

1425
01:21:59.611 --> 01:22:00.570
could just kind of talk to it.

1426
01:22:00.571 --> 01:22:02.940
Eventually gonna be able to read your mind so you don't have to talk your

1427
01:22:02.941 --> 01:22:04.350
fucking vocal.
Carl's going to shrink up.

1428
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.980
We're gonna all agree to genetically alter ourselves so we don't have penises

1429
01:22:07.981 --> 01:22:08.610
anymore.

1430
01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:11.730
As soon as they come up with a fucking thing that you could program into that

1431
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:16.590
takes you in a wild sexual ride of simulation that you could never achieve with

1432
01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:20.010
your actual real dick,
you'd be like,
I don't need this stupid thing anymore.

1433
01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.200
Your Dick is going to be just as dumb as a horse.

1434
01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:24.180
Your Dick is going to be like something that you like.

1435
01:22:24.181 --> 01:22:28.170
Remember when people used to fuck with dicks?
Ah,
you got to laugh about it.

1436
01:22:28.171 --> 01:22:31.590
Just like sending a fucking pigeon with a note wrapped around it's leg,

1437
01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:34.380
but how to do that when I can text you.
You wouldn't.
You wouldn't,

1438
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.140
but what about the actual having to writing in your hand.

1439
01:22:37.141 --> 01:22:38.970
Get the fuck Outta here.
The doodle.

1440
01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:42.210
Send me a selfie with a big smile and a thumbs up and it gets me in one second.

1441
01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:45.750
I have to rely on some stupid pigeon.
That's going to be what sex becomes.

1442
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.200
Sex is going to become some silly thing that we don't need to do anymore because

1443
01:22:49.201 --> 01:22:53.850
we're going to have some integrated pleasure system that's in our mind.

1444
01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:58.110
Where are we going to be able to just go the fuck anyone you want,
man,

1445
01:22:58.210 --> 01:23:01.650
you're going to be able to have insane sex with Christie Brinkley when she was

1446
01:23:01.651 --> 01:23:04.040
21 you're going to be able to,
you know,
to,

1447
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.220
to fuck the harness woman on the planet.

1448
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:08.650
<v 2>You're gonna be able to have sex with beyond a hundred beyoncé's.</v>

1449
01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:11.440
The Wu Tang clan a room,
the whole Wu Tang clan is going to suck your Dick.

1450
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:12.760
Awesome.
Whoever you want.

1451
01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:16.120
You're going to literally be able to do whatever you want whenever you want to

1452
01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:19.420
do it.
Once they figure out,
look,
this oculus rift thing,

1453
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:24.280
what we're seeing when we see oculus rift is like the first photograph you ever

1454
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:27.010
see those like first photographs of these to have like a thing they would throw

1455
01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:30.400
like a pack,
a tent over there back.
They'd be hiding in this box.

1456
01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.130
You know like you ever seen that you really old cameras,

1457
01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:38.160
the way they throw like a towel over the top of their head and they would point

1458
01:23:38.231 --> 01:23:41.380
this thing and everybody had to stay still for like a minute.
Sit there.

1459
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.160
Don't fucking move.
Yeah.
That's what we're seeing with oculus rift.

1460
01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:49.900
What do you think physically will be the evolutionary change of humans?

1461
01:23:49.901 --> 01:23:51.550
Those shrink.
We're shrinking.

1462
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:53.740
We're eventually going to get to the point where we don't need,

1463
01:23:53.741 --> 01:23:56.620
well when people are getting much bigger now,
but that's because of protein,

1464
01:23:56.850 --> 01:24:00.760
the protein intake because people understand diet better and as far as athletes

1465
01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:05.980
you got,
you're dealing with hormonal manipulation,
growth hormone,
testosterone.

1466
01:24:05.981 --> 01:24:09.940
You're also dealing with massive scientific advances and strength and

1467
01:24:09.941 --> 01:24:14.050
conditioning training.
And then also there's some selective breeding,

1468
01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:16.660
big people dating big people.
There's that Christie Brinkley,

1469
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:19.780
she's heard today 60,
she's jamming.

1470
01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:23.530
Do you got to see her moving around too?
It's not an illusion.

1471
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:26.860
It's an illusion created by the a,
the photograph.
I mean,

1472
01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:30.520
she definitely looks like an older mature woman,
but I would send it home,

1473
01:24:32.290 --> 01:24:37.050
send it home,
send it home.
I'd have to be real careful.
Yeah.

1474
01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:39.430
Cause I am a fucking animal.
You know what I'm saying?
And they get hurt her,

1475
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:45.030
that hip strength.
I've got lower back muscles that thick Fords,

1476
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:49.660
hip,
a kettlebell swings,
all that shit.
I do a lot of those.

1477
01:24:49.661 --> 01:24:53.080
I do a lot to do with Christie Shit,
but well,

1478
01:24:53.081 --> 01:24:56.290
they're going to get to a point where I'm going to be able to reverse aging.

1479
01:24:56.350 --> 01:25:00.660
That's on.
Unquestionably.
They're working on that and they're,

1480
01:25:00.661 --> 01:25:04.660
they're already like doing tests on that,
on,
on other animals.

1481
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:09.430
I feel like this path is going to lead us to just be born and just lay down with

1482
01:25:09.431 --> 01:25:12.010
a fucking monitor in front of us.
Like,
uh,

1483
01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:17.280
and just you sip your fighter nutrients and up and never stand up and just plug

1484
01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:18.390
into whatever you want to be.

1485
01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.760
We can get our nutrients the same way those a wireless pads are.
When you know,

1486
01:25:21.761 --> 01:25:23.350
you take one of those new cell phones,

1487
01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:25.540
we get to sit in on something and it just charges,

1488
01:25:25.541 --> 01:25:28.300
you don't even have to plug it in.
That's how we're gonna get our nutrients.

1489
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:32.500
Are nutrients going to be delivered through our car seats as we drive to work,

1490
01:25:32.501 --> 01:25:36.820
we're going to get nutrients drive to work naked and the nutrients are going to

1491
01:25:36.821 --> 01:25:39.960
just be absorbed by your body.
Skin.
I mean,
why not your skin?

1492
01:25:39.961 --> 01:25:44.320
I mean there's like rub testosterone cream on testosterone cream absorbs through

1493
01:25:44.321 --> 01:25:46.630
your skin.
They're going to fuck and you're going to be able to sit,

1494
01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:51.190
sit in your little Honda on your way to work and your car is going to feed you

1495
01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.140
and you believe it and no,
no shipping,
no farting,
no farting.
Yeah.

1496
01:25:55.141 --> 01:25:59.980
And if you want to like feel like a Henry the eighth orgy of food and big

1497
01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:01.000
fucking Turkey legs,

1498
01:26:01.001 --> 01:26:05.300
he just programmed that punching that and take you one of uh,

1499
01:26:05.301 --> 01:26:07.550
Germany to Henry of the eighth land.
You'll,

1500
01:26:07.551 --> 01:26:12.551
you'll die in a gigantic oak table with enemy heads hanging from the fucking

1501
01:26:12.951 --> 01:26:14.900
ceiling.
It's pretty awesome to think of like all,

1502
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:18.950
all the worlds you could create and just jump into it in a second.
It's coming,

1503
01:26:18.951 --> 01:26:20.210
dude.
Yeah.
We just,

1504
01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:24.620
we are just so comfortable with the world that we live in now.

1505
01:26:24.650 --> 01:26:27.050
It seems so normal to us,
but you have a,

1506
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.450
you have a lamp on your table over there.

1507
01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:32.660
You got a Goddamn a lava lamp sitting next to you.
It's weird.

1508
01:26:32.661 --> 01:26:36.140
Gooey shit is bouncing up and down and someone figured out a way to have

1509
01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:37.580
electricity.

1510
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:43.270
The shit that creates lightning come through the walls in these weird pipes.

1511
01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:47.210
Yeah,
you got the wrong one.
They're silly face.
You can't say it.

1512
01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:50.240
Push that in front of the,
push that in front of the salt lamp.

1513
01:26:50.710 --> 01:26:53.430
Pull it that thing over so people could see what we're talking about.
That shit.

1514
01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.700
It's grabbing the bottom of the bottom of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1515
01:26:55.780 --> 01:27:00.710
That's how it's going to fall.
It's not going to fall.
Look at that thing.

1516
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:04.010
If you brought that thing back in time,

1517
01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:07.340
if you brought that thing just as simple as stupid lava lamp,

1518
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.330
if you brought that back in time and showed someone from King Arthur's time,

1519
01:27:11.630 --> 01:27:12.463
they'll kill you.

1520
01:27:12.970 --> 01:27:17.590
<v 1>Definitely.
Jeans or pants.
Yeah,
my Lord.</v>

1521
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:21.400
Yeah.
She has electricity in the walls.
This lightning in the walls.

1522
01:27:21.850 --> 01:27:24.010
We're going to die.
You're going to die.

1523
01:27:24.011 --> 01:27:25.900
Stick a fork in that hole in the wall and you're dead.

1524
01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:30.080
Every person has a hole in the,
in their house.
We stick a fork in you.

1525
01:27:30.081 --> 01:27:34.180
You're dead.
Yeah,
they crazy,
isn't it?
It's ridiculous.

1526
01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.940
We might not die.
I mean,
you might just get really fucked up.

1527
01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.770
I gotta let me as a kid,
I stuck a key into an outlet.
Oh my God.

1528
01:27:41.771 --> 01:27:46.600
I don't know how the,
I guess the had maybe the shutoff circuit breakers.

1529
01:27:46.630 --> 01:27:51.610
Right,
but I stuck it in.
Sparks flew,
I mean flew out of it.

1530
01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:56.210
The key broken half,
like the burnt end state in the burn chart.
And it broken.

1531
01:27:56.211 --> 01:27:58.500
I was just like,
ah,
I think I fucked up in here.
Like

1532
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:04.330
parents came in,
same thing,
but I took a wire.

1533
01:28:04.331 --> 01:28:07.600
My idea is it's going to transfer electricity from the top outlet to the bottom

1534
01:28:07.601 --> 01:28:09.190
outlet.
It's like put it in there.

1535
01:28:09.191 --> 01:28:11.870
And I remember my dad was watching incredible Hawk at the time cause that's why

1536
01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:16.120
I was in the kitchen hiding and putting it in the wire sparks and fire.
It felt,

1537
01:28:16.121 --> 01:28:19.810
it felt like there was fire by shows us that if we had done that in like the
50s,

1538
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:22.380
we just be dead probably.
Right.
Well if you had done that during the,

1539
01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:22.910
during the days

1540
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:27.620
<v 2>of direct current,
it would have been very different.
Very different.
Yeah.
Like um,</v>

1541
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.220
they,
do you remember the uh,
Thomas Edison experiments?

1542
01:28:31.221 --> 01:28:35.900
They did when Thomas Edison was trying to warn people against the effects of

1543
01:28:35.901 --> 01:28:39.140
alternating current,
they,
they,
they cooked an elephant.

1544
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:42.560
They hooked this elephant up to this,

1545
01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:47.870
like these wires and barbecue.
This elephant.
No,
he never seen that.

1546
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:52.610
It's pretty crazy.
A Thomas Edison.
Interesting cat.
You know,

1547
01:28:52.611 --> 01:28:56.780
because obviously great genius and inventor and responsible for a lot of uh,

1548
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:58.290
pretty incredible things.
Yeah.

1549
01:28:58.430 --> 01:29:03.430
But also like was doing battle with the concepts that were being endorsed by

1550
01:29:03.601 --> 01:29:07.650
other scientists.
Like even Nikola Tesla was an alternating current guy.

1551
01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.040
He believed in the alternating current and Edison was,

1552
01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:14.630
his whole thing was set up on direct current.
So if you,
if you watch it,

1553
01:29:14.710 --> 01:29:18.210
pull that video up cause it's fucking crazy.
Like this is again,

1554
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:22.380
when you think about human beings,
it's not that long ago man.
You know,

1555
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:25.830
I mean this is a,
what was it?
19 what?
When did this happen?

1556
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:26.833
<v 6>Uh,</v>

1557
01:29:32.490 --> 01:29:34.380
<v 2>1903 1903.</v>

1558
01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:38.400
So this is when people were just starting to figure out what the fuck

1559
01:29:38.401 --> 01:29:42.180
electricity could do and they have this elephant stretch chained up.

1560
01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:44.640
And Thomas Edison's like,
look,

1561
01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:48.390
I'm going to show you guys what happens if you don't fucking listen to me.

1562
01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.140
So he did this just to disprove the other guys.
Yes.
But watch what he does.

1563
01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:56.670
They have this thing connected to this and they just charge it up and zap this

1564
01:29:56.671 --> 01:29:58.380
elephant.
Look,
he's cooking right now.

1565
01:29:58.410 --> 01:30:02.220
Damn these poor Elfant and just stand there and boom,
it falls over dead.

1566
01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:06.180
Oh Damn.
And that's in your house,

1567
01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:09.600
that's in your walls.
And Edison was trying to let you know like,

1568
01:30:09.601 --> 01:30:12.960
listen to me bitch.
Like what a crazy fuck that guy is.

1569
01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:17.070
He didn't just try to prove it with science.
He said,
okay,
I'm going to show you.

1570
01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:19.980
I'm going to take something bigger than you and I'm going to cook it.

1571
01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:22.620
I'm my cooking one night.
Tricity who second?
So what's not.

1572
01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:27.300
So that must have been like a huge like wave of fear and paranoia.

1573
01:30:27.301 --> 01:30:28.134
After that,

1574
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:32.160
they cooked the fucking elephant with his new type of electricity because in

1575
01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:36.450
that case,
what did he hooked it up?
He cooked it.
They covered it with wires.

1576
01:30:36.451 --> 01:30:36.751
I mean the,

1577
01:30:36.751 --> 01:30:41.220
the connected it with wires and then it fucking just electrocuted the shit out

1578
01:30:41.221 --> 01:30:44.040
of his Christ.
That was Thomas Edison.

1579
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:48.450
Could you imagine if in 2014 okay,
if you know,

1580
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.390
a hundred plus years later,
they did that.

1581
01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:54.720
The imagine if someone tried to prove something,
if they tried to prove,
you know,

1582
01:30:54.721 --> 01:30:59.160
there's,
we are on the verge of wireless electricity.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1583
01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:04.140
in order to tell you what is wrong with a wireless electricity,
here's,

1584
01:31:04.141 --> 01:31:08.010
you know,
Marty mcfuck face and Marty mcfuck face.
The scientist shows us.

1585
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:10.250
Here we are in Times Square.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1586
01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:15.290
this is an elephant is connected to this receiver and we're going to broadcast

1587
01:31:15.481 --> 01:31:17.700
wireless electricity to his brain.
Watch.

1588
01:31:17.701 --> 01:31:22.400
What happens is poor elephant fucking ears to outstrip.
Yeah,

1589
01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.840
I start to bleeding from his eyeballs and falls face first.

1590
01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.180
Peta would be all over it.

1591
01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:31.710
Everyone would freak that dog killed immediately.
They would kill him,
kill him.

1592
01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:33.600
If they didn't kill him,
they would beat him.

1593
01:31:33.601 --> 01:31:36.930
They would torture them to the end of the time.
He's an asshole.
He's,
he,

1594
01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.570
he's not even,
you're not even eating an elephant.
You know,

1595
01:31:39.571 --> 01:31:43.260
it's not like a cow like that.
You,
you,
you electrocute it and then you eat it.

1596
01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:46.020
You know,
you're just killing it.
Just killing it to prove a point.

1597
01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.880
That's just a hundred plus years ago.
It's really not long ago at all.

1598
01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.150
If you really stop and think about how much different people are,

1599
01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:59.530
2003 it was or well,
not a to know.
Three rather.
Yeah,
1903 and think that too.

1600
01:31:59.531 --> 01:32:03.460
Behaviors change so much.
If you,
if you measure by decades,

1601
01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:06.870
it's crazy how much,
how about you mentioned by movies when the Menus,

1602
01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.990
a slap women across the face all the time.
Shut up woman,

1603
01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:14.050
James Cagney heroes,
heroes,
heroes.

1604
01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:18.990
Sheroes used to smack women right across the face.
John Wayne style.

1605
01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:21.130
Get a hold of yourself

1606
01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.630
and the woman would just stand there and take it and then they start making out.

1607
01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:28.020
That's Sean Connery and the interview talking and we've seen that,
right?

1608
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:32.220
If she doesn't listen,
listen,

1609
01:32:32.670 --> 01:32:33.900
we mac back around.

1610
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:37.660
He was saying that women have a way of like getting you to do that.

1611
01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:41.590
Dude,
you're dating the wrong bitches.
Smacking him.

1612
01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:45.130
I'm pretty sure you're dating the wrong women.
Oh,
women don't do that.

1613
01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:49.560
So know you're choosing to date that that style of person,
like yeah,

1614
01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:53.050
there were people 200 years ago that wouldn't cause you to hit them.
No.
Okay.

1615
01:32:53.051 --> 01:32:57.160
There wouldn't torment you.
Not everybody wants to be constantly in conflict.

1616
01:32:57.161 --> 01:32:59.740
It's like it's such a stupid state.
He's drawn to the conflict.

1617
01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:04.960
That's why you want to do once.
It is awesome as he is an actor,
he's an actor,

1618
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:08.680
but he also,
you know,
he's coming from a different era for sure.
And he,

1619
01:33:08.681 --> 01:33:10.750
but he looked at a,
I think it was Barbara Walters,
he was like,

1620
01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:12.610
I'm gonna smack you next.
If you keep that shit up,

1621
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:16.150
he looks it up so we can watch that business.

1622
01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:19.090
A fucking Sean Connery saying she'd hit women.

1623
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:23.890
I mean it's this,
and this happened a long time ago.

1624
01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:28.240
It's 2020 plus now,
maybe.
Yeah,
25 to 30 years ago.
I'm guessing.

1625
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.520
Obviously not a long time ago in terms of what we've been saying,

1626
01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:32.560
the entire podcast,
but,
but he's an old school dude.

1627
01:33:32.561 --> 01:33:34.870
He's got to be in his late seventies or something by now.
Right.

1628
01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.950
But what I'm saying is like,
you couldn't do that today.
Hell No.
Like the,
the,

1629
01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.170
the culture has evolved,
but you get what I'm saying.

1630
01:33:41.171 --> 01:33:42.700
I wouldn't do that for the years.
Go by.

1631
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:46.610
<v 4>The worst thing to slap a woman now and then as I remember you said you don't do</v>

1632
01:33:46.611 --> 01:33:50.240
it with phase change.
It's better to do it with an open hand.
Yeah,

1633
01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:55.010
I remember that.
Yeah.
I love that.
I wouldn't change my opinion.

1634
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:58.410
<v 2>What did she say?
I would love that.
Is that what she said?
Hold on a second.</v>

1635
01:33:58.411 --> 01:34:00.240
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
What did she say

1636
01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:05.290
<v 4>first?
It's better to do it with an open hand.
Yeah,
I remember that.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1637
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:09.330
I didn't love that,
but didn't love it.
No,

1638
01:34:09.331 --> 01:34:13.170
I didn't love you think it's good to slap a woman?
No,
I don't think it's good.

1639
01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:16.560
I don't think it's bad that I don't think it's that bad.

1640
01:34:16.561 --> 01:34:19.850
I think that it depends entirely on the circumstances and if it marriage,

1641
01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:26.260
you have tried everything else and women are pretty good at it.

1642
01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:32.460
They can't leave it alone.
They don't want to have the last word.

1643
01:34:32.461 --> 01:34:35.970
Then you'd give them the last one,
but they're not happy with the last one.

1644
01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:38.230
They want to share it again and,

1645
01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:43.590
and get into a really provocative situation.
Then

1646
01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:48.210
I think it's absolutely right.

1647
01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:58.220
<v 2>What's up?
Ruin a good interview.</v>

1648
01:34:58.850 --> 01:35:02.400
But the idea behind that is fascinating.
Yeah.
I mean,

1649
01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.020
all he's really saying is I don't like a yappy broad.
Yeah.

1650
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:07.160
And that's really what he's trying to say.
You need to bring her up with a dude.

1651
01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.270
Just,
they're not all like that.
So crazy.

1652
01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.420
Not all men are like that and not all women are like that.

1653
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:17.330
You know what's so great about that?
The only great thing about that is,
you know,

1654
01:35:17.331 --> 01:35:19.040
when you call somebody out,
he,

1655
01:35:19.041 --> 01:35:22.910
she was calling him out on national television and his,
uh,

1656
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:27.290
his defense instincts kicked in,
or when she said,
uh,
she was like,

1657
01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:29.450
he realized were probably just having a nice chat.

1658
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:33.740
She brings that up and he was like,
immediately his face changed and he goes,

1659
01:35:34.090 --> 01:35:36.260
yeah,
I haven't changed my position on that.
Like,
he was really like,

1660
01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:38.230
I'm going to do battle with you now.
Yeah.

1661
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:43.490
He likes conflict as a guy who wants to,
he wants to have conflict.
Well,
I think,

1662
01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:47.780
I think he's just really confident and I think he believes in what he's saying

1663
01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:52.590
and uh,
he thinks it.
Barbara Walters just trying to catch him and you know,

1664
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.910
expose that and have him back down and was like,
I'm not gonna,

1665
01:35:55.911 --> 01:35:57.910
I'm not gonna back down.
You're not going to back down.
Yeah.

1666
01:35:58.270 --> 01:36:01.030
I date crazy bitches and sometimes I have to smack him back tomorrow.

1667
01:36:01.050 --> 01:36:04.160
Those are the ones who like to fuck,
fuck,
like wild animals.

1668
01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:05.390
And that's what I need in my life.

1669
01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.950
I'm 60 years old and I didn't get my dick hard and he's not very young creaming

1670
01:36:09.951 --> 01:36:14.190
bitch that,
you know,
let's me send it in.
Yeah.
No,
he's not,
not young.

1671
01:36:14.191 --> 01:36:18.770
They're young man.
You know,
some,
some people the,
the aphrodisiac,

1672
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:21.800
like the stimulant is not just sexual,

1673
01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:26.840
it's not just how the person looks,
it's not just being attracted to them.

1674
01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:28.790
Sometimes it's drama.
You know,

1675
01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:33.820
like there's a lot of people that get sucked up into this idea of fighting and

1676
01:36:35.031 --> 01:36:37.470
then making up and then to make makeup sex.
Yeah,

1677
01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:42.200
it's super common because we all have been there before where you break up with

1678
01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:45.350
someone and you're like,
it's over.
It's like fucking devastating.

1679
01:36:45.351 --> 01:36:46.184
It's heartbreaking.

1680
01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:49.850
And then one day you run into them and it might be just a month later or two

1681
01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:52.910
months later or whatever it may be.
You both have dated other people,
whatever.

1682
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:55.370
And then you hook up and it's incredible.

1683
01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.510
The sex is incredible and you're nice to each other and you're like,
I'm sorry,

1684
01:36:59.511 --> 01:37:04.130
I'm sorry to,
and you,
and it's incredible,

1685
01:37:04.150 --> 01:37:07.910
but it's such a heightened kite type of sex,
makeup,
sex.

1686
01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:12.840
Cause sometimes people need to put things into perspective.
They need the um,

1687
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:14.450
the benefit of time.

1688
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:19.750
They need the benefit of having all these emotions run through your head,

1689
01:37:20.091 --> 01:37:22.160
having all this,
these bad feelings,

1690
01:37:22.161 --> 01:37:25.790
but then having them all slow down and relax and time puts things into

1691
01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:30.320
perspective and you know,
and then you see each other,
then you're like,
oh fuck.

1692
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:32.660
And all you can think of then it's like the good times.

1693
01:37:32.690 --> 01:37:36.020
It's real hard to think about these really stupid,

1694
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:39.500
petty bad times and relationships once the relationship is over.

1695
01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:42.640
You really mostly just think about the good stuff about that person.
Right.

1696
01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:46.830
That's then used to start fucking again.
Oh Shit Dude.

1697
01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:50.960
I Bet Sean Connery through his deck around a lot.
Back in over time.

1698
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:52.730
But then again,
what happens after that?

1699
01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:56.910
You get fucking tired of each other again and you fall back new same old ways

1700
01:37:56.911 --> 01:38:00.120
and you get tired with each other and how do you fix that ladies and gentlemen?

1701
01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:04.470
Marijuana.
That's right.
Smoked some weed and fuck.

1702
01:38:04.471 --> 01:38:08.190
And you appreciate each other like,
like,
yeah,
just met.
That's good.

1703
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:10.850
That's good advice.
Great Advice.
There's no,

1704
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:15.390
no better like enhancement to sex than marijuana.

1705
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:18.660
The people who fuck and don't smoke pot.

1706
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:22.740
You are missing out on 50% of your sex.
Yeah,
you really are.

1707
01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.870
You don't know what you're missing.
It's if,

1708
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:30.380
if I could give you something that's not dangerous and that will make sex 50%

1709
01:38:30.511 --> 01:38:34.350
better,
do you know what that would be worth on the open market?
I mean,

1710
01:38:34.351 --> 01:38:37.800
there's stupid pills that you take that are supposed to make your Dick Rowe that

1711
01:38:37.801 --> 01:38:39.300
don't do a goddamn thing.

1712
01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:43.410
There's stupid people out there that are cut and rhino horns off to make their

1713
01:38:43.411 --> 01:38:45.540
cocks hard.
That doesn't work.

1714
01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:50.780
There's so much money in like enhancing sex and the number one thing to enhance

1715
01:38:51.301 --> 01:38:53.790
sex,
it just flies under the radar.

1716
01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:57.030
The one thing that works like a charm,

1717
01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:02.250
if you are in love or you are in lust or you have someone that you'd like to

1718
01:39:02.251 --> 01:39:04.350
fuck,
how about that?
And that person likes you to fuck them.

1719
01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:08.190
Get together and smoke some pot before you do it.
Don't get crazy.
Don't,

1720
01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:09.720
don't smoke so much.

1721
01:39:09.721 --> 01:39:12.660
You're paranoid and you freak out and he can't get it up just a little bit.

1722
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:17.280
Just a little bit.
Every touch will feel more,

1723
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:19.710
more spectacular.

1724
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:23.010
You'll feel like electricity through fingers.

1725
01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:27.210
The warmth of your bodies will,
the sensation would be so pleasurable.

1726
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:29.340
People that don't smoke pot and fuck,

1727
01:39:29.341 --> 01:39:33.630
you're missing out on that Cheyenne Chunk of what sex is.
Yeah,
or do it,
you know,

1728
01:39:33.631 --> 01:39:38.390
smoke and go touch a stranger or do mushrooms.
You want to go deep,
deep,
deep,

1729
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:41.300
deep,
deep,
deep.
Have sex on machine.

1730
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:45.450
Ever done that you'll like to kaleidoscopes.
It's hard to do.

1731
01:39:45.570 --> 01:39:48.600
Colliding so hard to do.
It's really hard to do.
I like,
I was fucking,

1732
01:39:48.601 --> 01:39:50.940
that's really tall girl lines and I was on mushrooms and I thought she was an

1733
01:39:50.941 --> 01:39:52.410
alien.
I was like,
I had just my,

1734
01:39:52.411 --> 01:39:55.380
it just cause you start playing tricks on yourself.

1735
01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.830
Play tricks on you and stuff.
I don't want to do that.
Don't,
don't listen to it.

1736
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:00.901
You don't.

1737
01:40:00.901 --> 01:40:04.820
You won't think you're an alien deal with your wife's not nailing crazy.
Yeah.

1738
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:07.440
Yeah.
Look,

1739
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:10.890
obviously the way you get affected by mushrooms is different than the way I do.

1740
01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:13.890
I think everybody is different.
That's a,

1741
01:40:13.891 --> 01:40:17.040
that's one of the weird things about psychedelics or pod or anything,

1742
01:40:17.041 --> 01:40:18.090
so thanks everybody.
Yeah,

1743
01:40:18.250 --> 01:40:20.990
I've heard people talk about what pot does them and I'm like,
okay,

1744
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:24.990
I don't know what's going on in your head,
but that's not me.
Shuts me down.

1745
01:40:24.991 --> 01:40:28.740
I just don't want to talk to anybody to sit down and shuts me down.
All right.

1746
01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:30.600
Okay.
I don't get it,

1747
01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:35.160
but maybe is everybody's got their own weird personality trends strand that you,

1748
01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:39.810
you know.
Well,
I just think there's a lot of a weird personality,

1749
01:40:39.811 --> 01:40:43.200
Trump traits.
You know,
there's a lot of weird biological traits.

1750
01:40:43.201 --> 01:40:47.010
People have a lot of different things going on.
People with alcohol,

1751
01:40:47.490 --> 01:40:52.350
I mean there's people that are the worst drunk ever that are super nice people.

1752
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.170
And then there's also people that they're,

1753
01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.040
they have a couple of drinks and they just become friendlier.

1754
01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:00.880
Nothing goes wrong at all.
I know,
it's really fascinating because I look back,

1755
01:41:00.881 --> 01:41:03.550
there's like a friends that would like want to punch me.

1756
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:05.500
You learn after like a few not,

1757
01:41:05.501 --> 01:41:10.210
cause I did something like every time they drank they were physically violent

1758
01:41:10.211 --> 01:41:11.830
people and like Jesus Christ.

1759
01:41:12.250 --> 01:41:15.130
And then there's the person who's just like hugging you.
I love you man.

1760
01:41:15.170 --> 01:41:15.640
You're like,

1761
01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:19.510
but they had the same amount of drinks and this is the behavior that comes out

1762
01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:23.050
too bad almost makes you,
it bums you out like,
Oh man,

1763
01:41:23.051 --> 01:41:26.870
you can't drink like you really,
we can't have you drinking.
Yeah.

1764
01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.690
And that's not uncommon at all.
No,
no.
It's probably like one out of 100 people.

1765
01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:35.800
Less than that,
I think last year.
Yeah.
That's like a food allergy almost.

1766
01:41:37.330 --> 01:41:39.070
Well that was something that they,
uh,

1767
01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:41.830
another thing that I had up on Twitter today that's pretty fascinating about

1768
01:41:41.831 --> 01:41:46.700
food allergies.
They figured out a way to,
uh,
to fix kids,
uh,

1769
01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.820
allergies to peanuts.
Really.

1770
01:41:48.821 --> 01:41:53.821
The DNA of peanut allergic kids changes with immune therapy study finds.

1771
01:41:54.490 --> 01:41:56.650
Hmm.
That's cool.
And this is on science daily.

1772
01:41:56.651 --> 01:42:00.040
So this is again not like a goofy website.
It's from Stanford.

1773
01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:05.430
And the idea is that treating a peanut allergy with oral immunotherapy changes

1774
01:42:05.741 --> 01:42:09.880
the DNA of the patient's immune cells according to a new study.

1775
01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:15.090
The DNA change could serve as the basis for a simple blood test to monitor long

1776
01:42:15.171 --> 01:42:19.810
term effectiveness of the allergy therapy.
That's pretty bad ass man.

1777
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:22.590
He was a lot of fucking foods that people are allergic to.

1778
01:42:22.630 --> 01:42:24.700
Some people are definitely allergic to shellfish.

1779
01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:28.930
We had that on fear factor of this dude.
Um,

1780
01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:33.880
some roaches and roaches are,
um,
they have the same enzyme,

1781
01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:35.260
apparently a shellfish.

1782
01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:39.850
So if you're allergic to roaches or even you don't know if you're allergic to

1783
01:42:39.851 --> 01:42:42.910
shellfish,
you'll also allergic to roaches.
Really?
Yeah.

1784
01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:46.420
So let's do like had like went into like Anna Filactic shock kind of.
Well,

1785
01:42:46.421 --> 01:42:49.570
he had started a,
his throat started closing up.
Yeah.

1786
01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:52.990
He was having a hard time breathing.
Well swelling,
you know,
that's what happens.

1787
01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:55.950
He had no idea or he knew he probably was a shellfish guy but didn't think about

1788
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:59.290
the Roche.
Well we didn't know.
Nobody knew.
Nobody knew.
I mean,
yeah,

1789
01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.650
it was the early days of fear factor.
Wow.
Yeah.

1790
01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:06.820
That shows just so lucky that no one died.
Yeah.

1791
01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:11.920
So lucky that dude definitely could if you didn't have a right medics around,

1792
01:43:11.921 --> 01:43:15.250
you know,
what are you guys doing over there?
What's going on?
Uh,

1793
01:43:15.370 --> 01:43:20.370
70 bags of heroin founded and Philip Seymour Hoffman is apartment poor fucker.

1794
01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:23.560
He just got back on it,
right?
Like a couple of years ago.

1795
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:26.950
He was like really clean up for like most of his life.
And then he just,

1796
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:29.320
he had a problem a while ago.
Yeah.

1797
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:33.550
Then he was clean for a while and then they talked about him going,

1798
01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:36.850
I remember reading about him going to get help.
Like,

1799
01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:39.820
I wouldn't say within the last year to do something,
you know,

1800
01:43:39.821 --> 01:43:43.690
like some type of rehab thing in the last year and then uh,
yeah,

1801
01:43:43.691 --> 01:43:44.830
that's really a bummer man.

1802
01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:48.210
Well the thing about him too is he died with a needle in his arm and his arm.

1803
01:43:48.211 --> 01:43:52.160
Yeah.
So he really,
he over did it.
Well,
he just did it.

1804
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:54.560
He's not the only one either that's dying.

1805
01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:57.590
Apparently there's quite a few people have died in the east coast,

1806
01:43:57.890 --> 01:44:00.350
Maryland recently.
Yeah.
They're thinking is a,

1807
01:44:00.351 --> 01:44:04.250
there's a bad batch of heroin or a strong batch of heroin or something.
Wow.

1808
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:09.230
He was so good.
Holy Shit.
Was he a talented actor?
That guy,
man.
Unbelievable.

1809
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:13.700
Well,
I think that some of the people that are able to like encapsulate those

1810
01:44:13.701 --> 01:44:17.850
incredible characters,
he able to fit themselves into those characters.

1811
01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:23.200
A lot of those people are fucking crazy.
Like Robert Downey jr crazy.
You know,

1812
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:25.790
it would go off on wild benders and do drugs.

1813
01:44:25.791 --> 01:44:29.240
Like there's a lot of those people that are like really good at acting.

1814
01:44:29.241 --> 01:44:32.840
There are sort of attracted to that.
Then that chaos and war.

1815
01:44:32.841 --> 01:44:37.430
Maybe it's just a part of what makes them a great actors.
You're really,

1816
01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:38.990
if you're a great,
great actor,

1817
01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:43.130
you have a sensitivity that's like maybe heightened,
you know,
you're sensitive.

1818
01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.550
I mean emotionally all around.
And um,
you know,

1819
01:44:46.551 --> 01:44:49.220
sometimes when you have that sense of you can be drawn in and certain other

1820
01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.560
directions,
you know.
Yeah.
So,

1821
01:44:51.561 --> 01:44:56.290
but he a man Hoffman was just genius actor.
Yeah.
He was a bad motherfucker.

1822
01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:57.153
Yeah.
You know,

1823
01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:01.070
it's sad when you see a guy like that just to come to their demons,
you know,

1824
01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:05.360
really is too bad.
That's a weird one too,
that heroin one's a weird one,
you know,

1825
01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:08.570
because people are talking about like legalizing all drugs.

1826
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:12.140
All drugs should be legal.
And it a way I support that.

1827
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:14.000
But in another way I'm like,

1828
01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:19.120
it would suck to see more people do heroin.
It really would.

1829
01:45:19.130 --> 01:45:23.540
Crystal meth because what I'm seeing now with pills,
I've met several people.

1830
01:45:23.541 --> 01:45:27.440
I know several people.
I know one guy very well that died from pills.

1831
01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:29.030
I know one guy,
uh,

1832
01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:32.660
very close to my family who fucked up his entire life on pills and he's still a

1833
01:45:32.661 --> 01:45:36.140
mass and he used to be a great guy and he's just a rack and it's all opiates,

1834
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:40.160
all opiates,
you know,
and then you see this guy and you go like,
fuck man.

1835
01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:44.900
Like if it was illegal,
would it be even more prevalent?
Like I would hope not,

1836
01:45:44.901 --> 01:45:49.100
but God,
it's just,
I'm not,
I'm just anti heroin.

1837
01:45:49.101 --> 01:45:53.930
I think heroin's a terrible drug to live your life with.
It just,
yeah.

1838
01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:59.140
There's nobody really who was like doing well thriving with heroin.

1839
01:45:59.450 --> 01:46:03.170
You know,
the crazy thing is how long some people can function.
Yeah.

1840
01:46:03.171 --> 01:46:06.470
And there's people that can function and there's people that actually probably

1841
01:46:06.471 --> 01:46:10.430
never get to the point where they're not able to function.
You know,

1842
01:46:10.431 --> 01:46:14.310
there's people that can keep it in check,
but I think for the most part,
um,

1843
01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:16.340
it just goes down hill for you.
Well,

1844
01:46:16.341 --> 01:46:20.030
one of the problems with these pill people is that they're not even trying to

1845
01:46:20.031 --> 01:46:24.620
get high.
They're trying to not be sick.
Right.
Cause your body's craving it.

1846
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:25.231
Yeah.

1847
01:46:25.231 --> 01:46:30.231
You get so addicted to these opiate pills that your body is just trying to get

1848
01:46:30.891 --> 01:46:32.960
to a base level.
It's not trying to,

1849
01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:36.320
it's not trying to get high as much as it's trying to get out of a deficit.

1850
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:41.320
So you give it these pills and then you like sort of feel normal for awhile.

1851
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:44.060
Yeah.
It's just so scary.
Yeah,
it is.
I mean,

1852
01:46:44.061 --> 01:46:46.880
I knew somebody who had a bad drinking problem and,

1853
01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:50.070
and would like when went into,
you know,

1854
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:54.720
withdrawal would drink never really to get drunk.
It was because there's sewage,

1855
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:57.810
such an alcoholic that,
you know,

1856
01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:03.060
she would drink just to Maine,
like to not be shaking and sweating.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1857
01:47:03.061 --> 01:47:07.380
That's what I've don't,
I don't understand because I,
I,
I've had many drinks.

1858
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:09.390
Yeah.
I don't get the alcohol one.

1859
01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:13.320
I don't understand how that could be addicted to somewhat addictive to somebody

1860
01:47:13.930 --> 01:47:16.890
for,
yeah.
But I do understand,
obviously it's a matte painting.

1861
01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:21.240
Many people are addicted to it,
but just for me,
it's just,
I don't understand.

1862
01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.140
It just seems,
uh,

1863
01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:27.240
it's just so strange that their body is craving alcohol.
Like it's a,

1864
01:47:27.241 --> 01:47:29.520
it's not just,
uh,
an emotional thing.
I mean,

1865
01:47:29.521 --> 01:47:31.100
they say that that's what happened with,
um,

1866
01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:35.910
an Amy Winehouse that she died from going cold Turkey.
Really?
Yeah.

1867
01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:38.010
She only had alcohol in her system when she died.

1868
01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:42.300
She didn't have any drugs and with her body just went into this.

1869
01:47:42.301 --> 01:47:46.770
I suspect that she tried to quit drinking and it just,
uh,

1870
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:50.770
Santa or over the edge.
Yeah.
That makes since I believe it,
man,
I,

1871
01:47:50.771 --> 01:47:55.320
I'm just glad I don't have that fucking,
that gene.
Yeah.
Or you know,
I mean,

1872
01:47:55.321 --> 01:47:56.154
I've never,

1873
01:47:56.580 --> 01:48:01.050
I drink once and if I drink once in a week and I'd have to major race,
I'm like,

1874
01:48:01.051 --> 01:48:05.230
man,
I'm not drinking it.
I don't drink again for like weeks man.
Really?
Yeah.

1875
01:48:05.730 --> 01:48:08.310
Yeah.
I haven't never,
you know,
that's just my own makeup.

1876
01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:11.380
When you used to hang out more locally at comedy clubs every night,

1877
01:48:11.381 --> 01:48:14.550
it used to probably go through that where you're like at a club every single

1878
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:18.240
night.
Did you drink more back then?
Yeah,
not really because I never,
I never,

1879
01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:23.100
ever drank before sets.
So the most I ever did was drink after sets.

1880
01:48:23.101 --> 01:48:25.860
But if I was just doing spots and hanging out a little bit,

1881
01:48:25.861 --> 01:48:28.710
I'd be more worried about like,
you know,
I be worried about driving home.

1882
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.870
So it wasn't a regular practice for me.

1883
01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:34.170
Like I've just never been that big of a drinker,
you know?
I mean,

1884
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:36.490
I'll have more drinks on the road.
Um,

1885
01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:41.010
but sometimes a lot of times I go to clubs and,
um,
Saturday he'll be,

1886
01:48:41.011 --> 01:48:44.130
the first time I asked for a drink and they'll all say like,
oh,

1887
01:48:44.131 --> 01:48:46.170
we didn't know you drank.
And I'm like,
what were you talking about it?

1888
01:48:46.170 --> 01:48:49.410
And they're like,
yeah,
we thought that it was so weird that you don't drink.
And,

1889
01:48:49.411 --> 01:48:53.730
um,
you know,
I was like,
no,
I'm just done now.
You know?
So yeah,

1890
01:48:53.731 --> 01:48:57.390
alcohol is fun.
It's fun,
it's fun to drink.
It's fun to get drunk,

1891
01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:01.580
but the problem is the effect on your body.
It's just so bad.
And,
uh,

1892
01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:03.750
Tommy and I have been talking about this because for the last two weeks I

1893
01:49:03.751 --> 01:49:08.020
haven't drank.
Wow.
I tried to see what it's like to have nothing exciting.

1894
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:10.410
I like glass of wine with dinner on Friday night,

1895
01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:13.950
but one glass of wine and that's it.
No like getting hammered.
No getting drunk.

1896
01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:18.150
No getting buzz,
no nothing.
Yup.
You,
you feel remarkably better.

1897
01:49:18.170 --> 01:49:20.070
You do Monday rolls around.
Remarkably.

1898
01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:23.760
So it's been two weeks in a row that I did this.
Like my endurance is up.

1899
01:49:23.761 --> 01:49:27.390
I mean it sounds so Duh.
You know,
it sounds so obvious,

1900
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:30.510
but you just think if you're out at a comedy club,

1901
01:49:30.511 --> 01:49:32.730
you're hanging out with your buddies,
you won't do a shot.
Yeah,
fuck it.

1902
01:49:32.731 --> 01:49:35.280
Let's do a shot.
Let's do another one.
Okay,
let's have a beer.

1903
01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:36.540
Three or four drinks.

1904
01:49:36.541 --> 01:49:39.330
You feel like it's nothing and it really is nothing but a difference between

1905
01:49:39.331 --> 01:49:42.810
three or four drinks and no drinks.
It's pretty significant.

1906
01:49:42.811 --> 01:49:45.360
And how much better you feel?
It's,
it's tremendously different.

1907
01:49:45.361 --> 01:49:48.010
I mean a few weeks ago I had a few drinks and I

1908
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:53.010
<v 1>really feel like it took me like totally to recover was like 48 72 hours to feel</v>

1909
01:49:53.351 --> 01:49:56.970
like a hundred percent better.
It was crazy.
It took like three days.
Yeah.

1910
01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:59.710
I feel that much better.
I never drank at home.
I only drink if I go out,

1911
01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:00.431
say like I,

1912
01:50:00.431 --> 01:50:03.820
I never said it home look like open up a beer or anything that unless it's like

1913
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.980
at night and I'm the girls that were about to go to bed,

1914
01:50:05.981 --> 01:50:07.990
I need to have one more drink in her.

1915
01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:13.510
<v 2>Oh,
how dare you
to a lot of feminists,
by the way.</v>

1916
01:50:14.110 --> 01:50:15.580
Do you know that and aware of that?
Yeah.

1917
01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:18.400
They got to push that Mr. Conrad and shove that down your throat.

1918
01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:19.533
You're going to be a rapist.

1919
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:22.900
But you know what's funny about that whole lot of feminist things that they're

1920
01:50:22.901 --> 01:50:25.750
saying that that works the other way around too with women and men that if the

1921
01:50:25.751 --> 01:50:27.940
man is drunk and the woman's so over,
the woman's raping the man,

1922
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:31.570
I feel that way a hundred percent support that I had been raped.

1923
01:50:31.630 --> 01:50:33.730
They have to say that it ridiculous.

1924
01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:36.670
They have to say that they can't say there's a double standard.
Right.

1925
01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.590
Nobody wants to admit there's double standards.
Right.

1926
01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:41.540
It's double standards don't exist.
Especially in like the,

1927
01:50:41.541 --> 01:50:45.910
the super liberal left wing progressive world.
It's the same on both sides.

1928
01:50:46.090 --> 01:50:48.130
So I was watching,
I was reading this,
uh,

1929
01:50:48.131 --> 01:50:52.240
this person's blog where they were talking about everyone who has sex with

1930
01:50:52.241 --> 01:50:56.540
someone who's drinking is being a rapist.
And she was talking about men as well.

1931
01:50:56.541 --> 01:51:00.670
Like men being drunk.
That a woman taking advantage.
Yes ladies that is rape.

1932
01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:04.270
Like what are you talking about?
The guy has a few drinks,

1933
01:51:04.271 --> 01:51:07.420
he's buzzed and he comes over and he wants to fuck and you have sex with them.

1934
01:51:07.421 --> 01:51:08.254
You're a rapist.

1935
01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:13.150
That is so fucking dumb and so symptomatic.

1936
01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:18.300
So like symbolic of like what's wrong with that sort of rigid like liberal

1937
01:51:19.211 --> 01:51:23.050
thinking is this,
there are no debits.
The double standards,

1938
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:28.050
<v 1>I mean one of the major differences is that in that situation we are thrilled to</v>

1939
01:51:28.051 --> 01:51:28.884
be raped.

1940
01:51:31.710 --> 01:51:35.590
<v 2>It's not rape whether the man has a limited inhibitions or not.</v>

1941
01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:39.880
That man wants to have sex.
If a guy comes to your house,

1942
01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:43.990
it's like if a guy goes to a bar,
gets drunk,
take a cab to your house,

1943
01:51:43.991 --> 01:51:47.700
let's make it a responsible story.
The guy takes a cab to your house and you,
uh,

1944
01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:52.450
throw him on the bed and fuck him.
That's not rape.
It's just not,

1945
01:51:52.451 --> 01:51:53.890
no,
it's just not.

1946
01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:58.810
It's just not and pretending that it is because you don't want women to be taken

1947
01:51:58.811 --> 01:52:00.880
advantage of.
And they'll like compared to like Steubenville,

1948
01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:02.770
like that the girl who was a,

1949
01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:06.640
she was so drunk that she was unconscious and these guys raped her.
Horrible,

1950
01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:11.620
unbelievably horrible,
unbelievably horrible and disgusting.

1951
01:52:11.621 --> 01:52:13.300
And it's a crime and it's evil.

1952
01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:18.540
Does the saying that a man being drunk is having sex with a woman?

1953
01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:23.940
Is that man being raped diminishes the impact of what's horrible about something

1954
01:52:24.311 --> 01:52:28.030
like Steubenville rape because you're being silly now.
Well,
you're,

1955
01:52:28.031 --> 01:52:33.031
you're saying something that is so preposterous that anyone with any logic could

1956
01:52:33.701 --> 01:52:36.790
immediately pick apart anyone who's had any experience.
Anyone who's a man,

1957
01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:37.540
by the way,

1958
01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:41.500
who's a heterosexual man who knows what it's like to have a couple of drinks and

1959
01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:43.510
uh,
and want to go have sex.

1960
01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:47.630
Like the idea that that is somehow or another race because you went over someone

1961
01:52:47.631 --> 01:52:50.540
who obviously you like,
you obviously liked this person,
you've,

1962
01:52:50.541 --> 01:52:54.160
I've obviously have it most likely have had sex with them before you go over

1963
01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:57.800
their house.
Yeah,
the Fuck Outta here.
I would even argue that if you,

1964
01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:02.640
if you're a man and you took a cab to that woman's house and she handcuffed you

1965
01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:06.890
to a bed and blindfolded you and put a ball gag in your mouth and fucked you,

1966
01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:08.870
that you also had a good time.
Like it wasn't,

1967
01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:11.210
it wasn't something that you were fighting,
you know,

1968
01:53:11.211 --> 01:53:15.200
or even able to getting tied up.
So it's on you fucker.

1969
01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:17.270
I mean other thing.
Yeah.

1970
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:20.270
Have you ever been in a situation that where you felt like he had a girl in your

1971
01:53:20.271 --> 01:53:23.390
bed and he didn't want to have sex with her bed?
You're a man,

1972
01:53:23.391 --> 01:53:26.630
you have a girl in your bed.
What are you doing?
Like,
if you're a man,

1973
01:53:26.631 --> 01:53:27.441
you have a girl in your bed,

1974
01:53:27.441 --> 01:53:31.400
what kind of stupid game you playing can nine by now doing really me,

1975
01:53:31.401 --> 01:53:34.670
I just don't feel good about our relationship yet.
Shut up.

1976
01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:37.010
If you're a grown adult,
you're not a 10 year old.

1977
01:53:37.011 --> 01:53:42.011
You're not someone who's confused about biology and about sexuality and about,

1978
01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:47.210
you know,
stimulation and attractiveness.
No,
you're a fucking adult.

1979
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:51.860
You can't get raped.
King of rape by a girl.
Jesus Christ.
Brian,

1980
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:55.940
it's one thing if you like Brian,
the only thing that can be really crazy is if,

1981
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:58.160
okay,
here's the scenario.
Um,

1982
01:53:58.190 --> 01:54:02.480
some sort of a survival situation where you're fleeing the country and you have

1983
01:54:02.690 --> 01:54:05.480
your friend's wife with you and you,
uh,

1984
01:54:05.481 --> 01:54:10.190
you have to stay in a hotel together because there's only a enough money for one

1985
01:54:10.191 --> 01:54:12.710
hotel room and just going to get some sleep and then get on the road and you're

1986
01:54:12.711 --> 01:54:13.640
like,
I'll sleep on the floor.

1987
01:54:13.641 --> 01:54:16.330
You take the bed and then while you're sleeping and you wake up and she's

1988
01:54:16.331 --> 01:54:19.190
talking to your deck,
you're like,
okay,
you just fucking ruined my life.

1989
01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:22.880
You ruined my life by being crazy and suck my dick while I'm sleeping.
Hey,

1990
01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:26.750
you know,
you kind of raping me.
Stop,
stop it.
I wouldn't have said Yes for you.

1991
01:54:26.751 --> 01:54:29.690
Suck on my Dick.
Or if I was awake,
wait,
wait a couple minutes now stop it.

1992
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:35.630
That is probably one of the very few scenarios that I could see where there

1993
01:54:35.631 --> 01:54:40.450
could be argued that a woman rapes the guy.
Yeah.
There's kind of like,
uh,
what's,

1994
01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:44.570
what's the one,
it's a single white female.
They kind of have that,
that scenario.

1995
01:54:44.590 --> 01:54:45.230
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1996
01:54:45.230 --> 01:54:47.960
Where pretends to be someone that she tries to pretend and she called and he's

1997
01:54:47.961 --> 01:54:51.220
like,
what's going on?
She's like,
well,
while she's choking on his cot,

1998
01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:53.870
and then he's like,
it's not even you.
So he got duped.
Right.

1999
01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:56.660
That's another one that's kind of rapey.
Yeah,
that's kind of rapey.

2000
01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:59.430
But that they'll finish and we'll talk about it,

2001
01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:08.030
but come on.
But a woman being drunk is always right.
If the woman's drunk there,

2002
01:55:08.031 --> 01:55:10.250
they want that to be raped and they want it.
I mean,

2003
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:15.260
obviously there's a broad spectrum of,
of,
of intoxication.

2004
01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:19.340
You know like one drink,
two drinks,
three drinks for drinks.

2005
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:23.120
One drink is you can make good decisions on one drink,

2006
01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:25.190
you can but you're drinking two drinks.

2007
01:55:25.191 --> 01:55:28.130
You could still make really good decisions on drinks but you're drinking.

2008
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.900
So like if,

2009
01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:32.840
if you have sex with someone who can make good decisions and it's two drinks in

2010
01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:36.620
the idea that you say that's rape,
you're a crazy person,
you're a crazy person.

2011
01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:37.180
Like you're,

2012
01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:40.970
you're a person who's dangerous because you're fucking up the whole idea and

2013
01:55:40.971 --> 01:55:44.340
argument.
The whole conversation about alcohol intoxication,

2014
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:48.750
you Rooney a bit by being unreasonable,
by taking this hard rigid stance,

2015
01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:53.900
you diminish the effect of something like Steubenville were where they are

2016
01:55:53.970 --> 01:55:57.630
getting someone so fucked up and taking advantage of someone who is so fucked up

2017
01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:01.590
and the way to kind of reel,
you know,
state your position is,

2018
01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:03.660
are you going to look at those two and say they're equivalent.

2019
01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:08.910
If you say they're equivalent,
then okay,
I guess we have your point of view on,

2020
01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:11.710
on,
you know,
the severity of,
of each of the,

2021
01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:14.640
but I think a reasonable person looks at those and you realize that they're not.

2022
01:56:14.641 --> 01:56:18.510
So it's kind of ridiculous.
Well,
it's a completely logical stance to take that.

2023
01:56:18.511 --> 01:56:21.780
It's a,
an on and off switch.
It's either on your,

2024
01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:26.490
there's an alcohol drink in,
in the system.
Uh,
it's,
it's that way.
It's rape.

2025
01:56:26.970 --> 01:56:31.120
There's no alcohol.
It's not rape.
Right.
Same Act.
Ridiculous.
Yeah.
There's,

2026
01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:35.970
it's clear that there's a certain point where someone is unable to make clear

2027
01:56:35.971 --> 01:56:38.580
decisions.
They're fucked up.
They're intoxicated.

2028
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.710
But where that lies is,
is very blurry.
And it's different for every person.

2029
01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:46.680
Yeah.
And some not some girls,
God damn it,

2030
01:56:46.681 --> 01:56:48.780
a lot of girls like to get drunk and get fucked.

2031
01:56:49.290 --> 01:56:52.080
They'd like to have sex with people that want to have sex with when they have a

2032
01:56:52.081 --> 01:56:53.970
few drinks,
they like it a lot.

2033
01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:57.720
So the idea that people say that that's rape because,

2034
01:56:59.010 --> 01:57:02.460
because of whatever,
because you want to push this ridiculous progressive agenda.

2035
01:57:02.461 --> 01:57:07.461
And this idea that anyone having a couple of drinks is somehow or another so

2036
01:57:07.741 --> 01:57:12.270
incapacitated that they're like a child like the we have to protect them.
Yeah,

2037
01:57:12.271 --> 01:57:17.180
I guess they're not making the distinction that there's a difference between a

2038
01:57:17.190 --> 01:57:22.190
woman choosing to have drinks and go have sex and a woman who has had too many

2039
01:57:24.631 --> 01:57:27.480
drinks in someone is,
you know,
taking advantage of her.

2040
01:57:27.481 --> 01:57:29.790
I mean the two totally different things.
Well not only that,

2041
01:57:29.791 --> 01:57:33.610
there's also the woman and the man if they're both drinking,
right.

2042
01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:36.930
Then what happens when the woman is almost always in the clear,

2043
01:57:37.290 --> 01:57:40.860
no one is accusing her.
No one's saying,
you know,
this woman raped me.
I,
you know,

2044
01:57:40.861 --> 01:57:43.800
we had drinks together and she raped me.
How many drinks did you have?
Two.

2045
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:47.830
How many drinks did she have to,
yeah man,
she raped you.
No one says that.
Right?

2046
01:57:47.850 --> 01:57:49.410
It doesn't say,
but I do say it to the guy.

2047
01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:51.750
He would say it to the guy like in the girl could say,
oh,

2048
01:57:51.751 --> 01:57:55.050
I got too drunk to consent and then you know,
toddler talk,

2049
01:57:55.051 --> 01:57:57.560
progressive think everybody's like,
oh,
it is rape.

2050
01:57:57.561 --> 01:57:59.610
To have sex with someone who's drinking.
No,
no,

2051
01:57:59.611 --> 01:58:03.090
it's raped sometimes to have sex with someone who's drinking is to say that

2052
01:58:03.091 --> 01:58:06.120
you're not responsible for your own actions sexually,
but you are.

2053
01:58:06.121 --> 01:58:10.140
When you're driving a car,
you are.
When you know you assault someone,

2054
01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:11.760
you know you're responsible.

2055
01:58:11.761 --> 01:58:13.770
If you kick someone's ass and hurt them and you're like,

2056
01:58:13.771 --> 01:58:16.980
I'm so sorry I was drunk.
You're responsible for that.

2057
01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:20.760
You are fucking responsible for your actions,
but you're not sexually.

2058
01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:22.470
You know,

2059
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:25.380
if your girlfriend comes home and she's hammered and she beats the fuck out of

2060
01:58:25.381 --> 01:58:27.420
you and hits you over the head with a hammer and you go to the hospital,

2061
01:58:27.421 --> 01:58:31.410
your fucking heads gashed open.
She can't say I was drinking,

2062
01:58:31.890 --> 01:58:33.690
so I'm not responsible for that violence.

2063
01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:37.670
But if she comes over your house and she's drunk and cheap fucks you that,

2064
01:58:38.970 --> 01:58:41.960
then you're a rapist because you,
you didn't,
you,

2065
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.520
<v 0>you didn't take into account the fact that she's not responsible for our actions</v>

2066
01:58:45.521 --> 01:58:48.520
cause she's had a couple of drinks.
It's madness.

2067
01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:51.010
It's so illogical and they,

2068
01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:56.040
they're so rigid on this because they want to support 100% women and women's

2069
01:58:56.081 --> 01:58:57.160
rights and the,
uh,

2070
01:58:57.180 --> 01:59:00.840
the idea of not supporting rape culture and the idea of diminishing rape and

2071
01:59:00.841 --> 01:59:01.540
society,

2072
01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:06.430
but by being so rigid and by being postural and illogical,

2073
01:59:06.670 --> 01:59:11.140
you ruin the whole discussion because we're on your side where you and I are

2074
01:59:11.141 --> 01:59:11.870
100% on,

2075
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:16.750
on their side as far as like someone being drunk and you take advantage of that

2076
01:59:16.751 --> 01:59:18.670
person.
Right.
That's disgusting.

2077
01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:21.840
What they're trying to say is that there is no scale.
Exactly.
It's just,

2078
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:23.260
it's black and white.
It's black and white.

2079
01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:25.870
You can't say that because you ruined the whole discussion.

2080
01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:27.820
You ruin it because we all know,

2081
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:32.860
most of us know people who like to drink and fuck.
It's so common.

2082
01:59:33.190 --> 01:59:38.020
It's so normal,
you know,
drink to get frisky.
That's people are married,

2083
01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:42.190
they drink and they start making out and it's great.
Yeah.
It's not bad.

2084
01:59:42.191 --> 01:59:45.430
They loosened inhibitions,
so it's not bad.

2085
01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:50.460
The idea that alcohol is bad across the board for everybody is fucking stupid.

2086
01:59:51.521 --> 01:59:55.360
It's stupid.
It's stupid.
It's just bad.
For your body.
That's what,

2087
01:59:55.361 --> 01:59:58.090
this is the only thing that you could prove for sure that's bad for your body.

2088
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:03.640
It's just one of those weird things,
man.
Where people who are intelligent,

2089
02:00:03.641 --> 02:00:07.360
who have good intentions and there's good meaning behind what they're trying to

2090
02:00:07.361 --> 02:00:11.890
do,
they fuck it all up with their ego and they fuck it all up with their rigid

2091
02:00:11.891 --> 02:00:15.760
thinking and they fucked it all up because they're not being open and objective

2092
02:00:15.761 --> 02:00:18.610
about the entire discussion.
This situation.
Yeah,
it's a,
it's,

2093
02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:22.870
it's the same thing I feel like with judging a people as black and white.
Yeah.

2094
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:24.850
I feel like most people are complex,

2095
02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:29.550
more complicated in varying degrees of good and bad.
And you know,

2096
02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:33.410
they're complicated.
Well,
you could easily put,
you know,

2097
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:36.760
generalizations like there was a generalization,
um,

2098
02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:40.540
someone who was talking about standup comics and they were saying that a comedy

2099
02:00:40.541 --> 02:00:43.660
clubs are filled with angry men and that's what comic hubs are.
Okay.

2100
02:00:43.710 --> 02:00:47.500
That's a giant generalization.
What do you do?
What if Sarah Silverman,

2101
02:00:47.501 --> 02:00:51.720
Eliza slessinger on stage?
It's still angry men that are now,

2102
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:56.470
it's silly.
It's silly.
Some comedians are angry men.
So are some mechanics.

2103
02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:01.240
Yeah.
Yeah.
So are so are some fucking bouncers.
There's some people that uh,

2104
02:01:01.241 --> 02:01:05.080
you know,
work in finance.
They're angry men.
Okay.
Some of them are,

2105
02:01:05.081 --> 02:01:08.260
aren't generalizations are fucking stupid.
They're gross.

2106
02:01:08.261 --> 02:01:10.720
So funny because when I hear those things,
like I always think of,

2107
02:01:11.050 --> 02:01:15.520
I'm thinking comedy comics that I know what always pops in my mind is just

2108
02:01:15.521 --> 02:01:19.660
silliness.
Yeah.
I don't think of like,
I think of like all the goofy,

2109
02:01:19.661 --> 02:01:23.710
silly kind of,
yeah.
You know,
like,
well,
last hanging out in the weekend.

2110
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:26.710
What do we do?
Are laughing all the time.
We're laughing,
angry.

2111
02:01:26.711 --> 02:01:30.940
90% of the time we're not angry at shit.
You know,
the idea that,
I mean,
look,

2112
02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:35.830
we all know dudes who are,
we all know this,
but we all know an equal or more,

2113
02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.260
a greater amount of dudes who aren't like Norton.

2114
02:01:38.261 --> 02:01:40.190
We're hanging with Norton all weekend.
Norton's

2115
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:44.930
<v 2>fucking great.
He's an angry,
he comes off like fake angry for jokes,
for free,</v>

2116
02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:49.990
for funny.
But he's filled with humility.
He's a very like,
uh,

2117
02:01:50.250 --> 02:01:51.860
self objective guy.

2118
02:01:51.861 --> 02:01:56.360
He's always like being introspective and talking about the way he behaves,

2119
02:01:56.361 --> 02:02:00.870
the way he thinks.
And he's always like criticizing himself,
you know,

2120
02:02:00.871 --> 02:02:04.400
and the idea that he's like this angry guy.

2121
02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:07.850
I was going to say that is that people also assume that um,

2122
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:09.223
they'll say the anger,

2123
02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:13.640
the anger with a respect to like somebody doing something on stage and they'll

2124
02:02:13.641 --> 02:02:17.420
have no idea that that person's not like that offstage.
That that's a heightened

2125
02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:24.140
version of themselves for their act,
for humor,
for humor.
Like,
you know,

2126
02:02:24.141 --> 02:02:25.850
like Brian Holtzman,

2127
02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:29.750
who was one of my favorite comedians or for some whatever reason,

2128
02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:32.690
just it never really caught on with people he used to,

2129
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:36.590
his whole act was this angry man who would say cruel,

2130
02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:41.090
evil shit and we would be dying laughing because he's not like that at all.

2131
02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:42.710
If you talked to Holtzman off stage,

2132
02:02:42.711 --> 02:02:45.980
he's laughing and he's shaking people's hands.
Hey ally.
Yeah,
what's going on?

2133
02:02:45.981 --> 02:02:48.560
Yeah.
Good to see you.
Hey,
good time up there.
You were really funny.

2134
02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:50.000
He's a funny guy.

2135
02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.300
But then he would do this character on stage where it was just like,

2136
02:02:53.950 --> 02:02:57.380
like Susan Smith,
when she drowned her kids,
he was like,

2137
02:02:57.381 --> 02:03:00.920
I heard those were bad kids.
Or those kids sat that close to the TV.

2138
02:03:00.921 --> 02:03:04.250
They didn't put away their blocks there were spilling their milk.
I was fucking,

2139
02:03:04.251 --> 02:03:05.120
kids were not be missed.

2140
02:03:05.690 --> 02:03:10.690
And it was so horrible but so funny how to be there to see it happen when the

2141
02:03:11.091 --> 02:03:12.260
tension was in the room.

2142
02:03:12.261 --> 02:03:15.950
Cause it was like two weeks after that woman drowned her kids.
You know,

2143
02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:19.760
that's a hilarious,
like a position to take that you have to commit her.

2144
02:03:19.761 --> 02:03:21.470
Those kids went bad.
That's how he says it.

2145
02:03:22.130 --> 02:03:25.130
They always fucking spelled that milk didn't put away their blocks.

2146
02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:28.580
I sat that closer to the TV.
Yeah.
Those kids will not be missed.

2147
02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:31.130
And the way he would say it was just so fucking,

2148
02:03:31.131 --> 02:03:35.810
the key to in like in those types of jokes is that you can never pull back on it

2149
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:39.470
once you say it.
Yeah.
You gotta go all in.
Like now they were really bad.

2150
02:03:39.471 --> 02:03:41.630
Kept telling you.
I know,
you know?
Yeah.

2151
02:03:41.690 --> 02:03:45.080
You have to like believe what you're saying.
Yeah.

2152
02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:48.470
And it's not real.
No,
of course not.
That's the whole fucking,

2153
02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:53.150
that's why we know we can laugh at it.
It's a real issue with uh,

2154
02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:56.900
with progressive's this idea that you're going to silence that kind of thinking

2155
02:03:56.901 --> 02:04:00.620
and talking,
you know,
silence that kind of a,
those kinds of jokes.

2156
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.140
And I see the point,
I see that you're trying to make a kinder,

2157
02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:05.360
gentler world for people to live in,

2158
02:04:05.361 --> 02:04:10.361
but I really feel like concentrating on jokes is a bad idea.

2159
02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:11.970
It is.
It's it,

2160
02:04:11.971 --> 02:04:16.971
it ruins the whole idea of trying to make people or at least diminishes the

2161
02:04:17.301 --> 02:04:20.900
whole idea of trying to make people in Nice in real life when they really mean

2162
02:04:20.901 --> 02:04:23.270
it and really care because you're not focusing on that.

2163
02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:24.740
Instead you're focusing on one,

2164
02:04:24.741 --> 02:04:28.880
they don't mean it and they're joking around like in the idea that somehow under

2165
02:04:28.881 --> 02:04:32.330
that joking around fuels the actual act,

2166
02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:36.620
the actual act of violence or the actual act of rape or the actual act of

2167
02:04:36.621 --> 02:04:38.910
anything evil or mean.

2168
02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:43.320
Because joking around about it is somehow or another gives a green light.

2169
02:04:43.530 --> 02:04:46.230
That's such a silly idea.
That's so silly.

2170
02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:49.680
If you have a problem with rape or if you have a problem with violence,

2171
02:04:49.681 --> 02:04:51.720
if you're a problem with a assaults,

2172
02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:57.150
do something that remedies the root cause of that and you'll find that it's not

2173
02:04:57.151 --> 02:04:57.984
jokes.

2174
02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:02.190
Nobody watched a comedy show was inspired to go rape somebody.

2175
02:05:02.191 --> 02:05:06.180
The idea behind that is fucking ridiculous.
The idea that it gives a green light,

2176
02:05:06.210 --> 02:05:09.690
you watch a comedy show and someone talks about beating the shit out of people.

2177
02:05:09.691 --> 02:05:12.900
It gives a green light to go out and beat the shit out of people.
That's no,

2178
02:05:12.901 --> 02:05:16.430
that's a defective person.
If that's the case,
you can't under their fucking mind.

2179
02:05:16.431 --> 02:05:20.760
You can't make your art only for defective people.
It's fucking stupid.

2180
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:21.690
It is.

2181
02:05:21.690 --> 02:05:25.950
But it's a lot of that progressive mindset that this progressive black and white

2182
02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:29.010
mindset,
this left wing liberal mindset,

2183
02:05:29.011 --> 02:05:32.940
that it ruins those discussions because yeah,

2184
02:05:32.941 --> 02:05:36.990
we do need to be nicer to each other.
Fucking,
yeah,
for sure.
We need less racism.

2185
02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:41.670
Absolutely.
We need less sexism.
Absolutely.
We need less assault.

2186
02:05:41.790 --> 02:05:45.300
We need less rape.
We need less violence.
We need last road rage.

2187
02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:48.660
We need less everything all across the board.
We need less of that.

2188
02:05:49.170 --> 02:05:51.930
But we're on your side and you're,

2189
02:05:51.931 --> 02:05:55.200
you're making us look like there's something wrong with us because we want to

2190
02:05:55.201 --> 02:05:56.034
drink and fuck.

2191
02:05:56.250 --> 02:05:59.610
You're making us look like there's something wrong with us because we enjoy a

2192
02:05:59.611 --> 02:06:03.630
ridiculous joke that someone doesn't really mean that's really cruel and nasty.

2193
02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:06.090
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you,
um,

2194
02:06:06.630 --> 02:06:11.600
if you really think that that comedy is the problem,
you're,

2195
02:06:11.610 --> 02:06:14.130
you're just gonna,
you're just going to make yourself look ridiculous.

2196
02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:17.190
You're going to get a very few people that agree with your point of view.

2197
02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:20.100
They're like,
yeah,
yeah.
Just get people to stop talking about anything that,

2198
02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:24.450
that could be offensive and you're just going to end up not making the progress

2199
02:06:24.451 --> 02:06:27.270
you are wishing for.
Yeah.
And the idea of trigger warnings,

2200
02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:29.340
that's the other thing.
Let's trigger warnings.

2201
02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:34.230
When people write blogs like super progressive,
uh,
people when they write blogs,

2202
02:06:34.231 --> 02:06:37.620
if they talk about rape or anything,
violence or crime,

2203
02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:42.140
they will put trigger warning in there.
A trigger warning like,
uh,

2204
02:06:42.180 --> 02:06:46.770
like to let you know that something horrible is coming up and it might trigger

2205
02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:49.460
posttraumatic stress like yeah,

2206
02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:53.730
if you say if you got beat up and robbed and someone's writing about,
you know,

2207
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:54.940
like robbery and they'll,

2208
02:06:54.941 --> 02:06:58.980
they'll put trigger warning and like the title a trigger warning and the thing

2209
02:06:58.981 --> 02:07:03.030
and then explain what they're talking about so that you get warned that they're

2210
02:07:03.031 --> 02:07:05.160
going to talk about assault or there you get Warren,

2211
02:07:05.161 --> 02:07:08.310
they're going to talk about rape or sexual aggression or whatever the fuck it
is.

2212
02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:10.900
This trigger warning,
trigger warning.
Like it's,

2213
02:07:10.901 --> 02:07:15.840
it's a fascinating aspect of our society that you want to protect people from

2214
02:07:15.950 --> 02:07:19.520
just even thinking about something that might've happened to them that's been

2215
02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:22.800
upset you.
Yeah.
So though that subject,
whatever that subject is,

2216
02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:26.790
he's either off limits are severely limited because of the fact that someone

2217
02:07:26.791 --> 02:07:30.240
actually has been victimized and real life has kind of really ridiculous to me.

2218
02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:32.010
Fucking yeah,
it's for the well,

2219
02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:35.360
I mean cause you don't get trigger warnings when you're not doing it.

2220
02:07:35.410 --> 02:07:37.210
Aside from reading that fucking blog,

2221
02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:40.300
there's no trigger warnings on signs when you walk down the street.

2222
02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:43.690
There's no trigger warnings that when you have a conversation with somebody who

2223
02:07:43.691 --> 02:07:46.720
you might not know,
well,
they're not going to be like real quick.
In a moment,

2224
02:07:46.721 --> 02:07:49.240
I'm going to bring up fighting.
Just giving you a heads up.

2225
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:51.760
Didn't trigger warnings be a trigger warning?

2226
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:55.330
Like what didn't you think about rape?
If you give a trigger warning,

2227
02:07:55.370 --> 02:07:58.150
that wouldn't be a trigger warning,
but it would certainly be a trigger.

2228
02:07:58.450 --> 02:08:02.500
And you know every movie,
essentially every violent movie is a trigger.

2229
02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:05.260
A trigger to people who have experienced violence.
Of course,

2230
02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:09.850
every fucking television show on crime,
which almost all of them are.

2231
02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:13.720
I mean,
what percentage of television shows,
dramas or on crime?

2232
02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:19.080
What percentage of this Chicago police or CSI or this or CSI Miami,

2233
02:08:19.301 --> 02:08:22.450
New York,
CSI,
the moon,
there's fucking a hundred law and orders.

2234
02:08:22.451 --> 02:08:27.070
They're all on crime.
If you've experienced any violent crime in your life,

2235
02:08:27.071 --> 02:08:30.310
you know it's a horrible,
horrific,
traumatic event.

2236
02:08:30.630 --> 02:08:33.520
Post traumatic stress from crime victims is huge.

2237
02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:37.510
Yet every show on television that's a drama,

2238
02:08:37.511 --> 02:08:39.100
like a huge percentage of them.

2239
02:08:39.130 --> 02:08:44.130
It's probably like 30% of all late night or all a nighttime dramas are based on

2240
02:08:45.371 --> 02:08:50.050
crime.
Violent crime.
Murders to violence is so key.

2241
02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:54.700
It's so crazy when you,
when you watch
shows and they,

2242
02:08:54.701 --> 02:08:59.160
um,
they have violent scenes,
you know,
the edited version has the violent,

2243
02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:04.120
I can like a guy's getting his head fucking blown off and then they'll be like,

2244
02:09:04.121 --> 02:09:09.070
that's right bud.
You and you're like,
they just bleeped fuck you know,
that could,

2245
02:09:09.071 --> 02:09:13.720
we can't handle,
we can't handle hearing that tired of these hogwash.

2246
02:09:13.721 --> 02:09:15.880
And you're like,
well,
that's what he said.
No,
he said something else,

2247
02:09:16.090 --> 02:09:17.200
but we can't handle that.

2248
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:21.730
But we did see him pull out a 12 gauge and blow the guy's fucking guts all over

2249
02:09:21.731 --> 02:09:24.790
the place.
Well,
how about the walking dead?
Watch the walking dead,

2250
02:09:24.850 --> 02:09:26.950
the walking dead.
They're cutting people's heads off.

2251
02:09:27.070 --> 02:09:31.120
They're blowing people's heads up with guns,
but they never say fuck.

2252
02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:35.650
Never say fuck.
It's,
yeah.
It's so redundant that you,
you know,
you can't also,

2253
02:09:36.070 --> 02:09:40.300
God forbid they show a woman's breasts that would make your hair.
No,

2254
02:09:40.301 --> 02:09:44.020
you can't do that.
No pussies at all.
No,
don't show me where the babies come from,

2255
02:09:44.290 --> 02:09:45.760
where the babies are made.
Can't handle it.

2256
02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:49.600
But you can show me a lady with a Samurai Sword.
It cuts people in half.
Yeah.

2257
02:09:49.810 --> 02:09:51.040
She kills regular people too.

2258
02:09:51.041 --> 02:09:54.070
She doesn't just kill zombies because regular bunch of the people kill regular

2259
02:09:54.071 --> 02:09:57.820
people.
They've killed a hundred bunch of regular people on that show.
It's fun.

2260
02:09:58.220 --> 02:10:02.770
Yeah,
but I can't handle hearing shit.
What the fuck man,
we're weird.

2261
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:06.340
So weird.
What a stupid culture.
Well,
you know what?

2262
02:10:06.341 --> 02:10:08.860
I can't stop thinking about the guy,

2263
02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:14.260
the farted at the sink.
I think airport,

2264
02:10:14.650 --> 02:10:18.430
we talked about it for 10 minutes afterwards.
We'll Dude's Fart when they pee.

2265
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:22.230
Go to the bathroom.
Do to constantly far to in public restrooms.
Yeah,

2266
02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:26.830
but at the sink and the dude was washing his hands and he cut a monster fart.

2267
02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:31.060
And I told Tommy about it and I was like,
dude,
this guy,
he broke,

2268
02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:33.980
he broke the rule.
I walked out just this happened.
I

2269
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:37.790
<v 1>unfortunately missed the incident,
but you said it immediately and I was,</v>

2270
02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:40.970
I kept wrapping my head around it and I think what I've come to the conclusion

2271
02:10:41.210 --> 02:10:46.070
is that if you do that,
all I'm looking for is for you to acknowledge it.
Oops.

2272
02:10:46.150 --> 02:10:50.450
Yeah.
You need to say something.
I want you to say something about that.

2273
02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:55.160
Cause I was thinking about how,
uh,
an old guy one time farted next to me in,

2274
02:10:55.200 --> 02:11:00.110
um,
uh,
like on a tram and the in the airport and I was like,

2275
02:11:00.111 --> 02:11:03.890
Jesus,
he led a fucking pretty big fart.
And I looked at him and he goes,

2276
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:08.360
snuck out of me.
I was like,
all right.
And I kind of took away like,

2277
02:11:08.890 --> 02:11:11.150
you know what was upsetting him?
It,
yes.
I was like,
well,

2278
02:11:11.151 --> 02:11:14.180
thank you for acknowledging your fart right now.
Yeah.

2279
02:11:14.181 --> 02:11:17.840
This guy was just washing his hands and he just,
the sink is not the year.

2280
02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:20.990
I don't think you'd get a pass there.
Yeah,
it was.
It was definitely,

2281
02:11:22.450 --> 02:11:24.770
it was definitely a gray area.
It was definitely a greater,

2282
02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:27.880
people fart all the time at the urinals.
That's so common.
Yeah.

2283
02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:32.890
I heard a lot of farms get done zip up walk all the way around washing your

2284
02:11:32.991 --> 02:11:37.460
hands in the middle of Washington as you just unload and no one said a word.

2285
02:11:37.461 --> 02:11:42.200
Yeah,
everyone just let it go.
And then we got outside and I was like,
Yo Dude,

2286
02:11:42.201 --> 02:11:46.310
how do you feel about this?
I can't stop thinking about it.

2287
02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:49.520
And then we're trying to figure out what kind of far it's girls cut when they're

2288
02:11:49.521 --> 02:11:52.010
in the bathroom and whether or not they washed their hands and far nine each

2289
02:11:52.011 --> 02:11:55.820
other.
Probably not as much.
Not as much.
But they definitely drop heat in there.

2290
02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:59.420
Once they close that door or then they allow themselves.
Yeah,

2291
02:11:59.510 --> 02:12:03.490
they allow themselves to,
to fucking farted up.
Um,
you know,

2292
02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:08.390
you know,
they let them rip once they get in that door that closed that door.

2293
02:12:08.391 --> 02:12:11.690
They just,
you have to,
if you're taking a shit,
you got to Fart.

2294
02:12:12.260 --> 02:12:14.030
But I wonder if they fart while they're washing their hands.

2295
02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:16.550
These are the things that I think I,
yeah,
absolutely.

2296
02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:19.070
I wonder about what we need more of this in the world.

2297
02:12:19.130 --> 02:12:23.210
Do you mask your farts when you shit in a public restaurant?
No.
No.
Let it out.

2298
02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:26.810
You gotta do what you want.
Hold up to the Caliph girl farts in idiot.

2299
02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:32.690
Jesus Christ.
You have it on your phone.
I love girl farts.
40 year old man.

2300
02:12:32.691 --> 02:12:37.180
He's got it on his phone.
Oh
Christ.

2301
02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:41.540
Huge fetish now.
It's actually a weapon.
It is.
It's amazing.
It's been,
yeah,

2302
02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:43.820
it's amazing.
There's been fart porn forever.

2303
02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:48.350
We're dudes like sniff arts where you have a girl's ass.
Yeah.
I um,
naughty.

2304
02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:49.161
We played some,

2305
02:12:49.161 --> 02:12:54.161
a fart clips on our show and we were talking about it and the guy wrote in and

2306
02:12:54.471 --> 02:12:58.340
he was like,
I have a big time fart fetish.
And were like,
what?

2307
02:12:58.341 --> 02:12:59.840
Like what's the thinking about it?
And he was like,

2308
02:12:59.841 --> 02:13:04.430
I think it's just back to the taboo of it that the pretty girl is not supposed

2309
02:13:04.431 --> 02:13:06.260
to.
So he's uh,
you know what I mean?

2310
02:13:06.261 --> 02:13:09.840
Like did it say that should be in a dirty girl and he loves,
you know,

2311
02:13:09.841 --> 02:13:12.890
a pretty girl doing it is like the ultimate thing.
Yeah.

2312
02:13:12.891 --> 02:13:15.890
That's the thing about people is like,
they want people to be naughty,
right.

2313
02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:21.140
Just because we feel so,
most people at least feel so confined by the rules.

2314
02:13:21.141 --> 02:13:23.450
And I think women,
so even more so than men,

2315
02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:28.050
women even more so than men because society wants you to be a lady and he wants

2316
02:13:28.051 --> 02:13:31.170
a certain way.
Sure.
You know,
and there's slut shaming,
you know,

2317
02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.070
I have to be a slut.

2318
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:34.380
<v 2>You're not allowed to do what you want to do.
You know,</v>

2319
02:13:34.381 --> 02:13:37.590
like if a woman wants to go out and fuck a bunch of different guys,

2320
02:13:37.591 --> 02:13:41.280
like we'll have one once a fuck two guys in at night.
She's a terrible person.

2321
02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:44.940
Like if you find out about that,
oh my God,
she,
and she went to this guy's house.

2322
02:13:44.941 --> 02:13:45.511
She fucked him.

2323
02:13:45.511 --> 02:13:48.030
Then she laughed and she went to this other guy's house and fucked him.

2324
02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:51.750
What a whore.
National Champion.
Like girls would be like,
what a whore.
Yeah.

2325
02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:56.520
But if you told me,
so he decides he leaves is this girl's house and he's like,

2326
02:13:56.521 --> 02:13:56.941
you know what?

2327
02:13:56.941 --> 02:13:59.700
Fuck I can call somebody else and you call somebody else and he goes and fucks

2328
02:13:59.701 --> 02:14:03.300
her.
And we're like,
that's great if as an animal.
Yeah.
It wasn't,

2329
02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:06.340
it wasn't even done.
He didn't want it to fuck more than,

2330
02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:09.540
that is crazy though that we don't,
you know,
that we have that,

2331
02:14:09.541 --> 02:14:14.020
that double standard for that.
I mean,
I remember in college a Guy Friend,
uh,

2332
02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:19.100
going into a sorority house and bang and girls in the same house in the same

2333
02:14:19.201 --> 02:14:22.980
nine different rooms and like,
yeah,
we all were like,
that's fantastic.

2334
02:14:22.981 --> 02:14:26.120
You're such a hero.
Like you're a wonderful person.
And I was like,

2335
02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:30.360
we were all so happy with his story.
But if a girl went to a fraternity house,

2336
02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:33.600
fuck one guy said goodnight honey left and then knocked on the door,

2337
02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:38.370
she's fucking under attorney fucking whore.
Yeah.

2338
02:14:38.371 --> 02:14:41.190
We really should applaud her.
Yeah.
I mean,
well or not,

2339
02:14:41.790 --> 02:14:44.290
either way we should let her do whatever she wants to do.
Yeah.

2340
02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:47.010
She's just fucking people.
Why do you,
what do you care?

2341
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:51.030
Are they going to stay together forever during college?
Jesus Christ,

2342
02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:53.790
if you have a problem with the grow will fucks one guy and then fucks not the

2343
02:14:53.791 --> 02:14:56.540
guy that night.
You're silly.
Yeah,
you are.
What's wrong?

2344
02:14:56.590 --> 02:14:58.110
It could be one of those guys.
Yeah.

2345
02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:00.780
All you gotta do is throw your dig in front of her.
Obviously she likes him.

2346
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:05.400
So that suppression leads to,
uh,
like a reaction.

2347
02:15:05.650 --> 02:15:09.480
This is just holding back leads to this need to let it go.

2348
02:15:09.810 --> 02:15:13.830
And the girl just forks right in that dude's face.
[inaudible]

2349
02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:19.230
if you do,
did you dirty bitch dirty 40 dash 40 bitch.

2350
02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:23.220
Pardon my mouth.
It's so funny.
The people that own this,

2351
02:15:23.221 --> 02:15:25.470
I love girlfriends are actually wants it right now.

2352
02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:31.390
Don't promote that so stupid.
Oh my gosh,
that's not Canada.

2353
02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.480
Me and I'm a bad girl.

2354
02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:41.490
The smell and the fucking noise and the whole thing that naughtiness of it all.

2355
02:15:41.970 --> 02:15:46.110
We hold it in Boston,
girls farting.
We have a thing about,
um,

2356
02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:49.800
about people shitting too.
You know,
like no one wants to admit,

2357
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:50.820
they just took a shit.

2358
02:15:50.821 --> 02:15:55.260
We want to hide it and cover it up with noise and fans and we want to light

2359
02:15:55.261 --> 02:15:59.910
matches and yeah,
it,
it,
it,
it is weird.
I mean,
I don't like,

2360
02:15:59.911 --> 02:16:04.800
uh,
those single single stall Unisex bathrooms.
When you got to shit,
I got shit.

2361
02:16:04.801 --> 02:16:07.050
And then there's like,
someone's like,
you're going in there and you're like,
ah,

2362
02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:11.880
fuck man,
why don't you go in first to Shit on top?
Ain't shit.

2363
02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:13.920
I know I get,
but you get that,
you know,
like,

2364
02:16:14.010 --> 02:16:18.060
I feel like I can't relax or you can say,
can I please use the restroom?

2365
02:16:18.061 --> 02:16:19.080
Like if you're at a meeting,

2366
02:16:19.081 --> 02:16:20.830
if you're having a meeting or something like that and say,

2367
02:16:20.850 --> 02:16:24.090
I'll be right back off to use the restroom.
But you can't say,
look,
I got to shit.

2368
02:16:24.110 --> 02:16:26.190
I gotta I can't keep talking to you guys.
I gotta take a shit.

2369
02:16:26.460 --> 02:16:30.820
You say I use the restroom.
It's ambiguous.
Okay,
go ahead and you leave.
You know,

2370
02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:34.810
you can't say,
I'm so sorry I was late for this meeting.
I got here on time,

2371
02:16:34.811 --> 02:16:38.380
but I had to shit.
Yeah,
right,
right.
You can't say that now.
You gotta be upset,

2372
02:16:38.410 --> 02:16:41.320
you've got to go to the restroom and then you,
you know that the clock's running.

2373
02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:45.430
So cause if you come back 15 minutes later it covered in sweat.
They're like,
wow,

2374
02:16:45.431 --> 02:16:49.930
you took a monster shit.
Huh?
You can't really get that out there.
You're like,

2375
02:16:49.931 --> 02:16:51.670
oh fuck now I got to grind this thing out.
Question.

2376
02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:53.350
Sometimes that's what you have to do.

2377
02:16:53.351 --> 02:16:56.620
Sometimes you have to take a 10 minute heater.
Like sometimes you just,

2378
02:16:56.740 --> 02:16:59.050
you take a shit and it comes up clump,
clump,
and you're like,
God,

2379
02:16:59.051 --> 02:17:03.220
there's a lot more up there.
God Damn,
it happened on the flight yesterday.
Oh No.

2380
02:17:03.221 --> 02:17:05.740
As soon as I sat down and was to wanting to go to sleep and I was like,

2381
02:17:05.770 --> 02:17:08.890
I gotta take a shit.
And it was during takeoff.

2382
02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:12.050
So then you're like waiting for it to hit 10,000 feet,
you know,
and then you're,

2383
02:17:12.051 --> 02:17:14.650
you're waiting for them to turn the seat belt sign off.

2384
02:17:15.010 --> 02:17:19.900
And I go in there like this is going to be,
this is like a fucking marathon shit.

2385
02:17:20.590 --> 02:17:23.320
But I didn't have time for it.
So I really dropped half of it off,

2386
02:17:23.350 --> 02:17:28.030
just like a fall asleep and then later on I finished.

2387
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:29.980
It was,
it was pretty,
pretty dramatic.

2388
02:17:29.981 --> 02:17:32.800
It's one of the weird things about your body is that there's like this

2389
02:17:32.801 --> 02:17:36.670
intangible sense of how much shit is in there.
You know,

2390
02:17:36.671 --> 02:17:40.150
like when you're taking a shit,
like you have that feeling,

2391
02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:43.270
that weird feeling like I smell a shit or I feel shit bro.

2392
02:17:43.271 --> 02:17:46.990
And I feel a shit cooking in the oven.
And then once you're taking that Shit,

2393
02:17:46.991 --> 02:17:50.070
you've got this pressure thing.
Like,
you know,
it's in there and you know,

2394
02:17:50.071 --> 02:17:53.650
it's up there and there's a certain amount.
I God damn,
and this isn't ready.

2395
02:17:54.010 --> 02:17:55.990
This is tied it.
Yeah.
All right.
I'm going to have to,

2396
02:17:56.140 --> 02:17:59.350
I'm going to have to up to empty it and then I'll come back later.
Yeah.

2397
02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:02.110
And that's,
and that's the worst you'd like when it's all gone.
Yeah.

2398
02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:05.040
Certain foods to will trigger,
um,

2399
02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:09.340
just amazing amounts of shit that come out of you where you're just like,

2400
02:18:09.341 --> 02:18:11.500
is my body mostly shit?
Like,

2401
02:18:11.501 --> 02:18:14.650
am I just a walking talking shit machine?

2402
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:18.730
Because sometimes I'll like the amount that will come out of me.

2403
02:18:18.731 --> 02:18:20.200
It's just incredible to me.

2404
02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:23.950
I cannot get over what's coming out of me.

2405
02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:26.360
If you think about how much food you eat though,
if you sink,
sink,

2406
02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:28.210
think of like your entire day.

2407
02:18:28.211 --> 02:18:32.650
If you shit once a day thinking about breakfast in there and then lunch in there

2408
02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:33.800
and then your dinner in.

2409
02:18:33.801 --> 02:18:38.801
They're like this giant mound of food that goes into your body and then snack,

2410
02:18:39.011 --> 02:18:41.560
like you might have a protein bar along the way and then you'll have all this

2411
02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:42.700
you drink thing.

2412
02:18:42.701 --> 02:18:46.360
You might drink milk which has got some solids in there and then slowly but

2413
02:18:46.361 --> 02:18:49.290
surely compress that into just laws.

2414
02:18:50.350 --> 02:18:53.770
Big ropey shit logs.
It's amazing.
It's not really bigger.

2415
02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:57.160
Now picture a pretty girl squatting over your face and letting that all over
you.

2416
02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:04.800
Well that's the under glass like big thing guys.

2417
02:19:05.650 --> 02:19:09.450
Some guys like women shitting on class coffee tables.
Yeah,

2418
02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:12.400
I would always heard that about Stallone.
Those,

2419
02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:14.800
it was like one of those rumors probably made up.

2420
02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:16.510
It was probably like the Richard Gere durable thing.

2421
02:19:16.970 --> 02:19:21.720
Someone decided to say it and then it sounds cool.
So people repeat it.
Yeah,

2422
02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:22.820
we'll Stallone likes,

2423
02:19:23.050 --> 02:19:27.470
she likes to get under tables and girls take big juicy shits on those tables.

2424
02:19:27.471 --> 02:19:30.020
He loves him as he want to fuck them.
Just wants him to shit.

2425
02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:34.610
I'd like to watch people shit f over a glass table just to see it come out maybe

2426
02:19:34.611 --> 02:19:37.410
once.
Sure.
What about a guy like Joey Diaz?

2427
02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:40.010
I think that's the one that would be at the top of my list.

2428
02:19:40.011 --> 02:19:43.010
What if he fell and landed on a table on the table shattered and you died.

2429
02:19:43.580 --> 02:19:45.230
That'd be horrible.
Last went through.

2430
02:19:45.231 --> 02:19:48.860
Your next shit was in your eyeballs and you'd died knowing that shit was all

2431
02:19:48.861 --> 02:19:52.340
over your face and feeling the,
the hot blood rush out of your neck.
Wow.

2432
02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:56.360
That's already,
I slipped.
Whoops.
At too much sodium.

2433
02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:59.300
I think that it would be much more interesting to watch Diaz Shit.

2434
02:19:59.330 --> 02:20:03.680
Then some model.
I'd like to see him have explosive diarrhea on a glass table.

2435
02:20:03.770 --> 02:20:07.430
Well,
I would like to see a girl who's like addicted to stimulants,

2436
02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:09.770
like who's trying to be really skinny.
How?

2437
02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:13.820
Just how little she actually shifts in a day.
Probably shocking.

2438
02:20:13.821 --> 02:20:18.740
Seemed like a little tiny poops.
Curly squarely turned comes out slightly bile,

2439
02:20:19.150 --> 02:20:23.110
yellow smell to it.
What's going on June?
Sorry.
That's a big one.

2440
02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:26.300
Anything half of her shit.
His pills.

2441
02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:32.630
How do some stills come out?
Yeah,
like non dissolved pills.

2442
02:20:33.620 --> 02:20:38.500
Clumps.
Yeah,
but I mean it would be fun to watch a couple of times maybe why?

2443
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:42.560
I don't know about fun but maybe fascinating.
Yeah.
Fascinating.

2444
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:45.200
I think as an art exhibit you were talking about art a lot this weekend.

2445
02:20:45.530 --> 02:20:47.240
It'd be great to set up a live exhibit.

2446
02:20:47.241 --> 02:20:52.070
I've always thought of this where you have like 10 people 50 feet up and their

2447
02:20:52.071 --> 02:20:56.570
button a kid and they have different body types and they're sitting on glass

2448
02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:01.010
toilets with glass tubes coming down and then the exhibit as you walk around and

2449
02:21:01.011 --> 02:21:06.011
they all shit like that'd be kind of a fun and they flush it and you see these

2450
02:21:06.501 --> 02:21:11.501
glass tubes filled up with shit and come tumbling down and then you'd go septic

2451
02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:15.110
at the bottom,
a giant large tank filled with shit.
That's all glass.

2452
02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:18.950
And you have different colored hair and you're like,
I,
this is my creation.
I,

2453
02:21:18.951 --> 02:21:21.690
this is if you wanted to buy this,
it's five 15 minutes.

2454
02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:28.820
We were uh,
talking with this dude who explained to us this weekend about,
um,

2455
02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:29.660
how,
uh,

2456
02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:33.950
we were talking about expensive photography because we saw this really expensive

2457
02:21:33.951 --> 02:21:37.210
photography piece and uh,
he was talking about the,

2458
02:21:37.211 --> 02:21:41.240
the scam or the strategy involved in the high powered,

2459
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:45.890
high priced artwork and that what some times would a dealer will do is they get

2460
02:21:45.891 --> 02:21:50.660
a bunch of people that are really into,
uh,
to art and they,

2461
02:21:50.661 --> 02:21:54.770
what they'll do is they'll see these houses with people's art.
They'll like,

2462
02:21:54.771 --> 02:21:57.070
they'll take your breathe into the mica three coming to me.

2463
02:21:57.420 --> 02:22:02.360
One of you motherfuckers,
you know
it,
you might be a bunny.

2464
02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:05.690
Really?
Yeah,
I heard it several times.
You're freaked me out.

2465
02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:12.290
Anyway,
the guy said,
it's these things pick up lot.
Eddie Bravo was the worst.

2466
02:22:12.291 --> 02:22:16.910
He was like,
Oh yeah,
I forgot about it.
And we're like,
Hey,
you hear that?
Oh,

2467
02:22:16.911 --> 02:22:20.420
I didn't even hear that.
You don't hear that.
People hear it fucking Weirdo.

2468
02:22:20.810 --> 02:22:24.470
Anyway,
they take a,
a guy who like buys a lot of art,

2469
02:22:24.500 --> 02:22:27.750
they f they get these fish and they plant these things in the house.

2470
02:22:27.751 --> 02:22:31.230
We'd like to gift you this,
this gallery would like to give to you this piece.

2471
02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:35.760
This is a guy who a is pieces go for about $50,000 price point.

2472
02:22:36.090 --> 02:22:38.630
And seeing these,
you're uh,

2473
02:22:38.631 --> 02:22:41.130

Thank you so much.

2475
02:22:44.190 --> 02:22:49.020
And so then this gets around to these people that are in this small community of

2476
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:52.560
people who buy expensive art.
Where'd you get that?
Oh,
it's a blah,
blah,
blah,

2477
02:22:52.561 --> 02:22:55.670
blah blah.
You know,
uh,
the uh,
you know,
Sebring,

2478
02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:59.250
a gallery actually a gifted it to me cause I buy a lot of pieces from them.

2479
02:22:59.370 --> 02:23:01.680
He's actually putting on an exhibit next month.
Oh,
amazing.

2480
02:23:01.890 --> 02:23:05.850
And then so they'll see these plugs.
They'll send like four or five.

2481
02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:11.010
It could be an unknown guy who doesn't have a price point really yet.
Exactly.

2482
02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:12.990
But he's talented.
Right.

2483
02:23:12.991 --> 02:23:17.250
And so that's how they sort of stimulate the environment and what he said in his

2484
02:23:17.251 --> 02:23:18.850
words,
create heat.
Yeah.

2485
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:23.010
And so then they'll have a gallery exhibit and this guy's work will be up and

2486
02:23:23.011 --> 02:23:27.630
it's really good work,
but people are already bought into it because,

2487
02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:31.430
oh,
you know,
Rothchild has a piece above his bed.

2488
02:23:31.431 --> 02:23:33.570
It's $50,000 it's amazing.

2489
02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:37.170
<v 1>Best part.
The part I was fascinated with is that if they get that out there,</v>

2490
02:23:37.171 --> 02:23:41.220
right,
they see this stuff to these important people and then they have,

2491
02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:46.170
they make sure that the people that were gifted show up to the gallery so that

2492
02:23:46.171 --> 02:23:51.000
when other people with money are there,
that person's like,
yeah,

2493
02:23:51.001 --> 02:23:54.720
I have one of those.
Yeah.
Like,
Oh shit.
You have one of those.
It's weird.
Right.

2494
02:23:54.721 --> 02:23:59.400
I won't one of those too.
That's like the,
it's,
it's very strange,
man.
Yeah,

2495
02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:04.530
it's in,
it's,
it's kind of the fear,
I think the base of the fear.
Yeah.

2496
02:24:04.531 --> 02:24:09.180
Yeah.
As we talked about this exit through the gift shop is a exactly,

2497
02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:14.250
kind of the same mentality where the guy who was documenting Banksy was like,

2498
02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:19.260
I'll be an artist.
And then,
uh,
they create anybody successful,

2499
02:24:19.261 --> 02:24:23.580
crazy money.
And there's no like,
history of him.
There's no origin of,

2500
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.770
of like work being built.
It was just one day,
it was like,
here's a bunch of work,

2501
02:24:28.771 --> 02:24:33.360
here's like an overwhelming amount of work that I kind of didn't really create.

2502
02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:36.520
And then everybody was willing to,
yeah,
well you can do that.

2503
02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:39.750
The market really interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can get to do that and you can just

2504
02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:43.900
<v 2>can set people up.
I mean,
it's the hype machine.
It's like,
okay,</v>

2505
02:24:43.901 --> 02:24:47.230
like how many times have there been like a comedy central special?

2506
02:24:47.470 --> 02:24:50.860
And you'll see the comedy central special common APP and they'll have a bunch of

2507
02:24:50.861 --> 02:24:53.840
people that,
uh,
you know,
uh,
our,
uh,

2508
02:24:55.180 --> 02:24:58.750
critics or something.
We'll say he's one of the funniest guys out there and boom,

2509
02:24:58.900 --> 02:25:02.440
go blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And then you have a,
you know,
you like someone famous,

2510
02:25:02.441 --> 02:25:05.350
I'll say something,
right.
My favorite all time,
comedian Pam.

2511
02:25:05.650 --> 02:25:09.730
And then you'll see this guy do this thing and then boom,
comma,
next.

2512
02:25:09.731 --> 02:25:14.731
It's the new show with the new guy already endorsed by all these other guys.

2513
02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:17.440
Essentially the same thing.
Same thing.
It's true.
You know?

2514
02:25:17.730 --> 02:25:20.520
<v 1>Yeah.
Movies are big in that.
Fuck.
Yeah.</v>

2515
02:25:20.521 --> 02:25:22.560
They are the core critics thing the whole way.

2516
02:25:22.561 --> 02:25:26.020
Like the funniest thing I've seen this year.
No,

2517
02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:30.670
no shows FiveStars blog,
this guy,
that guy,
this critic said,

2518
02:25:30.730 --> 02:25:35.200
I've never ever had such a good time.
He had a good time.

2519
02:25:35.770 --> 02:25:36.191
And you know,

2520
02:25:36.191 --> 02:25:39.850
there's some dudes when it comes to movies that you could just always count on.

2521
02:25:40.270 --> 02:25:42.970
There's some dudes that are just bullshitters oh yeah.

2522
02:25:43.070 --> 02:25:46.720
It's big bullshit business.
They just love shitty movies.
Yeah.

2523
02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:48.340
And then this other dude's like,

2524
02:25:48.341 --> 02:25:52.900
they'll criticize films like a Roger Ebert was a,
a famous Catholic.

2525
02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:56.670
People would be like really upset at some of the movies that he criticized the

2526
02:25:56.671 --> 02:26:01.540
way.
Criticized them.
Yeah.
I people put so much into what his,
um,

2527
02:26:01.570 --> 02:26:06.040
his critiques of films,
I never was really,
I've,
I've read a number of them.
Um,

2528
02:26:06.730 --> 02:26:08.260
I remember,
I don't remember which one,

2529
02:26:08.261 --> 02:26:13.050
but I remember disagreeing on some stuff he liked and I was like,
well I don't,

2530
02:26:13.051 --> 02:26:15.890
I don't really have,
I don't have a problem with that.
I just feel like,
um,

2531
02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:19.630
with the,
I really feel like everybody is a critic.

2532
02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:22.060
We all get to say what we like and don't like.

2533
02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:26.740
And like if you can find something that you line up a lot with their beliefs and

2534
02:26:26.741 --> 02:26:29.650
may,
that might be the person for you to trust.
But if it's not,

2535
02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:34.680
then like I don't give him really any more credibility than a lot of any other,

2536
02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:40.330
I know he watched a lot and you know,
they knew a lot about films.
Go Guy Myself.

2537
02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:40.780
You're what?

2538
02:26:40.780 --> 02:26:44.770
More of a Cisco Guy Cause Cisco like liked all those been movies and that kind

2539
02:26:44.771 --> 02:26:47.790
of Shitty Scifi movies.
So I never trusted him.
What does it,

2540
02:26:47.980 --> 02:26:49.450
you don't need those guys anymore.

2541
02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:52.300
The point is that everybody can do it now because of social media,

2542
02:26:52.301 --> 02:26:53.860
because of Facebook,
because of Twitter.

2543
02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:58.450
Anybody can be a critic and there's some pretty eloquent reviews by people who

2544
02:26:58.451 --> 02:27:01.990
don't do it.
For a living.
I've read many reviews that people like,

2545
02:27:02.170 --> 02:27:04.990
you know they have those,
a rotten tomato remove reviews.

2546
02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:08.920
Some of those rotten tomato reviews are really fucking good and they're really

2547
02:27:08.921 --> 02:27:10.790
concise and they're just regular folks.
Yeah.

2548
02:27:10.810 --> 02:27:14.530
So a person who enjoys the movie or didn't enjoy the movie and said,

2549
02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:15.910
here's what I think about this.

2550
02:27:15.940 --> 02:27:20.870
I think that that side is a better indicator because it gathers,
you know,

2551
02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:22.920
basically averages out.

2552
02:27:22.940 --> 02:27:26.980
You know like so have a lot of people that like that watch movies say this is

2553
02:27:26.981 --> 02:27:29.890
awesome,
there's a pretty good chance it's going to be a pretty decent movie.

2554
02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:34.450
Yeah.
If they all say this is a fucking garbage is that,
it's not very likely.

2555
02:27:34.451 --> 02:27:38.170
That's a good movie.
Yeah.
But then when you like take professional interviewers,

2556
02:27:38.171 --> 02:27:40.210
like there are professional reviewers,

2557
02:27:40.211 --> 02:27:44.770
like how can you be someone who'd just PR your art is reviewing other people's

2558
02:27:44.771 --> 02:27:46.960
art.
Cause that's essentially your contribution.

2559
02:27:47.290 --> 02:27:49.930
Your contribution is reviewing other people's are,
who the fuck are you?

2560
02:27:50.170 --> 02:27:54.370
And then you find out that eBird actually wrote his own script.
He made dog shit.

2561
02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:58.690
He made a dog shit movie he wrote.
And he directed a piece of fucking garbage.

2562
02:27:58.790 --> 02:28:02.770
So he failed at the thing that he was praised for being a critic of Valley of

2563
02:28:02.771 --> 02:28:06.080
the dolls.
Right.
Yeah.
All right.
I don't know if that is at the time.
Yeah.

2564
02:28:06.190 --> 02:28:09.940
It was supposed to be unbelievably bad.
Yeah.
You suck at it.
It's sexy though,

2565
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:12.310
but it's like having the best,

2566
02:28:12.311 --> 02:28:16.960
like the most respected comedy critic was like one of the worst standups of all

2567
02:28:16.961 --> 02:28:19.960
time.
Exactly.
That's exactly what it's like.

2568
02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:22.280
But a guy who never got out of open Mike Nights

2569
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.970
<v 2>was fucking terrible.
He knows fuck.
And you know,
he would say,</v>

2570
02:28:25.971 --> 02:28:28.950
here's the problem with Tom Seger is last special.
Yeah.

2571
02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:33.290
Tom has this pen dantic way of distributing as Joe,

2572
02:28:33.291 --> 02:28:38.060
so don't fuck fucking hack.
Yeah,
it's exactly that.
Yeah,
it is.
Well,

2573
02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:39.740
the idea of being a critic too,

2574
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:44.660
there's only one reason why people become critics is because they don't have

2575
02:28:44.661 --> 02:28:49.400
anything to contribute.
There's no critics that our critics,
because you know,

2576
02:28:49.401 --> 02:28:53.510
I'm brilliant at writing books and I'm amazing at doing paintings and art,

2577
02:28:53.511 --> 02:28:56.240
but what I really like to do is judge other people's Shit.

2578
02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:59.660
That's my favorite thing.
Yeah,
no,
they usually want to be authors.

2579
02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:03.860
They want to be screenwriters.
They want to be someone who's doing that thing,

2580
02:29:03.861 --> 02:29:06.140
but they don't have it in them,
so they become a critic.

2581
02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:09.620
That's one of the beautiful things about things like rotten tomatoes.

2582
02:29:10.020 --> 02:29:13.490
They're just regular people.
They don't have to write a review of this.

2583
02:29:13.570 --> 02:29:16.910
They write a review of it because they're inspired to write,

2584
02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:21.260
which is probably like how you should,
we should,
we should treat artwork.

2585
02:29:21.470 --> 02:29:24.930
We should look at people's,
you know,
you look at an average,
you know,

2586
02:29:24.990 --> 02:29:28.850
old rotten tomatoes gave it 80% and then you look at the reviews and go,
okay,

2587
02:29:28.851 --> 02:29:31.640
I see what this guy's saying.
I said,
without giving away too much,

2588
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:35.370
here's what I didn't like without giving away too much.
Here's what I liked.
Yeah.

2589
02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:37.820
Beyond the valley of the dolls,

2590
02:29:38.510 --> 02:29:42.860
<v 5>the sequel,
and he cowrote it.
But I remember seeing it was sexy.</v>

2591
02:29:42.861 --> 02:29:45.290
There was a lot of sex in it,
a lot of hot chicks and stuff.
But yeah,

2592
02:29:45.291 --> 02:29:48.080
it's total stupid stoner seventies movie.

2593
02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:52.510
<v 2>We should watch it and get really high and do commentator Terry on it.</v>

2594
02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:56.890
Russ Meyers beyond the valley of the dolls.
So this is a movie that he wrote,

2595
02:29:57.030 --> 02:29:58.510
<v 5>he cowrote.
Uh,</v>

2596
02:29:59.270 --> 02:30:02.280
it was a co written with Roger Ebert for 20th century.

2597
02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:06.290
<v 2>See you can't criticize that though because unless you know who the other person</v>

2598
02:30:06.291 --> 02:30:10.160
is any less,
you know what Roger's contributions where you know,

2599
02:30:10.610 --> 02:30:14.570
I mean he was a part of a dog shit movie,
but I've been a part of dog shit shows.

2600
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:15.111
You know,

2601
02:30:15.111 --> 02:30:17.900
there was a lot of those things that we did on the man show that were dog shit.

2602
02:30:18.350 --> 02:30:21.980
But if you've know about the behind the scenes struggles to even get dog shit

2603
02:30:21.981 --> 02:30:26.840
made it realize how difficult it is to have to have something represent what you

2604
02:30:26.841 --> 02:30:30.470
wanted to do.
Especially if it was like his first movie he tried to make.

2605
02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:32.210
Who knows how many people were involved in this?

2606
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:34.640
Who knows how high on coke the producers were,

2607
02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:39.350
who knows how fucking crazy the actors were.
Who knows.
It's so hard to tell.

2608
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:41.780
And even if you read his copy of the script,

2609
02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:45.870
who knows how much editorial control he had on it over it.
Who knows?

2610
02:30:45.871 --> 02:30:49.670
Who knows what the studio decided they wanted added or removed.

2611
02:30:51.470 --> 02:30:55.040
It's hard until you,
unless you read their individual work,

2612
02:30:55.041 --> 02:30:58.400
like if you write a blog entry and you wrote it all by yourself,
you know,

2613
02:30:58.790 --> 02:31:03.380
now I know that's your work.
I know your work.
Right.
But like a show,
like,

2614
02:31:03.820 --> 02:31:07.400
like something like the Jessel neck offensive and how much control do you think

2615
02:31:07.401 --> 02:31:11.090
they had?
I mean,
how much,
how much,
how much input did comedy central have?

2616
02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:13.920
How much input did the producers have?
How?
Right.
Yeah.

2617
02:31:13.970 --> 02:31:16.970
I don't know the standards and practice people.
So you can't say this,

2618
02:31:16.971 --> 02:31:20.400
you can't say that,
change this now.
Waters it down,
but it's good enough.

2619
02:31:20.401 --> 02:31:22.800
Let's do it anyway.
Right.
Who knows?
You know,

2620
02:31:23.490 --> 02:31:28.380
I don't know why I chose to just on their girlfriends,
but I did.
Yeah,
no,
it,

2621
02:31:28.970 --> 02:31:31.860
imagine this,
it's a representation of what,
what he wants,

2622
02:31:31.861 --> 02:31:34.860
but you don't know that he's actually,
I mean,

2623
02:31:34.890 --> 02:31:38.130
getting on exactly what he wants all the time.
Right?
Yeah.
Which is the beautiful,

2624
02:31:38.190 --> 02:31:39.600
beautiful thing about podcasts.

2625
02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:43.140
And the beautiful thing about standup is you don't have to have something in it

2626
02:31:43.141 --> 02:31:45.550
that you don't like.
It can be exactly what you want.
Yeah.

2627
02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:49.920
It's limited amount of people are involved.
The smaller the number,
the,

2628
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:53.070
the pure,
the,
the division or the pure,

2629
02:31:53.071 --> 02:31:57.620
they're the product of what you're doing from one source.
It's weird when you,

2630
02:31:57.621 --> 02:31:57.870
you,

2631
02:31:57.870 --> 02:32:02.160
you get like giant groups of people that are like all the voting and deciding on

2632
02:32:02.161 --> 02:32:04.230
what should be in a movie.
All,
you know,

2633
02:32:04.231 --> 02:32:06.270
putting their input on how a TV show should be,

2634
02:32:06.271 --> 02:32:10.920
what the monologue should be and it's not going to work.
Yeah.
Can't have that.

2635
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:14.070
The only way those things work cause if you have the less people the better.

2636
02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:19.420
And that's why the things that don't have like directors who really proved

2637
02:32:19.801 --> 02:32:23.130
themselves and talent that really proves itself can get like they have that

2638
02:32:23.131 --> 02:32:26.370
power of less and less notes.
That's why that work is a lot of times better.

2639
02:32:26.371 --> 02:32:29.400
You know,
people aren't telling really Tarantino,

2640
02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:32.100
you got to change all this shit now he's,
he's getting it.

2641
02:32:32.101 --> 02:32:35.100
He's putting the movie out there that he wants to put out there.
Yeah.
You know,

2642
02:32:35.160 --> 02:32:39.110
so that's why it's good South Park.
Perfect example.
There's,

2643
02:32:39.310 --> 02:32:40.680
it's really Trey Parker,

2644
02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:43.800
one fucking guy and Matt stone is involved in it as well.

2645
02:32:43.801 --> 02:32:48.540
And then all the writers are involved as well.
But without having this one guy,

2646
02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:51.900
if you've watched that a one hour thing that they did,
what was it called?

2647
02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:57.120
The countdown to a 77 days to air.
Really fascinating.

2648
02:32:57.121 --> 02:33:01.890
Really?
Yeah.
Really fascinating because you get to see his,
um,
his,
uh,
process,

2649
02:33:01.891 --> 02:33:03.300
the creative process.
Well,

2650
02:33:03.301 --> 02:33:06.960
how many other people input things and what's involved in the creating of
things,

2651
02:33:06.961 --> 02:33:09.480
but their show is so successful,
successful,

2652
02:33:09.481 --> 02:33:13.020
and so awesome that comedy central just leaves it alone.
They just,

2653
02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:17.670
it's so great back away as,
as the daily show,
that same sort of situation,

2654
02:33:17.790 --> 02:33:19.260
they don't fuck with it.
They just leave it alone.

2655
02:33:19.290 --> 02:33:24.090
And then Louie has that famous deal where he just takes less money and gets

2656
02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:28.230
known.
He delivers an episode goes,
they don't even know the episode.
Beautiful.

2657
02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:31.050
He just drops it out.
Here's the episode the best way.
And we'll look,
you know,

2658
02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:32.970
when you got a guy who is as talented as Louie,

2659
02:33:32.971 --> 02:33:34.710
like if you want them on your network,

2660
02:33:34.730 --> 02:33:38.820
the the best way to get them on your network is this.
Get Him,
get,
let him do it.

2661
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:41.420
Let them do it.
They're smart enough to get out of their own way.
Right.

2662
02:33:41.550 --> 02:33:44.610
It's a beautiful thing that they figured out to do that with him,

2663
02:33:44.730 --> 02:33:48.120
to just step back,
get out of their own way and let him do it.
And unfortunately,

2664
02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:49.141
I feel like,
you know,

2665
02:33:49.141 --> 02:33:53.490
a lot of entertainment would be a lot better if they would embrace that a little

2666
02:33:53.491 --> 02:33:58.290
bit more.
You know,
there's so many people giving their input on,
on television.

2667
02:33:58.291 --> 02:33:58.800
I mean,

2668
02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:03.660
people would die if they realize the amount of people telling you to do things

2669
02:34:03.661 --> 02:34:07.890
and cut things out and TV.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
It's just,
um,

2670
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:13.770
it's,
it's,
it's hard.
It's hard to get things done on a,
a network,

2671
02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:17.680
you know,
because every spot that they have is valuable.

2672
02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:22.080
Every slot,
every 30 minute slot,
especially during prime time.

2673
02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:24.070
It's extremely valuable.

2674
02:34:24.490 --> 02:34:28.960
It's worth so much to have those things there that they have to be real careful

2675
02:34:28.961 --> 02:34:33.100
because if it's a hit,
they can make so much money in advertising.
If you can,

2676
02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:37.750
you have a new Chappelle show and it becomes a new cultural icon sort of a
thing.

2677
02:34:37.780 --> 02:34:40.720
Oh my God,
it's worth money.
So much money.
So because of that,

2678
02:34:40.721 --> 02:34:44.020
these noncreative fucking people get involved in the creative process.

2679
02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:47.620
Try to optimize money.
Fuck that all up man.

2680
02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:52.090
But that's the one that went to walk away from and leave alone the most when we

2681
02:34:52.091 --> 02:34:53.320
did opie and Anthony on Friday,

2682
02:34:53.321 --> 02:34:58.120
they were talking about that about radio being sort of ruined because of uh,

2683
02:34:58.150 --> 02:35:02.420
all this input that now all this restrictions,
all this you,

2684
02:35:02.430 --> 02:35:05.590
you can't just be wild anymore.
You can't just do,

2685
02:35:05.591 --> 02:35:07.570
what you actually want to do is say what you actually want to say.

2686
02:35:07.571 --> 02:35:09.120
You've got to worry about being suspended.

2687
02:35:09.121 --> 02:35:13.870
You got to worry about being fined even on satellite radio there were still
find.

2688
02:35:14.540 --> 02:35:17.050
Yeah.
And then you get,
and they have like taboo topic,

2689
02:35:17.051 --> 02:35:20.650
like don't just don't even bring this up ever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean they were,

2690
02:35:20.651 --> 02:35:23.410
they took a hiatus from satellite for a while,

2691
02:35:23.411 --> 02:35:28.330
but there were still unregular radio.
Yeah,
that's so bananas.
And if they,

2692
02:35:28.331 --> 02:35:30.070
the hiatus was because the,

2693
02:35:30.071 --> 02:35:33.670
they had on some crazy homeless guy get on and say he wanted to rape.
Uh,

2694
02:35:33.970 --> 02:35:36.820
who was it?
The black one.
Condoleezza Rice.
Oh right.

2695
02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:40.450
This is some crazy homeless guy saying a bunch of hymnody shit.

2696
02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:41.440
And because of that they got,

2697
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:45.670
I'm pretty sure they got suspended from satellite,

2698
02:35:45.671 --> 02:35:48.760
but they were allowed to be on a regular radio.
It doesn't even,

2699
02:35:48.890 --> 02:35:50.230
it wasn't that what does,
let's see.

2700
02:35:50.231 --> 02:35:52.210
Opie and Anthony suspended from satellite radio.

2701
02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:56.550
<v 5>I know that the playboy radio on Sirius radio,
which is now I think vivid radio,</v>

2702
02:35:56.551 --> 02:35:58.830
they used to have up to,
like a month ago,

2703
02:35:58.831 --> 02:36:01.920
they had these rules that you weren't allowed to talk about incest.

2704
02:36:01.921 --> 02:36:04.380
You weren't allowed to talk about drugs including marijuana.

2705
02:36:04.381 --> 02:36:06.240
You weren't allowed to talk about all this shit.
And it's like,
wait,

2706
02:36:06.241 --> 02:36:08.310
this is playboy radio and you can't talk.

2707
02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:12.050
<v 2>No.
Wanna XM suspended them for 30 days.</v>

2708
02:36:12.810 --> 02:36:15.650
That's ridiculous.
Can't talk about marijuana on playboy radio.

2709
02:36:16.310 --> 02:36:20.480
Fuck fucking stupid shit.
Is that,
that's so dumb.

2710
02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:25.540
So they were on censored radio while while they were suspended from uncensored

2711
02:36:26.301 --> 02:36:30.340
radio.
That's so crazy for something someone else said.
That's so great.

2712
02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:34.100
Yeah.
Well it's more,
more idiotic thinking.

2713
02:36:34.310 --> 02:36:37.520
There's a lot of idiotic thinking out there,
but you know,
it's also,

2714
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:38.391
let's be honest,

2715
02:36:38.391 --> 02:36:41.360
it's idiotic to have some fucking homeless guy on saying he wants a rape

2716
02:36:41.361 --> 02:36:44.930
Condoleezza Rice.
Like what you should do is say,
don't do that anymore.

2717
02:36:44.931 --> 02:36:48.230
Cause it's stupid and gross that that guy's nasty.
Like,
why?

2718
02:36:48.231 --> 02:36:52.910
Why do you have this fucked up mentally ill person in your studio saying stupid

2719
02:36:52.911 --> 02:36:55.580
shit like that?
Like that's not good.
Right.
But it's,

2720
02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:59.510
it's suspending them for that,
you know,
just,
yeah,
just don't do that again.

2721
02:36:59.630 --> 02:37:01.070
The people let you know,

2722
02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:03.920
the people should let them know that they don't like that.
Like,
hey man,

2723
02:37:03.921 --> 02:37:05.960
that was fucking gross.
Yeah.
Why?
Why?

2724
02:37:05.961 --> 02:37:09.320
You got this guy saying he's gonna rape some woman and this woman who works in

2725
02:37:09.321 --> 02:37:12.950
the White House,
like that's crazy.
How old were they suspended for 30 days.

2726
02:37:13.010 --> 02:37:17.770
30 days.
If it wasn't for though,
I would have never done this.
You know,

2727
02:37:17.771 --> 02:37:22.040
and we'd never done it this way either.
Cause every other show that I ever did,

2728
02:37:22.041 --> 02:37:25.160
every other radio show that ever did was always like real structured.

2729
02:37:25.610 --> 02:37:27.680
Like you would go in there,
they would have their bits,

2730
02:37:27.681 --> 02:37:30.050
they would have their news guy that would interrupt every 15 minutes.

2731
02:37:30.051 --> 02:37:31.310
They do their traffic thing.

2732
02:37:31.311 --> 02:37:34.070
They had all this stuff that you had to go through and do.

2733
02:37:34.370 --> 02:37:37.250
But when you do opie and Anthony,
he would just sit there and hang out with them.

2734
02:37:37.270 --> 02:37:42.110
Yeah.
It was just a slow,
just a loose,
open hang conversation.

2735
02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:44.090
And it was so much more fun to do that way.

2736
02:37:44.450 --> 02:37:48.110
And I remember doing it thinking like,
God damn like this is the way to do it.

2737
02:37:48.111 --> 02:37:49.340
Why don't they fucking do this?

2738
02:37:49.650 --> 02:37:53.960
I have a radio show and you still will sometimes every once in a while we'll

2739
02:37:53.961 --> 02:37:56.970
stop in and do radio somewhere else.
Right.
You'll still like if somebody,

2740
02:37:56.971 --> 02:38:01.040
if it in a certain town we still give them besides aside from ONA or,
no,
I think,

2741
02:38:01.041 --> 02:38:02.750
I think I do,
um,

2742
02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:06.410
ONA and Kevin and being regularly and you know,
I'll see.

2743
02:38:06.530 --> 02:38:09.080
Sometimes I'll call in to a another station.

2744
02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:12.320
There's not that many of them anymore.
This,
they did jocks.

2745
02:38:12.650 --> 02:38:14.600
These disc jockeys had been all choked out.

2746
02:38:14.601 --> 02:38:19.320
They'd been choked out by Jack TV or Jack Radio and all the preprogram was

2747
02:38:19.370 --> 02:38:23.680
Ambien Jack Radio.
It's pretty sweet though.
Have you ever listened to it before?

2748
02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:26.420
It's just music.
There's no g deejays anymore.

2749
02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:29.300
There's no radio personalities and the point.
Yeah.

2750
02:38:29.350 --> 02:38:33.230
And so it was morning radio shows are all just chill out some radios,
so,

2751
02:38:33.231 --> 02:38:34.940
so God damn awful to do.

2752
02:38:35.070 --> 02:38:40.070
But if you want like good music and you don't want to listen to fucking idiots

2753
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:44.660
Babel,
which is a lot of what you get on those morning shows.
Yeah,

2754
02:38:44.661 --> 02:38:47.490
something like jacket is great.
Oh yeah,
no,
I'm saying like it's,

2755
02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:51.140
some of it is so like the guys doing morning shows,

2756
02:38:51.141 --> 02:38:55.380
some of them are still so bad.
They're dinosaurs.
Yeah.
They're there.
Done that.

2757
02:38:55.381 --> 02:38:58.910
That whole style only existed when there was a small amount of people that were

2758
02:38:58.911 --> 02:39:00.890
allowed to broadcast.
Yeah.
You know,

2759
02:39:00.891 --> 02:39:04.700
and then when the restrictions came down and they had to be as generic and as

2760
02:39:04.701 --> 02:39:09.260
politician,
like as possible,
they beat you,
you got this top 49 cents.

2761
02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:13.700
We have people who talk like this,
our next gas.
Do you know,
you're,
you're,

2762
02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:16.340
you're talking in some weird fake robot voice.

2763
02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:20.150
You're plugging in to this system and doing,
you know,

2764
02:39:20.151 --> 02:39:23.120
what's expected of you and there's no individuality to it.

2765
02:39:23.121 --> 02:39:27.280
There's no uniqueness to it.
There's a,
there's,
it's just a,

2766
02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:30.260
it's too restrictive and environment for creativity.

2767
02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:32.570
That's why when a guy like Howard stern came along,

2768
02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:37.440
it was just like he blew the roof off of the business because all of a sudden

2769
02:39:37.441 --> 02:39:41.660
the guy came along that wasn't scared to talk,

2770
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:45.350
to take on controversial stances to say outrageous shit,

2771
02:39:45.530 --> 02:39:48.500
to say really funny things and to try to entertain people.

2772
02:39:48.501 --> 02:39:53.240
And that's really bold and crazy way and an attack.

2773
02:39:53.241 --> 02:39:56.300
Other people who were like his competitors like openly attack them.
Like,

2774
02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:59.630
who the fuck ever did that?
Yeah.
That was his,
that was also a strategy.

2775
02:39:59.630 --> 02:40:01.760
I didn't know her,
but it was like he would,

2776
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:06.440
when he was new in a market and a radio guy was telling me that like if he came

2777
02:40:06.441 --> 02:40:07.280
into a new market,

2778
02:40:07.810 --> 02:40:12.810
the first thing he would always do is attack that guy's show so that like he was

2779
02:40:14.161 --> 02:40:18.840
playing in a new city and the,
the former number one show would have,

2780
02:40:18.841 --> 02:40:19.471
would be making,

2781
02:40:19.471 --> 02:40:23.490
being made fun of on Howard show so that listeners would be like,
oh shit.

2782
02:40:23.491 --> 02:40:27.780
Like he's making fun of this guy and create that,
that buzz in that new city.

2783
02:40:27.781 --> 02:40:31.530
Right.
It creates drama in the new city and then people are,
you know,

2784
02:40:31.531 --> 02:40:32.800
either saying like,
you know what,
he's right.

2785
02:40:32.801 --> 02:40:36.570
The show is fucking lame that we've been listening to or you know,
so you know,

2786
02:40:36.571 --> 02:40:38.400
he would also probably have,
but he would,

2787
02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:42.120
he would pull the people that were going to like him anyways from that new city

2788
02:40:42.180 --> 02:40:45.000
and then,
you know,
either worked out or it didn't.
And it's,
you know,

2789
02:40:45.030 --> 02:40:48.330
it's low fruit anyway because a lot of them really do suck.
Yeah.

2790
02:40:48.331 --> 02:40:49.230
So it's easy to do.

2791
02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:52.200
You can just go in there and Jack them cause it just pointing out the obvious.

2792
02:40:52.220 --> 02:40:56.100
Yeah.
Did a lot of these just he would play their show on his show.

2793
02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:01.140
Opiate Anthony does that.
They do that.
They,
what they do is um,
they'll,
they'll,

2794
02:41:01.170 --> 02:41:04.710
they were doing a jock Tobar so uh,

2795
02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:09.270
throughout the month of October they were like really corny shitty radio shows.

2796
02:41:09.271 --> 02:41:13.280
They would highlight them,
play them and then just destroy them.
Oh my God.

2797
02:41:13.310 --> 02:41:18.310
Would play play an Anthony is so good at like destroying things and so as Norton

2798
02:41:19.380 --> 02:41:20.070
and so they would,

2799
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:24.480
they would play these great and pause them and just crush them and just go off

2800
02:41:24.481 --> 02:41:27.360
on them for like 10 minutes and then come back to them and let them play some

2801
02:41:27.361 --> 02:41:30.630
more and then crush them.
Imagine how brutal like,

2802
02:41:30.631 --> 02:41:34.340
like if you're that guy and you hear that it's so fucking tight now that,

2803
02:41:34.341 --> 02:41:37.590
oh and they got ahold of your radio show today for John October and then the

2804
02:41:37.591 --> 02:41:38.820
past,
it's get ahold of you.

2805
02:41:38.850 --> 02:41:43.380
Oh cause the ONA past our fucking savages,

2806
02:41:43.930 --> 02:41:45.780
they're animals.
Those huge,

2807
02:41:45.781 --> 02:41:49.590
huge ONA fans listen to religiously every day when they,

2808
02:41:49.591 --> 02:41:54.450
when they decided to go after somebody over torture you on Twitter Tarci you're

2809
02:41:54.451 --> 02:41:57.630
fucking Facebook page.
Holy Shit.
Oh,
fucking attack you,

2810
02:41:57.690 --> 02:42:01.940
they'll attack you as well as during fans.
Yeah.
As,
I mean,
imagine like you,

2811
02:42:01.941 --> 02:42:05.490
you have your little radio show in De Moines and then you get home and you're

2812
02:42:05.491 --> 02:42:08.400
fucking mailbox is full.
You're like,
what's all this fucking hate mail?

2813
02:42:08.700 --> 02:42:11.700
Which is one thing I wanted to bring up.
Um,

2814
02:42:11.701 --> 02:42:16.440
we won the stitcher award for the best overall podcast and uh,
you know,

2815
02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:19.920
uh,
agree or disagree that that's all good.

2816
02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:22.800
But some was someone from some,
uh,

2817
02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:25.740
podcasts when I'm not even going to bother mentioning because I think it was

2818
02:42:25.741 --> 02:42:26.580
actually someone who is like,

2819
02:42:26.581 --> 02:42:29.790
one of the sound guys from the podcast told people that do this,

2820
02:42:29.791 --> 02:42:31.950
told people to send some hate our way.

2821
02:42:32.250 --> 02:42:36.420
And I got all these fucking angry people on Twitter that were angry that this

2822
02:42:36.421 --> 02:42:41.340
other show didn't win.
And look,
I,
you know,
first of all,

2823
02:42:41.341 --> 02:42:45.250
I think,
I think contests are stupid.
Okay.
I'm,

2824
02:42:45.251 --> 02:42:49.020
I'm glad that people like the show,
but I don't give a fuck if we won a contest.

2825
02:42:49.021 --> 02:42:52.650
I think contents are dumb as fuck.
I've never asked to won a contest.
Um,

2826
02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:56.040
it's nice that people acknowledge that they enjoy it.
I like that.

2827
02:42:56.400 --> 02:43:00.510
But if you're going after someone else for winning something and somehow or

2828
02:43:00.511 --> 02:43:05.280
another,
you know,
it,
it,
it,
you think it takes away from the show that you like,

2829
02:43:05.350 --> 02:43:10.090
you know,
like you're a fucking idiot.
Just a bigger show.
No,
no.

2830
02:43:10.490 --> 02:43:12.160
I've never even heard them until this,
this

2831
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:17.080
<v 0>wave of fucking hate started coming my way.
And then you just reading it,</v>

2832
02:43:17.081 --> 02:43:20.110
it was like,
this is so stupid.
Like you don't have to like a show,

2833
02:43:20.111 --> 02:43:23.590
but if you're mad that your show didn't win and then another show did,

2834
02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:27.910
you're a fucking dunce and to just go out and push a bunch of hate.

2835
02:43:27.911 --> 02:43:30.910
All that means is that the show that you represent,

2836
02:43:30.911 --> 02:43:34.010
the show that you like has a bunch of assholes for fans?
It does.

2837
02:43:34.270 --> 02:43:37.570
I don't know why that is.
I don't know who's responsible for that.

2838
02:43:37.571 --> 02:43:39.640
But if someone necessary,
I mean,

2839
02:43:39.641 --> 02:43:43.510
we live in 2014 we on this podcast,

2840
02:43:43.511 --> 02:43:46.300
especially as a rule,

2841
02:43:46.330 --> 02:43:48.670
support other people as a rule.

2842
02:43:48.671 --> 02:43:52.120
I'm constantly telling people about other podcasts that I love,

2843
02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:56.440
whether it's hardcore history with Dan Carlin or um,

2844
02:43:56.530 --> 02:43:58.410
whether it's Danielle [inaudible],
Danielle Bell,

2845
02:43:58.420 --> 02:44:02.860
Ellie's podcasts or Thompson Jurez podcast,
or whether it's anybody,

2846
02:44:02.861 --> 02:44:04.360
Joey Diaz,
Ari Shaffir.

2847
02:44:04.510 --> 02:44:07.870
We'd constantly promote people's podcasts when they come on.

2848
02:44:07.871 --> 02:44:10.240
When Kara Santa Maria was on here the other day,
I was telling her,

2849
02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:12.640
start a podcast.
You should do a podcast.

2850
02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:17.170
And if somehow or another you like her podcast more than you'd like my podcast.

2851
02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:20.560
Good.
That means you like something.
I don't give a fuck.

2852
02:44:20.830 --> 02:44:22.360
There's plenty of people in this world.

2853
02:44:22.361 --> 02:44:27.280
There's 300 million fucking people in this country alone and this podcast

2854
02:44:27.281 --> 02:44:29.530
reaches people all over the planet.

2855
02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:34.360
I get emails and text messages into our tweets rather from New Zealand,

2856
02:44:34.361 --> 02:44:37.540
from Australia,
from Japan.
I get them from Afghanistan.

2857
02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:41.710
I get them constantly from all over the world.
It doesn't,
it is plenty of people.

2858
02:44:41.770 --> 02:44:46.450
You don't.
Cool.
Who knows how many millions that is,
that have access to podcasts.

2859
02:44:47.350 --> 02:44:49.900
You should listen to whatever you like.

2860
02:44:50.170 --> 02:44:55.070
You know the idea that somehow or another,
your show is a is,

2861
02:44:55.071 --> 02:44:59.050
is being stiffed by some,
you know,
maybe they had some,

2862
02:44:59.051 --> 02:45:02.320
they organize some fucking thing where they tried to win just the way that it's

2863
02:45:02.321 --> 02:45:06.100
possible that they were upset that they did that.
And so this is the blowback,

2864
02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:08.740
but it's probably that same sort of strategy.
Get us to talk about it,

2865
02:45:08.741 --> 02:45:11.830
get us to be angry about it,
and it pumps up that other show.

2866
02:45:12.550 --> 02:45:16.110
I had somebody try to bait us on that too.
I was like,
I'm not,
you know,

2867
02:45:16.130 --> 02:45:18.700
I hope that other show does great.
I hope it's something I can listen to.

2868
02:45:18.850 --> 02:45:23.500
I hope I enjoy it.
I'm not,
you know,
I'm not against any other shows.

2869
02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:25.870
I love what I love,
you know,

2870
02:45:25.871 --> 02:45:30.871
and if there's someone out there that wins some stitcher award or some iTunes

2871
02:45:32.261 --> 02:45:33.820
award or something like that and we didn't,

2872
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:36.730
I'll listen to it because I want to know if it's good.
It's good.
Yeah.
You know,

2873
02:45:36.731 --> 02:45:37.190
maybe it'll,

2874
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:40.580
I'll find it enjoyable and it'd be something I can listen to on a plane sometime

2875
02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:43.510
and have a good time.
I'm really sorry we got our listeners is sending you that.

2876
02:45:43.511 --> 02:45:48.500
Hey Man,
I was about to bring that up.
I was trying to work it in slowly.
Um,

2877
02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:52.270
we didn't,
we didn't even talk about the UFC.
Oh yeah.
Crazy ass fucking UFC.

2878
02:45:52.290 --> 02:45:54.780
That was pretty cool to fights.
I heard in the stance.
Yeah.

2879
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:58.230
Heard some people got stabbed,
stabbed,
uh,
crazy.

2880
02:45:58.231 --> 02:46:00.550
Another guy threw a chair at a woman.

2881
02:46:01.570 --> 02:46:04.180
Did he throw it at somebody else and the woman got hit that what happened?

2882
02:46:04.210 --> 02:46:07.090
We didn't get clarity on that,
but it was,
it was intense in the stands.

2883
02:46:07.300 --> 02:46:10.160
It was funny because a,
it was,
how do you get a chair on the stance?

2884
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:14.060
<v 1>I think the chair was in,
um,
higher up when they have the,</v>

2885
02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:16.100
the free standing area with like the,

2886
02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:19.640
where they're actually our chairs and there's,
Oh,
I see,
I see.

2887
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:22.730
So there's still someone threw it down.
I'm not sure how it was thrown.

2888
02:46:22.731 --> 02:46:26.530
They were just talking about that a chair got thrown and hit a girl that a dude

2889
02:46:26.531 --> 02:46:28.190
through it,
but you know,
the stabbing,

2890
02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:31.790
it made sense that something like that happened because we were all,

2891
02:46:31.791 --> 02:46:36.290
I realized that sometimes fights happen in the stands and you look and it just

2892
02:46:36.291 --> 02:46:41.060
kind of,
if they,
if fizzles out really quickly.
And in this case it was,
um,

2893
02:46:41.780 --> 02:46:46.040
it was like,
you saw,
you heard a huge,
you know,
like kind of shouting,

2894
02:46:46.041 --> 02:46:48.860
screaming from this area and we all turned,
we're watching it.

2895
02:46:48.861 --> 02:46:53.861
And then I realized that 30 seconds later there's a fight going on and everybody

2896
02:46:54.441 --> 02:46:57.170
is looking in the stance like,
because it's,

2897
02:46:57.350 --> 02:47:00.140
there's so much action in there and people are scared.

2898
02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:04.470
What fight was going on while this was happening?
Man,
this had to have been,
um,

2899
02:47:05.270 --> 02:47:08.030
oh,
was Jamie Varner enabled through Hilo?
Was it that fight?

2900
02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:12.090
That's what someone said.
Um,
it was,
yeah,
it was,
it was later on.
So it was,

2901
02:47:12.091 --> 02:47:16.880
it wasn't one of the early fights.
I want to say.
It's probably about,
uh,
yeah,

2902
02:47:16.881 --> 02:47:19.900
that makes sense.
Six,
seven fights in.
So that would be furniture.

2903
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:21.830
You thought it was a crazy fucking fight.

2904
02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:25.070
That fight makes people want to stab people.
Yeah.
And that was the,

2905
02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:26.780
that was bananas.

2906
02:47:26.810 --> 02:47:30.400
We're looking at six or seven decisions in a row up to that point.
And,

2907
02:47:30.830 --> 02:47:34.790
but Jamie Varner and able to Hilo just fucking assaulted each other.

2908
02:47:34.850 --> 02:47:39.490
They threw down,
Varner looked like,
um,
in the beginning,
like he was,

2909
02:47:39.890 --> 02:47:41.840
seemed like he was moments away from closing it out.

2910
02:47:41.870 --> 02:47:46.430
He hit him hard and fast and he had him in trouble and you just didn't know if

2911
02:47:46.431 --> 02:47:48.050
he was going to close it out right then.

2912
02:47:48.260 --> 02:47:51.770
But then towards the end of the fight he looked like he was gonna get him again.

2913
02:47:52.250 --> 02:47:55.130
<v 2>Well,
he had him in a north south choke to for awhile.
He,
um,</v>

2914
02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:58.070
he burnt his arm out in the first round because he was trying to choke them out

2915
02:47:58.071 --> 02:48:00.110
with that,
a north south choke.
So he had them on the ground,

2916
02:48:00.111 --> 02:48:03.200
had a dominant position,
how to choke,
couldn't finish the choke,

2917
02:48:03.410 --> 02:48:06.830
and then they got up and we're fucking sling it knuckles at each other.
And it's,

2918
02:48:06.831 --> 02:48:11.120
yeah,
it was one of the wildest,
most aggressive fights.
The way I described it,

2919
02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:14.180
they,
those punches were like,
what'd you say about my mother punches?

2920
02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:17.420
That's the way I described it,
because they were just,
there was so ridiculous.

2921
02:48:17.421 --> 02:48:20.780
It was still like throughout the fights we were seeing a number of haymakers

2922
02:48:20.810 --> 02:48:24.680
thrown a lot of over the top running,
throwing punches.

2923
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:28.910
It was pretty intense.
There was a lot of,
there was people complained about it,

2924
02:48:28.911 --> 02:48:32.810
like pumps.
It always happens online.
People complain.
But I thought there was a,

2925
02:48:32.990 --> 02:48:33.823
there was some,

2926
02:48:33.890 --> 02:48:37.520
some fights that weren't the most dramatic because they were evenly matched and

2927
02:48:37.521 --> 02:48:42.140
then went to decision,
but that Varner fight and then of course that fucking the,

2928
02:48:42.170 --> 02:48:47.150
the main event was a huge disaster.
Yeah,
the stoppage.
The premature stoppage.

2929
02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:49.570
Yeah.
It's too bad because,
uh,

2930
02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:54.410
first of all it's too bad because Hanan Barao looked fucking sensational.
I mean,

2931
02:48:54.411 --> 02:48:59.190
he cracked Uriah faber with this big punch and he heard them with a bad leg
kick.

2932
02:48:59.191 --> 02:49:01.580
Before that Matt kick was like a whip.

2933
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:05.460
He cracked your ride with a hard leg kick and you can see your,

2934
02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:07.800
I have like a little bit of a limp to him right after that.

2935
02:49:07.801 --> 02:49:11.340
Like it was a hard kick and then he caught him with that big punch and had them

2936
02:49:11.341 --> 02:49:12.174
really hurt.

2937
02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:17.600
And so for him it sucks because he had Uriah really badly hurt and it doesn't

2938
02:49:18.270 --> 02:49:20.760
give him like this,
this definitive ending.

2939
02:49:21.090 --> 02:49:25.180
He was looking at the referee when he was like hammer fist and your wife wanted

2940
02:49:25.290 --> 02:49:28.530
the referee to stop the fight,
which of course look,
he's the champion,

2941
02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:31.950
he wants to retain his title.
It's worth a lot of money to him it's,
it's,

2942
02:49:31.951 --> 02:49:36.630
it's very valuable.
It's also a moment of,
you know,
a point of pride,

2943
02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:39.000
but he had your rial really badly hurt.

2944
02:49:39.030 --> 02:49:42.360
It would have been way better if you could finish them off legitimately,

2945
02:49:42.570 --> 02:49:45.210
you know,
if he finished him off like where there's no controversy.

2946
02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:49.980
But herb dean stopped the fight Kinda early,
but you know,

2947
02:49:49.981 --> 02:49:51.990
and herb sign like he didn't know.
Like what if,

2948
02:49:51.991 --> 02:49:56.520
what if he stopped the fight and Uriah,
like after a Hanan Barao got off of them,

2949
02:49:56.521 --> 02:49:59.580
rolls over onto his back and he's unconscious.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,

2950
02:49:59.581 --> 02:50:02.040
he's getting cracked.
He's hurt,
he's wobbling,

2951
02:50:02.041 --> 02:50:05.550
he's hanging on and he just had his hands up and he's getting hit with punches.

2952
02:50:05.910 --> 02:50:08.460
I didn't think it was quick enough to stop the fight or I didn't think it was

2953
02:50:08.461 --> 02:50:10.980
bad enough to stop the fight.
But I'm not a refereeing man.
I'm not.

2954
02:50:10.981 --> 02:50:15.120
I'm not in there.
Right next to the guys he is.
And he made a bad call.

2955
02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:17.610
But it's because he wanted everybody to be safe.

2956
02:50:17.611 --> 02:50:21.300
It's the right call to make if you're,
if you're concerned with being safe.
Yeah.

2957
02:50:21.390 --> 02:50:24.840
This is the Jamie Varner able to Hilo fight.
Boom.

2958
02:50:24.841 --> 02:50:27.900
That's the punch that landed.
Oh my God,
that's crazy.

2959
02:50:28.290 --> 02:50:30.570
But the way they were winging at each other,
look at this.

2960
02:50:30.750 --> 02:50:35.160
They're winging punches at each other.
Oh,
Tree Hilo hit him.
So perfect too.

2961
02:50:35.490 --> 02:50:40.410
And he was chasing after.
True.
Hilo.
I mean,
it was,
the whole thing was so crazy.

2962
02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:44.100
It was a,
it was a cool,
like one of the wildest,

2963
02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:46.900
like Donny Brooke style fights,
one of the wild,

2964
02:50:47.460 --> 02:50:50.400
most slobber knocker fights I've ever seen.
It's one of the fight.

2965
02:50:50.401 --> 02:50:52.530
It's the fight that gets an audience excited.

2966
02:50:52.740 --> 02:50:55.010
That's the kind of fight that people are fired up about.

2967
02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:58.300
I feel sorry for you or I favor a little bit.
Yeah.

2968
02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:01.500
That he didn't have a chance to actually come back and he's a fucking durable

2969
02:51:01.501 --> 02:51:02.250
guy too,

2970
02:51:02.250 --> 02:51:06.660
because he might have been able to get out of that and survive and come back.

2971
02:51:06.661 --> 02:51:08.940
We saw with Frankie Edgar versus gray Maynard.

2972
02:51:08.941 --> 02:51:12.540
He was hurt even worse than Uriah Faber was.
But look,
he came back and he won.

2973
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:16.140
We came back and he made a draw out of it.
Who was it that fuck was it Martin?

2974
02:51:16.380 --> 02:51:20.820
They got out of a crazy armbar.
Where was he at?
Uh,
putting it on.

2975
02:51:21.270 --> 02:51:25.590
Um,
no,
that was a,
Martin was putting it on and uh,
he,
uh,

2976
02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:30.060
put it on fucking Russian guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maga Madoff.
Mike.
I met him.
Yeah.

2977
02:51:30.061 --> 02:51:32.650
That was a crazy fight.
First round,
he,
he,

2978
02:51:32.750 --> 02:51:37.750
he dominated that dude on the ground and got a real good deep arm bar and the

2979
02:51:38.281 --> 02:51:40.950
guy was screaming in agony when he was trying to get out of it.

2980
02:51:40.951 --> 02:51:45.150
Like you can see his arms hyperextended screaming in agony and managed to get

2981
02:51:45.151 --> 02:51:48.150
out of it and actually managed to win the fight.
Yeah.
That was incredible.

2982
02:51:48.151 --> 02:51:50.580
That was absolutely incredible.
Seeing like,
get out of it.
Fuck yeah,

2983
02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:53.970
there was some,
uh,
some great fights.
Josie,
all of those are fucking beast.

2984
02:51:53.971 --> 02:51:58.560
And so is that kid Ricardo Lamas,
man.
Ricardo Lamas is a tough fucking kid.

2985
02:51:59.530 --> 02:52:03.270
Um,
we also saw uh,
uh,
uh,

2986
02:52:03.300 --> 02:52:06.730
Alistair and Frank Mir.
Yeah.
And um,
do that,

2987
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:10.780
that knee to the face.
Yeah.
I have,
I know a friend,

2988
02:52:10.810 --> 02:52:14.770
so I have a really good seats.
I was like,
hey side.
And that,

2989
02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:19.920
that knee was right in front of us and you hear it and we saw Frank's eyes roll

2990
02:52:20.141 --> 02:52:23.830
back.
I was certain,
first of all,
this,
I just heard his jaw get cracked in half.

2991
02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:29.060
And I also thought because he stumbled big time,
I thought he was absolutely.

2992
02:52:29.061 --> 02:52:31.750
Yeah.
Yeah.
He didn't want to go down and look.
Frank Mir is a tough motherfucker,

2993
02:52:31.751 --> 02:52:36.040
man.
He's tough.
He's tough and he's experienced and the dude is just been there,

2994
02:52:36.041 --> 02:52:39.720
done that.
It's hard to take him out,
you know,
even to this day.

2995
02:52:39.721 --> 02:52:42.850
That's why I was so impressive that Josh Barnett took him out so fast in the

2996
02:52:42.851 --> 02:52:45.850
first round.
Frank's fucking tough math.
We already kept trying to,

2997
02:52:45.851 --> 02:52:49.720
when he was trying to win and he was getting,
he was getting hit pretty good.

2998
02:52:50.470 --> 02:52:53.260
Almost had to give it to you at one point in time,
but Alster popped out of it.

2999
02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:53.861
But you know,

3000
02:52:53.861 --> 02:52:56.350
maybe a frank God that earlier in the fight before he'd taken all that

3001
02:52:56.351 --> 02:52:57.970
punishment,
maybe we would have more strength.

3002
02:52:58.060 --> 02:53:01.240
It's incredible to be able to take that abuse and still be in it though.

3003
02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:03.190
Well Alster fuck conservatively.

3004
02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:06.040
You liked kind of admitted to it that he was worried because he had lost two

3005
02:53:06.041 --> 02:53:08.770
fights in a row and he wanted to make sure he played it safe and got the win.

3006
02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:12.360
By the way,
was it Trujillo that,
that um,
you asked something like your,

3007
02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:14.470
did it hurt and he was like,
I heard like a mug then.
Yeah,

3008
02:53:15.690 --> 02:53:18.520
he was totally honest about it.
I mean,
yeah.
All right,

3009
02:53:18.580 --> 02:53:21.340
so we ran out of time and we're going to turn into a pumpkin soon.
Uh,

3010
02:53:21.470 --> 02:53:25.480

Thank you everybody who came to New York this weekend.

We had a great fucking time.
It couldn't have been a nicer crowd.

3037
02:54:42.731 --> 02:54:46.120
You guys were cool as fuck.
And even though everybody had to get over a thousand,

3038
02:54:46.121 --> 02:54:49.030
people had to get upstairs through two elevators.
Um,

3039
02:54:49.031 --> 02:54:51.580
we mentioned at the beginning of the show that we're going to start late because

3040
02:54:51.581 --> 02:54:54.190
of that.
And everybody cheered and they were happy.
And we got,

3041
02:54:54.280 --> 02:54:57.670
we got everybody seated before the show started.
It just,
I couldn't,

3042
02:54:57.730 --> 02:54:59.290
I can't thank you guys enough.
It's just,

3043
02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:04.070
it's a real honor having people that are so nice and so cool come to our shows.
I

3044
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:05.090
<v 0>don't know how it happened,</v>

3045
02:55:05.091 --> 02:55:08.570
but we're going to make sure that we continue to try to nurture this.
All right.
