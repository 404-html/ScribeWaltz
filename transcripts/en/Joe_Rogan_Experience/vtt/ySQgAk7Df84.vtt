<v Speaker 2>I had been an electrical engineer and a</v>

118
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 2>lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know anything about</v>

119
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:51.870
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we,</v>

120
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 2>we just sort of sold ourselves out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

121
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 2>And by the time we were done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last six or eight,</v>

122
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 2>nine months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was financing the thing by selling</v>

123
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:01.654
<v Speaker 2>ecstasy.</v>

124
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I knew a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my acting class,</v>

125
00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:06.800
<v Speaker 1>and you know how long I was smacked in</v>
<v Speaker 1>class years.</v>

126
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I loved it by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of reasons.</v>

127
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Mainly because it was just fun to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a just,</v>

128
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of craziness and Joe would</v>
<v Speaker 1>always make fun of me,</v>

129
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:16.940
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy,</v>

130
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.770
<v Speaker 1>really good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal guy,</v>

131
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.050
<v Speaker 1>so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was,</v>

132
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.060
<v Speaker 1>and I hired him to shoot me to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>this audition.</v>

133
00:05:26.061 --> 00:05:29.810
<v Speaker 1>So I go to his house and he's got this</v>
<v Speaker 1>great camera and on his wall is a dream</v>

134
00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 1>board and on his wall is his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

136
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:34.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

137
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.650
<v Speaker 1>He's put his face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's put pictures of his face on the</v>

138
00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:42.530
<v Speaker 1>cover of vanity fair and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines,</v>

139
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.130
<v Speaker 1>he's got slogan's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the guy,</v>

140
00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:50.150
<v Speaker 1>you're the one and it's a dream board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was big.</v>

141
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.070
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Covered his whole wall man.</v>

142
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.930
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a good guy and he's like,</v>

143
00:05:53.931 --> 00:05:56.660

<v Speaker 1>And a lot of ways he's just been told</v>

144
00:05:56.661 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>the wrong as Jay Davis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it is not cheap.</v>
