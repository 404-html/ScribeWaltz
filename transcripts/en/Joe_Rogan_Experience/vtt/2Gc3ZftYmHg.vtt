1
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.310
<v Speaker 1>The yes</v>

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 2>and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up man?</v>

3
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 2>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate it.</v>

5
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me come up.</v>

6
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 2>why don't you tell people what you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:20.541
<v Speaker 2>I am a muscle physiologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm a phd in human bioenergetics and </v>

9
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:21.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm the director for the Center for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport performance,</v>

10
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 2>which all that basically means I studied</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle physiology,</v>

11
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 2>why it grows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shrinks,</v>

12
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 2>repairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dyes and all that crap.</v>

13
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 2>Now when you're dealing with athletes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're dealing with like state of </v>

14
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.251
<v Speaker 2>the art performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much does that stuff change like </v>

15
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:37.251
<v Speaker 2>year to year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like protocols,</v>

16
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 2>like what people used to think was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to go,</v>

17
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 2>what's the new way to go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

18
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 2>if you take a look or if you examine </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the idea of science in general,</v>

19
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 2>it's the understanding that we're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That totally what science is.</v>

20
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we knew what the answer was,</v>

21
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't look into it.</v>

22
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the point of doing a study </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we know the answer,</v>

23
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by definition we're always evolving </v>

24
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.651
<v Speaker 2>in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's quite funny how the central </v>

25
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 2>tenants are really not that different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take nutrition,</v>

26
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:06.261
<v Speaker 2>you take training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of those things are </v>

27
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:06.261
<v Speaker 2>similar to what they were 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

28
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 2>8,100</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

29
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 2>so the bulk of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what matters for the bulk of athletes is</v>

30
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:16.971
<v Speaker 2>fairly standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What where it differs is the last few </v>

31
00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:20.151
<v Speaker 2>percentage points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's getting us that last 10 percent </v>

32
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:23.151
<v Speaker 2>gains or being very specific so you on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal level need this little bit of </v>

33
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 2>difference when you need this tiny bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of difference,</v>

34
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 2>but the bulk of it really is not that </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

35
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 2>but when you watch an mma fighters in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

36
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:35.841
<v Speaker 2>you see so many different methods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean so many different ways to approach </v>

37
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 2>things and I never know who's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 2>is it really depends upon who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful and they'd go,</v>

39
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 2>well that guy obviously has it down.</v>

40
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a major fallacy called the </v>

41
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 2>fallacy of authority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so or appeal to authority,</v>

42
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.011
<v Speaker 2>which is somebody really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it or somebody who coaches somebody </v>

43
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 2>really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it or a lot of people did it.</v>

44
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.340
<v Speaker 2>All.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three of those are examples of major </v>

45
00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.340
<v Speaker 2>logical fallacies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

46
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 2>To break down on Aristotle's reasoning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not what we do now,</v>

47
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 2>they can help us with some ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 2>where to go,</v>

48
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 2>but that's a really bad approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to understand like what works</v>

49
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:10.701
<v Speaker 2>for somebody at a very high levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily going to work for the </v>

50
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 2>bulk of people and particular if like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the great example is is Schwartzenegger.</v>

51
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 2>So when he came out and with his book of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Encyclopedia of bodybuilding,</v>

52
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 2>everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic,</v>

53
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:22.821
<v Speaker 2>I'll go do those workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not arnold and you should be </v>

54
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 2>doing what arnold did when he was at </v>
<v Speaker 2>your stage.</v>

55
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Not at his stage will also is doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucket of steroids.</v>

56
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Well that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

57
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if especially back in those days,</v>

58
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 2>they didn't come clean about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

59
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 2>So guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

60
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I call my biceps are ripping off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bone.</v>

61
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or how come it's not working for them.</v>

62
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all that is really important to </v>

63
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 2>understand what the context of recovery </v>
<v Speaker 2>than nutrition has.</v>

64
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 2>All the other stresses that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminated from his life.</v>

65
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 2>All of that changes what's going to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not work for you.</v>

66
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a bunch of different ways of</v>
<v Speaker 2>approaching things like I've always been</v>

67
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 2>fascinated by the marv method</v>

68
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.310
<v Speaker 3>and now nick curse on takes that method </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well and their idea is that strength </v>

69
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.141
<v Speaker 3>and conditioning is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when a fighters in camp is </v>

70
00:03:10.141 --> 00:03:13.351
<v Speaker 3>more important than anything more </v>
<v Speaker 3>important even than skill work because </v>

71
00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 3>you already know how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so strength and conditioning should</v>

72
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:19.981
<v Speaker 3>take precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get all that done to get your body to </v>

73
00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 3>the point where you have the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>horsepower,</v>

74
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 3>the biggest gas tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best tires,</v>

75
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best handling and then you already </v>

76
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 3>know how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just approach it that way.</v>

77
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the guy that actually trained Marv.</v>

78
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

79
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 3>This is the Fullerton guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It cal state fullerton.</v>

80
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:36.110
<v Speaker 3>So he was the cyclist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

81
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's his name,</v>

82
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 3>y e s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>s Russian name.</v>

83
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's awesome.</v>

84
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:45.091
<v Speaker 3>He's like 85 now or something and if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to get massively entertained by </v>

85
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:49.261
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's a good one because he's just </v>

86
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:49.261
<v Speaker 3>very opinionated.</v>

87
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:49.320
<v Speaker 3>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

88
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

89
00:03:50.421 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

90
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:52.910
<v Speaker 3>an important one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at Joel Jameson,</v>

91
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine who trains Demetrius </v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnson,</v>

92
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.450
<v Speaker 3>like all those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have very different approaches and </v>

93
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the massive fallacies,</v>

94
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 3>it's actually goes back to your original</v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

95
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 3>is thinking that there is one single </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

96
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.520
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

97
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Whether we're talking training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition,</v>

98
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 3>recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice,</v>

99
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of these modalities,</v>

100
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 3>the major reason we have so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>internet fighting between experts and </v>

101
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.290
<v Speaker 3>why it makes it so difficult for so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to figure out like,</v>

102
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the right answer is because </v>

103
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.300
<v Speaker 3>searching for the right answers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem to begin with,</v>

104
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 3>we're having the wrong conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this crap.</v>

105
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not the right place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are two very different </v>

106
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.410
<v Speaker 3>approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For Demetrius,</v>

107
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 3>they reduce a lot of the strength </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning they do during camp because</v>

108
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 3>they want to get very good with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>train,</v>

109
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 3>with the fighting.</v>

110
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.720
<v Speaker 3>So all that stuff is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Joel believes in training as much as </v>

111
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 3>we can prior to camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in camp,</v>

112
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:46.621
<v Speaker 3>it's time to get better at fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone like nick is apparently has the </v>

113
00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:47.510
<v Speaker 3>opposite approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that either one of them is</v>
<v Speaker 3>more or less effective than the other.</v>

115
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 3>It really comes down to the combination </v>
<v Speaker 3>of coaches as well as the athlete.</v>

116
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Some athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

117
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 3>and you could attest to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've seen this a bunch of times,</v>

118
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 3>if they're two days out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three days out a week out,</v>

119
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 3>some of them get really anxious if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get to practice a skill.</v>

120
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Like I want to be really sharp with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>combinations.</v>

121
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 3>I want to be really good with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>transitions,</v>

122
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you take that away from them,</v>

123
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 3>they get very anxious and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it.</v>

124
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.890
<v Speaker 3>And so you almost have to do is program </v>
<v Speaker 3>at based on this combination of </v>

125
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 3>physiology and psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a bit outside of my realm,</v>

126
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 3>but this is what makes coaching so </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated is saying,</v>

127
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you know what?</v>

128
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:32.971
<v Speaker 3>For you athlete one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do the opposite </v>

129
00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:32.971
<v Speaker 3>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Athlete too,</v>

130
00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:36.980
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be doing the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach because you just don't feel as </v>

131
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.980
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not as confident,</v>

132
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 3>you're not filling the smooth and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than anything when they walked down</v>

133
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 3>to that cage or particularly two or </v>
<v Speaker 3>three days before,</v>

134
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.510
<v Speaker 3>they have to feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

135
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.610
<v Speaker 3>You have to have that combination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

136
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 3>It is weird that like there is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

137
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one like a Mark Hunt is going </v>

138
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 3>to have a completely different set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirements than you know,</v>

139
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.730
<v Speaker 3>a Derek Lewis or a mighty mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnson or anybody.</v>

140
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like everybody's got different </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs and,</v>

141
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 3>and everybody's coming to the table with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different set of skills and a </v>

142
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 3>different set of problems.</v>

143
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you look at experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

144
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.870
<v Speaker 3>So what worked for you in your second </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight when you were 20 is maybe not the </v>

145
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.870
<v Speaker 3>same approach you have to take when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 30.</v>

146
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got back from New York.</v>

147
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 3>I was in there the last three days and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was with one of my guys,</v>

148
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:23.801
<v Speaker 3>Dennis Bermudez and we had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation and when I first started </v>

149
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 3>working with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had to take a very different approach</v>

150
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 3>the week of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially even,</v>

151
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hour before the fight because the </v>

152
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.991
<v Speaker 3>way that he got ramped up for a fight is</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different than some other people </v>

153
00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 3>that I've worked with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we had to realize.</v>

154
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:38.420
<v Speaker 3>And I remember he called me right after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

155
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.470
<v Speaker 3>one of his recent fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

156
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 3>maybe four or five fights go and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

157
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:46.811
<v Speaker 3>I'm freaking out because I didn't freak </v>
<v Speaker 3>out in the cages time when really I was </v>

158
00:06:46.811 --> 00:06:46.811
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

159
00:06:46.811 --> 00:06:46.811
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

160
00:06:46.811 --> 00:06:51.401
<v Speaker 3>I'm usually really freaked out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cage and this is what drives my </v>

161
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:54.221
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this time I was really calm and </v>

162
00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:54.221
<v Speaker 3>collected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw everything and I'm,</v>

163
00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm nervous that I'm not nervous enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had to get him in with,</v>

164
00:06:56.901 --> 00:07:01.901
<v Speaker 3>with my good friend Lenny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the Moses sports psychologist </v>

165
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:01.901
<v Speaker 3>who works a lot of combat sport athletes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

166
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to get you in a place of optimal</v>

167
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 3>arousal because if you're under aroused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a problem,</v>

168
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 3>but if you're over aroused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem as well.</v>

169
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.370
<v Speaker 3>So we had to change the tactics a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit between everything from his walk </v>

170
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.491
<v Speaker 3>down to the week of before the queuing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that we say to him to make </v>

171
00:07:15.491 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 3>sure he's in an optimal state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every other athletic worked.</v>

172
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Like all those approaches are completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

173
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 3>We can't have the same thing.</v>

174
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.480
<v Speaker 3>How do you train a guide to do is walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>down all this.</v>

175
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot we can do really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

176
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.790
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not sports psychologist so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go too much.</v>

177
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.800
<v Speaker 3>You know what they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely everything from breathing </v>

178
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 3>drills right to the queuing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the words you use.</v>

179
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the back,</v>

180
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 3>if you're a Dennis Bermudez five years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

181
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 3>you know Ryan Parsons would have to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>like real vile,</v>

182
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 3>horrible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like rip his fucking head off.</v>

183
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 3>I want you to bring it back into place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like murder him,</v>

184
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 3>rip him to shreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That works for some guys,</v>

185
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 3>for dentists at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that point.</v>

186
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Not Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now it's a little bit different </v>

187
00:07:59.530 --> 00:07:59.530
<v Speaker 3>approach and Ryan and can tell you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>details of what he does now,</v>

188
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:04.151
<v Speaker 3>but some guys that can you tell some </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people that backstage they're </v>

189
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:04.151
<v Speaker 3>gonna be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

190
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Like don't don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like telling me what to focus on.</v>

191
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:11.761
<v Speaker 3>Remind me my keys in my timing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the guys that are two ramped up </v>

192
00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very specific breathing drills,</v>

193
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:16.991
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can have them do as they're walking </v>

194
00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:18.300
<v Speaker 3>down the cage as they're in the cage a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're the first one down</v>

195
00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:20.610
<v Speaker 3>or the second one down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if their first down,</v>

196
00:08:20.611 --> 00:08:25.611
<v Speaker 3>sometimes that's a 10 minute delay </v>
<v Speaker 3>between when they're standing in the </v>

197
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:25.611
<v Speaker 3>cage and when they actually start </v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing.</v>

198
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not taking advantage of that </v>

199
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 3>time or if that time is getting taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage of you,</v>

200
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.530
<v Speaker 3>that can have a real problem with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy and especially if you get a guy </v>

201
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.071
<v Speaker 3>who is really savvy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a connor or John Jones who takes </v>

202
00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:41.360
<v Speaker 3>their time coming down and they mess </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you,</v>

203
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 3>they do different things on the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

204
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:45.650
<v Speaker 3>That really influences what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the guy in the cage,</v>

205
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're less experienced </v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe attend to the underdog or other</v>

206
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:52.880
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that can all be we be messed with.</v>

207
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Now a guy like Dennis Bermudez is a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

208
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

209
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.080
<v Speaker 3>you're</v>

210
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 2>working with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's obviously a world class fighter,</v>

211
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 2>but he always seems to fall just short </v>
<v Speaker 2>on these big fights.</v>

212
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

213
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where it's outside of my </v>

214
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:09.800
<v Speaker 2>expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a muscle physiologist,</v>

215
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:09.800
<v Speaker 2>not a psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

216
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.100
<v Speaker 2>But with his last performance against </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aaron Elca,</v>

217
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 2>who is a really tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very awkward.</v>

218
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:20.301
<v Speaker 2>Really just blood and guts type fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was a good matchup for very </v>

219
00:09:20.301 --> 00:09:20.700
<v Speaker 2>good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good matchup.</v>

220
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Skill-Wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should on paper.</v>

221
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Just so many good matchup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite dentist and a lot of ways where</v>

222
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:30.291
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to beat around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like two things are happening in </v>

223
00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:30.291
<v Speaker 2>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

224
00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I feel like Darren Elkins is getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>better for sure.</v>

225
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:37.311
<v Speaker 2>And he was super motivated and energized</v>
<v Speaker 2>by his performance over Merseyside </v>

226
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 2>backtick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an amazing comeback.</v>

227
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

228
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

229
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people felt like he was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite.</v>

230
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 2>That Dennis was the favorite going into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight.</v>

231
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On paper.</v>

232
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Clearly he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

233
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 2>from a lot of vantage points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really difficult.</v>

234
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

235
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.260
<v Speaker 2>without telling too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

236
00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Dennis story for him it was quite funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens with the game plan </v>

237
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 2>sometimes and what happens when they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there,</v>

238
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:07.311
<v Speaker 2>even with the seasoned guy like Denis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if a part of that was </v>

239
00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 2>because it was in New York and Dennis </v>
<v Speaker 2>his hometown,</v>

240
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 2>or if that was because of pat who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>good friend,</v>

241
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 2>fought right before and want to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy fight and the fight before,</v>

242
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 2>if you saw that you just don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes in.</v>

243
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

244
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:21.210
<v Speaker 2>sometimes like in the middle of a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like the fights over and like,</v>

245
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know why we did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just we got into this weird rhythm thing</v>

246
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:29.001
<v Speaker 2>and we started doing this and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened and that the </v>

247
00:10:29.001 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 2>rhythm can kind of take over the fight.</v>

248
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.210
<v Speaker 2>And Darren fought an amazing fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did exactly what he needed to do.</v>

249
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just the,</v>

250
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 2>from my perspective as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I one,</v>

251
00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I try to stay away from those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not my job,</v>

252
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

253
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 2>And this is what makes it exciting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

254
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:49.461
<v Speaker 2>It's why I work with these folks is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can have the perfect camp </v>

255
00:10:49.461 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 2>physically and sometimes you win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you lose.</v>

256
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 2>And so then you go back to the drawing </v>
<v Speaker 2>board and you go,</v>

257
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we throw everything out?</v>

258
00:10:55.591 --> 00:10:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Do we try something different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it though?</v>

259
00:10:57.921 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Is it psychological?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it physical?</v>

260
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically.</v>

261
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the physical game plan like you</v>

262
00:11:03.631 --> 00:11:08.631
<v Speaker 2>planned on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You must have planned on knowing how </v>

263
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:11.001
<v Speaker 2>Darren fights a super high paced in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>face type of fight that that part's not </v>

264
00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 2>a problem for dentists.</v>

265
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't really get tired and the vast</v>
<v Speaker 2>majority is fights,</v>

266
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.450
<v Speaker 2>but it looked a little bit like he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting tired and this fight again,</v>

267
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:23.451
<v Speaker 2>he can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from the feedback and from what we </v>

268
00:11:23.451 --> 00:11:23.451
<v Speaker 2>saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was like,</v>

269
00:11:23.451 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just maybe had a hard time focusing.</v>

270
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't ask them very specifically,</v>

271
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was going on there.</v>

272
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:33.531
<v Speaker 2>I kind of give them a few weeks to kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of get through that stuff before we </v>

273
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:33.531
<v Speaker 2>start going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

274
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 2>What's watched the tape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go through it.</v>

275
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Went through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to be careful not offending </v>

276
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:39.070
<v Speaker 2>him or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or his direct current,</v>

277
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:39.730
<v Speaker 2>just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

278
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.780
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean from my vantage it was like this </v>

279
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.930
<v Speaker 2>was not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not what we were looking for.</v>

280
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.930
<v Speaker 2>He should have just been more active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the second round,</v>

281
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 2>which is what really got them in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>east on the third round.</v>

282
00:11:51.391 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Once you kind of got into it dot Dennis </v>
<v Speaker 2>in our eyes,</v>

283
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.070
<v Speaker 3>lease was pretty dominated that round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least clearly ahead were one and </v>

284
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.890
<v Speaker 3>two were not so good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

285
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just potentially a focus potentially a</v>

286
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 3>lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

287
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.200
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He physically that happened to him in </v>

288
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:10.200
<v Speaker 3>the fight that he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He like,</v>

289
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:10.600
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't prepare for this.</v>

290
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:12.670
<v Speaker 3>We didn't think was gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is throwing me off.</v>

291
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 3>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

292
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.380
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't go in the second round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a weird job you have because </v>

293
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.910
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of relying on someone else </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pull the trigger.</v>

294
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.960
<v Speaker 3>You're relying on someone else to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>the moves and you could train them all </v>

295
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get them in incredible shape,</v>

296
00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

297
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:30.910
<v Speaker 3>ready go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're on autopilot.</v>

298
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 3>They're doing their own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially me,</v>

299
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 3>because I'm not the guy who's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>practice all day everyday with them.</v>

300
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not the Nickerson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not seeing them 12 hours a week.</v>

301
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

302
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.660
<v Speaker 3>like Dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't even see all camps sometimes </v>

303
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.931
<v Speaker 3>because he's in New York and I'm in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a in La and so it's like,</v>

304
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 3>so what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you give them a protocol,</v>

305
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 3>do you give them a schedule?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my role,</v>

306
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 3>depending on which fighter I'm with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is completely different.</v>

307
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes it's one phone call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of camp.</v>

308
00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

309
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 3>this came up when you think we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

310
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:06.420
<v Speaker 3>How do we go about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's a text three times a day </v>

311
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 3>everyday for the whole camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's phone calls.</v>

312
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to do like,</v>

313
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:13.411
<v Speaker 3>this is not my full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My full time job is to research muscle </v>

314
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:16.771
<v Speaker 3>physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work with MMA fighters and combat </v>

315
00:13:16.771 --> 00:13:17.300
<v Speaker 3>sport athletes is because I love it </v>
<v Speaker 3>rarely.</v>

316
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost like a side job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A side hobby,</v>

317
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

318
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:24.400
<v Speaker 3>If you want to think of it that way </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

319
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:26.710
<v Speaker 3>I have my full time living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got multiple labs to run.</v>

320
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.810
<v Speaker 3>Like this is what I do is publish </v>
<v Speaker 3>research,</v>

321
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take biopsies of people like hundreds,</v>

322
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.920
<v Speaker 3>tens of thousands of muscle fibers at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this point in my life and when I can </v>

323
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:37.920
<v Speaker 3>help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I think I can,</v>

324
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.430
<v Speaker 3>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I try not to.</v>

325
00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't work with general public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I our lab is different.</v>

326
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:47.701
<v Speaker 3>I'll put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most labs that do the type of muscle </v>

327
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:48.910
<v Speaker 3>research we do are focused on disease </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevention or treatment.</v>

328
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do we fight cancer?</v>

329
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 3>How do we get people back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the few that actually do this</v>

330
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:54.670
<v Speaker 3>on the other end of the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

331
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:59.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's study optimization like how do we </v>

332
00:13:59.730 --> 00:13:59.730
<v Speaker 3>thrive?</v>

333
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.640
<v Speaker 3>How do we not just get to 80 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do we kick ass at 80 years old </v>

334
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.320
<v Speaker 3>and becoming from a performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>background that I have a,</v>

335
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
<v Speaker 3>my athletic background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just makes so much sense.</v>

336
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.220
<v Speaker 3>I didn't come from martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>background at all,</v>

337
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:12.850
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't do anything until much </v>
<v Speaker 3>later in life,</v>

338
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.730
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I started paying attention to mma,</v>

339
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.250
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something energetically,</v>

340
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.240
<v Speaker 3>physiologically far different about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>demands of this sport and it's really </v>

341
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.090
<v Speaker 3>exciting and it's a really complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem to solve.</v>

342
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.500
<v Speaker 3>So I just started helping out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chipping in and then once you get help a</v>

343
00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:31.270
<v Speaker 3>couple of people and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fantastic,</v>

344
00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of the ball gets rolling.</v>

345
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:38.070
<v Speaker 3>So right now basically what I do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of it like concierge service if </v>

346
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 3>you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't,</v>

347
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't email me for training program.</v>

348
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't have an online website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can buy stuff from right here.</v>

349
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:45.490
<v Speaker 3>Like if somebody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

350
00:14:45.491 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 3>I know a friend who could really need </v>
<v Speaker 3>this or something.</v>

351
00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you coach people for Diet as well?</v>

352
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you do go through everything with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>

353
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Depending on what they need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how do you.</v>

354
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:59.411
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you decide like what a person </v>

355
00:14:59.411 --> 00:14:59.411
<v Speaker 3>needs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I say,</v>

356
00:14:59.411 --> 00:15:02.680
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darren Elkins came to you that he might </v>

357
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:02.680
<v Speaker 3>be very different than Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you,</v>

358
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.690
<v Speaker 3>how do you decide what a person needs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's depends on if they're local or </v>

359
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A blood work is the easy one,</v>

360
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 3>but the vast majority of what I do is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of conversation.</v>

361
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.690
<v Speaker 3>So I spend a lot of time on phone calls </v>
<v Speaker 3>and skype with them saying basically </v>

362
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 3>walk me through what have you done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are you at,</v>

363
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 3>how do you think I can help?</v>

364
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.510
<v Speaker 3>The number one thing I do then is say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

365
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 3>do you have who else on your team does </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

366
00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Who's helping you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get on a call with them.</v>

367
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Not so that I can tell them what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just let me know what your world was</v>

368
00:15:28.231 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 3>like and then I'll see if I can add some</v>
<v Speaker 3>advice and maybe we'll try this.</v>

369
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.280
<v Speaker 3>I can help you track things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you with my experience about </v>

370
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I've seen this happen before or I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that's happened before.</v>

371
00:15:38.731 --> 00:15:43.731
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened with the best </v>

372
00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:45.581
<v Speaker 3>example was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you remember last summer at the Rio </v>

373
00:15:45.581 --> 00:15:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Olympics when that Helen Miraculous won </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gold medal,</v>

374
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.210
<v Speaker 3>the first American ever female to win </v>
<v Speaker 3>gold and wrestling?</v>

375
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't paying attention.</v>

376
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go read the article in sports </v>

377
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:57.350
<v Speaker 3>illustrated that she wrote afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She beat,</v>

378
00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

379
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I think you Shita was her name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was a three time defending gold </v>

380
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 3>medalist and a 15 times straight world </v>
<v Speaker 3>title.</v>

381
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 3>It was just like rulon gardner when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat a Carolyn,</v>

382
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.730
<v Speaker 3>but the female version.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Helen went down there.</v>

383
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.600
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was down two to one with like 30 </v>

384
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.000
<v Speaker 3>seconds to go in the semi finals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came back and won.</v>

385
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Speaker 3>She was down a point to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is She in the finals?</v>

386
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:23.801
<v Speaker 3>Ends up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ends up upsetting her first American to </v>

387
00:16:23.801 --> 00:16:23.801
<v Speaker 3>ever win gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

388
00:16:23.801 --> 00:16:28.061
<v Speaker 3>I worked with Helen for about a year on </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight nutrition because she had to </v>

389
00:16:28.061 --> 00:16:31.931
<v Speaker 3>cut a whole bunch of extra weight for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time and the whole wrestling </v>

390
00:16:31.931 --> 00:16:32.810
<v Speaker 3>community was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll never get down to 53 kilos,</v>

391
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:34.460
<v Speaker 3>like don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to go up.</v>

392
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.120
<v Speaker 3>Because what happened was resting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really weird thing where world </v>

393
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 3>championships is a different weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes.</v>

394
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:45.971
<v Speaker 3>Then the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she was a world champion at 55 kilos </v>

395
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.740
<v Speaker 3>and either had to go up to 58 kilos for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Olympics,</v>

396
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.830
<v Speaker 3>which had a three time defending gold </v>
<v Speaker 3>medalist and a 15 times straight world </v>

397
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.860
<v Speaker 3>champion or go down to f 2:53</v>
<v Speaker 3>kilos to,</v>

398
00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.950
<v Speaker 3>to wrestle somebody who also had that 15</v>
<v Speaker 3>times cert world title.</v>

399
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.660
<v Speaker 3>So pounds wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a five or six pounds.</v>

400
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Six pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

401
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.730
<v Speaker 3>roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a big deal,</v>

402
00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:06.740
<v Speaker 3>but when you're already like scraping to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get there.</v>

403
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.770
<v Speaker 3>And so she had to make the decision to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go up or go down.</v>

404
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.500
<v Speaker 3>And what happened was she had an </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutritionist,</v>

405
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.350
<v Speaker 3>Eric rebel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you may know Eric,</v>

406
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.520
<v Speaker 3>he works at Barnett.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been around Josh,</v>

407
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:21.521
<v Speaker 3>big huge dude wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but eric was her nutritionist and Eric </v>

408
00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:25.690
<v Speaker 3>reached out to me because he's right </v>
<v Speaker 3>down where we're at and where Helen was </v>

409
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:26.330
<v Speaker 3>down here and he was basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'm doing obviously,</v>

410
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.930
<v Speaker 3>but like let's get as big a team as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible that make the right decisions </v>

411
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.380
<v Speaker 3>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how I like to work.</v>

412
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when a new person reaches out to me,</v>

413
00:17:35.211 --> 00:17:35.720
<v Speaker 3>I go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

414
00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.310
<v Speaker 3>who else do you have on board?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't fire them.</v>

415
00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:40.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anybody to get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's all put our heads together because</v>

416
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.600
<v Speaker 3>with MMA specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not making any income.</v>

417
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympic wrestlers of the same thing.</v>

418
00:17:46.401 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 3>She makes like 15 grand a year or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like he's.</v>

419
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what</v>

420
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 2>you have to understand when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>coaching them.</v>

421
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not team Dr Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's team Helen and all of us have </v>

422
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.691
<v Speaker 2>to be focused on her and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter if anyone knows what I do with </v>

423
00:18:02.691 --> 00:18:03.570
<v Speaker 2>her or not or anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you get the credit,</v>

424
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:08.571
<v Speaker 2>another nutritionist gets the credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to actually help these </v>

425
00:18:08.571 --> 00:18:11.601
<v Speaker 2>professional athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to let your ego go completely </v>

426
00:18:11.601 --> 00:18:11.790
<v Speaker 2>out the door and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why throw people out?</v>

427
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:16.791
<v Speaker 2>Let's take every information I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>about everything you've ever done and </v>

428
00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:20.481
<v Speaker 2>come together with solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if somebody else has an idea that </v>

429
00:18:20.481 --> 00:18:23.391
<v Speaker 2>you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's up to you to figure it out and </v>

430
00:18:23.391 --> 00:18:23.391
<v Speaker 2>give it to the athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

431
00:18:23.391 --> 00:18:23.391
<v Speaker 2>So what'd you find out with her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was the,</v>

432
00:18:23.391 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 2>what was the issue and how'd you get her</v>
<v Speaker 2>to lose the extra?</v>

433
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 2>So actually it was like a year of </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

434
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

435
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

436
00:18:29.601 --> 00:18:30.990
<v Speaker 2>like every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every week,</v>

437
00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:33.300
<v Speaker 2>every month something else came up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

438
00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:35.200
<v Speaker 2>we tackle this problem and then we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>another problem.</v>

439
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Iron was a huge one for her iron </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficiency and we had,</v>

440
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.910
<v Speaker 2>she was basically almost flat lined on </v>
<v Speaker 2>her iron,</v>

441
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.550
<v Speaker 2>looked anemic and we had to come in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

442
00:18:44.551 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we're going to add this.</v>

443
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 2>But she was also traveling to Mongolia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was going internationally.</v>

444
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:50.700
<v Speaker 2>So she kept getting sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mongolia,</v>

445
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for tournaments,</v>

446
00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.300
<v Speaker 2>because you had to qualify the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan and she's cutting.</v>

447
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:57.450
<v Speaker 2>She's had imagined wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Mongolian shake is terrifying.</v>

448
00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.850
<v Speaker 2>They all moving here at world champions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that terrifying.</v>

449
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 2>They're hardcore though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This kid shit out of me.</v>

450
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.880
<v Speaker 2>So she had to put her on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

451
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:11.030
<v Speaker 2>we had to basically play a game of </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying if we give you the things that </v>

452
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.881
<v Speaker 2>keep you from not being sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also the stuff that actually </v>

453
00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 2>harms iron absorption cheap.</v>

454
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:20.060
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things like vitamin C for examined </v>

455
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:20.060
<v Speaker 2>seed to keep you from getting sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

456
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.580
<v Speaker 2>So that can help you as you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about while she's dehydrating,</v>

457
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.620
<v Speaker 2>so you're saying anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're going to go travel </v>

458
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.571
<v Speaker 2>internationally for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take a big bolus of vitamin C </v>

459
00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:30.270
<v Speaker 2>and it may help you from getting sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>from getting cold.</v>

460
00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Does that really affected better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>probiotics?</v>

461
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:34.420
<v Speaker 2>To heal probiotics that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're on that too,</v>

462
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.980
<v Speaker 2>but the point was if you're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>on like a two week thing to eastern </v>

463
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.401
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you every advantage </v>

464
00:19:43.401 --> 00:19:43.401
<v Speaker 2>possible that not probably get a cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

465
00:19:43.401 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 2>but when wouldn't you do that on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular basis?</v>

466
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:49.281
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you accentuate the Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a traveling trip and give it some stuff </v>

467
00:19:49.281 --> 00:19:54.141
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean wouldn't you want that boost </v>

468
00:19:54.141 --> 00:19:55.971
<v Speaker 2>everywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the probiotics are basically a no </v>

469
00:19:55.971 --> 00:19:58.881
<v Speaker 2>brainer all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you don't see and everything </v>

470
00:19:58.881 --> 00:19:58.881
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

471
00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be careful because </v>

472
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:01.490
<v Speaker 2>anytime you go with a vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>

473
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have potential toxicity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and vitamin C,</v>

474
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.860
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

475
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.670
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

476
00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:07.980
<v Speaker 2>What's the toxicity rate of vitamin C </v>
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>

477
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not gonna actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

478
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.960
<v Speaker 2>put it this way at generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime you're getting a vitamin from a </v>

479
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.741
<v Speaker 2>food source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably nowhere near toxicity </v>

480
00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:18.741
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so natural consumption of food.</v>

481
00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:20.640
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be in a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you start taking three,</v>

482
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six grams of vitamin C at a time,</v>

483
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:28.670
<v Speaker 2>you're potentially going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and it's a whole host and what </v>

484
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.191
<v Speaker 2>makes it really complicated is there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction with other vitamins and </v>

485
00:20:31.191 --> 00:20:31.260
<v Speaker 2>minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the iron,</v>

486
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:32.940
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you give them with vitamin C,</v>

487
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:36.870
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna help absorption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but zinc is going to do the opposite and</v>

488
00:20:36.871 --> 00:20:41.871
<v Speaker 2>so if you do these other combinations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to potentially have </v>

489
00:20:41.871 --> 00:20:42.810
<v Speaker 2>problems or you're potentially safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we say the campus,</v>

490
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.930
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean zinc doesn't help vitamin C </v>

491
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:48.030
<v Speaker 2>absorption or it doesn't help iron </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorption?</v>

492
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.580
<v Speaker 3>Iron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zinc actually messes up your iron </v>

493
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:53.580
<v Speaker 3>absorption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime you have an a,</v>

494
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vitamin or mineral,</v>

495
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.030
<v Speaker 3>you have potential either co absorption </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you have a confliction,</v>

496
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.270
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to cut things off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does zinc conflict with iron?</v>

497
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the chemistry behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

498
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the have a lot of that and you look up </v>

499
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.390
<v Speaker 3>basically vitamin A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vitamin D,</v>

500
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.030
<v Speaker 3>vitamin K and magnesium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vitamin K with bone absorption,</v>

501
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:15.450
<v Speaker 3>so you have to make sure that it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you're eating one at </v>

502
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:15.450
<v Speaker 3>breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

503
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Another one at launches at Howard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get it from food,</v>

504
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:18.280
<v Speaker 3>you're basically safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we don't really.</v>

505
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:23.310
<v Speaker 3>This is stuff we don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you supplement like during your </v>

506
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.310
<v Speaker 3>lunch or during your breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

507
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.751
<v Speaker 3>this is what the general answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't supplement with vitamins and </v>

508
00:21:27.751 --> 00:21:27.751
<v Speaker 3>minerals unless you have a very specific</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

509
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.920
<v Speaker 3>And we did that for the vast majority of</v>
<v Speaker 3>camp,</v>

510
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:34.000
<v Speaker 3>but she was continually getting sick </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of a variety of reasons.</v>

511
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:37.750
<v Speaker 3>Some that I probably shouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so we're like,</v>

512
00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:38.320
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

513
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.510
<v Speaker 3>We addressed that and then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

514
00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:42.910
<v Speaker 3>now you're super anemic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's get away from that.</v>

515
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:48.810
<v Speaker 3>But what we did basically is get iron </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to a decent level as soon as </v>

516
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 3>possible and then go off of everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>and go right back to food.</v>

517
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.480
<v Speaker 3>How are you failing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that one,</v>

518
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.120
<v Speaker 3>she was so low on iron as soon as we got</v>
<v Speaker 3>her to decent level,</v>

519
00:21:56.121 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 3>like within days it was just like tears </v>
<v Speaker 3>of joy if like I feel so much better.</v>

520
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sleeping all the time,</v>

521
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:07.590
<v Speaker 3>but it was continued with the hard part </v>
<v Speaker 3>with her was getting her down and then </v>

522
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.930
<v Speaker 3>you would be shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the food was like in Rio,</v>

523
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.010
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

524
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.270
<v Speaker 3>They told me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

525
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.800
<v Speaker 3>at the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

526
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Like they told them you'd have a c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>D and then we get down there and she </v>

527
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.700
<v Speaker 3>called me the first day and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have nothing.</v>

528
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:21.160
<v Speaker 3>We've got McDonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got popcorn and cookies.</v>

529
00:22:21.161 --> 00:22:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Like there's nothing down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

530
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.930
<v Speaker 3>She's like five Olympic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible.</v>

531
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean the basketball players probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>had something but like he's a wrestler.</v>

532
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:34.411
<v Speaker 3>She didn't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they had better food for the more </v>

533
00:22:34.411 --> 00:22:38.551
<v Speaker 3>prominent sports probably probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they probably brought their own </v>

534
00:22:38.551 --> 00:22:38.551
<v Speaker 3>chefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

535
00:22:38.551 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

536
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's dealing with the team and then </v>

537
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.511
<v Speaker 3>she had to be shipped out of Rio to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>other city two hours away or an hour </v>

538
00:22:45.511 --> 00:22:45.670
<v Speaker 3>away or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

539
00:22:45.671 --> 00:22:50.671
<v Speaker 3>there's no grocery store here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even walk to the store to get </v>

540
00:22:50.671 --> 00:22:50.671
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything decent.</v>

541
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.820
<v Speaker 3>So we had real problems.</v>

542
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm about to do a opening ceremonies and</v>

543
00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:59.350
<v Speaker 3>we had a plan for food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like basically we're going hour by hour,</v>

544
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.420
<v Speaker 3>how do you feel like where are we at </v>
<v Speaker 3>these types of things.</v>

545
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 3>And she wanted to do opening ceremonies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she called me.</v>

546
00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:05.440
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do opening ceremonies.</v>

547
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

548
00:23:05.861 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 3>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>

549
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.250
<v Speaker 3>This is what I want you to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And whatever it was.</v>

550
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:10.870
<v Speaker 3>And with the next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

551
00:23:10.871 --> 00:23:12.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm right next to Michael Phelps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the front,</v>

552
00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:17.461
<v Speaker 3>like I don't want to get out of line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go back out and neat </v>

553
00:23:17.461 --> 00:23:17.461
<v Speaker 3>because I don't to lose my spot next to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Philips in the front.</v>

554
00:23:17.461 --> 00:23:17.461
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

555
00:23:17.461 --> 00:23:22.141
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well she was supposed to eat whatever </v>

556
00:23:22.141 --> 00:23:22.420
<v Speaker 3>vegetable and food and fat source we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>

557
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she's like,</v>

558
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.690
<v Speaker 3>all they have is cookies and popcorn.</v>

559
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.870
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'll just start.</v>

560
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.640
<v Speaker 3>And we actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was one time we didn't do.</v>

561
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:35.670
<v Speaker 3>We didn't want to do that because she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was at a problem where she was so </v>

562
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.590
<v Speaker 3>calorically underserved for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She or her body would crash quite often,</v>

563
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.660
<v Speaker 3>so we had to keep her nutrients really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

564
00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:44.440
<v Speaker 3>really high or vitamins and minerals to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep her at a low calorie count,</v>

565
00:23:44.441 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 3>but her body not freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she was like,</v>

566
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.820
<v Speaker 3>what do I do not eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we had to actually go to the popcorn</v>

567
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:53.660
<v Speaker 3>because of the good fat and the butter </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it had to keep her from not feeling</v>

568
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:58.661
<v Speaker 3>terrible to get it surprised go to for </v>
<v Speaker 3>popcorn for nutrition at the Olympia and</v>

569
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.310
<v Speaker 3>she was there for like six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to be there for like an</v>

570
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.930
<v Speaker 3>hour and go into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a shit show.</v>

571
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.710
<v Speaker 3>That's the most now.</v>

572
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.760
<v Speaker 3>What about other athletes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

573
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean forget about this specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirements or someone who has to lose </v>

574
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:09.820
<v Speaker 3>a ton of way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

575
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you deal with most athletes,</v>

576
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:12.260
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

577
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:17.300
<v Speaker 3>what kind of like a strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning protocols do you have the </v>

578
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.350
<v Speaker 3>mom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of recovery protocols like are</v>

579
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 3>using Cryo therapy or sauna?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of stuff we're using.</v>

580
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 3>So all of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

581
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:26.000
<v Speaker 3>I think at the problem is thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one answer there.</v>

582
00:24:26.001 --> 00:24:28.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any athletes that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we do.</v>

583
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:29.210
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is our method.</v>

584
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:34.450
<v Speaker 3>This is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a generally a terrible approach </v>

585
00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:35.300
<v Speaker 3>is combination of where that who they </v>
<v Speaker 3>with what have they done,</v>

586
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.100
<v Speaker 3>what's their past history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they like,</v>

587
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.930
<v Speaker 3>were they not like what do we really </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to get?</v>

588
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:43.931
<v Speaker 3>So I try to identify what's compromising</v>
<v Speaker 3>their performance and let's pick the </v>

589
00:24:43.931 --> 00:24:44.780
<v Speaker 3>best solution for that issue.</v>

590
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.050
<v Speaker 3>So you show up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your problem is agility.</v>

591
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:53.051
<v Speaker 3>Your footwork,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just too slow in your feet or </v>

592
00:24:53.051 --> 00:24:53.051
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna have a different approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your training.</v>

593
00:24:53.051 --> 00:24:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Then when someone says you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>out stretch,</v>

594
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.360
<v Speaker 3>you're getting out strength here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone's pushing you around too </v>

595
00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:58.360
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to rebuild your feet.</v>

596
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to improve your maximum </v>
<v Speaker 3>speed because you're already the fastest</v>

597
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:03.680
<v Speaker 3>and the division.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe your strength is your issue.</v>

598
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:07.480
<v Speaker 3>So do you do a bunch of tests on them </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they come to you and then you tried</v>

599
00:25:07.481 --> 00:25:08.630
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of tests do you do?</v>

600
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 3>So we have an entire center for sport </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>

601
00:25:11.151 --> 00:25:15.140
<v Speaker 3>We've got six or eight laboratories in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it with a whole host of equipment.</v>

602
00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.230
<v Speaker 3>The thing we put the mask on them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make them run field to Max.</v>

603
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

604
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:23.861
<v Speaker 3>If we need to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can actually measure the amount of </v>

605
00:25:23.861 --> 00:25:23.861
<v Speaker 3>oxygen and carbon dioxide coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the body,</v>

606
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.540
<v Speaker 3>which allows us to get a number called </v>
<v Speaker 3>the vo two Max,</v>

607
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:29.810
<v Speaker 3>which is the maximum amount of oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you bring in and exhale.</v>

608
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.310
<v Speaker 3>So it tells us basically year your </v>
<v Speaker 3>maximum cardiovascular capacity and it's</v>

609
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:38.690
<v Speaker 3>pseudo important for mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the average person's like at 40,</v>

610
00:25:38.691 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 3>45,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to give you some context,</v>

611
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:43.610
<v Speaker 3>that number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone past about 60,</v>

612
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.670
<v Speaker 3>if you continue to go up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going really make you fight any</v>

613
00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:51.671
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's one of the things that we did </v>

614
00:25:51.671 --> 00:25:54.010
<v Speaker 3>or we found doing all the research on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the MMA folks is if a point of </v>

615
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.941
<v Speaker 3>diminishing return come around 60.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you show up and you're a jake </v>

616
00:25:57.941 --> 00:26:00.350
<v Speaker 3>ellenberger and you're at 52 and I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get you to 58,</v>

617
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.870
<v Speaker 3>then that's going to help your </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance a lot,</v>

618
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:07.990
<v Speaker 3>but when you show up in your pack </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments and you're 66 and I get you to </v>

619
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.481
<v Speaker 3>69,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not gonna make you fight any </v>

620
00:26:10.481 --> 00:26:10.481
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not your problem.</v>

621
00:26:10.481 --> 00:26:13.721
<v Speaker 3>What makes you lose in a fight is other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you need to spend that </v>

622
00:26:13.721 --> 00:26:13.721
<v Speaker 3>precious training time on.</v>

623
00:26:13.721 --> 00:26:18.460
<v Speaker 3>So when you get a guy or a girl and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have them in your studio and you start </v>

624
00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:23.711
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's like the first thing you do </v>

625
00:26:23.711 --> 00:26:23.711
<v Speaker 3>with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it would honestly,</v>

626
00:26:23.711 --> 00:26:24.170
<v Speaker 3>the first thing would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what did the manager or why do they</v>

627
00:26:24.171 --> 00:26:29.171
<v Speaker 3>reach out to me the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because usually when they come to me </v>

628
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:29.171
<v Speaker 3>it's problem fixing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't come to me with like,</v>

629
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:29.390
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one seven fights in Roseville.</v>

630
00:26:29.391 --> 00:26:30.590
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

631
00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Usually it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

632
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.380
<v Speaker 3>this is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing because of this reason.</v>

633
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 3>That's gotta be frustrating though </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you'll,</v>

634
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 3>when someone's losing the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a slippery slope.</v>

635
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.640
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to catch yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

636
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:41.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's,</v>

637
00:26:41.791 --> 00:26:46.791
<v Speaker 3>it's the game to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes they just want another </v>

638
00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:49.320
<v Speaker 3>answer which is just not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a rough answer.</v>

639
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna tell them that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>coat,</v>

640
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.100
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

641
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:55.200
<v Speaker 3>so we'll all watch the fights of course </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to their team.</v>

642
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.480
<v Speaker 3>So I'll give you a specific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ample examples.</v>

643
00:26:57.481 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 3>So they come to me and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

644
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

645
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're fast enough on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>

646
00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:03.690
<v Speaker 3>This is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

647
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:05.550
<v Speaker 3>well we've got force plates that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

648
00:27:05.551 --> 00:27:10.551
<v Speaker 3>really sensitive measurement equipment </v>
<v Speaker 3>built into the ground and we can have </v>

649
00:27:10.551 --> 00:27:10.551
<v Speaker 3>them do a variety of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

650
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.370
<v Speaker 3>of jumping test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving test,</v>

651
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.240
<v Speaker 3>lifting test force plates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does it work?</v>

652
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:20.450
<v Speaker 3>So it's a really expensive scale </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically built into the ground and it </v>

653
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 3>measures it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

654
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 3>there is big as your laptop or as big as</v>
<v Speaker 3>the table.</v>

655
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's fairly small.</v>

656
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as big as the whole table?</v>

657
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:28.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can,</v>

658
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.890
<v Speaker 3>not ours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have one that's maybe the size of</v>

659
00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.830
<v Speaker 3>a small coffee table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

660
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 3>And then there's two of them back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

661
00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can do your right foot on one,</v>

662
00:27:37.831 --> 00:27:38.700
<v Speaker 3>your left foot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another one,</v>

663
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.260
<v Speaker 3>so we can test everything from not only </v>
<v Speaker 3>your forest,</v>

664
00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:44.970
<v Speaker 3>which is like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I measured your maximum dead lifts,</v>

665
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.700
<v Speaker 3>I would know how strong your back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your hamstrings and your glutes.</v>

666
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 3>But how do you produce that force is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>big key.</v>

667
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.480
<v Speaker 3>So a good example is years ago we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>some fighters come in and one of them </v>

668
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 3>was clearly not fast enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wouldn't believe it.</v>

669
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:04.730
<v Speaker 3>So he was strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it took him a long time to produce </v>

670
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:05.820
<v Speaker 3>that force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to give you a number,</v>

671
00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:08.580
<v Speaker 3>let's say you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could produce 100 newtons of force,</v>

672
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:10.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just making the number up.</v>

673
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:15.770
<v Speaker 3>And I produced 100 newtons of force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it took you one second to get </v>

674
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.281
<v Speaker 3>there and it took me a hundred seconds </v>
<v Speaker 3>or half a second to get there in an MMA </v>

675
00:28:19.281 --> 00:28:19.290
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have one second.</v>

676
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.120
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have 100 newtons of usable </v>
<v Speaker 3>force in your sport?</v>

677
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

678
00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:28.590
<v Speaker 3>You just said he didn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he didn't think he was slow.</v>

679
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:33.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thought the problems were other </v>

680
00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:33.610
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

681
00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:33.610
<v Speaker 3>What do they think the problems were?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

682
00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Coaching like I'm not getting the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>things start.</v>

683
00:28:35.771 --> 00:28:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

684
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.280
<v Speaker 3>they had my walkout song wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you told them your slow dude,</v>

685
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.580
<v Speaker 3>that was my thing where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

686
00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:46.770
<v Speaker 3>His coaching staff was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think this is a problem.</v>

687
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Well let's put them on a force plate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see not only how much force you </v>

688
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.311
<v Speaker 3>produced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's strength numbers were high </v>

689
00:28:55.311 --> 00:28:56.310
<v Speaker 3>squatted to lie dead to the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the time it took him to produce that</v>

690
00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:01.350
<v Speaker 3>force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's called the rate of force </v>

691
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.350
<v Speaker 3>development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

692
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.370
<v Speaker 3>his peak velocity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time it took him to get to that </v>

693
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.370
<v Speaker 3>velocity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that,</v>

694
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:08.211
<v Speaker 3>when I compare it to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the other athletes and nfl players </v>

695
00:29:08.211 --> 00:29:08.211
<v Speaker 3>and stuff was just like off the charts </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

696
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what exercise do you do to measure that?</v>

697
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.920
<v Speaker 3>So now that's a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when we have to individual athletes,</v>

698
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:18.921
<v Speaker 3>they come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So say one is the opposite to one of </v>

699
00:29:18.921 --> 00:29:18.921
<v Speaker 3>them is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

700
00:29:18.921 --> 00:29:21.150
<v Speaker 3>really good at producing fast quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other one takes a long time.</v>

701
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.840
<v Speaker 3>So the one that doesn't produce fast or </v>
<v Speaker 3>forced very quick,</v>

702
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.360
<v Speaker 3>we would put them on a drill where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

703
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:30.420
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goal of your training is to maximize</v>

704
00:29:30.421 --> 00:29:33.000
<v Speaker 3>how quickly you produce for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care how heavy you get,</v>

705
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.000
<v Speaker 3>but this is a reactive strength thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a speed thing.</v>

706
00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:40.200
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to do a maybe little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>lighter squats,</v>

707
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:45.230
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to explode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to transition out of the </v>

708
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.230
<v Speaker 3>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to bounce,</v>

709
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.230
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use Momentum.</v>

710
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:49.351
<v Speaker 3>You gonna Swing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to generate fast as </v>

711
00:29:49.351 --> 00:29:51.841
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to go to maximal </v>

712
00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:51.841
<v Speaker 3>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other guy,</v>

713
00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:51.841
<v Speaker 3>we get the opposite.</v>

714
00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:55.560
<v Speaker 3>We would take the speed advantage away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from him or her and say you need to be </v>

715
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.460
<v Speaker 3>able to produce more strength without </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking advantage of the speed.</v>

716
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:02.461
<v Speaker 3>And it's basically comes down to using </v>
<v Speaker 3>the muscle for force or the connective </v>

717
00:30:02.461 --> 00:30:06.901
<v Speaker 3>tissue for force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's really what we can tease out </v>

718
00:30:06.901 --> 00:30:10.150
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of speed and athletic </v>

719
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.050
<v Speaker 3>performance is genetic and how much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is what you've been doing and how </v>

720
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 3>much can you improve?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

721
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:18.931
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we actually just completed a really </v>

722
00:30:18.931 --> 00:30:20.590
<v Speaker 3>cool study on monozygotic twins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>monozygotic twins means you're the exact</v>

723
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:23.930
<v Speaker 3>same DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a sperm went in implant,</v>

724
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.430
<v Speaker 3>the two implanted one egg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the egg split and you became identical.</v>

725
00:30:27.431 --> 00:30:32.431
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we found two twins that were the </v>

726
00:30:32.431 --> 00:30:34.711
<v Speaker 3>exact same DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of them had been doing a like </v>

727
00:30:34.711 --> 00:30:38.940
<v Speaker 3>marathons and stuff for 35 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other hadn't done anything in 35 </v>

728
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:39.790
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

729
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.780
<v Speaker 3>So we had this exact question that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

730
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.930
<v Speaker 3>Identical DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one variable different,</v>

731
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.650
<v Speaker 3>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a huge variable though.</v>

732
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.300
<v Speaker 3>One is a super endurance athlete and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ns one,</v>

733
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:57.690
<v Speaker 3>the other one's a lazy bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that or maybe studies a </v>

734
00:30:57.971 --> 00:30:59.110
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

735
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

736
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a truck driver.</v>

737
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so weird.</v>

738
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.380
<v Speaker 3>That's unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it?</v>

739
00:31:05.381 --> 00:31:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Like extremely unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually kind of share similar interests.</v>

740
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.750
<v Speaker 3>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there are differences,</v>

741
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.070
<v Speaker 3>there are differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mild,</v>

742
00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of do this and you do a little </v>

743
00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:17.420
<v Speaker 3>bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

744
00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:17.420
<v Speaker 3>So what were the differences in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>body types?</v>

745
00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.230
<v Speaker 3>So we tested them for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A cardiovascular stuff,</v>

746
00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.440
<v Speaker 3>vo two Max strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these same tests that we do with the</v>

747
00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:23.860
<v Speaker 3>MMA fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle biopsies,</v>

748
00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:25.090
<v Speaker 3>fiber type,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much fast,</v>

749
00:31:25.091 --> 00:31:26.220
<v Speaker 3>how much slow twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

750
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:31.260
<v Speaker 3>all the ones in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we found was of course the </v>

751
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.000
<v Speaker 3>endurance athlete had higher vo two Max,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no brainer you,</v>

752
00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:39.001
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you run a hundred miles a week for 30 </v>

753
00:31:39.001 --> 00:31:39.001
<v Speaker 3>years and your brother doesn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

754
00:31:39.001 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have better </v>
<v Speaker 3>cardiovascular system,</v>

755
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.020
<v Speaker 3>blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol,</v>

756
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.490
<v Speaker 3>all that crap better than the trained </v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes.</v>

757
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.810
<v Speaker 3>But the strength did not favor the </v>
<v Speaker 3>athlete.</v>

758
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.340
<v Speaker 3>The muscle quality didn't favor the </v>
<v Speaker 3>athlete.</v>

759
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.020
<v Speaker 3>The total amount of muscle didn't favor </v>
<v Speaker 3>the athlete.</v>

760
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.650
<v Speaker 3>The speed didn't favor with the athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really know and want to hear.</v>

761
00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:04.651
<v Speaker 3>The craziest part is the fiber type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trained athlete and his quad was 90 </v>

762
00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 3>percent slow twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 percent fast twitch,</v>

763
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.070
<v Speaker 3>the untrained was 40 percent slow </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitch,</v>

764
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.450
<v Speaker 3>about 30 percent fast twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then about 30 percent of some of the</v>

765
00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:18.250
<v Speaker 3>hybrids in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense to you?</v>

766
00:32:18.251 --> 00:32:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Because the guy was just constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>running work.</v>

767
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.310
<v Speaker 3>Now what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really weird,</v>

768
00:32:24.311 --> 00:32:26.060
<v Speaker 3>that the muscle quality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

769
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Didn't favor the athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what it mean,</v>

770
00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.320
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by muscle quality when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying that?</v>

771
00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.620
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

772
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:37.620
<v Speaker 3>You can take an ultrasound and you take </v>
<v Speaker 3>an image of the muscle and it looks at </v>

773
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.320
<v Speaker 3>it like a combination of how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>administering muscular fat there is with</v>

774
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.340
<v Speaker 3>the how much total muscle master is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the size and a bunch of different </v>

775
00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.360
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get this rough idea of quality.</v>

776
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.380
<v Speaker 3>How's it not favor guys exercising </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly?</v>

777
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be careful to only one </v>

778
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:57.100
<v Speaker 3>subject or two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we don't know,</v>

779
00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 3>but the one implication could be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

780
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:03.140
<v Speaker 3>endurance running and cycling is great </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

781
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.060
<v Speaker 3>There's a clear health advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

782
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:10.540
<v Speaker 3>but if that's all you do for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably not enough to save the </v>

783
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.251
<v Speaker 3>muscle capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know things that are that are </v>

784
00:33:15.251 --> 00:33:18.371
<v Speaker 3>actually going to predict mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vo Two max leg strength is one of the </v>

785
00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:20.270
<v Speaker 3>most significant predictors of how long </v>
<v Speaker 3>you live leg strength.</v>

786
00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:22.280
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely weird.</v>

787
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of Tom Platz should live forever.</v>

788
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

789
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Some of these guys that squat 900 now </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's diminishing returns.</v>

790
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.400
<v Speaker 3>$400.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take you to 4:15,</v>

791
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.960
<v Speaker 3>you're not living at day longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

792
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:39.130
<v Speaker 3>but think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the one of the big reasons why </v>

793
00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:42.071
<v Speaker 3>you go from living by yourself to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>assisted living home can't walk.</v>

794
00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.910
<v Speaker 3>I can't walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't stand up,</v>

795
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.360
<v Speaker 3>and the biggest one that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually starting to look at now is foot</v>

796
00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:49.790
<v Speaker 3>speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>foot speed.</v>

797
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.170
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

798
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.860
<v Speaker 3>If you trip and you're about to fall and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't put your foot out and catch </v>

799
00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.060
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have the foot speed to get </v>

800
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.220
<v Speaker 3>yourself out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these strength to stop yourself from</v>

801
00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:02.360
<v Speaker 3>falling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

802
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.700
<v Speaker 3>So balance and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

803
00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:09.701
<v Speaker 3>it's east centric strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ability to block all those forces </v>

804
00:34:09.701 --> 00:34:11.540
<v Speaker 3>into the ground to catch your whole body</v>
<v Speaker 3>mass from falling or the,</v>

805
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be also your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulate your body like yoga?</v>

806
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:20.230
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be able to control yourself in </v>

807
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.810
<v Speaker 3>awkward positions at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing they see is huge </v>

808
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:22.810
<v Speaker 3>increases in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just physical activity.</v>

809
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.230
<v Speaker 3>When you're stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you're really,</v>

810
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:29.231
<v Speaker 3>really strong and you're 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're much more likely to go to an </v>

811
00:34:29.231 --> 00:34:32.021
<v Speaker 3>extra yoga class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go and take the dog for an extra </v>

812
00:34:32.021 --> 00:34:32.021
<v Speaker 3>walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go grab the thing,</v>

813
00:34:32.021 --> 00:34:35.630
<v Speaker 3>but if I'm super weak and getting off </v>
<v Speaker 3>the toilet is a maximum effort squat,</v>

814
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm more likely to just keep in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>chair.</v>

815
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 3>Just stand on the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

816
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

817
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible that there wasn't any </v>
<v Speaker 3>increase in muscle quality,</v>

818
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.000
<v Speaker 3>so that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

819
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:49.910
<v Speaker 3>that's also one very specific type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>

820
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Endurance work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

821
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.690
<v Speaker 3>this guy was a bodybuilder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>

822
00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.280
<v Speaker 3>so that's exactly the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you.</v>

823
00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:00.340
<v Speaker 3>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the first question you asked </v>

824
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:00.340
<v Speaker 3>when we started talking was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

825
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:00.620
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the best type of workout?</v>

826
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.450
<v Speaker 3>What we will or what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

827
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.560
<v Speaker 3>the new age stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

828
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

829
00:35:04.821 --> 00:35:07.430
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to I think every one of us </v>
<v Speaker 3>would agree.</v>

830
00:35:07.431 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be as healthy as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>

831
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.400
<v Speaker 3>you need to do a variety of training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

832
00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.840
<v Speaker 3>It can't just be one modality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you've only done yoga your whole </v>

833
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.871
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably going to have strength </v>

834
00:35:19.871 --> 00:35:19.871
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speech problems.</v>

835
00:35:19.871 --> 00:35:20.570
<v Speaker 3>If you've only run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've only lifted weights,</v>

836
00:35:20.571 --> 00:35:23.330
<v Speaker 3>if you've only exposed yourself to a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these stimuli,</v>

837
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.750
<v Speaker 3>you're probably in a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we've,</v>

838
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 3>what we've done recently actually has </v>
<v Speaker 3>expanded that thinking.</v>

839
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my friend Brian Mackenzie and I have </v>

840
00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:37.721
<v Speaker 3>a book that we just came out a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago on this whole idea called </v>

841
00:35:37.721 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>unplugged where we need to</v>

842
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.010
<v Speaker 2>expand past just lifting and running and</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about what other physiological </v>

843
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:46.950
<v Speaker 2>exposures do we need that are important </v>
<v Speaker 2>for longevity.</v>

844
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.240
<v Speaker 2>How well do we do when we're hungry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about cold?</v>

845
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.390
<v Speaker 2>How about thirsty hot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How well do we do?</v>

846
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning performance wise meaning </v>

847
00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.521
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like are you manipulating diet to </v>

848
00:36:01.521 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 2>make people perform better when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold?</v>

849
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every combination.</v>

850
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:09.470
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to be able to sustain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>perform as well as we can throughout </v>

851
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.861
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we probably need to be able to handle a </v>

852
00:36:12.861 --> 00:36:12.861
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about longevity now,</v>

853
00:36:12.861 --> 00:36:15.960
<v Speaker 2>not like necessarily athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance and will equal athletes.</v>

854
00:36:15.961 --> 00:36:18.150
<v Speaker 2>We would use this under that umbrella </v>
<v Speaker 2>but very,</v>

855
00:36:18.151 --> 00:36:19.530
<v Speaker 2>very carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

856
00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:24.531
<v Speaker 2>I would not recommend a extensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting in during the middle of a six </v>

857
00:36:24.531 --> 00:36:24.940
<v Speaker 2>week camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of UFC fights.</v>

858
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Like this is not at all we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is something maybe we implement</v>

859
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:29.160
<v Speaker 2>outside of camp.</v>

860
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

861
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:34.470
<v Speaker 2>we have somebody who's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very carbohydrate dependent,</v>

862
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:40.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have a hard time using fat as a </v>

863
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.550
<v Speaker 2>fuel source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

864
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.360
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe in during that six week camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before UFC fight,</v>

865
00:36:42.361 --> 00:36:43.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not messing with a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount.</v>

866
00:36:43.621 --> 00:36:45.540
<v Speaker 2>We're not going on a new diet five weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>before a fight.</v>

867
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But maybe,</v>

868
00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.410
<v Speaker 2>oh you got hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got,</v>

869
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got an extended lay off.</v>

870
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Now we start to work on another part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your physiology.</v>

871
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.280
<v Speaker 2>So that next camp we've got more what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>called metabolic flexibility.</v>

872
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.970
<v Speaker 2>So we have an ability to switch back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth before between fuel sources.</v>

873
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're preparing someone for a </v>

874
00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:05.090
<v Speaker 2>very specific event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

875
00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Q,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're ramping up for September twelfth,</v>

876
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.700
<v Speaker 2>boom with this is we have a protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get ready.</v>

877
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:13.730
<v Speaker 2>But then after the fights over then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be working on very specific </v>

878
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.350
<v Speaker 2>balancing exercises or that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

879
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm of the belief that during those </v>

880
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.171
<v Speaker 2>last few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to be very specific to what </v>

881
00:37:24.171 --> 00:37:24.171
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get on weight,</v>

882
00:37:24.171 --> 00:37:25.470
<v Speaker 2>get focused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get all these things.</v>

883
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:30.950
<v Speaker 2>But now if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if we overspecification for too </v>

884
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:31.740
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have problems.</v>

885
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:37.370
<v Speaker 2>We have this complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fighting forces called </v>

886
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:39.801
<v Speaker 2>optimization versus adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So generally when you're optimizing,</v>

887
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.050
<v Speaker 2>you're not adapting and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that work?</v>

888
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.510
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

889
00:37:45.511 --> 00:37:48.510
<v Speaker 2>you brought up earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we do this stuff a lot.</v>

890
00:37:48.511 --> 00:37:51.210
<v Speaker 2>We've done a lot of studies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>published in this area.</v>

891
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:57.230
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just learning some of the </v>

892
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.230
<v Speaker 2>physiology behind what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 2>ice.</v>

893
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people ask me this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

894
00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.900
<v Speaker 2>you for ice are pro or against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why we have to be in </v>

895
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:03.150
<v Speaker 2>one side of the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

896
00:38:03.151 --> 00:38:03.770
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

897
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.920
<v Speaker 2>there's one guy who does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

898
00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:09.120
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't believe in ice.</v>

899
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.470
<v Speaker 2>And Misha tate had them on her podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like the anti ice guy.</v>

900
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.880
<v Speaker 2>He's like saying you shouldn't use ice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've looked at some of the pub med </v>

901
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.490
<v Speaker 2>studies and some of the various.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of benefits to ice,</v>

902
00:38:20.491 --> 00:38:22.980
<v Speaker 2>like I don't understand why anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be anti ice,</v>

903
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.750
<v Speaker 2>but it makes sense at all to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

904
00:38:24.751 --> 00:38:26.820
<v Speaker 2>it totally does and this is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm going.</v>

905
00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Anti ice makes sense to you or no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can.</v>

906
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Ken?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

907
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:30.960
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there is.</v>

908
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.200
<v Speaker 2>There's good scientific evidence to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are consequences of the ice </v>

909
00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.100
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in post injury or postworkout for.</v>

910
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.340
<v Speaker 2>So it depends on the workout context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

911
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:45.400
<v Speaker 2>So we'll go to easy examples so it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>so vague and theoretical.</v>

912
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 2>A post a workout that you try to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger and more muscle mass,</v>

913
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.100
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to do that right </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>

914
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Bingo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why?</v>

915
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because your body has time to recover in</v>

916
00:38:54.821 --> 00:38:57.250
<v Speaker 2>the actual inflammation is supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be good for you.</v>

917
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

918
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the signal to grow.</v>

919
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people have this really weird thing </v>

920
00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 2>where they like to personify your </v>
<v Speaker 2>humidify chemicals and physiology.</v>

921
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not good or bad,</v>

922
00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.710
<v Speaker 2>like inflammation isn't great or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just is.</v>

923
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a chemical like it doesn't give a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit at all.</v>

924
00:39:14.471 --> 00:39:15.760
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not conscious.</v>

925
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were to do and hop in an ice </v>

926
00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:21.750
<v Speaker 2>bath post of a lifting session when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to add muscle mass,</v>

927
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.350
<v Speaker 2>is gonna fuck up your game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

928
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're supposed to wait like two </v>

929
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:28.440
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

930
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:28.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not the right number though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more the better.</v>

931
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Probably more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably four to six.</v>

932
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

933
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why mess with it?</v>

934
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.670
<v Speaker 2>And I interference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read something about to the two hours </v>

935
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.731
<v Speaker 2>is good after a hard lift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we don't have any numbers to say </v>

936
00:39:38.731 --> 00:39:39.250
<v Speaker 2>optimal yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they would take a lot of studies to</v>

937
00:39:39.251 --> 00:39:41.320
<v Speaker 2>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well two's not good but three is better.</v>

938
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:44.470
<v Speaker 2>So everything she knows rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would have to titrate it up.</v>

939
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to do a study that says one </v>
<v Speaker 2>group gets two hours,</v>

940
00:39:46.691 --> 00:39:51.691
<v Speaker 2>one group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's three hours and then you'd have to </v>

941
00:39:51.691 --> 00:39:52.060
<v Speaker 2>like concentrate our effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much exactly.</v>

942
00:39:52.061 --> 00:39:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Effort is just kind of putting it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be in the same training program.</v>

943
00:39:54.761 --> 00:39:57.160
<v Speaker 2>We have to biopsy them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Preimposed take blood marks,</v>

944
00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.110
<v Speaker 4>a lot of jobs to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of work.</v>

945
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm so busy and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>creativity involved in it too because </v>

946
00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.141
<v Speaker 4>you have to Kinda like manipulate things</v>
<v Speaker 4>and figure stuff out and contemplate.</v>

947
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why I'm the director or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>CO director and I am the run my own lab </v>

948
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.030
<v Speaker 2>and I've got fantastic postdocs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>students that are actually the operators</v>

949
00:40:15.031 --> 00:40:15.690
<v Speaker 2>that execute</v>

950
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:21.010
<v Speaker 4>but it seems like everything is </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly evolving and shifting and </v>

951
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:21.010
<v Speaker 4>changing and it's like,</v>

952
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:25.800
<v Speaker 2>well I find myself honestly spending </v>
<v Speaker 2>more time being in the middle of saying </v>

953
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.390
<v Speaker 2>like let's stop all the fighting between</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and let's spend time saying,</v>

954
00:40:28.391 --> 00:40:33.391
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was good about this and what was </v>

955
00:40:33.391 --> 00:40:33.391
<v Speaker 2>bad about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when it comes to ice,</v>

956
00:40:33.391 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 2>what about an entry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are so many twists their ankle</v>

957
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:35.470
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

958
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.540
<v Speaker 2>do you believe in and icing it right </v>
<v Speaker 2>away?</v>

959
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:39.700
<v Speaker 2>I have to defer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not My area.</v>

960
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to finish the example,</v>

961
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.340
<v Speaker 2>so post lifting session,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not great,</v>

962
00:40:45.341 --> 00:40:50.341
<v Speaker 2>but maybe if you wait six hours or do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day and when we're talking </v>

963
00:40:50.341 --> 00:40:54.301
<v Speaker 2>about ice and we're talking about ice </v>
<v Speaker 2>baths that we were talking about or </v>

964
00:40:54.301 --> 00:40:54.301
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about like a cryo </v>
<v Speaker 2>chamber,</v>

965
00:40:54.301 --> 00:40:55.720
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd chamber research,</v>

966
00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.900
<v Speaker 2>so I'll have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually I should say this with </v>

967
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:00.900
<v Speaker 2>everything like this is as we know it </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

968
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as I started the show with like if </v>

969
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm wrong in a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say like actually all that </v>

970
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:08.850
<v Speaker 2>was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is part of it.</v>

971
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:08.850
<v Speaker 2>So what I've read about that</v>

972
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:13.220
<v Speaker 4>cryo chambers is the big thing is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>anti inflammatory markers in the blood </v>

973
00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:19.220
<v Speaker 4>or the reduction of inflammatory markers</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the blood and improvements inside of </v>

974
00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:23.890
<v Speaker 4>cold shock proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines that those </v>

975
00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:23.890
<v Speaker 4>would be beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if,</v>

976
00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:25.440
<v Speaker 4>if you're saying that,</v>

977
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.030
<v Speaker 2>but you got to be careful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial.</v>

978
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So beneficial for some things,</v>

979
00:41:29.221 --> 00:41:31.440
<v Speaker 2>but they're always going to come in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromise is something else.</v>

980
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:37.200
<v Speaker 2>So maybe beneficial for a power lifter </v>
<v Speaker 2>that may be beneficial for an endurance </v>

981
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.870
<v Speaker 2>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

982
00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.900
<v Speaker 2>But I'm going to make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

983
00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.620
<v Speaker 2>So you have physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I do.</v>

984
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what science is.</v>

985
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:48.500
<v Speaker 2>We we biopsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we took blood,</v>

986
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:53.501
<v Speaker 2>we measured one market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't take into context </v>

987
00:41:53.501 --> 00:41:53.501
<v Speaker 2>anything else in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

988
00:41:53.501 --> 00:41:55.280
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get a lift in and you're like,</v>

989
00:41:55.281 --> 00:42:00.281
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my elbow always things up on me after I </v>

990
00:42:00.281 --> 00:42:02.651
<v Speaker 2>lift and I bought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a competition in eight weeks or a </v>

991
00:42:02.651 --> 00:42:05.351
<v Speaker 2>show in eight weeks and would be like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>power lifting competition or body </v>

992
00:42:05.351 --> 00:42:08.641
<v Speaker 2>building competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you get in the ice that takes </v>

993
00:42:08.641 --> 00:42:10.841
<v Speaker 2>that pain away for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physiologically or animalistic or </v>

994
00:42:10.841 --> 00:42:11.030
<v Speaker 2>anything and that allows you to train </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

995
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Well then we can't see that that was bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

996
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Or if you were like some of my fighters </v>
<v Speaker 2>who they like,</v>

997
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 2>they feel more accomplished when they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

998
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:22.811
<v Speaker 2>They feel like they've done some work so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel less anxiety because they got </v>

999
00:42:22.811 --> 00:42:26.030
<v Speaker 2>in work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then now we were playing a game </v>

1000
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.541
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more complex when they got in the </v>

1001
00:42:28.541 --> 00:42:29.810
<v Speaker 2>exercise or the ice bath in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1002
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:31.760
<v Speaker 2>the ice bath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it would be true of anything.</v>

1003
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So setting them up for a psychological </v>

1004
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:37.460
<v Speaker 2>when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1005
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.060
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you factor that in,</v>

1006
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.370
<v Speaker 2>you have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're dealing with human beings.</v>

1007
00:42:40.371 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1008
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 2>But it might not even be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally,</v>

1009
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.860
<v Speaker 2>but really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really perceptive.</v>

1010
00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1011
00:42:46.371 --> 00:42:47.090
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1012
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:48.960
<v Speaker 2>I guess so for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean confidence is,</v>

1013
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.240
<v Speaker 2>is a giant factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1014
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:56.320
<v Speaker 2>With combat athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's some preliminary evidence </v>

1015
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:56.320
<v Speaker 2>that suggests perhaps an ice bath.</v>

1016
00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I think specifically post exercise in </v>
<v Speaker 2>crude model increased mitochondrial </v>

1017
00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:01.180
<v Speaker 2>biogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1018
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.730
<v Speaker 2>So now you say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's bad or good post-exercise </v>

1019
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:06.730
<v Speaker 2>while I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1020
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:10.001
<v Speaker 2>what's the goal of the training session </v>
<v Speaker 2>now when you say increased bio </v>

1021
00:43:10.001 --> 00:43:10.400
<v Speaker 2>mitochondrial biogenesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1022
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:15.460
<v Speaker 2>is that within a certain time period </v>
<v Speaker 2>post exercise or is that just period?</v>

1023
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a,</v>

1024
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.950
<v Speaker 2>it'll be when they took the biopsy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the blood marker.</v>

1025
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying,</v>

1026
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.610
<v Speaker 2>like within an hour after exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the sessions.</v>

1027
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:43:24.391 --> 00:43:26.690
<v Speaker 2>So this one I believe was immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>post exercise.</v>

1029
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:28.490
<v Speaker 2>So like finishing good event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1031
00:43:30.241 --> 00:43:34.520
<v Speaker 2>So now you've got a conundrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is physiology,</v>

1032
00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:35.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1033
00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.760
<v Speaker 2>So I get so fucking irritated when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say like,</v>

1034
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing.</v>

1035
00:43:38.631 --> 00:43:40.370
<v Speaker 2>And then they pull up plant flags about </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

1036
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.040
<v Speaker 2>We do what we don't do it because I sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle going like,</v>

1037
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:48.400
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be a terrible coach </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] because you're going to be </v>

1038
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 2>in a situation where you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to violate those rules.</v>

1039
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

1040
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.600
<v Speaker 2>that's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1041
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:56.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is why we're utterly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find that that's the case,</v>

1042
00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:01.550
<v Speaker 2>his diet as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I am a big proponent of variable </v>

1043
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.760
<v Speaker 2>diets and I think that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>biodiversity in.</v>

1044
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Well obviously there is where people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>allergic to certain cup type of foods,</v>

1045
00:44:08.361 --> 00:44:09.380
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1046
00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:14.180
<v Speaker 2>but I just think this one size fits all </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach to diet seems.</v>

1047
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:16.940
<v Speaker 2>The more I studied diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more it seems crazy.</v>

1048
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.690
<v Speaker 2>So I would ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about if I came to you</v>

1049
00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:23.240
<v Speaker 2>and said I'm going to do one workout </v>
<v Speaker 2>style the rest of my life,</v>

1050
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:25.940
<v Speaker 2>everyone would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's stupid.</v>

1051
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be a Yogi says where to </v>

1052
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:31.360
<v Speaker 2>go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most of us would say,</v>

1053
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1054
00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1055
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.950
<v Speaker 4>will also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think it's fun,</v>

1056
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:39.980
<v Speaker 4>but why do we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why is that acceptable to do that </v>

1057
00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:39.980
<v Speaker 4>with nutrition?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then why is that?</v>

1058
00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 4>I have to be ketogenic and this is what </v>
<v Speaker 4>I do the rest of my life,</v>

1059
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:45.870
<v Speaker 4>or I have to be a paleo or have to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything else lie.</v>

1060
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.690
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's you,</v>

1061
00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.320
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you said variability,</v>

1062
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:53.280
<v Speaker 4>I assume you mean having a wide variety </v>
<v Speaker 4>of foods in your daily?</v>

1063
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:58.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think also a wide variety of foods in </v>

1064
00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:00.651
<v Speaker 4>your daily life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also I think what works for you </v>

1065
00:45:00.651 --> 00:45:01.950
<v Speaker 4>might not work for Jamie or might not </v>
<v Speaker 4>work for me.</v>

1066
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:04.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the bio variability,</v>

1067
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:09.500
<v Speaker 4>but we're going to go inception on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>one because you're ready to go another </v>

1068
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:09.500
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1069
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.340
<v Speaker 4>If that is absolutely true and most </v>
<v Speaker 4>people recognize that,</v>

1070
00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:16.341
<v Speaker 4>but what we don't appreciate is the fact</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's not one diet that works </v>

1071
00:45:16.341 --> 00:45:16.341
<v Speaker 4>best for you.</v>

1072
00:45:16.341 --> 00:45:20.840
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there might be one day that works </v>

1073
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:20.970
<v Speaker 4>best for me from power lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it might be different if I'm running</v>

1074
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 4>hills or it might be the exact same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1075
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:24.030
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1076
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:28.050
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck bro it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1077
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:33.230
<v Speaker 4>what you're highlighting is a real issue</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's also one of the reasons why </v>

1078
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.760
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of what I would call </v>
<v Speaker 4>confidence men out there and I don't use</v>

1079
00:45:35.761 --> 00:45:38.510
<v Speaker 4>that in a good term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1080
00:45:38.511 --> 00:45:41.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean confidence been like con men </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's,</v>

1081
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:43.860
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 4>still tell you like,</v>

1082
00:45:43.861 --> 00:45:46.380
<v Speaker 4>this is my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the way to go.</v>

1083
00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:51.381
<v Speaker 4>You got to follow my way and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they almost always mock other diets,</v>

1084
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:54.270
<v Speaker 4>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.100
<v Speaker 4>How helpful is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Good.</v>

1086
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:57.540
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't help anything.</v>

1087
00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:02.570
<v Speaker 4>It's a big issue in the MMA community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see a lot of these guys popping up </v>

1088
00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:03.000
<v Speaker 4>where they're trying to make a name for </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

1089
00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:07.020
<v Speaker 4>It seems super common that someone wants</v>
<v Speaker 4>to diminish the,</v>

1090
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 4>the other people out there doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>different things and like this is our </v>

1091
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.890
<v Speaker 4>way and this is the only way is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right way.</v>

1092
00:46:12.891 --> 00:46:15.240
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a straight ego shot.</v>

1093
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:20.390
<v Speaker 4>Well also I think what they're playing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to is that fighters in particular want </v>

1094
00:46:20.431 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 4>someone to come along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go,</v>

1095
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:23.640
<v Speaker 4>Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the fucking solution.</v>

1096
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You come to me.</v>

1097
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.570
<v Speaker 4>This is a fucking house of power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get this shit right.</v>

1098
00:46:30.571 --> 00:46:33.420
<v Speaker 4>We know what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got a team of experts to.</v>

1099
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:35.310
<v Speaker 4>He's got a team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got a team.</v>

1100
00:46:35.311 --> 00:46:36.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you go,</v>

1101
00:46:36.681 --> 00:46:37.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm with the team.</v>

1102
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:38.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1103
00:46:38.201 --> 00:46:38.880
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started,</v>

1104
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:42.630
<v Speaker 4>I signed up with Joe's team and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you really start believing like,</v>

1105
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:43.650
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is gonna work.</v>

1106
00:46:43.651 --> 00:46:48.651
<v Speaker 4>But did you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think physiology is that </v>

1107
00:46:48.651 --> 00:46:49.200
<v Speaker 4>precious?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty precious.</v>

1108
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.600
<v Speaker 4>Not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't carry mean in terms of like,</v>

1109
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.400
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to be lined up perfect.</v>

1110
00:46:53.401 --> 00:46:55.710
<v Speaker 4>And there's a one magical combination of</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1111
00:46:55.711 --> 00:46:56.490
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

1112
00:46:56.491 --> 00:47:01.020
<v Speaker 4>But I think for some people clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some diets sure fit better.</v>

1113
00:47:01.021 --> 00:47:06.021
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a bunch of friends that went </v>
<v Speaker 4>plant based and not maybe not even </v>

1114
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:11.121
<v Speaker 4>Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the majority of their food is plant </v>

1115
00:47:11.121 --> 00:47:13.461
<v Speaker 4>based and they just feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their body just works better than the </v>

1116
00:47:13.461 --> 00:47:13.461
<v Speaker 4>vast majority of us would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1117
00:47:13.461 --> 00:47:18.430
<v Speaker 4>Then I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know a lot of other people that </v>

1118
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.430
<v Speaker 4>went fat based then they feel better </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

1119
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean like a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of coconut oil,</v>

1120
00:47:20.391 --> 00:47:25.391
<v Speaker 4>a lot of Avocados.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems to me especially true with </v>

1121
00:47:25.391 --> 00:47:28.470
<v Speaker 4>people that are in intense exercise and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why that is,</v>

1122
00:47:28.471 --> 00:47:30.500
<v Speaker 4>but it seems like a lot of dudes that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that Lyft,</v>

1123
00:47:30.501 --> 00:47:34.450
<v Speaker 4>a lot of weights or that are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu or wrestling or anything or this</v>

1124
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:37.660
<v Speaker 4>law explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me like a lot of fats and,</v>

1125
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:42.400
<v Speaker 4>and fish oils and things along those </v>
<v Speaker 4>lines when they add those to their diets</v>

1126
00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:45.820
<v Speaker 4>officially in particular seems to have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>big effect on grapplers.</v>

1127
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:51.270
<v Speaker 4>It seems to help them with joint issues </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of pain and maybe </v>

1128
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.310
<v Speaker 4>inflammation.</v>

1129
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>

1130
00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that most people are gonna </v>

1131
00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:01.030
<v Speaker 2>far better on a more traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate diet that are in the more </v>

1132
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:05.861
<v Speaker 2>explosive power strength stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially at the volumes that mma </v>

1133
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:07.880
<v Speaker 2>fighters are on because of the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>output they're doing,</v>

1134
00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.210
<v Speaker 2>less amount of glucose requirements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the muscles.</v>

1135
00:48:11.211 --> 00:48:16.211
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to be careful because this </v>

1136
00:48:16.211 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 2>is the exact same principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either you're adapting or you're </v>

1137
00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 2>optimizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're optimizing all the time,</v>

1138
00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:24.311
<v Speaker 2>then you're not adapting and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you push yourself to one end of </v>

1139
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:27.281
<v Speaker 2>the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to probably compromise the </v>

1140
00:48:27.281 --> 00:48:27.950
<v Speaker 2>metabolic ability to go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side of the spectrum.</v>

1141
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.060
<v Speaker 2>So spectrum meaning what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're defining it in any way,</v>

1142
00:48:32.061 --> 00:48:33.470
<v Speaker 2>but in this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1143
00:48:33.471 --> 00:48:36.110
<v Speaker 2>so say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get very good at metabolizing fat as</v>

1144
00:48:36.111 --> 00:48:41.111
<v Speaker 2>a fuel that may come with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences then of being able to use </v>

1145
00:48:41.111 --> 00:48:41.111
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates as a fuel.</v>

1146
00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.160
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in a sport that requires </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1147
00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.490
<v Speaker 2>that's potentially problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sport would it require you to use?</v>

1148
00:48:46.491 --> 00:48:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Carbohydrates versus ketones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's anaerobic.</v>

1149
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:53.660
<v Speaker 2>So almost by definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anything that's maximal intensity,</v>

1150
00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:57.070
<v Speaker 2>a difficulty is going to be heavily </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate for them.</v>

1151
00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had got you in here with Dom </v>
<v Speaker 2>D'agostino.</v>

1152
00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just had him on,</v>

1153
00:49:01.761 --> 00:49:02.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1154
00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:05.530
<v Speaker 2>he's all fat based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a,</v>

1155
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:10.610
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent Keto and he believes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that key to genic diets have a host of </v>

1156
00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.520
<v Speaker 2>benefits and that the human body just </v>
<v Speaker 2>functions better on them.</v>

1157
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's a good example.</v>

1158
00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1159
00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dom and I wouldn't say anything about </v>

1160
00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:20.660
<v Speaker 2>him without him being right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1161
00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:21.620
<v Speaker 2>not fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everything I've seen of him has been</v>

1162
00:49:21.621 --> 00:49:22.790
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1163
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much supportive.</v>

1164
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:26.060
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of what I've heard him</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1165
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:29.750
<v Speaker 2>but his main lens is being focused on </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer prevention,</v>

1166
00:49:29.751 --> 00:49:31.370
<v Speaker 2>epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

1167
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:34.460
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at some of the research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not an oncologist,</v>

1168
00:49:34.461 --> 00:49:36.110
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to speak a bit out of turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1169
00:49:36.111 --> 00:49:41.111
<v Speaker 2>but there are now actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification of several cancers that </v>

1170
00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:42.560
<v Speaker 2>thrive on fat rather than carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1171
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not seen this because he was </v>

1172
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 2>talking about a host of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancers that sugars and you stop them </v>

1173
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.260
<v Speaker 2>dead in their tracks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1174
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's fully right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's totally right on that.</v>

1175
00:49:54.771 --> 00:49:59.771
<v Speaker 2>But I did read something about a type of</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain cancer though that is not.</v>

1176
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:03.500
<v Speaker 2>Does not feed on sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1177
00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1178
00:50:04.941 --> 00:50:05.540
<v Speaker 2>it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1179
00:50:05.541 --> 00:50:08.500
<v Speaker 2>good for cancer or what kind of cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>alfre prop.</v>

1180
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 80 percent of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's right.</v>

1181
00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even 90 percent.</v>

1182
00:50:11.451 --> 00:50:16.451
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the number is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentally caused cancer or who </v>

1183
00:50:16.451 --> 00:50:16.451
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1184
00:50:16.451 --> 00:50:20.290
<v Speaker 2>But the vast majority of high intensity </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise is powered by carbohydrate for </v>

1185
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.540
<v Speaker 2>most of us who know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would it be carbohydrate versus it's</v>

1186
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:23.810
<v Speaker 2>more efficient and it's faster.</v>

1187
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1188
00:50:24.951 --> 00:50:26.960
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had you in here with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1189
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.940
<v Speaker 2>he would disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1190
00:50:28.941 --> 00:50:33.941
<v Speaker 2>there's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I got to be careful to say this </v>

1191
00:50:33.941 --> 00:50:34.010
<v Speaker 2>faster and it works better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1192
00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:39.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have carbohydrate directly in the </v>

1193
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:41.351
<v Speaker 2>muscle cell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's stored as muscle </v>

1194
00:50:41.351 --> 00:50:41.351
<v Speaker 2>glycogen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1195
00:50:41.351 --> 00:50:42.770
<v Speaker 2>And so it is an immediate fuel source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're at work,</v>

1196
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:44.030
<v Speaker 2>then those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your systemic,</v>

1197
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 2>those are coming from the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>circulation.</v>

1198
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:51.490
<v Speaker 2>So when you use carbohydrate for fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using the carbohydrate in the </v>

1199
00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:52.850
<v Speaker 2>muscle that is exercising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're doing bicep curls,</v>

1200
00:50:52.851 --> 00:50:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you're burning glycogen from the BICEP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiber,</v>

1201
00:50:55.610 --> 00:51:00.610
<v Speaker 2>not even the muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the individual fiber that's </v>

1202
00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.801
<v Speaker 2>contracting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how would that be more beneficial </v>

1203
00:51:02.801 --> 00:51:02.801
<v Speaker 2>than systemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's faster.</v>

1204
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm right there contracting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to move it throughout my </v>

1205
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:07.900
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I use fat as a fuel source,</v>

1206
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 2>it has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to be go through life policies,</v>

1207
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:12.620
<v Speaker 2>which means it's say it's stored fat in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your entire body.</v>

1208
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.300
<v Speaker 2>So people right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to this podcast,</v>

1209
00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:16.010
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who the fuck to believe.</v>

1210
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bug on a dude on Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1211
00:51:18.411 --> 00:51:21.170
<v Speaker 2>one thing you gotTa do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude on Wednesdays is another thing.</v>

1212
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the.</v>

1213
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.220
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's what I would say my </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest message is.</v>

1214
00:51:25.221 --> 00:51:30.221
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a right or wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the wrong question entirely is </v>

1215
00:51:30.221 --> 00:51:33.700
<v Speaker 2>who's right or wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any athletes who are on a </v>

1216
00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:33.700
<v Speaker 2>fat based?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1217
00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1218
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably those ones.</v>

1219
00:51:36.351 --> 00:51:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say that there's Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Civic Athlete.</v>

1220
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just like,</v>

1221
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.640
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't talk about my diet stuff.</v>

1222
00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Who Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say that.</v>

1223
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some do.</v>

1224
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority don't get.</v>

1225
00:51:43.751 --> 00:51:48.751
<v Speaker 2>But Helen did ironman about appellant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go through periods of that with her </v>

1226
00:51:48.751 --> 00:51:48.751
<v Speaker 2>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of reasons.</v>

1227
00:51:48.751 --> 00:51:51.110
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very successful with her periods of</v>

1228
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:52.430
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not when she's competing.</v>

1229
00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Even during training but not when she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>competing.</v>

1230
00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not like on competition day?</v>

1231
00:51:56.991 --> 00:51:58.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes a week of.</v>

1232
00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:00.950
<v Speaker 2>So on competition day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1233
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:05.951
<v Speaker 2>Because you feel like the glucose based </v>
<v Speaker 2>diets are more efficient in terms of </v>

1234
00:52:05.951 --> 00:52:06.500
<v Speaker 2>actual physical performance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1235
00:52:06.501 --> 00:52:08.570
<v Speaker 2>most specifically for rehydration </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposes too,</v>

1236
00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:14.130
<v Speaker 2>so because she's dehydrating heavily and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't consume carbohydrates and </v>

1237
00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.230
<v Speaker 2>the rehydration process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna have a real problem.</v>

1238
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1239
00:52:15.861 --> 00:52:20.861
<v Speaker 2>That makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't go there but we'll do it </v>

1240
00:52:20.861 --> 00:52:21.860
<v Speaker 2>even maybe like five days out or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>working of or something.</v>

1241
00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:25.270
<v Speaker 2>But what we have to be careful there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is one,</v>

1242
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.330
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

1243
00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:28.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not badmouthing dom at all.</v>

1244
00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nothing,</v>

1245
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.740
<v Speaker 2>but he's not dealing with somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally hypo caloric,</v>

1246
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:39.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we're going through an athlete </v>

1247
00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.351
<v Speaker 2>who is six weeks of coming down in </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories and if we start cutting out </v>

1248
00:52:41.351 --> 00:52:42.170
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we actually did address that.</v>

1249
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.610
<v Speaker 2>He was saying that when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about kidogenic states in particular,</v>

1250
00:52:46.611 --> 00:52:49.880
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about most people </v>
<v Speaker 2>during regular life,</v>

1251
00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:55.570
<v Speaker 2>50 grams carberry carbohydrates would </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep you in a ketogenic state,</v>

1252
00:52:56.031 --> 00:52:59.970
<v Speaker 2>but when you're talking about like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>pro athletes powerless,</v>

1253
00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:02.810
<v Speaker 2>you're in the hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,</v>

1254
00:53:02.811 --> 00:53:07.811
<v Speaker 2>250 and you're still cute agentic </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your body is much more </v>

1255
00:53:07.811 --> 00:53:07.811
<v Speaker 2>requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I told you,</v>

1256
00:53:07.811 --> 00:53:12.401
<v Speaker 2>he's smart guy like I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm generally on board with what he's </v>

1257
00:53:12.401 --> 00:53:14.381
<v Speaker 2>saying is a scientist just like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is micronutrient </v>

1258
00:53:14.381 --> 00:53:18.881
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if an athletes coming down and </v>

1259
00:53:18.881 --> 00:53:20.300
<v Speaker 2>calories that and especially if those </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories are coming from carbohydrates,</v>

1260
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:23.420
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates are their main source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates or plants.</v>

1261
00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.730
<v Speaker 2>So if we've compromised that and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>really low in calories,</v>

1262
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:30.210
<v Speaker 2>then they go down to nutrients about </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals and that's a real problem.</v>

1263
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:32.430
<v Speaker 2>So we have to be very careful with </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting them into Quito.</v>

1264
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 2>If it comes with a compromising of </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables,</v>

1265
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.310
<v Speaker 2>nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1266
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.010
<v Speaker 2>cold press juices or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what we do.</v>

1267
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the times we did that </v>

1268
00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:46.220
<v Speaker 2>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1269
00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.420
<v Speaker 2>that almost single handedly saved Rio </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a.</v>

1270
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:51.090
<v Speaker 2>It was a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a real physiological crash.</v>

1271
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Like just just sucks to think that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest level of amateur competition</v>

1272
00:53:54.961 --> 00:53:56.320
<v Speaker 2>they have poor food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1273
00:53:56.370 --> 00:54:01.370
<v Speaker 2>well we had a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to do because especially because </v>

1274
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:03.651
<v Speaker 2>she was basically broke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to like go up real struggle to </v>

1275
00:54:03.651 --> 00:54:06.321
<v Speaker 2>find a cold press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that we could get to her that </v>

1276
00:54:06.321 --> 00:54:09.740
<v Speaker 2>because we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was on like 40 ounces a day of that </v>

1277
00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:09.740
<v Speaker 2>for awhile and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1278
00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.190
<v Speaker 2>it's funny we did that and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1279
00:54:11.191 --> 00:54:13.740
<v Speaker 2>you could do the math but 200 grams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbs or something.</v>

1280
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:17.160
<v Speaker 2>And the second we did that her weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>just started falling.</v>

1281
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1282
00:54:18.271 --> 00:54:23.271
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we added 200 grams of carbs and poem </v>

1283
00:54:23.271 --> 00:54:23.271
<v Speaker 2>whites just flu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what would,</v>

1284
00:54:23.271 --> 00:54:24.260
<v Speaker 2>what do you attribute that to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Combination of,</v>

1285
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:26.730
<v Speaker 2>of physiological and psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors.</v>

1286
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.560
<v Speaker 2>Psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She felt better.</v>

1287
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:30.390
<v Speaker 2>So it caused her weight to drop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1288
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:35.690
<v Speaker 2>she was stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was freaked out the w and that's </v>

1289
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:35.880
<v Speaker 2>cortisol level capture with higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1290
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

1291
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:42.200
<v Speaker 2>So she was panicked and she was freaked </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and she was stressed because she </v>

1292
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:42.200
<v Speaker 2>didn't feel good and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not losing any weight.</v>

1293
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:46.581
<v Speaker 2>And once one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of it was we gave her a system </v>

1294
00:54:46.581 --> 00:54:46.581
<v Speaker 2>that she believed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1295
00:54:46.581 --> 00:54:47.040
<v Speaker 2>And so she like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1296
00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:49.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can do this.</v>

1297
00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh now I also physiological pumps some </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrients into you.</v>

1298
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.750
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like honestly,</v>

1299
00:54:54.751 --> 00:54:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what part of it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could have been all psychological,</v>

1300
00:54:57.661 --> 00:54:59.160
<v Speaker 2>it could have been all physiological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1301
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:04.160
<v Speaker 2>But what we know is it worked and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave her a bunch of nutrients and we're </v>

1302
00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:04.970
<v Speaker 2>like 40 ounces a day or up to 60 ounces </v>
<v Speaker 2>a day of,</v>

1303
00:55:04.971 --> 00:55:09.971
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fresh pressed vegetable juice and </v>

1304
00:55:09.971 --> 00:55:09.971
<v Speaker 2>just like clockwork every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1305
00:55:09.971 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1306
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:15.441
<v Speaker 2>this is such a complicated subject and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so nuanced and there's so many </v>

1307
00:55:15.441 --> 00:55:19.371
<v Speaker 2>different variables that I feel like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be a scientist to really truly </v>

1308
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:21.480
<v Speaker 2>understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1309
00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:26.940
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the problems with the Bro </v>

1310
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Science people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that do not have the real </v>

1311
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:31.200
<v Speaker 2>education and this stuff that are out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to coaching athletes and and teach</v>

1312
00:55:31.201 --> 00:55:32.970
<v Speaker 2>them what to do and what not to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1313
00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:38.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really know what you're talking </v>

1314
00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:38.140
<v Speaker 2>about and that becomes a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to get care.</v>

1315
00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Like it's funny because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't dominic said,</v>

1316
00:55:41.011 --> 00:55:41.700
<v Speaker 2>but he's example.</v>

1317
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.380
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard him plant the flag and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be unmovable.</v>

1318
00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Movable on idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because those of us that </v>

1319
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:49.410
<v Speaker 2>do this for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1320
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:51.060
<v Speaker 2>rarely do we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the other dicks that do it.</v>

1321
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like everyone else is like,</v>

1322
00:55:53.341 --> 00:55:58.341
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get this one on fiber type more than </v>

1323
00:55:58.341 --> 00:55:58.800
<v Speaker 2>anything in the planet fiber type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do for a living.</v>

1324
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I could tell you more about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>than vast almost anyone on the planet </v>

1325
00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.580
<v Speaker 2>and yet I'll still have people who like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this guy's instagram posts,</v>

1326
00:56:05.581 --> 00:56:06.240
<v Speaker 2>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong.</v>

1327
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I've hunted up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biopsied hundreds of people have </v>

1328
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:13.671
<v Speaker 2>isolated tens of thousands of fibers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>random under the lasers and studied </v>

1329
00:56:13.671 --> 00:56:16.841
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're gonna tell me because you </v>

1330
00:56:16.841 --> 00:56:16.841
<v Speaker 2>read one instagram post or one review </v>
<v Speaker 2>from two lanes.</v>

1331
00:56:16.841 --> 00:56:16.841
<v Speaker 2>Look put the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1332
00:56:16.841 --> 00:56:18.180
<v Speaker 2>people love doing that though.</v>

1333
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean nuts and they love it because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that reason.</v>

1334
00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.100
<v Speaker 2>I know they love to call bullshit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1335
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't respond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't matter what it still gets </v>

1336
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:28.200
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they know.</v>

1337
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck because I bombed them with </v>

1338
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:35.400
<v Speaker 2>youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing them walking them through the </v>

1339
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:35.400
<v Speaker 2>science and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

1340
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't read or watch that like </v>

1341
00:56:38.521 --> 00:56:38.521
<v Speaker 2>blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1342
00:56:38.521 --> 00:56:41.521
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong on instagram post.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had somebody on something a few weeks </v>

1343
00:56:41.521 --> 00:56:43.020
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some instagram or something and was like</v>

1344
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:48.450
<v Speaker 2>going through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was being super respectful so I </v>

1345
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:48.450
<v Speaker 2>didn't mind helping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

1346
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:52.771
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're done here because I already told </v>

1347
00:56:52.771 --> 00:56:52.771
<v Speaker 2>you about my three hour video on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you didn't watch it.</v>

1348
00:56:52.771 --> 00:56:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck off.</v>

1349
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Bingo.</v>

1350
00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Three hours.</v>

1351
00:56:58.631 --> 00:57:03.631
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A three hour video is a Goddamn gift </v>

1352
00:57:03.631 --> 00:57:06.841
<v Speaker 2>from God because if you stop and think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how much schooling you would have </v>

1353
00:57:06.841 --> 00:57:09.460
<v Speaker 2>to go through to get the information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in that three hour video,</v>

1354
00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:14.880
<v Speaker 2>it would take a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took my career and you can boil it </v>

1355
00:57:15.161 --> 00:57:17.380
<v Speaker 2>down to three hours and people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1356
00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1357
00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I went to an instagram page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy or some shit that said,</v>

1358
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.780
<v Speaker 2>you're an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I did a five minute videos.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>

1365
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Like here we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the whole Shebang.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's the link.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:43.411
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And throw it all up there and I still </v>

1369
00:57:43.411 --> 00:57:43.411
<v Speaker 2>get the change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't change when you train.</v>

1370
00:57:43.411 --> 00:57:43.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 2>so if someone has like a lot of fast </v>

1373
00:57:49.741 --> 00:57:49.741
<v Speaker 2>twitch muscle fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's see,</v>

1374
00:57:49.741 --> 00:57:51.730
<v Speaker 2>like Mike Tyson in his prime as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1375
00:57:51.731 --> 00:57:56.731
<v Speaker 2>it's like a ball of fast twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you turn a guy like Mike Tyson </v>

1376
00:57:56.731 --> 00:57:58.320
<v Speaker 2>into like an ultra marathon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1377
00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.760
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he could maybe complete one,</v>

1378
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

1379
00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So genetically he's elite at fighting.</v>

1380
00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:11.470
<v Speaker 2>He's just an explosive individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But making him like,</v>

1381
00:58:11.471 --> 00:58:12.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1382
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.220
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Goggins type character.</v>

1383
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have.</v>

1384
00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:19.240
<v Speaker 2>So the easiest way to understand this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>plasticity.</v>

1385
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Your ability to change your adaptability</v>
<v Speaker 2>is far higher than what people </v>

1386
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:29.821
<v Speaker 2>understand and in fact there's almost a </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct link between the increase in </v>

1387
00:58:29.821 --> 00:58:33.841
<v Speaker 2>technology and the increase in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts of what change and how much </v>

1388
00:58:33.841 --> 00:58:33.841
<v Speaker 2>they change.</v>

1389
00:58:33.841 --> 00:58:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our ability to measure it.</v>

1390
00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Bingo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1391
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:40.680
<v Speaker 2>So the reason why we didn't think fiber </v>
<v Speaker 2>type change 20 years ago is because we </v>

1392
00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:44.131
<v Speaker 2>didn't have the technology to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the fidelity to measure all the </v>

1393
00:58:44.131 --> 00:58:47.821
<v Speaker 2>ones that we were missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are also probably a </v>

1394
00:58:47.821 --> 00:58:48.080
<v Speaker 2>psychological factor in there as well as</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the people that are measuring it.</v>

1395
00:58:48.081 --> 00:58:52.330
<v Speaker 2>It's probably easier to say that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't change then to say that it does.</v>

1396
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:55.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it was just more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that was the evidence.</v>

1397
00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:56.250
<v Speaker 2>The comp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1398
00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's confirmation bias.</v>

1399
00:58:57.671 --> 00:59:02.671
<v Speaker 2>The first 10 studies had not shown it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so therefore you're not looking for it </v>

1400
00:59:02.671 --> 00:59:02.671
<v Speaker 2>really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1401
00:59:02.671 --> 00:59:03.220
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Move on.</v>

1402
00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise you'd be chasing your </v>

1403
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:08.260
<v Speaker 2>own tail forever on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1404
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you right now like it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1405
00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.600
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get things into,</v>

1406
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:16.200
<v Speaker 2>into publication when they completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged and entire the entire </v>

1407
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.670
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An example.</v>

1408
00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:18.850
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1409
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:23.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were the first one to try to </v>

1410
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.910
<v Speaker 2>publish a study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fiber types</v>

1411
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:27.130
<v Speaker 3>changed as response exercise training </v>
<v Speaker 3>and 20 years of research suggested </v>

1412
00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:29.060
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you'd have a very hard time </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting through review.</v>

1413
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.890
<v Speaker 3>They would hammer you for every little </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that like,</v>

1414
00:59:31.891 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you do this and did you do this?</v>

1415
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:36.940
<v Speaker 3>And because we're going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 3>skeptical and that's not a good reason,</v>

1416
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:37.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1417
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:39.080
<v Speaker 3>That's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be,</v>

1418
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:44.110
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A extraordinary claims require </v>

1419
00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:44.110
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1420
00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:47.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have no beef with that is what the </v>

1421
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:50.141
<v Speaker 3>problem is when the other people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't scientists and don't pay </v>

1422
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:51.920
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you don't know what like I do,</v>

1423
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.510
<v Speaker 3>then you need to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can talk about it.</v>

1424
00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:58.511
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talk about stuff I'm not an expert </v>

1425
00:59:58.511 --> 01:00:00.101
<v Speaker 3>about all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you need to be careful when someone </v>

1426
01:00:00.101 --> 01:00:00.101
<v Speaker 3>else walks in the room and goes like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1427
01:00:00.101 --> 01:00:00.700
<v Speaker 3>I do this for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1428
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:01.270
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1429
01:00:01.271 --> 01:00:02.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just concede the point,</v>

1430
01:00:02.421 --> 01:00:05.720
<v Speaker 3>but you need to be a little more open </v>
<v Speaker 3>with listening and gone.</v>

1431
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1432
01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know that.</v>

1433
01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1434
01:00:09.581 --> 01:00:10.180
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1435
01:00:10.181 --> 01:00:15.181
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you think of anything that has </v>

1436
01:00:15.181 --> 01:00:17.851
<v Speaker 4>changed other than the fiber types?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a change the way people look at </v>

1437
01:00:17.851 --> 01:00:18.580
<v Speaker 4>things recently because of technology.</v>

1438
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1439
01:00:19.391 --> 01:00:20.620
<v Speaker 3>that's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1440
01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:22.300
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1441
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:25.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hyperplasia is probably the biggest one.</v>

1442
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:28.240
<v Speaker 3>And what does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when your muscle gets bigger,</v>

1443
01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.660
<v Speaker 3>you the diameter of each individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle fiber gets larger.</v>

1444
01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:34.030
<v Speaker 3>So it just thickens right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1445
01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:37.510
<v Speaker 3>hyperplasia is a concept that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually add more muscle fibers total,</v>

1446
01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:42.900
<v Speaker 3>so you add sells to the entire muscle </v>
<v Speaker 3>and for decades basically if you say </v>

1447
01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:47.701
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't actually exist in humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>now as we're improving our fidelity of </v>

1448
01:00:47.701 --> 01:00:49.570
<v Speaker 3>our measurement techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a.</v>

1449
01:00:49.571 --> 01:00:51.760
<v Speaker 3>It happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know it happens in other mammals.</v>

1450
01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:57.180
<v Speaker 3>How what happens in humans when it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be very difficult and </v>

1451
01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.301
<v Speaker 3>probably impossible to ever show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have more and more evidence </v>

1452
01:01:00.301 --> 01:01:02.500
<v Speaker 3>because we know the mechanisms now </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind the cell growth.</v>

1453
01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:07.980
<v Speaker 3>So once we see the physiology and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanics behind it and the molecules </v>

1454
01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:08.470
<v Speaker 3>and the gene expression and then we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1455
01:01:08.471 --> 01:01:09.700
<v Speaker 3>it lines up with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>

1456
01:01:09.701 --> 01:01:10.180
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>d,</v>

1457
01:01:10.181 --> 01:01:15.181
<v Speaker 3>and e.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just can't show up with f because of </v>

1458
01:01:15.181 --> 01:01:17.820
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we need to really rethink our </v>

1459
01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.670
<v Speaker 3>position here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's probably the biggest one.</v>

1460
01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:25.330
<v Speaker 4>Now when you're dealing with athletes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially athletes that are trying </v>

1461
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:27.590
<v Speaker 4>to make weight like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a fighter.</v>

1462
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:33.040
<v Speaker 4>And do you ever tell them like say like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a Jake ellenberger was a pretty thick </v>

1463
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.680
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's done 170 pounds and you got,</v>

1464
01:01:34.681 --> 01:01:39.681
<v Speaker 4>I'm exercising and doing all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things and you do a body composition of </v>

1465
01:01:39.681 --> 01:01:43.721
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever tell them like you got to </v>

1466
01:01:43.721 --> 01:01:44.330
<v Speaker 4>lose some muscle like theirs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever say that?</v>

1467
01:01:44.331 --> 01:01:49.331
<v Speaker 4>Like your 200,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five pounds getting down to one </v>

1468
01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:49.331
<v Speaker 4>seventies really gonna fuck you up.</v>

1469
01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:50.730
<v Speaker 3>We've done that a little bit in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

1470
01:01:50.731 --> 01:01:51.570
<v Speaker 3>People have come and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1471
01:01:51.571 --> 01:01:56.571
<v Speaker 3>will you test me and tell me if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think I can go down to 55 or 85 or </v>

1472
01:01:56.571 --> 01:01:56.571
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1473
01:01:56.571 --> 01:02:00.030
<v Speaker 3>my general approach is you're better off</v>
<v Speaker 3>staying or going up.</v>

1474
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:03.750
<v Speaker 3>It's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost always better if they're going to</v>

1475
01:02:03.751 --> 01:02:05.050
<v Speaker 3>go stay at a class or go up awake.</v>

1476
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:10.180
<v Speaker 4>I could not agree more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you've seen the performances of </v>

1477
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:10.680
<v Speaker 4>fighters when they do go up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look so much.</v>

1478
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:12.590
<v Speaker 4>The Jorge Mazda doll is a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>

1479
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:13.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forty,</v>

1480
01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:16.400
<v Speaker 4>55 forever fought at one seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the best in the world now.</v>

1481
01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.720
<v Speaker 4>Donald cerrone and another example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's been a ton of fighters that move</v>

1482
01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:24.290
<v Speaker 4>up in look so much better because their </v>
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>

1483
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 4>like Calvin Gastrula,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's another great example.</v>

1484
01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:27.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

1485
01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:29.300
<v Speaker 3>he's a diet one though for the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

1486
01:02:29.301 --> 01:02:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets that dialed.</v>

1487
01:02:30.501 --> 01:02:32.480
<v Speaker 3>He should be able to make 70 no problem.</v>

1488
01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.030
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But God damn it looks good at 85,</v>

1489
01:02:35.031 --> 01:02:36.470
<v Speaker 4>he looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see tank,</v>

1490
01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:41.880
<v Speaker 4>he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you see a guy like him and you </v>

1491
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:41.880
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta out powered by.</v>

1492
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:41.880
<v Speaker 4>Golly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Weidman.</v>

1493
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.390
<v Speaker 4>What's the line in the sand you draw </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you say,</v>

1494
01:02:44.391 --> 01:02:49.391
<v Speaker 4>okay Calvin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's put on some muscle and some </v>

1495
01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.551
<v Speaker 4>strength so that you could deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>oil Ramiro's of the world or let's lean </v>

1496
01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:54.830
<v Speaker 4>you out and get you off the Tacos so you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>

1497
01:02:54.831 --> 01:02:59.831
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could fight guys that you're </v>

1498
01:02:59.831 --> 01:02:59.831
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be fighting.</v>

1499
01:02:59.831 --> 01:02:59.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it man.</v>

1500
01:02:59.831 --> 01:03:01.750
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internally questioned that if they,</v>

1501
01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:04.600
<v Speaker 3>if they really buy in to what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1502
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:06.760
<v Speaker 3>it's an easy conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of them won't,</v>

1503
01:03:06.761 --> 01:03:07.840
<v Speaker 3>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1504
01:03:07.841 --> 01:03:08.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1505
01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:13.701
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you have a good answer </v>

1506
01:03:13.701 --> 01:03:13.701
<v Speaker 3>there man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's tough.</v>

1507
01:03:13.701 --> 01:03:13.701
<v Speaker 3>He's a classic example though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's this almost,</v>

1508
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean it got to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know his camp,</v>

1509
01:03:16.061 --> 01:03:18.370
<v Speaker 3>like I've met him a handful of times but</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've never been in my lab.</v>

1510
01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know like how bad his stuff his </v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

1511
01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 3>or how like if he's got medical problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>that no one knows about or if he has any</v>

1512
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:27.160
<v Speaker 3>other issues that are going on and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it hard.</v>

1513
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:32.190
<v Speaker 3>So that happens from time to time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they don't want to just like ice </v>

1514
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:34.801
<v Speaker 3>cream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ice Cream is a lot of guys that are </v>

1515
01:03:34.801 --> 01:03:34.801
<v Speaker 3>super talented.</v>

1516
01:03:34.801 --> 01:03:35.650
<v Speaker 3>They just love to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1517
01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.430
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

1518
01:03:36.431 --> 01:03:41.431
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of those folks will go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>food for comfort for that and for the </v>

1519
01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:43.840
<v Speaker 3>control control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

1520
01:03:43.841 --> 01:03:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Especially in such a crazy world of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world of competition in combat sports,</v>

1521
01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 3>especially in this sport where like </v>
<v Speaker 3>winning and losing so finite and when </v>

1522
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:56.641
<v Speaker 3>you get to the top like nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well rarely people win more than they </v>

1523
01:03:56.641 --> 01:03:57.210
<v Speaker 3>lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1524
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so hard.</v>

1525
01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:00.750
<v Speaker 3>And there's so many with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1526
01:04:00.751 --> 01:04:03.130
<v Speaker 3>like in Nfl and major league baseball </v>
<v Speaker 3>and soccer,</v>

1527
01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a clear pecking order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You beat this person,</v>

1528
01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.610
<v Speaker 3>then you'd beat this team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you'd beat this team,</v>

1529
01:04:06.611 --> 01:04:08.980
<v Speaker 3>then you get to play for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>championship or an mma.</v>

1530
01:04:08.981 --> 01:04:11.740
<v Speaker 3>It's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's definitely not anymore.</v>

1531
01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the UFC it's real weird.</v>

1532
01:04:13.961 --> 01:04:17.200
<v Speaker 3>Like especially the 185 pound division,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like good fucking luck.</v>

1533
01:04:17.410 --> 01:04:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's waiting in line to fight </v>

1534
01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:24.781
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bisping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's probably going to fight George St </v>

1535
01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:24.970
<v Speaker 3>Pierre and everybody be like Luke </v>
<v Speaker 3>rockhold.</v>

1536
01:04:24.971 --> 01:04:27.130
<v Speaker 3>So those other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what the fuck?</v>

1537
01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:32.340
<v Speaker 3>When he beat rockhold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my single favorite mma moment in </v>

1538
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:32.340
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1539
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like a noxious bisbing fan or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1540
01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 3>But that was the culmination of a dude </v>
<v Speaker 3>who put in so much time and he did </v>

1541
01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:43.080
<v Speaker 3>everything to make it a business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did everything and then he not only </v>

1542
01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.320
<v Speaker 3>steps in and fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just killer and rockhold who I thought</v>

1543
01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:49.300
<v Speaker 3>was been underrated his whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's this insanely good,</v>

1544
01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.510
<v Speaker 3>but he'd already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd already lost them convincingly,</v>

1545
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad subs in the first round.</v>

1546
01:04:55.430 --> 01:05:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And older guys don't come back and beat </v>

1547
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:00.430
<v Speaker 3>younger guys in the rematch is ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1548
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:04.860
<v Speaker 3>Especially on short notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Short notice when he had a whole camp </v>

1549
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.940
<v Speaker 3>and has every reason to not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence in like 90 percent or more.</v>

1550
01:05:06.941 --> 01:05:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Fighters would have just been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1551
01:05:08.001 --> 01:05:08.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like no way.</v>

1552
01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:14.280
<v Speaker 3>He takes the flight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no one would take that flight </v>

1553
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:14.280
<v Speaker 3>because if you lose twice to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion,</v>

1554
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.640
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not gonna get third.</v>

1555
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Just every risk possible.</v>

1556
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:21.010
<v Speaker 2>And he just nails like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unbelieve clips him and knocks him out.</v>

1557
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

1558
01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Like I loved rock whole book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just incredible.</v>

1559
01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:28.590
<v Speaker 2>It really was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could really tell that rockhold </v>

1560
01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:29.440
<v Speaker 2>just thought he was going to win the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight no matter what.</v>

1561
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.530
<v Speaker 2>It is a done deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally underestimated.</v>

1562
01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Bisping's so scrappy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's one of the most mentally tough</v>

1563
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:41.251
<v Speaker 2>guys in the sport because he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have like some freak issue while we're </v>

1564
01:05:41.251 --> 01:05:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Merrill athleticism or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>

1565
01:05:42.611 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 2>it's just hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not particularly fast.</v>

1566
01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>

1567
01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:50.850
<v Speaker 2>He's not super mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very skilled and he's got a lot of </v>

1568
01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:52.860
<v Speaker 2>physical issues to see out of one I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1569
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Is that a bunch of issues with joints </v>
<v Speaker 2>and disks and he doesn't move willing </v>

1570
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.870
<v Speaker 2>injuries?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1571
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:59.290
<v Speaker 2>And he's not baked for the division or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1572
01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have people at while.</v>

1573
01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:01.980
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty big for when any five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1574
01:06:01.981 --> 01:06:06.981
<v Speaker 2>not like amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not like towering over white men </v>

1575
01:06:06.981 --> 01:06:06.981
<v Speaker 2>are rockhold like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1576
01:06:06.981 --> 01:06:07.010
<v Speaker 2>he's not those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1577
01:06:07.011 --> 01:06:09.220
<v Speaker 2>those guys are giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have some amazing skill set.</v>

1578
01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:14.221
<v Speaker 2>Either way he can fall back on a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>championship in wrestling to get </v>

1579
01:06:14.221 --> 01:06:16.890
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he just is like pretty good at </v>

1580
01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:16.890
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1581
01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still just finds a tough kid.</v>

1582
01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:21.180
<v Speaker 2>He's a guy I would love to biopsy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out like how much slow twitch </v>

1583
01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:22.630
<v Speaker 2>and fast twitch does he have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty four beats per minute.</v>

1584
01:06:22.631 --> 01:06:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Resting heart rate is fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.670
<v Speaker 2>He's a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big factor and that he could push</v>

1586
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:29.530
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous pace and then keep it </v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

1587
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Like one of my favorite fights of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael's was when he beat Conley.</v>

1588
01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's just overwhelmed them and </v>

1589
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.260
<v Speaker 2>just starting to get tired and bisping </v>
<v Speaker 2>just poured it on.</v>

1590
01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just gave him a beating and that was </v>

1591
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:46.330
<v Speaker 2>sort of a in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1592
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:50.721
<v Speaker 2>a shift towards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was always a world class </v>

1593
01:06:50.721 --> 01:06:53.821
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a shift towards the upper end </v>

1594
01:06:53.821 --> 01:06:53.821
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the division.</v>

1595
01:06:53.821 --> 01:06:55.510
<v Speaker 2>It was a big moment for his career too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if he lost that,</v>

1596
01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.610
<v Speaker 2>that's probably about nine tonight for </v>
<v Speaker 2>him in terms of.</v>

1597
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that,</v>

1598
01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:01.680
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got knocked out by Vittorio,</v>

1599
01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:06.720
<v Speaker 2>comes right back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know he got knocked out by </v>

1600
01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comes right back.</v>

1601
01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.750
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been around him a bit.</v>

1602
01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:11.080
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's one of the guys were like,</v>

1603
01:07:11.081 --> 01:07:16.081
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just not going to shake him like </v>

1604
01:07:16.081 --> 01:07:16.081
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1605
01:07:16.081 --> 01:07:16.750
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's undeniably tough.</v>

1606
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's undeniably like,</v>

1607
01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.270
<v Speaker 2>when he says like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all fight,</v>

1608
01:07:19.271 --> 01:07:20.980
<v Speaker 2>that dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he legit.</v>

1609
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's there.</v>

1610
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And you can say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1611
01:07:23.381 --> 01:07:24.340
<v Speaker 2>he's scared of Romero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1612
01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:27.190
<v Speaker 2>he's not scared of any of these students</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to cash in.</v>

1613
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:28.660
<v Speaker 2>When he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1614
01:07:28.661 --> 01:07:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I think the bisping GSP fight is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating fight.</v>

1615
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:33.550
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1616
01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>GSPS never fought at 85.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes back,</v>

1617
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:38.860
<v Speaker 2>he fights for a world title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it compelling.</v>

1618
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder if this is unfortunate,</v>

1619
01:07:41.621 --> 01:07:46.420
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder how many of these young new</v>
<v Speaker 2>fans I would like to say like post Ronda</v>

1620
01:07:46.421 --> 01:07:51.421
<v Speaker 2>Rousey fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of them even know who fucked </v>

1621
01:07:51.421 --> 01:07:51.820
<v Speaker 2>GSP is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot in my life.</v>

1622
01:07:51.821 --> 01:07:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Definitely does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well she's a fan,</v>

1623
01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.010
<v Speaker 2>but I mean I'm wonder if how many of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>new ones,</v>

1624
01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:02.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people coming up actually know who </v>

1625
01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>he is and it means it's been a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1626
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:04.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years,</v>

1627
01:08:04.421 --> 01:08:04.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1628
01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:06.030
<v Speaker 2>More than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:11.070
<v Speaker 2>When did he lose to Johnny Hendricks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's three years ago at </v>

1630
01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:11.070
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least.</v>

1631
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Pete Johny Hendricks.</v>

1632
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1633
01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big believer in that decision.</v>

1634
01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:24.410
<v Speaker 2>I feel like at most that was a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like Hendrix got the most of it.</v>

1635
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:27.080
<v Speaker 2>My buddy troy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's brother had 50 k on Hendrix on that</v>

1636
01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 2>fight during and afterwards he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

1637
01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 2>We're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>

1638
01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Hendrix thing was interesting because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hendrix is one of those guys that you </v>

1639
01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:39.720
<v Speaker 2>kind of like what happened to that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1640
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

1641
01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:45.440
<v Speaker 2>A lot of speculation on that where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can all read between the lines there.</v>

1642
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1643
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.330
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1644
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the Usada speculation.</v>

1645
01:08:49.711 --> 01:08:51.410
<v Speaker 2>There's the motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speculation.</v>

1646
01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:56.411
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also have that thing to what guys </v>

1647
01:08:56.411 --> 01:08:56.420
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that put in that many years of wrestling</v>

1648
01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.800
<v Speaker 2>and you start competing that hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that young like that.</v>

1649
01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.310
<v Speaker 2>That wears on you a timeframe that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>run out of.</v>

1650
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a like people believe there's a </v>

1651
01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:09.670
<v Speaker 2>nine year window as a world class </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

1652
01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the sport,</v>

1653
01:09:11.421 --> 01:09:16.421
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably fair as a fighter and </v>

1654
01:09:16.421 --> 01:09:16.790
<v Speaker 2>that as a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like can you get to mma in particular?</v>

1655
01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Guys have nine years to compete at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>world class level and then the wheels </v>

1656
01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:21.850
<v Speaker 2>just fall off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1657
01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Get in and get your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get Out.</v>

1658
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>

1659
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:24.870
<v Speaker 2>if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.720
<v Speaker 2>That's why 38,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1661
01:09:26.721 --> 01:09:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Bespeaks 38.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That GSP fights,</v>

1662
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:29.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Move.</v>

1663
01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for $100 move.</v>

1664
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does a business typically do?</v>

1665
01:09:33.921 --> 01:09:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Well with like the fighters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He handles wrestlers decently well.</v>

1666
01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:40.520
<v Speaker 2>He's a very good defensive wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His styles can be fantastic.</v>

1667
01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:43.990
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what GSB relied on a lot is,</v>

1668
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.200
<v Speaker 2>is his stamina.</v>

1669
01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Conditioning was great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that stamina is dependent upon </v>

1670
01:09:50.230 --> 01:09:54.371
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do even if you're just physically </v>

1671
01:09:54.371 --> 01:09:54.371
<v Speaker 2>fit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you haven't fought in a long time.</v>

1672
01:09:54.371 --> 01:09:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily know if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>applicable.</v>

1673
01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also going to be different too</v>

1674
01:09:58.281 --> 01:09:59.870
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see what he does weight wise.</v>

1675
01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what people don't understand about </v>

1676
01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:07.601
<v Speaker 2>when you watch professional athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters in particular as a lot of what </v>

1677
01:10:07.601 --> 01:10:10.991
<v Speaker 2>happens in that fatigue is either </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological or it's bad weight cut </v>

1678
01:10:10.991 --> 01:10:11.180
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now he doesn't have that,</v>

1679
01:10:11.181 --> 01:10:16.181
<v Speaker 2>but if he's lugging around extra weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's not used to potentially </v>

1680
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.400
<v Speaker 2>problematic depending on how he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's got some smart people in this </v>

1681
01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:21.400
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's probably going to be fine,</v>

1682
01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.300
<v Speaker 2>but that's a real problem that he may or</v>
<v Speaker 2>may not be ready for.</v>

1683
01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's lugging around extra weight,</v>

1684
01:10:25.941 --> 01:10:28.910
<v Speaker 2>but he was always walking around </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around one 85 slash 90.</v>

1685
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:31.070
<v Speaker 2>He might just decide to compete at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

1686
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.450
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if he stays there,</v>

1687
01:10:32.451 --> 01:10:37.451
<v Speaker 2>he's probably fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if someone gets in his head and </v>

1688
01:10:37.451 --> 01:10:37.451
<v Speaker 2>tries to get them up to two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1689
01:10:37.451 --> 01:10:37.451
<v Speaker 2>two or something and then come back </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1690
01:10:37.451 --> 01:10:38.480
<v Speaker 2>like he's probably not going to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal there,</v>

1691
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.270
<v Speaker 2>which he's not gonna run out of gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that.</v>

1692
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Like having more muscle doesn't make you</v>
<v Speaker 2>fatigued more.</v>

1693
01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:48.730
<v Speaker 2>It's the training that does it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have fighters use cardio </v>

1694
01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:49.910
<v Speaker 2>machines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do you have,</v>

1695
01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:54.940
<v Speaker 2>do you have them use versa climbers or </v>
<v Speaker 2>treadmills or anything along those </v>

1696
01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:59.651
<v Speaker 2>lines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like those are super </v>

1697
01:10:59.651 --> 01:10:59.651
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1698
01:10:59.651 --> 01:11:03.130
<v Speaker 2>differences in terms of we're generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get most of their physical </v>

1699
01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:07.271
<v Speaker 2>activity from training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have an extra hour with the </v>

1700
01:11:07.271 --> 01:11:07.271
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could get in the week.</v>

1701
01:11:07.271 --> 01:11:08.840
<v Speaker 2>You mean by martial arts training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1702
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1704
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:15.610
<v Speaker 2>but having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we want to do a small circuit or </v>

1705
01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:15.610
<v Speaker 2>something</v>

1706
01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:15.720
<v Speaker 3>that incorporates one of those things in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1707
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm never going to prescribe.</v>

1708
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:19.560
<v Speaker 3>If they're not doing it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1709
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.510
<v Speaker 3>let's hop on and let's get an hour on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the elliptical.</v>

1710
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Like that's never going to come out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my mouth.</v>

1711
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:27.540
<v Speaker 3>That's not to say I would never use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not throwing anything out.</v>

1712
01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:30.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm not pro or con,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's chip judicially not where I'm</v>

1713
01:11:30.511 --> 01:11:33.450
<v Speaker 3>going to go because it's far easier for </v>
<v Speaker 3>us to help them lose weight through food</v>

1714
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:37.620
<v Speaker 3>than it is adding on an extra hour and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that adding on an extra hour of activity</v>

1715
01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:39.750
<v Speaker 3>can be real harmful for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muscularly,</v>

1716
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:42.420
<v Speaker 3>but we're not necessarily just talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about losing weight.</v>

1717
01:11:42.421 --> 01:11:44.670
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about increasing </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasing performance.</v>

1718
01:11:44.671 --> 01:11:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe in any of those machines?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a believer or unbeliever in.</v>

1719
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would go to it if I needed it.</v>

1720
01:11:49.771 --> 01:11:54.771
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like in camp it's a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>need with the exception of maybe like a </v>

1721
01:11:54.771 --> 01:11:55.380
<v Speaker 3>recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you want to do like,</v>

1722
01:11:55.381 --> 01:11:57.390
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go and easy 45 or something on the</v>

1723
01:11:57.391 --> 01:11:57.870
<v Speaker 3>bike.</v>

1724
01:11:58.390 --> 01:12:00.900
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as like a 45 hard,</v>

1725
01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:06.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the exception of when you start </v>

1726
01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.271
<v Speaker 3>moving to championship fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think there's good cause for doing </v>

1727
01:12:08.271 --> 01:12:12.020
<v Speaker 3>maybe once a week of saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do this with Dirk and all the time </v>

1728
01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:12.020
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1729
01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.861
<v Speaker 3>he loves to ride mountain bikes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So go out in the mountain bike and go </v>

1730
01:12:15.861 --> 01:12:15.861
<v Speaker 3>ride for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're saying dirt,</v>

1731
01:12:15.861 --> 01:12:15.861
<v Speaker 3>I mean pat comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1732
01:12:15.861 --> 01:12:17.070
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay for people.</v>

1733
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Not mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1734
01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:20.760
<v Speaker 3>but that's because of it is because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>loves that.</v>

1735
01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:24.210
<v Speaker 3>That's his real mental release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mountain budgeting.</v>

1736
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great workout tour.</v>

1737
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fantastic.</v>

1738
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:28.050
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets in the sun,</v>

1739
01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.080
<v Speaker 3>he gets away from people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets to breathe and we're not </v>

1740
01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.140
<v Speaker 3>counting things which can be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I had another athlete,</v>

1741
01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:35.670
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely hate jogging.</v>

1742
01:12:35.671 --> 01:12:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Like it's the worst thing I got knee </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>

1743
01:12:38.071 --> 01:12:38.700
<v Speaker 3>hurts my back.</v>

1744
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1745
01:12:40.201 --> 01:12:42.080
<v Speaker 3>go jog and hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you did,</v>

1746
01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:47.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if someone has knee problems and </v>

1747
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:47.100
<v Speaker 3>you want to get them to do cardio 45 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>

1748
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:48.690
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe in the pool.</v>

1749
01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:52.530
<v Speaker 3>A lot of pool work can be really helpful</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they have access.</v>

1750
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.740
<v Speaker 3>If they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1751
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:57.360
<v Speaker 3>no one has ever not love the Airdyne or </v>
<v Speaker 3>our assault bikes.</v>

1752
01:12:58.230 --> 01:12:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Those are fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Versa.</v>

1753
01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:02.010
<v Speaker 3>Climates are great and I got no problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with those things.</v>

1754
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:06.210
<v Speaker 3>What is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a one machine that is like your</v>

1755
01:13:06.211 --> 01:13:09.030
<v Speaker 3>standby or go to when it comes to cardio</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine?</v>

1756
01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those would probably.</v>

1757
01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Those are the rower diverse climber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rower and the Airdyne.</v>

1758
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aerosault,</v>

1759
01:13:14.731 --> 01:13:17.340
<v Speaker 3>any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that allowed them to move,</v>

1760
01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:21.180
<v Speaker 3>that minimizes the amount of technical </v>
<v Speaker 3>teaching you have to do.</v>

1761
01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:24.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people run horribly.</v>

1762
01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like a real,</v>

1763
01:13:27.211 --> 01:13:27.930
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real problem.</v>

1764
01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:30.060
<v Speaker 3>Especially wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever watch the rest of the run,</v>

1765
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:31.200
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a,</v>

1766
01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.530
<v Speaker 3>you're a knee pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're busted ankle waiting to happen,</v>

1767
01:13:34.890 --> 01:13:39.890
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not going to throw that on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they try to teach them a new </v>

1768
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.890
<v Speaker 3>movement skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not needed.</v>

1769
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:41.160
<v Speaker 3>There's a thousand ways we can get there</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they already run,</v>

1770
01:13:41.161 --> 01:13:44.350
<v Speaker 3>well never running background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we could go there if they want,</v>

1771
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:46.320
<v Speaker 3>if they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them do like it.</v>

1772
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

1773
01:13:47.341 --> 01:13:49.080
<v Speaker 3>We can get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they don't run well,</v>

1774
01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:50.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean technically well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1775
01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:54.870
<v Speaker 3>if they're landing in bad positions that</v>
<v Speaker 3>their fear out everywhere and they don't</v>

1776
01:13:54.871 --> 01:13:58.620
<v Speaker 3>want to take time to go to a running </v>
<v Speaker 3>coach like Brian Mackenzie or something,</v>

1777
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:01.770
<v Speaker 3>then we're not going to add that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to add a new skill.</v>

1778
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:03.040
<v Speaker 3>They know a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1779
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.940
<v Speaker 3>Greg Jackson's work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of his camp,</v>

1780
01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:09.840
<v Speaker 3>they do these uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hill runs in Albuquerque.</v>

1781
01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:10.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1782
01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.760
<v Speaker 3>That stuff going up a hill is a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>different though.</v>

1783
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because generally the foot position of </v>

1784
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:21.691
<v Speaker 3>the hill as much easier to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's harder to run bat uphill than </v>

1785
01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:23.650
<v Speaker 3>it is on flat ground generally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is something you'd go to.</v>

1786
01:14:23.651 --> 01:14:28.651
<v Speaker 3>But that's also probably something where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have as much teaching and </v>

1787
01:14:28.651 --> 01:14:31.420
<v Speaker 3>you're an altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that by itself is going to reduce how</v>

1788
01:14:31.421 --> 01:14:36.421
<v Speaker 3>hard you work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is going to reduce the stress on </v>

1789
01:14:36.421 --> 01:14:36.421
<v Speaker 3>your joints and bones and ligaments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that helps.</v>

1790
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:41.520
<v Speaker 3>So all that can be integrated where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have you reduced the likelihood of them </v>

1791
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.540
<v Speaker 3>getting a sore back or knees because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>added some 45 minute running on there.</v>

1792
01:14:44.541 --> 01:14:46.390
<v Speaker 3>That didn't really have to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1793
01:14:46.391 --> 01:14:50.020
<v Speaker 3>he'll seem to reduce that anyway because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really almost like doing squats.</v>

1794
01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:55.410
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like doing or a lunch or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that because you just </v>

1795
01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:56.770
<v Speaker 3>kind of running and pushing your body up</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of like the pounding,</v>

1796
01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.310
<v Speaker 3>the East centric pounding is gone.</v>

1797
01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a very good.</v>

1798
01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:06.180
<v Speaker 3>One of the most important things we </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress during fight camp is you want to </v>

1799
01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:09.301
<v Speaker 3>minimize the Essentra contractions </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that leads to more soreness and </v>

1800
01:15:09.301 --> 01:15:14.041
<v Speaker 3>if you got really sore legs and you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to go to movie tie practice and </v>

1801
01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:14.650
<v Speaker 3>somebody in the leg like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem.</v>

1802
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:17.830
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to be able to get work </v>
<v Speaker 3>in without getting extremely sore.</v>

1803
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:20.920
<v Speaker 3>So hills are great example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aerodyne is like the same thing,</v>

1804
01:15:20.921 --> 01:15:22.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pushing the whole time.</v>

1805
01:15:22.271 --> 01:15:25.150
<v Speaker 3>It's not landing and impacts running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rowing,</v>

1806
01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:27.470
<v Speaker 3>all these versaclimber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why they're so good at.</v>

1807
01:15:27.471 --> 01:15:29.500
<v Speaker 3>Or one of the reasons you can do a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of work</v>

1808
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:34.630
<v Speaker 4>is air dine or reverse Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those things limited in the fact that </v>

1809
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:38.771
<v Speaker 4>like the movement is very specific and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that law is in terms of doing that </v>

1810
01:15:39.261 --> 01:15:42.380
<v Speaker 4>versus like maybe like a Kettlebell </v>
<v Speaker 4>cardio workout.</v>

1811
01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.250
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should do.</v>

1812
01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.650
<v Speaker 3>That's why you need to do a combination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1813
01:15:45.651 --> 01:15:48.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's a bunch of different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like we talked with nutrition,</v>

1814
01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:51.260
<v Speaker 3>it's variability that gets this is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're looking for,</v>

1815
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:55.310
<v Speaker 3>especially when the goal is not that </v>
<v Speaker 3>modality.</v>

1816
01:15:56.210 --> 01:16:01.210
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're competing in a kettle bell </v>

1817
01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:01.210
<v Speaker 3>swinging competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you should be focusing on that,</v>

1818
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:04.010
<v Speaker 3>but when you're using that for another </v>
<v Speaker 3>modality that doesn't transfer over,</v>

1819
01:16:04.011 --> 01:16:07.010
<v Speaker 3>then you need to have a wide range of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stresses.</v>

1820
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:09.830
<v Speaker 3>How do you know like what to tell them </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do though?</v>

1821
01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.270
<v Speaker 3>So that's the thing is I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1822
01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:14.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that stress is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who cares?</v>

1823
01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.600
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the stress of worrying about which </v>

1824
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.200
<v Speaker 3>one to do is not important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't focus on being like,</v>

1825
01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:26.201
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should we pick versaclimber today or </v>

1826
01:16:26.201 --> 01:16:26.201
<v Speaker 3>should we add,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be,</v>

1827
01:16:26.201 --> 01:16:26.990
<v Speaker 3>what's the training outcome we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for?</v>

1828
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1829
01:16:28.071 --> 01:16:30.590
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to improve your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeat maximal,</v>

1830
01:16:30.591 --> 01:16:35.030
<v Speaker 3>sustained 15 second intervals with short</v>
<v Speaker 3>rest and all at the same time,</v>

1831
01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.240
<v Speaker 3>keeping your breathing mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1832
01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 3>that's the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what modality do we want to use </v>

1833
01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 3>today to introduce that insult?</v>

1834
01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:48.140
<v Speaker 4>And so you think the good move would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>to introduce a bunch of different things</v>

1835
01:16:48.141 --> 01:16:50.090
<v Speaker 4>like wild day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1836
01:16:50.091 --> 01:16:52.430
<v Speaker 4>One day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do the Kettlebell cardio workout another</v>

1837
01:16:52.431 --> 01:16:57.431
<v Speaker 4>day do the aerosol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that air assault bike puts across </v>

1838
01:16:57.431 --> 01:16:57.830
<v Speaker 4>salt air assault,</v>
<v Speaker 4>punch another day.</v>

1839
01:16:57.831 --> 01:16:59.140
<v Speaker 4>Do a verse climate climber</v>

1840
01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:01.180
<v Speaker 3>as a general quick statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1841
01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:06.690
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say that the smarter </v>

1842
01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:06.690
<v Speaker 3>approach would be to step back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1843
01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:07.690
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the goal of that workout?</v>

1844
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:11.210
<v Speaker 3>What's the goal of this week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this camp,</v>

1845
01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.210
<v Speaker 3>this fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where you then that guides you to</v>

1846
01:17:14.211 --> 01:17:16.850
<v Speaker 3>make that exercise choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So don't like.</v>

1847
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:19.130
<v Speaker 3>You should never choose the exercises </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you love the exercise.</v>

1848
01:17:19.131 --> 01:17:21.200
<v Speaker 3>That's a stupid reason you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>angry.</v>

1849
01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really irritates me.</v>

1850
01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.260
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you measure a resting heart rates,</v>

1851
01:17:26.261 --> 01:17:27.790
<v Speaker 4>body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that jazz?</v>

1852
01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:29.030
<v Speaker 3>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1853
01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.970
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some folks do it.</v>

1854
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not super important for me that you</v>

1855
01:17:33.401 --> 01:17:38.401
<v Speaker 3>don't feel like it's important in terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of finding out whether or not a </v>

1856
01:17:38.401 --> 01:17:39.070
<v Speaker 3>fighter's overtrained oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a little bit different question.</v>

1857
01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:42.880
<v Speaker 3>So you can use things like hrv to track </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

1858
01:17:42.881 --> 01:17:44.680
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A heart rate variability.</v>

1859
01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.560
<v Speaker 3>So it'll effectively think of it like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart rate monitor,</v>

1860
01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:51.880
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to look at how so your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your heart doesn't disco beat,</v>

1861
01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:53.710
<v Speaker 3>beat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beat,</v>

1862
01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:54.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has variability.</v>

1863
01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:56.560
<v Speaker 5>Beebee Beebee,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beebee,</v>

1864
01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.190
<v Speaker 5>beebee.</v>

1865
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually is,</v>

1866
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.580
<v Speaker 3>has some relationship with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomic nervous system.</v>

1867
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:06.080
<v Speaker 3>So if it's really variable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a good spot.</v>

1868
01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:07.640
<v Speaker 3>If you lose your variability and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes</v>

1869
01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:09.140
<v Speaker 5>beat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>beat,</v>

1870
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:10.280
<v Speaker 5>beat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>beat,</v>

1871
01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:12.910
<v Speaker 3>you're actually potentially being </v>
<v Speaker 3>overtrained.</v>

1872
01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.270
<v Speaker 3>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your nervous system is a little bit shot</v>

1873
01:18:16.271 --> 01:18:17.830
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can use those in Joel.</v>

1874
01:18:17.831 --> 01:18:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Jamison again has done a ton of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1875
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can look at that to,</v>

1876
01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:25.180
<v Speaker 3>to have an idea of whether or not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>overtrained so you can use that.</v>

1877
01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't particularly use those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of reasons.</v>

1878
01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:33.930
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what's going to happen for the </v>

1879
01:18:33.930 --> 01:18:35.080
<v Speaker 3>most part over the six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as camps going on,</v>

1880
01:18:35.081 --> 01:18:37.210
<v Speaker 3>like it's based on performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coach,</v>

1881
01:18:37.211 --> 01:18:42.211
<v Speaker 3>the athlete when I've been around them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we planned it out so that this is </v>

1882
01:18:42.211 --> 01:18:42.610
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the volume this week,</v>

1883
01:18:42.611 --> 01:18:44.740
<v Speaker 3>this is the volume this week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the volume this week,</v>

1884
01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.780
<v Speaker 3>so that we don't get ourselves in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>

1885
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.340
<v Speaker 4>And how do you know how to plan the </v>
<v Speaker 4>volume out?</v>

1886
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:51.090
<v Speaker 4>Like say if you got a gun like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1887
01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:54.320
<v Speaker 4>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Weidman comes to you and he wants,</v>

1888
01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to train with you.</v>

1889
01:18:56.290 --> 01:19:01.290
<v Speaker 4>He's getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>preparing for a five round championship </v>

1890
01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:03.971
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you know how much work to give </v>

1891
01:19:03.971 --> 01:19:03.971
<v Speaker 4>him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you,</v>

1892
01:19:03.971 --> 01:19:03.971
<v Speaker 4>how do you schedule?</v>

1893
01:19:03.971 --> 01:19:05.860
<v Speaker 3>So I would never have the arrogance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>step in and go,</v>

1894
01:19:05.861 --> 01:19:07.030
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the volume you're at.</v>

1895
01:19:07.031 --> 01:19:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never met you.</v>

1896
01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Great to meet you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's your volume.</v>

1897
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:14.620
<v Speaker 3>Like that'd be stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you have him come and do a test </v>

1898
01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:17.341
<v Speaker 3>workout for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wouldn't have a conversation with </v>

1899
01:19:17.341 --> 01:19:19.831
<v Speaker 3>as many as coaches and honestly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time I worked with them for </v>

1900
01:19:19.831 --> 01:19:20.530
<v Speaker 3>something like volume,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I generally would just shut up and watch</v>

1901
01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:21.910
<v Speaker 3>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1902
01:19:21.911 --> 01:19:26.911
<v Speaker 3>like here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what you're going to tell me you </v>

1903
01:19:26.911 --> 01:19:28.681
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So write on a piece of paper what you </v>

1904
01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:28.681
<v Speaker 3>did for the camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your plan for the camp?</v>

1905
01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:31.861
<v Speaker 3>What have you done in the past?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I look and we can assess some </v>

1906
01:19:31.861 --> 01:19:32.530
<v Speaker 3>volume and then I can generally tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1907
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:37.950
<v Speaker 3>this is normal for a person of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>caliber of your aid and your experience </v>

1908
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:41.401
<v Speaker 3>or like you're way over what's normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how that lands on you </v>

1909
01:19:41.401 --> 01:19:44.680
<v Speaker 3>and then I watch and as we go along and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's conversations continuing going,</v>

1910
01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.410
<v Speaker 3>this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your other coach told me this,</v>

1911
01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:50.650
<v Speaker 3>you're telling me this is going on blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>working back here,</v>

1912
01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:56.650
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if we're in the right spot </v>

1913
01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:56.650
<v Speaker 3>here and then the second or third camp </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

1914
01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:57.400
<v Speaker 3>Then I can have a feel and I can go back</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the previous notes and go,</v>

1915
01:19:57.401 --> 01:20:02.401
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is 10 percent higher this year for </v>

1916
01:20:02.401 --> 01:20:04.740
<v Speaker 3>three more times here I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll always almost always </v>

1917
01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:04.740
<v Speaker 3>matches up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1918
01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

1919
01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What arE your thoughts</v>

1920
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.590
<v Speaker 2>on like plyometrics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Box jumps,</v>

1921
01:20:10.591 --> 01:20:12.010
<v Speaker 2>things on those lines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1922
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:15.870
<v Speaker 2>box jumps are generally misused so </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't understand,</v>

1923
01:20:15.871 --> 01:20:19.590
<v Speaker 2>especially in and crossfit or an mma or </v>
<v Speaker 2>in wrestling.</v>

1924
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:22.290
<v Speaker 2>People use crossfit for conditioning for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most part,</v>

1925
01:20:22.291 --> 01:20:27.291
<v Speaker 2>which is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't get the biggest benefit </v>

1926
01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:27.291
<v Speaker 2>out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is strength,</v>

1927
01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:27.930
<v Speaker 2>speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powertrain,</v>

1928
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:30.690
<v Speaker 2>the reactive part of the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>training muscle spindles,</v>

1929
01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.380
<v Speaker 2>so absolutely fine as a modality that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't get that out,</v>

1930
01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.090
<v Speaker 2>like how do they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1931
01:20:36.091 --> 01:20:37.320
<v Speaker 2>someone does a box jump in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1932
01:20:37.321 --> 01:20:38.160
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>box jumps,</v>

1933
01:20:38.161 --> 01:20:43.161
<v Speaker 2>I Want to get better power my legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they'll go and do like a bar for five</v>

1934
01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:46.500
<v Speaker 2>rounds and then I'll go do 100 box jumps</v>
<v Speaker 2>as fast as I can.</v>

1935
01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:50.220
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting any faster like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just getting more tired.</v>

1936
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:55.290
<v Speaker 2>That will not improve your power at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't know because you're not jumping</v>

1937
01:20:55.291 --> 01:21:00.291
<v Speaker 2>halfassed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually jumping at a very sub </v>

1938
01:21:00.291 --> 01:21:00.870
<v Speaker 2>max speed the whole time because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>already fatigued.</v>

1939
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

1940
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:04.980
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to use those for power </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1941
01:21:04.981 --> 01:21:07.500
<v Speaker 2>if you're using it for conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1942
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:13.460
<v Speaker 2>no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're using it for the sake of </v>

1943
01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:13.460
<v Speaker 2>improving your foot speed or your power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your strength,</v>

1944
01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:14.610
<v Speaker 2>or your explosiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be west rep.</v>

1945
01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Well rested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1946
01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.760
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One to three reps take a break,</v>

1947
01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:22.970
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of like that strong </v>

1948
01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:25.281
<v Speaker 2>first protocol?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the pavel tatsu lean idea </v>

1949
01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:28.140
<v Speaker 2>that you know he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He feels that strength is.</v>

1950
01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:30.210
<v Speaker 2>It's along the same sort of lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're talking about.</v>

1951
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.430
<v Speaker 2>The strength is essentially a skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1952
01:21:32.431 --> 01:21:37.431
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should not be doing things to </v>

1953
01:21:37.431 --> 01:21:40.371
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the best way to do it in his </v>

1954
01:21:40.371 --> 01:21:40.920
<v Speaker 2>estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to do more sets with more,</v>

1955
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:46.130
<v Speaker 2>more break in between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is very strength one-on-one.</v>

1956
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd have a hard time for a true </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength person disagreeing with a lot </v>

1957
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.590
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

1958
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.550
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get stronger when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>tired,</v>

1959
01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:59.150
<v Speaker 2>so going to failure is not as now I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to a bunch of people about this </v>

1960
01:21:59.521 --> 01:22:04.521
<v Speaker 2>that have started doing this recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like within the last year or two and </v>

1961
01:22:04.521 --> 01:22:07.530
<v Speaker 2>they've all experienced great results </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the idea being that you used to</v>

1962
01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:12.531
<v Speaker 2>go to failure and then he'd be wrecked </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like three or four days instead of </v>

1963
01:22:12.531 --> 01:22:16.821
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say if you could do 10 reps or </v>

1964
01:22:16.821 --> 01:22:16.821
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do five and then you take a big rest</v>

1965
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:19.950
<v Speaker 2>and then you do five again and he took a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big risk and then you wind up.</v>

1966
01:22:19.951 --> 01:22:24.951
<v Speaker 2>Instead of doing 15 reps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wind up doing like 30 over the </v>

1967
01:22:24.951 --> 01:22:27.360
<v Speaker 2>course of an hour and a half and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fine the next day.</v>

1968
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you had lujan simmons,</v>

1969
01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:30.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1970
01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.750
<v Speaker 2>This is classic fucking maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy.</v>

1971
01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.000
<v Speaker 2>He was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

1972
01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I always tell my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my students to google him Because you're</v>

1973
01:22:38.851 --> 01:22:40.350
<v Speaker 2>not going to get like an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could get bored.</v>

1974
01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to my podcast with him.</v>

1975
01:22:41.971 --> 01:22:44.160
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most entertaining things</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever heard in my life.</v>

1976
01:22:44.161 --> 01:22:46.180
<v Speaker 2>He's such a character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The basic idea.</v>

1977
01:22:46.181 --> 01:22:51.181
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we'll have to back up for a quick </v>

1978
01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:51.181
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the goal,</v>

1979
01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:51.181
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strength.</v>

1980
01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:54.840
<v Speaker 2>If gold pure strength is the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>failure also has to be defined.</v>

1981
01:22:54.841 --> 01:22:56.610
<v Speaker 2>So what do you mean by failure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

1982
01:22:56.611 --> 01:22:58.360
<v Speaker 2>My family because of fatigue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1983
01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Then he's totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1984
01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Am I failing though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the two heavy.</v>

1985
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Well you do want to go to that failure </v>
<v Speaker 2>for strength.</v>

1986
01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I also though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so need to at some</v>

1987
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.330
<v Speaker 3>point pick up something that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick up or really close to camp.</v>

1988
01:23:09.331 --> 01:23:11.560
<v Speaker 3>Pick up to get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really close to it.</v>

1989
01:23:11.561 --> 01:23:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Like you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1990
01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.750
<v Speaker 3>But you can't do a second one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put it down.</v>

1991
01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe you could do two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can do three or something like </v>

1992
01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:21.780
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1993
01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.470
<v Speaker 3>the very textbook answer is anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>below five repetitions ish is going to </v>

1994
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:28.060
<v Speaker 3>be good for strength to the maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything more than five is bodybuilding.</v>

1995
01:23:28.061 --> 01:23:29.550
<v Speaker 3>That's what paul says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1996
01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:31.420
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty dead on.</v>

1997
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's not too wrong there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're like,</v>

1998
01:23:33.221 --> 01:23:34.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a reason I brought louie up his,</v>

1999
01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.190
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his classic.</v>

2000
01:23:36.191 --> 01:23:39.250
<v Speaker 3>We're saying first reps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you did three sets of 10,</v>

2001
01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:43.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you had three first repetitions,</v>

2002
01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you had three reps that you did after</v>

2003
01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.750
<v Speaker 3>rest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you did 10 sets at three,</v>

2004
01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.130
<v Speaker 3>now you have 10 for strips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2005
01:23:54.131 --> 01:23:55.360
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2006
01:23:55.361 --> 01:23:57.130
<v Speaker 3>So now you did the same total </v>
<v Speaker 3>repetitions,</v>

2007
01:23:57.131 --> 01:23:59.530
<v Speaker 3>but 10 of them were done after full </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest,</v>

2008
01:23:59.531 --> 01:24:01.600
<v Speaker 3>which means you're gonna have more power</v>
<v Speaker 3>and more force.</v>

2009
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:03.880
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it seemed smarter.</v>

2010
01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:04.840
<v Speaker 3>That's basically it.</v>

2011
01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.450
<v Speaker 4>So you're better off doing 10 threes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then three,</v>

2012
01:24:07.451 --> 01:24:10.390
<v Speaker 4>10 for strength for strength or power or</v>
<v Speaker 4>speed.</v>

2013
01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:15.420
<v Speaker 4>And then taking a big break in between </v>
<v Speaker 4>them is sort of counterintuitive to a </v>

2014
01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:15.420
<v Speaker 4>lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They feel like,</v>

2015
01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:19.891
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be a pussy and then let </v>

2016
01:24:19.891 --> 01:24:20.570
<v Speaker 4>myself get fully recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to push while I'm still at.</v>

2017
01:24:20.571 --> 01:24:21.490
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

2018
01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:21.980
<v Speaker 4>broke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2019
01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.670
<v Speaker 4>And they'll help you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>

2020
01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:25.420
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

2021
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:28.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see that all the time.</v>

2022
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:31.390
<v Speaker 4>Meat heads in the gym and they think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the way to go.</v>

2023
01:24:31.391 --> 01:24:32.050
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2024
01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:32.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2025
01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:33.500
<v Speaker 3>And they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2026
01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:38.501
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the way to go if they want to get </v>

2027
01:24:38.501 --> 01:24:38.501
<v Speaker 3>sore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they want to maybe prove awesome.</v>

2028
01:24:38.501 --> 01:24:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Do that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love to walk around sore.</v>

2029
01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:43.430
<v Speaker 3>You know what's funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like the number one reason I got</v>

2030
01:24:43.431 --> 01:24:46.460
<v Speaker 3>into mma was that that question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right there,</v>

2031
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:48.590
<v Speaker 3>people kept coming to me with this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2032
01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:53.710
<v Speaker 3>you don't know basics of speed training </v>
<v Speaker 3>or strength training and the mma guys </v>

2033
01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:53.710
<v Speaker 3>were so wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I.</v>

2034
01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:55.730
<v Speaker 3>That's how I got into this for the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>part is people are like,</v>

2035
01:24:55.731 --> 01:24:57.680
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is changing like everything.</v>

2036
01:24:57.681 --> 01:24:57.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2037
01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:00.140
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mma training is.</v>

2038
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:02.870
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really strange because mma training</v>

2039
01:25:02.871 --> 01:25:05.750
<v Speaker 4>is essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still in its infancy,</v>

2040
01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:10.960
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really didn't even exist until 1993 </v>

2041
01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.500
<v Speaker 4>and then it didn't even really exist </v>
<v Speaker 4>even then until like.</v>

2042
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:18.910
<v Speaker 4>I feel like frank shamrock was the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>real professional mma fighter because he</v>

2043
01:25:19.401 --> 01:25:24.401
<v Speaker 4>was the first guy to figure out that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to be an insane cardio and he was </v>

2044
01:25:24.401 --> 01:25:27.400
<v Speaker 4>the first guy to be able to strike and </v>
<v Speaker 4>also be able to grappled,</v>

2045
01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:32.420
<v Speaker 4>be able to fight off of his back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece it all together and the cardio is </v>

2046
01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.530
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a huge factor,</v>

2047
01:25:33.710 --> 01:25:34.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2048
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:36.080
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he beat tito ortiz,</v>

2049
01:25:36.081 --> 01:25:39.530
<v Speaker 4>it was way smaller than tito,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he beat them because of cardio.</v>

2050
01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:44.980
<v Speaker 4>But one of the things that I used to see</v>
<v Speaker 4>early on that was so confusing to me </v>

2051
01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:49.421
<v Speaker 4>because I came from a striking </v>
<v Speaker 4>background was how many of these guys </v>

2052
01:25:49.421 --> 01:25:52.780
<v Speaker 4>were willing to beat the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other in the gym and like that they</v>

2053
01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:57.781
<v Speaker 4>were just going to war but not even </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to war with like good skills,</v>

2054
01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:01.070
<v Speaker 4>like going to war while they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>learning for the sake of war.</v>

2055
01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:01.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2056
01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm watching them getting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're</v>

2057
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.850
<v Speaker 2>beating the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2058
01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:08.030
<v Speaker 2>you guys are professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this isn't like,</v>

2059
01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.360
<v Speaker 2>this isn't like some idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the y like you guys are,</v>

2060
01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:14.930
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be pros like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have damage yourself.</v>

2061
01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 2>The takes years off of your career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of you know me working</v>

2062
01:26:19.701 --> 01:26:24.650
<v Speaker 2>with athletes is doing these very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very basic things like I'm not.</v>

2063
01:26:24.710 --> 01:26:26.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guru was like,</v>

2064
01:26:26.301 --> 01:26:27.050
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the,</v>

2065
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.480
<v Speaker 2>the 18 point blood tests and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get these.</v>

2066
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:32.360
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of what I do is go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2067
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:33.380
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see the problem here.</v>

2068
01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to do this basic thing.</v>

2069
01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't eaten a vegetable in a week.</v>

2070
01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that as not as much anymore,</v>

2071
01:26:41.181 --> 01:26:42.650
<v Speaker 2>but I used to really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2072
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:48.010
<v Speaker 2>We get a lot of the pro athlete that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't eat vegetables we get is </v>

2073
01:26:48.010 --> 01:26:51.401
<v Speaker 2>honestly it's because probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] assholes like you and they </v>

2074
01:26:51.401 --> 01:26:51.401
<v Speaker 2>want your show or something.</v>

2075
01:26:51.401 --> 01:26:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I tell people to eat vegetables all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2076
01:26:52.971 --> 01:26:53.240
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2077
01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:54.530
<v Speaker 2>When they watched this and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2078
01:26:54.531 --> 01:26:59.531
<v Speaker 2>they'll come at me with a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>really weird nutrition questions or </v>

2079
01:26:59.531 --> 01:27:03.111
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A really weird advanced training ones </v>

2080
01:27:03.111 --> 01:27:04.961
<v Speaker 2>because I went to a seminar or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like back the train up like </v>

2081
01:27:04.961 --> 01:27:07.760
<v Speaker 2>you're sparring six times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got a whole nother conversation,</v>

2082
01:27:07.761 --> 01:27:08.030
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2083
01:27:08.031 --> 01:27:09.020
<v Speaker 2>we don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2084
01:27:09.021 --> 01:27:10.010
<v Speaker 2>that's not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2085
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:10.970
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2086
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Or you're doing that or you're running </v>
<v Speaker 2>35 miles a week.</v>

2087
01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the vast majority of what I do </v>

2088
01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:22.421
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is bring this guy's back to life and go </v>

2089
01:27:22.421 --> 01:27:24.191
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me help you sift through all this </v>

2090
01:27:24.191 --> 01:27:26.440
<v Speaker 2>internet stuff that's really complicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's take what's actually good and </v>

2091
01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.401
<v Speaker 2>bad and dial in a very usable system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think people just get overwhelmed </v>

2092
01:27:30.861 --> 01:27:32.150
<v Speaker 2>with options for me internet.</v>

2093
01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:37.150
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because too many people get on exposure </v>

2094
01:27:37.150 --> 01:27:38.840
<v Speaker 2>and get on shows or platforms and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to make sure that,</v>

2095
01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.450
<v Speaker 2>that they are known as the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows something different.</v>

2096
01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2097
01:27:42.951 --> 01:27:43.390
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2098
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's not very exciting if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up here and tell you like,</v>

2099
01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:46.430
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joel has pros and cons to everything.</v>

2100
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2101
01:27:48.171 --> 01:27:49.910
<v Speaker 2>well that's not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's good.</v>

2102
01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're saying is very </v>

2103
01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:55.300
<v Speaker 2>important for people to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the no wait,</v>

2104
01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:57.200
<v Speaker 2>they get bogged down in the details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way too much if things that really don't</v>

2105
01:27:57.201 --> 01:28:02.201
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's not that sensitive or </v>

2106
01:28:02.201 --> 01:28:04.471
<v Speaker 2>sensitive enough where it can't convert </v>
<v Speaker 2>something from from something to </v>

2107
01:28:04.471 --> 01:28:05.390
<v Speaker 2>something else and if it needs it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will do that for the most part.</v>

2108
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:08.390
<v Speaker 2>So there are some real small things at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end,</v>

2109
01:28:08.391 --> 01:28:13.391
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of what we can do is just get </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on a reasonable program that's </v>

2110
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:18.400
<v Speaker 2>actually possible for you to implement </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't drive you so crazy or </v>

2111
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.050
<v Speaker 2>so is so difficult and so confusing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you that you get halfway into it.</v>

2112
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:22.430
<v Speaker 2>You abandoned it and then you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start over.</v>

2113
01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2114
01:28:23.301 --> 01:28:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I always think about dan gable and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>dan gable was young,</v>

2115
01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:32.480
<v Speaker 2>I pretty much outworked anybody and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just an unbelievable savage when it </v>

2116
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.940
<v Speaker 2>came to his training and then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifested itself in the competition.</v>

2117
01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:39.941
<v Speaker 2>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the momentum behind him because of his </v>

2118
01:28:39.941 --> 01:28:42.731
<v Speaker 2>roof was training was so intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now he can't even walk right.</v>

2119
01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:45.830
<v Speaker 2>When these hips are gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his knees or guns got artificial,</v>

2120
01:28:45.831 --> 01:28:46.640
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2121
01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:51.670
<v Speaker 2>he's just fucked up because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And soMe guys were willing to MAke that </v>

2122
01:28:51.670 --> 01:28:51.670
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is that,</v>

2123
01:28:51.670 --> 01:28:53.870
<v Speaker 2>here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that sacrifice necessary?</v>

2124
01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Like can you be too tough versus smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your training?</v>

2125
01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:02.340
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2126
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Because like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that here's where it gets so tricky is </v>

2127
01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.191
<v Speaker 3>physiology versus psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that gave him that extra mental </v>

2128
01:29:10.191 --> 01:29:12.240
<v Speaker 3>confidence that he needed to perform </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

2129
01:29:12.241 --> 01:29:14.310
<v Speaker 3>well then it's hard to say that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't necessary.</v>

2130
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was always talking about guys on</v>

2131
01:29:16.531 --> 01:29:21.531
<v Speaker 3>steroids that he liked competing against</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys on steroids because he knew they </v>

2132
01:29:21.531 --> 01:29:21.531
<v Speaker 3>were mentally weak and they would break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2133
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:23.310
<v Speaker 3>So who the hell knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2134
01:29:23.311 --> 01:29:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Like you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have all this conflicting stuff and,</v>

2135
01:29:25.691 --> 01:29:27.300
<v Speaker 3>and you try to do this dance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why again,</v>

2136
01:29:27.301 --> 01:29:32.301
<v Speaker 3>you need People,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a team to do this stuff and </v>

2137
01:29:32.301 --> 01:29:32.301
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2138
01:29:32.301 --> 01:29:35.481
<v Speaker 3>this is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people have a really hard time with </v>

2139
01:29:35.481 --> 01:29:38.840
<v Speaker 3>physiological truth or scientific truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and implementation.</v>

2140
01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.110
<v Speaker 3>so a very easy one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sugar,</v>

2141
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:48.980
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't know anyone in the world </v>

2142
01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:48.980
<v Speaker 3>who advocates adding sugar to your diet.</v>

2143
01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:50.460
<v Speaker 3>It's a good thing like no one's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>say that.</v>

2144
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you tell somebody a scientific </v>

2145
01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.671
<v Speaker 3>truth versus what the message you spread</v>
<v Speaker 3>it spread to either your athletes are a </v>

2146
01:29:58.671 --> 01:30:01.911
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people that can be very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different because because of </v>

2147
01:30:01.911 --> 01:30:03.420
<v Speaker 3>unintended applications are </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

2148
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:08.690
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no physiological harm with </v>

2149
01:30:08.690 --> 01:30:08.690
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad for you in any way,</v>

2150
01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:14.300
<v Speaker 3>but as a message to the general public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the worst thing to say.</v>

2151
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:20.870
<v Speaker 3>And so most of the fighting that goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth between any conversation </v>

2152
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.940
<v Speaker 3>like this is people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2153
01:30:20.941 --> 01:30:21.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2154
01:30:21.271 --> 01:30:23.580
<v Speaker 3>But the actual effect of it is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2155
01:30:23.581 --> 01:30:28.581
<v Speaker 3>but the science is wrong and they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>conceding that they're actually talking </v>

2156
01:30:28.581 --> 01:30:29.010
<v Speaker 3>past each other far more than they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to.</v>

2157
01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.810
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that sugar is bad for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

2158
01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:31.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't be.</v>

2159
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:34.980
<v Speaker 3>It can't be unless implementation.</v>

2160
01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:35.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2161
01:30:35.661 --> 01:30:35.790
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2162
01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.250
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2163
01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:37.260
<v Speaker 3>what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now we've.</v>

2164
01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sugar in your diet.</v>

2165
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:41.510
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sugars is where it gets confusing.</v>

2166
01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you want to break down sugar,</v>

2167
01:30:43.650 --> 01:30:48.210
<v Speaker 3>having sugar in your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like eating sugary foods and snacks,</v>

2168
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.540
<v Speaker 3>having an excess of sugar has dire </v>
<v Speaker 3>health consequence.</v>

2169
01:30:51.541 --> 01:30:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Totally correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

2170
01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:55.950
<v Speaker 3>But there's a key word you said there </v>
<v Speaker 3>which was excess excess.</v>

2171
01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:58.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like meaning a piece of fruit,</v>

2172
01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 3>like a nectarine not bad for you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2173
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:02.280
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good for you.</v>

2174
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:03.930
<v Speaker 3>And plus fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2175
01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But processed sugar,</v>

2176
01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:10.170
<v Speaker 3>whether it's removed from that fiber and</v>
<v Speaker 3>put into a cocacola dot becomes an issue</v>

2177
01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:13.860
<v Speaker 3>because of concentration issue because </v>
<v Speaker 3>now you can consume that a concentration</v>

2178
01:31:13.861 --> 01:31:17.580
<v Speaker 3>that probably wouldn't happen normally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And quantities that would never happen.</v>

2179
01:31:17.581 --> 01:31:22.581
<v Speaker 3>Normally thing go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you could have a person in the </v>

2180
01:31:22.581 --> 01:31:22.680
<v Speaker 3>corner of left who that says like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2181
01:31:22.681 --> 01:31:23.220
<v Speaker 3>you're an idiot.</v>

2182
01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Look at the science says sugar is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad for you for a thousand reasons.</v>

2183
01:31:26.341 --> 01:31:31.250
<v Speaker 3>And they're technically right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when we have conversations to $350,</v>

2184
01:31:31.251 --> 01:31:36.251
<v Speaker 3>million americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want all that detail in </v>

2185
01:31:36.251 --> 01:31:36.251
<v Speaker 3>between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want do,</v>

2186
01:31:36.251 --> 01:31:38.790
<v Speaker 3>do I do it or do I not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if I have to take a hard line and</v>

2187
01:31:38.791 --> 01:31:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2188
01:31:39.301 --> 01:31:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Sugar is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't eat it.</v>

2189
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:44.250
<v Speaker 3>It actually causes a generally good </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect on people.</v>

2190
01:31:44.251 --> 01:31:44.700
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2191
01:31:44.701 --> 01:31:45.750
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know this.</v>

2192
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Adding sugar to my stuff is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it right.</v>

2193
01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Which is a net good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although technically individually it's </v>

2194
01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:54.720
<v Speaker 3>not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>

2195
01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:59.930
<v Speaker 3>So sugar in and of itself is not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>excess sugar and processed sugar</v>

2196
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:05.220
<v Speaker 4>and added sugar in mass quantities is </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad and that's what you're dealing with </v>

2197
01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:08.680
<v Speaker 4>with the average american diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's through breads or pastas or</v>

2198
01:32:08.681 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 4>actually sugar and soda itself,</v>

2199
01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:13.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>or sucrose or are or any of those things</v>

2200
01:32:13.031 --> 01:32:15.420
<v Speaker 3>and added to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when people go,</v>

2201
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 3>the poor souls go on the internet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to figure out like,</v>

2202
01:32:17.741 --> 01:32:18.080
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>

2203
01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.530
<v Speaker 3>are carbs bad for me or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2204
01:32:20.531 --> 01:32:25.531
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fighting over stuff that's not </v>

2205
01:32:25.531 --> 01:32:27.751
<v Speaker 3>important and we're missing the message </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people want real answers and </v>

2206
01:32:27.751 --> 01:32:30.380
<v Speaker 3>you're not helping them give it to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

2207
01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if it makes you look right </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the internet.</v>

2208
01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:34.840
<v Speaker 3>We need to come together and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2209
01:32:34.841 --> 01:32:37.450
<v Speaker 3>well here's good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's bad and bad and here are the pros</v>

2210
01:32:37.451 --> 01:32:38.290
<v Speaker 3>and cons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

2211
01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:43.340
<v Speaker 3>now here's the information for you folks</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't matter whose book it is </v>

2212
01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:43.870
<v Speaker 3>or who wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's not the important part.</v>

2213
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:48.910
<v Speaker 4>Well even having this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 4>though is going to be really confusing </v>

2214
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:52.211
<v Speaker 4>to a lot of people because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about so many different </v>

2215
01:32:52.211 --> 01:32:55.001
<v Speaker 4>variables in by your being </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectually honest about all this </v>

2216
01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:55.710
<v Speaker 4>stuff and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's,</v>

2217
01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no real good answer.</v>

2218
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2219
01:32:58.701 --> 01:33:00.830
<v Speaker 4>and it's different for one person is for</v>
<v Speaker 4>another person.</v>

2220
01:33:00.831 --> 01:33:05.831
<v Speaker 4>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people might get over really well </v>

2221
01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:07.430
<v Speaker 4>on like macadamia nuts and almonds and </v>
<v Speaker 4>get their protein from,</v>

2222
01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:10.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and other people they might actually had</v>

2223
01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:11.630
<v Speaker 4>an allergy to those things.</v>

2224
01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2225
01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:17.580
<v Speaker 3>trust me and tried to be my students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get irritated this shit when I do </v>

2226
01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:17.580
<v Speaker 3>this to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's probably</v>

2227
01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:21.890
<v Speaker 4>good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when a fighter in particular is </v>

2228
01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:24.651
<v Speaker 4>thinking about their career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sort of exist in these six week to </v>

2229
01:33:24.651 --> 01:33:27.060
<v Speaker 4>eight week lifespans like their whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2230
01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:32.090
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or fortunately when it works out well </v>

2231
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:34.050
<v Speaker 4>that they go through these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ruth was training camps</v>

2232
01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:39.160
<v Speaker 3>and to have any variability had to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>any unknown to have any.</v>

2233
01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 3>So this is bringing up a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not a kind of conversation I </v>

2234
01:33:45.010 --> 01:33:45.890
<v Speaker 3>would have with a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2235
01:33:46.190 --> 01:33:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Not during,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not specially 10 weeks out from a fight </v>

2236
01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:51.190
<v Speaker 3>overload their brain with possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2237
01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:51.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2238
01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:52.100
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is very clear.</v>

2239
01:33:52.101 --> 01:33:53.390
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you like to do?</v>

2240
01:33:53.391 --> 01:33:55.430
<v Speaker 3>What do you hate to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What have you done before,</v>

2241
01:33:55.431 --> 01:33:56.270
<v Speaker 3>what's worked well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

2242
01:33:56.271 --> 01:33:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2243
01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:58.430
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2244
01:33:58.870 --> 01:34:02.060
<v Speaker 3>I have an analogy called the cook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the baker and the chef.</v>

2245
01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:07.900
<v Speaker 3>I give you the very quick story of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can listen to the whole episode on </v>

2246
01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:08.270
<v Speaker 3>my podcast if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the podcast called?</v>

2247
01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:10.020
<v Speaker 3>The body of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2248
01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:13.340
<v Speaker 3>So it's on itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff,</v>

2249
01:34:13.730 --> 01:34:15.170
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Body knowledge.com.</v>

2250
01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:20.640
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually a not to talk about that </v>

2251
01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:20.640
<v Speaker 3>too much is only nine episodes.</v>

2252
01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:23.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not like going on running podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like radio lab dan carlin,</v>

2253
01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:27.740
<v Speaker 3>but for physiology and finishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not to that extent,</v>

2254
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:28.830
<v Speaker 3>but you get that here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2255
01:34:28.850 --> 01:34:33.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I like to look at people as either </v>

2256
01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:34.490
<v Speaker 3>the easy one is either a baker or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cook,</v>

2257
01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:40.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you know what the difference </v>

2258
01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:40.060
<v Speaker 3>between baking and cooking is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2259
01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people don't.</v>

2260
01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Baking is chemistry basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2261
01:34:42.201 --> 01:34:45.020
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm a little tablespoon here.</v>

2262
01:34:45.021 --> 01:34:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a teaspoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baking soda,</v>

2263
01:34:46.191 --> 01:34:47.340
<v Speaker 3>baking powder house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>

2264
01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:49.610
<v Speaker 3>That does not work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't bake like that.</v>

2265
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will not make anything.</v>

2266
01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.770
<v Speaker 3>You would have a mesh of crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And an oven baking is chemistry.</v>

2267
01:34:54.771 --> 01:34:59.771
<v Speaker 3>You can do this in this order and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you add this and you cannot do </v>

2268
01:34:59.771 --> 01:34:59.771
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And other orders.</v>

2269
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:03.620
<v Speaker 3>It's very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like roughly cooking is like,</v>

2270
01:35:03.621 --> 01:35:04.790
<v Speaker 3>well all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what's left?</v>

2271
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:06.140
<v Speaker 3>I get some oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets some hot.</v>

2272
01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Kind of dicey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2273
01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Throat throw some whatever you give them</v>
<v Speaker 3>mishmash,</v>

2274
01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:15.311
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people generally I find work well </v>

2275
01:35:15.311 --> 01:35:16.760
<v Speaker 3>with nutrition information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either one of two approaches.</v>

2276
01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:18.440
<v Speaker 3>So if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe,</v>

2277
01:35:18.441 --> 01:35:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do a nutrition program for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you for the next six months,</v>

2278
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:22.760
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2279
01:35:22.761 --> 01:35:24.860
<v Speaker 3>you can either do this one of two ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2280
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:30.070
<v Speaker 3>we can work together every morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weigh every single thing you eat on the </v>

2281
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.070
<v Speaker 3>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>text it to me,</v>

2282
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you exactly how many slices of</v>
<v Speaker 3>avocado to have,</v>

2283
01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:38.440
<v Speaker 3>how many jalapenos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd tell you exact weights and </v>

2284
01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:41.021
<v Speaker 3>volumes for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or we can maybe text once a day or once </v>

2285
01:35:41.021 --> 01:35:41.990
<v Speaker 3>a week and we would just go over </v>
<v Speaker 3>concepts and ideas.</v>

2286
01:35:41.991 --> 01:35:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Here's what we're trying to get to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want.</v>

2287
01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Which would you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2288
01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:47.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2289
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:49.550
<v Speaker 3>What should I look?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a should.</v>

2290
01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:52.580
<v Speaker 3>It's a personal preference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some people would.</v>

2291
01:35:52.810 --> 01:35:55.130
<v Speaker 3>I cook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just wants ideas,</v>

2292
01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.740
<v Speaker 3>give me the concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one or two things to work through.</v>

2293
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2294
01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:04.190
<v Speaker 3>I get anxiety with all those rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the information like I can </v>

2295
01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:04.910
<v Speaker 3>implemented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's too complicated.</v>

2296
01:36:04.911 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't have that much time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

2297
01:36:06.831 --> 01:36:07.970
<v Speaker 3>I called these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooks,</v>

2298
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:11.420
<v Speaker 3>other people get anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my wife natasha,</v>

2299
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:14.750
<v Speaker 3>when I don't give her exact numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

2300
01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:16.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is six grams for the eight almonds or is</v>

2301
01:36:16.671 --> 01:36:17.240
<v Speaker 3>it nine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost like,</v>

2302
01:36:17.241 --> 01:36:18.230
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2303
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:23.210
<v Speaker 3>So giving people the information in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that they absorb it is important.</v>

2304
01:36:23.211 --> 01:36:26.660
<v Speaker 3>So if you talk to a baker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so chemistry details,</v>

2305
01:36:26.661 --> 01:36:29.930
<v Speaker 3>weighing everything out and I go are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2306
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:31.520
<v Speaker 3>here's what I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of fat,</v>

2307
01:36:31.521 --> 01:36:32.810
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some grains,</v>

2308
01:36:32.811 --> 01:36:34.640
<v Speaker 3>and it's not going to work for them.</v>

2309
01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:38.300
<v Speaker 3>You have to give them a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very specific system.</v>

2310
01:36:38.301 --> 01:36:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Having a cup of this tablespoon of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if that system isn't perfect.</v>

2311
01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.560
<v Speaker 3>What about chef?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So chef is someone who knows the </v>

2312
01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.521
<v Speaker 3>chemistry of baking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but has the years of experience of </v>

2313
01:36:51.521 --> 01:36:54.791
<v Speaker 3>mixing it in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you can go ahead and break those </v>

2314
01:36:54.791 --> 01:36:54.850
<v Speaker 3>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2315
01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:56.480
<v Speaker 3>Chefs break camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooking result of time.</v>

2316
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Baking roles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a chef was like anderson silva.</v>

2317
01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:00.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fighting.</v>

2318
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2319
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:04.520
<v Speaker 3>But a chef would be maybe where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>at in nutrition,</v>

2320
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:06.110
<v Speaker 3>where you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do that.</v>

2321
01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:11.111
<v Speaker 3>I could follow a very Specific diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know the concept and I know these </v>

2322
01:37:11.111 --> 01:37:11.111
<v Speaker 3>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me experiment here.</v>

2323
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:16.510
<v Speaker 3>And you have room to maneuver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is most people want to jump </v>

2324
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:17.330
<v Speaker 3>in and be chefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People want to fight like anderson silva</v>

2325
01:37:17.331 --> 01:37:19.000
<v Speaker 3>their first day and you get overwhelmed.</v>

2326
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:24.070
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so get a detailed understanding about </v>

2327
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:27.971
<v Speaker 3>how your body functions under very </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific protocols and then start </v>

2328
01:37:27.971 --> 01:37:28.580
<v Speaker 3>fucking around with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or the opposite.</v>

2329
01:37:28.670 --> 01:37:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Start off with a cook approach was to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2330
01:37:30.441 --> 01:37:32.690
<v Speaker 3>let's give me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you one or two concepts this</v>

2331
01:37:32.690 --> 01:37:37.690
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to eat one fresh green every </v>

2332
01:37:37.690 --> 01:37:38.480
<v Speaker 3>day and I want you to do make sure you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have protein every time you eat.</v>

2333
01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.640
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My only role.</v>

2334
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next week we had a rule.</v>

2335
01:37:42.171 --> 01:37:47.171
<v Speaker 3>maybe we got another concept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as you get better and you get more </v>

2336
01:37:47.171 --> 01:37:47.780
<v Speaker 3>confidence and you get more comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go,</v>

2337
01:37:47.781 --> 01:37:49.040
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how much protein?</v>

2338
01:37:49.041 --> 01:37:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2339
01:37:50.090 --> 01:37:51.620
<v Speaker 3>let's just try a hundred grams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2340
01:37:51.621 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>well that's a that unless they're 150 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've slowly pushed you,</v>

2341
01:37:56.430 --> 01:38:01.430
<v Speaker 2>but generally being a baker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those rules weighing everything </v>

2342
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:02.280
<v Speaker 2>generally that's not sustainable for </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people.</v>

2343
01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:09.030
<v Speaker 2>now when you coach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you coach them as far as their diet </v>

2344
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:12.351
<v Speaker 2>goes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do do you actually tell them what they </v>

2345
01:38:12.351 --> 01:38:12.351
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends on if they're a cook or a baker.</v>

2346
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:14.550
<v Speaker 2>So a cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not.</v>

2347
01:38:14.551 --> 01:38:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I tell them basic concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2348
01:38:16.921 --> 01:38:19.050
<v Speaker 2>So I talked to them how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to be helpful for them?</v>

2349
01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:20.130
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you think I should do.</v>

2350
01:38:20.131 --> 01:38:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Should I add more carbs or shit out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I'm feeling when I'm.</v>

2351
01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:23.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2352
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Where were you at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like here's our diet.</v>

2353
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's add more carbs.</v>

2354
01:38:26.491 --> 01:38:27.840
<v Speaker 2>How should I do this or this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2355
01:38:27.841 --> 01:38:32.841
<v Speaker 2>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you generally tell people to avoid </v>

2356
01:38:32.841 --> 01:38:35.571
<v Speaker 2>any specific foods or are there any </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that interrupt training or get </v>

2357
01:38:35.571 --> 01:38:38.070
<v Speaker 2>into the way outside of the obvious?</v>

2358
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2359
01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Candy,</v>

2360
01:38:39.961 --> 01:38:40.840
<v Speaker 2>pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2361
01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless we have some very specific </v>

2362
01:38:46.190 --> 01:38:49.221
<v Speaker 2>history with them that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember you don't react well when this </v>

2363
01:38:49.221 --> 01:38:49.221
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2364
01:38:49.221 --> 01:38:50.520
<v Speaker 2>but generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2365
01:38:50.521 --> 01:38:55.521
<v Speaker 2>When you say like protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you specify fish or chicken or meat </v>

2366
01:38:55.521 --> 01:38:57.110
<v Speaker 2>or fits a cook?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2367
01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:58.230
<v Speaker 2>No?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a baker,</v>

2368
01:38:58.231 --> 01:38:59.700
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2369
01:38:59.701 --> 01:39:03.960
<v Speaker 2>And whether it's important that I chose </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish or chicken almost doesn't matter as</v>

2370
01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:06.930
<v Speaker 2>much as telling them that the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they all go,</v>

2371
01:39:06.931 --> 01:39:07.950
<v Speaker 2>he's got it dialed for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Credit,</v>

2372
01:39:07.951 --> 01:39:11.130
<v Speaker 2>I got a sense that you have here eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>ounces of halibut.</v>

2373
01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:12.300
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>

2374
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:13.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you'd be like,</v>

2375
01:39:13.651 --> 01:39:18.651
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of the ones I work </v>
<v Speaker 2>with are already pretty good with their </v>

2376
01:39:18.651 --> 01:39:20.010
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and it's really more concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2377
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.950
<v Speaker 2>some of them would want the stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>relief telling them what to eat and they</v>

2378
01:39:22.951 --> 01:39:24.370
<v Speaker 2>want someone to come in and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2379
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:25.740
<v Speaker 2>do you know anyone that would come in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and food prep,</v>

2380
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:27.810
<v Speaker 2>meal prep for me and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2381
01:39:27.811 --> 01:39:28.320
<v Speaker 2>we can do that.</v>

2382
01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of them like it,</v>

2383
01:39:29.791 --> 01:39:32.400
<v Speaker 2>some of it is their distress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them like that control.</v>

2384
01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:34.440
<v Speaker 2>So I try to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2385
01:39:34.441 --> 01:39:37.800
<v Speaker 2>it's not about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if my system worked.</v>

2386
01:39:37.801 --> 01:39:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My system is what do you want to do?</v>

2387
01:39:40.051 --> 01:39:42.180
<v Speaker 2>How can I help you and your team?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can we do?</v>

2388
01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:45.390
<v Speaker 2>That's the approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2389
01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.070
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems so.</v>

2390
01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:52.360
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many variables and it's so </v>

2391
01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:52.360
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I get so irritated you,</v>

2392
01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:54.420
<v Speaker 2>you're teasing me earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucketing all fired up about it.</v>

2393
01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I could understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I appreciate this intellectual </v>

2394
01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.981
<v Speaker 2>honesty about these variables and about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how there is not one approach because </v>

2395
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:07.080
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many dickheads out there that</v>

2396
01:40:07.081 --> 01:40:10.770
<v Speaker 2>are teaching their method in air quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here we go.</v>

2397
01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Let's take those dickheads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2398
01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:15.830
<v Speaker 2>If you're a baker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>landing on one of those systems is going</v>

2399
01:40:15.831 --> 01:40:20.831
<v Speaker 2>to be fantastic for you and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to five star review and you're going to </v>

2400
01:40:20.831 --> 01:40:23.510
<v Speaker 2>try it out everybody because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>baker and you needed a system.</v>

2401
01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>

2402
01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.830
<v Speaker 2>if you're a cook though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going like,</v>

2403
01:40:25.831 --> 01:40:26.850
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

2404
01:40:26.851 --> 01:40:28.530
<v Speaker 2>And if a scientist could step in and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2405
01:40:28.531 --> 01:40:31.170
<v Speaker 2>well those are all the problems and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this and this and this,</v>

2406
01:40:31.171 --> 01:40:32.820
<v Speaker 2>and then everyone's fighting back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

2407
01:40:32.821 --> 01:40:33.390
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well fuck.</v>

2408
01:40:33.391 --> 01:40:38.391
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess though he felt like I'm so </v>

2409
01:40:38.391 --> 01:40:38.391
<v Speaker 2>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2410
01:40:38.391 --> 01:40:40.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not the right question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what irritates a lot of people's</v>

2411
01:40:40.621 --> 01:40:45.621
<v Speaker 2>at some people are finding like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>insecurity that people have and they're </v>

2412
01:40:47.101 --> 01:40:52.101
<v Speaker 2>exploiting it by telling them exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they think is right.</v>

2413
01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 2>It's human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2414
01:40:53.951 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 2>We</v>

2415
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:56.290
<v Speaker 3>want the next solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want all this stuff.</v>

2416
01:40:56.291 --> 01:40:58.390
<v Speaker 3>We want it all dialed into one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2417
01:40:58.391 --> 01:41:03.391
<v Speaker 3>I call it fallacy of unicorn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm just gonna keep searching </v>

2418
01:41:03.391 --> 01:41:03.880
<v Speaker 3>because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this one thing and if I fix that</v>

2419
01:41:03.881 --> 01:41:05.580
<v Speaker 3>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else align up.</v>

2420
01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:08.350
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2421
01:41:08.530 --> 01:41:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Now what about vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you specify the type of </v>

2422
01:41:13.530 --> 01:41:13.690
<v Speaker 3>vegetables you like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you prefer a dark,</v>

2423
01:41:13.691 --> 01:41:18.691
<v Speaker 3>leafy green vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>general statement beats or the more </v>

2424
01:41:18.691 --> 01:41:18.691
<v Speaker 3>color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more texture.</v>

2425
01:41:18.691 --> 01:41:19.420
<v Speaker 3>The bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2426
01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:22.450
<v Speaker 3>and like you said actually earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the variety that matters.</v>

2427
01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:25.060
<v Speaker 3>What these folks as sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now having said that,</v>

2428
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:28.420
<v Speaker 3>here's what I'll do outside of camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are conversations we're having,</v>

2429
01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:31.660
<v Speaker 3>like I want as many different vegetables</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you possibly can,</v>

2430
01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.280
<v Speaker 3>different colors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different countries,</v>

2431
01:41:33.281 --> 01:41:35.530
<v Speaker 3>different seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff,</v>

2432
01:41:35.531 --> 01:41:36.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

2433
01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:38.110
<v Speaker 3>let's cook them sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's steam them.</v>

2434
01:41:38.111 --> 01:41:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Let's eat them fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's eat them raw.</v>

2435
01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.460
<v Speaker 3>There's pros and cons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2436
01:41:43.210 --> 01:41:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you got to fight in four weeks and </v>

2437
01:41:48.210 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 3>we're 25 pounds overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I will take those options away</v>

2438
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:51.730
<v Speaker 3>because it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then to control numbers.</v>

2439
01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:53.170
<v Speaker 3>If I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2440
01:41:53.171 --> 01:41:55.240
<v Speaker 3>here's the approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have a,</v>

2441
01:41:55.300 --> 01:42:00.280
<v Speaker 3>b and c at these three meals every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every other day we'll rotate.</v>

2442
01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Then I've just removed a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>variables from there and they can just </v>

2443
01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:05.640
<v Speaker 3>refocus and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2444
01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:06.190
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we can watch the weight.</v>

2445
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:08.350
<v Speaker 3>We're down to half a pound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're down half a pound down a quarter,</v>

2446
01:42:08.351 --> 01:42:13.351
<v Speaker 3>pound were great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's maybe exchange out kale for </v>

2447
01:42:13.351 --> 01:42:16.261
<v Speaker 3>spanish this time or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the hard part about extreme </v>

2448
01:42:16.261 --> 01:42:19.411
<v Speaker 3>variability is lack of control and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes if you're like,</v>

2449
01:42:19.691 --> 01:42:20.860
<v Speaker 3>why am I mean not anything you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me,</v>

2450
01:42:20.861 --> 01:42:22.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm meeting a bunch of different stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not losing weight.</v>

2451
01:42:23.290 --> 01:42:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they don't understand yet,</v>

2452
01:42:25.141 --> 01:42:28.120
<v Speaker 3>but this type of vegetable has a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>more calories in this type of vegetable,</v>

2453
01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:31.270
<v Speaker 3>so we're getting really high up in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers or when you eat this,</v>

2454
01:42:31.271 --> 01:42:34.240
<v Speaker 3>the way you prep it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you like it is glaringly dense,</v>

2455
01:42:34.241 --> 01:42:37.630
<v Speaker 3>so I will reduce options for them.</v>

2456
01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:42.680
<v Speaker 3>So it was funny because if you looked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of mine nutrition programs for my </v>

2457
01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:44.050
<v Speaker 3>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could look at it and be like,</v>

2458
01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's an idiot.</v>

2459
01:42:45.041 --> 01:42:46.240
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2460
01:42:46.241 --> 01:42:46.780
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this.</v>

2461
01:42:46.781 --> 01:42:48.100
<v Speaker 3>You stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have any of this.</v>

2462
01:42:48.101 --> 01:42:49.360
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dummy.</v>

2463
01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:52.060
<v Speaker 3>You think that that three day plan is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we did the whole year round.</v>

2464
01:42:52.090 --> 01:42:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Your argument is someone who's not even </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

2465
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:58.060
<v Speaker 3>They're real you of all people know the </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

2466
01:42:58.990 --> 01:43:00.360
<v Speaker 3>What about water?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2467
01:43:00.370 --> 01:43:03.010
<v Speaker 3>I've always wanted to ask somebody this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you know the answer.</v>

2468
01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:07.000
<v Speaker 3>This is all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these ways to treat water,</v>

2469
01:43:07.450 --> 01:43:09.740
<v Speaker 3>alkaline water on bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2470
01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2471
01:43:10.811 --> 01:43:12.100
<v Speaker 3>I would assume so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2472
01:43:12.130 --> 01:43:14.230
<v Speaker 3>We actually did a study on that six </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks alkaline.</v>

2473
01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:17.260
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is alkaline water?</v>

2474
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:20.670
<v Speaker 3>That's ph right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the opposite of acid or alkaline</v>

2475
01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.140
<v Speaker 3>is the base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

2476
01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:23.950
<v Speaker 3>how do they make the water that way?</v>

2477
01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Like what are they doing to it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2478
01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:28.210
<v Speaker 3>so generally water comes a probably a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit acidic,</v>

2479
01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:30.040
<v Speaker 3>especially our tap water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2480
01:43:30.230 --> 01:43:33.850
<v Speaker 3>and so I would imagine they just do some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of combination of salt or d salting</v>

2481
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:37.810
<v Speaker 3>pretty easy chemistry wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to get it a little bit technical,</v>

2482
01:43:37.811 --> 01:43:39.820
<v Speaker 3>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's salt to your water.</v>

2483
01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.230
<v Speaker 3>I think somebody did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2484
01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:46.500
<v Speaker 3>actually did a study of a bunch of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>alkaline waters and tested them in the </v>

2485
01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:50.041
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like bonding different brands and they </v>

2486
01:43:50.041 --> 01:43:50.041
<v Speaker 3>were all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2487
01:43:50.041 --> 01:43:50.041
<v Speaker 3>eddie wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2488
01:43:50.041 --> 01:43:51.190
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that we're not even </v>
<v Speaker 3>close to alkaline,</v>

2489
01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:56.260
<v Speaker 3>but just remember it's going to change </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it sits on the shelf when it's </v>

2490
01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:57.680
<v Speaker 3>exposed to sunlight and all that crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call it holy water.</v>

2491
01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of silly.</v>

2492
01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I always feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2493
01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:02.450
<v Speaker 3>that's the blessed water.</v>

2494
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man,</v>

2495
01:44:03.321 --> 01:44:04.430
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2496
01:44:04.431 --> 01:44:04.820
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2497
01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:09.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If studies came out and we kept doing </v>

2498
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:09.890
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

2499
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:09.890
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something here,</v>

2500
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:11.550
<v Speaker 3>but there no studies currently before </v>
<v Speaker 3>with friends.</v>

2501
01:44:11.551 --> 01:44:13.160
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a sense that stupid.</v>

2502
01:44:13.770 --> 01:44:18.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean a punch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The training mask is training masks.</v>

2503
01:44:18.101 --> 01:44:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely is good.</v>

2504
01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good or bad.</v>

2505
01:44:21.250 --> 01:44:23.120
<v Speaker 3>It depends on what you use it for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>

2506
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I needed an answer.</v>

2507
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:25.580
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2508
01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:28.790
<v Speaker 3>So what I'd like to do is give examples </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2509
01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:30.200
<v Speaker 3>of when good one bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2510
01:44:30.910 --> 01:44:33.350
<v Speaker 3>And this is a brian mackenzie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep bringing him up,</v>

2511
01:44:33.351 --> 01:44:35.660
<v Speaker 3>but he taught me this lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a great lesson in humility.</v>

2512
01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's,</v>

2513
01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:37.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know him,</v>

2514
01:44:37.881 --> 01:44:42.881
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was really disruptive in the running </v>

2515
01:44:42.881 --> 01:44:42.881
<v Speaker 3>community and the movement.</v>

2516
01:44:42.881 --> 01:44:42.881
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came up,</v>

2517
01:44:42.881 --> 01:44:43.400
<v Speaker 3>kelly started at like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that came up together.</v>

2518
01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2519
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:47.780
<v Speaker 3>so I wasn't interested in him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People kept getting at me like,</v>

2520
01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go look at his stuff.</v>

2521
01:44:48.710 --> 01:44:49.270
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2522
01:44:49.271 --> 01:44:51.680
<v Speaker 3>he's a crossfit coach out like </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonchalant,</v>

2523
01:44:51.730 --> 01:44:53.660
<v Speaker 3>like crossfit coach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing against that.</v>

2524
01:44:53.661 --> 01:44:56.690
<v Speaker 3>but at the time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does crossfit coach?</v>

2525
01:44:56.691 --> 01:44:57.760
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2526
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrogance on my part,</v>

2527
01:44:58.821 --> 01:45:00.140
<v Speaker 3>mistake and second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2528
01:45:00.141 --> 01:45:02.460
<v Speaker 3>you're running coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm doubling on uninterrupted.</v>

2529
01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2530
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:06.380
<v Speaker 3>this is me highlighting my mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2531
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:08.200
<v Speaker 3>but then I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny enough,</v>

2532
01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.510
<v Speaker 3>paid attention to what he was saying and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out there was something there.</v>

2533
01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:16.540
<v Speaker 3>So it's funny how much you hated someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you don't actually listen or read </v>

2534
01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:16.790
<v Speaker 3>their stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2535
01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was promoting the training mask and </v>

2536
01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:21.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2537
01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:21.880
<v Speaker 3>like everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2538
01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:22.070
<v Speaker 3>does it work evidence so it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

2539
01:45:22.071 --> 01:45:22.520
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

2540
01:45:22.521 --> 01:45:23.030
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

2541
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:26.090
<v Speaker 3>And then I listened to what he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he was actually using it,</v>

2542
01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:31.720
<v Speaker 3>so he wasn't using it to simulate </v>
<v Speaker 3>altitude because that's not really </v>

2543
01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:35.081
<v Speaker 3>effective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was using it to teach people how </v>

2544
01:45:35.081 --> 01:45:35.480
<v Speaker 3>to use their diaphragm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's when I was like,</v>

2545
01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:38.960
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it here.</v>

2546
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:42.230
<v Speaker 3>So I'll come back and I'll finish this </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

2547
01:45:42.231 --> 01:45:46.910
<v Speaker 3>But the quick analogy here would be if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>handed you a pen and said,</v>

2548
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:48.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like does this pen work?</v>

2549
01:45:48.710 --> 01:45:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may not work as a dagger,</v>

2550
01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:56.260
<v Speaker 3>but it worked pretty good as a pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the problem with the mask was it's </v>

2551
01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:59.651
<v Speaker 3>flipped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't work for what it was told you </v>

2552
01:45:59.651 --> 01:46:00.020
<v Speaker 3>to work for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it worked because in this case,</v>

2553
01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:05.320
<v Speaker 3>the active restricting people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing sometime can help them learn </v>

2554
01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:08.801
<v Speaker 3>to use their diaphragm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who breathe with their shoulders </v>

2555
01:46:08.801 --> 01:46:11.741
<v Speaker 3>up and they don't use their stomach and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their diaphragm a lot when you put one </v>

2556
01:46:11.741 --> 01:46:13.610
<v Speaker 3>in front of their face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have that option.</v>

2557
01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:16.370
<v Speaker 3>And so they learned to breathe their </v>
<v Speaker 3>belly and user diaphragm.</v>

2558
01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I just didn't give him the time </v>

2559
01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 3>of day because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>training mass doesn't work,</v>

2560
01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 3>elevation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

2561
01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:22.860
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

2562
01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2563
01:46:24.441 --> 01:46:29.441
<v Speaker 3>that's not how you were using it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the benefit of breathing through </v>

2564
01:46:29.441 --> 01:46:32.440
<v Speaker 3>the diaphragm with a mask on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the mask that's important is </v>

2565
01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:36.491
<v Speaker 3>the fact that it would use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a quick way to identify if you're </v>

2566
01:46:36.491 --> 01:46:39.050
<v Speaker 3>bringing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you figured out it's like a white </v>

2567
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:41.390
<v Speaker 3>belt boss route and has some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing device.</v>

2568
01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:42.780
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2569
01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.750
<v Speaker 3>he was telling me about some studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they did with it was showed.</v>

2570
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Was it you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was mine.</v>

2571
01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>

2572
01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:49.350
<v Speaker 3>My lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2573
01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:54.360
<v Speaker 3>what he was saying is that what makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>his better is that it's easy to breathe </v>

2574
01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:58.380
<v Speaker 3>out the valve open so you can exhale </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good dump your carbon dioxide.</v>

2575
01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:02.130
<v Speaker 3>Whereas other ones that have just </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller holes are not as good.</v>

2576
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:04.170
<v Speaker 3>So we did that study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2577
01:47:04.171 --> 01:47:09.171
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is actually what turned me on </v>

2578
01:47:09.171 --> 01:47:12.170
<v Speaker 3>to brian initially because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my boss came to me with the o two </v>

2579
01:47:12.170 --> 01:47:12.170
<v Speaker 3>trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2580
01:47:12.170 --> 01:47:14.520
<v Speaker 3>like this stuff doesn't work bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns out it does.</v>

2581
01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:17.160
<v Speaker 3>But here's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2582
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:22.560
<v Speaker 3>so his device restricts airflow in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can change the setting so it can</v>

2583
01:47:22.561 --> 01:47:25.080
<v Speaker 3>be a lot of restriction or a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of restriction.</v>

2584
01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.370
<v Speaker 3>He has lIke filters that you put on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So right there boss route and yeah,</v>

2585
01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:31.740
<v Speaker 3>the o two trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2586
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all those little valves on the left </v>

2587
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.910
<v Speaker 3>and right hand side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're thick.</v>

2588
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:37.220
<v Speaker 3>TheY have increased airflow or decrease </v>
<v Speaker 3>airflow.</v>

2589
01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:42.230
<v Speaker 3>So what we did is we had people come in </v>
<v Speaker 3>four times and they either got the </v>

2590
01:47:42.230 --> 01:47:42.840
<v Speaker 3>height restriction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low restriction,</v>

2591
01:47:42.841 --> 01:47:44.340
<v Speaker 3>medium restriction or no restriction.</v>

2592
01:47:44.970 --> 01:47:49.860
<v Speaker 3>And what we saw is in every person under</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those,</v>

2593
01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:50.670
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me back up.</v>

2594
01:47:50.890 --> 01:47:55.890
<v Speaker 3>They came in and either they did some </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing drills like blowing it out,</v>

2595
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:58.290
<v Speaker 3>inhaling as hard as they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing it out.</v>

2596
01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:02.550
<v Speaker 3>And they did that 30 times and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>did basically a vo two max test.</v>

2597
01:48:02.610 --> 01:48:07.610
<v Speaker 3>So they ran to exhaustion which took </v>
<v Speaker 3>them five to eight minutes kind of </v>

2598
01:48:07.610 --> 01:48:10.251
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we want to see like I was interested </v>

2599
01:48:10.251 --> 01:48:12.771
<v Speaker 3>in performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like does this actually make me perform </v>

2600
01:48:12.771 --> 01:48:15.351
<v Speaker 3>better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they either got a lot of </v>

2601
01:48:15.351 --> 01:48:15.351
<v Speaker 3>restriction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little restriction medium or none.</v>

2602
01:48:15.351 --> 01:48:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Every single person got substantially </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

2603
01:48:17.611 --> 01:48:21.480
<v Speaker 3>like 20 to 30 percent better under one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the conditions,</v>

2604
01:48:22.410 --> 01:48:25.080
<v Speaker 3>but they also got worse under one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions as well.</v>

2605
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:29.820
<v Speaker 3>So what that told us was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if for example,</v>

2606
01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:34.410
<v Speaker 3>you went under the high restriction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're like you can't get any aaron.</v>

2607
01:48:34.890 --> 01:48:39.890
<v Speaker 3>It actually fatigued your intercostals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are the muscles between your ribs </v>

2608
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:42.570
<v Speaker 3>that open up your ribs and allow airflow</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the diaphragm.</v>

2609
01:48:42.571 --> 01:48:45.180
<v Speaker 3>and those got fatigued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you did your performance,</v>

2610
01:48:45.181 --> 01:48:46.920
<v Speaker 3>you got slower because you were already </v>
<v Speaker 3>gassed.</v>

2611
01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:53.220
<v Speaker 3>But if you had really strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>intercostals the lower,</v>

2612
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:58.550
<v Speaker 3>so the real open valve wasn't enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>resistance to actually caused those </v>

2613
01:48:58.550 --> 01:49:01.710
<v Speaker 3>muscles to warm up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that didn't help your performance.</v>

2614
01:49:02.490 --> 01:49:07.490
<v Speaker 3>So what we found is my point here </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically is the individualization of </v>

2615
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:08.220
<v Speaker 3>the approach here is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really important.</v>

2616
01:49:08.221 --> 01:49:09.780
<v Speaker 3>So there's something there for all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

2617
01:49:09.781 --> 01:49:12.690
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to have to titrate out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might need heavy,</v>

2618
01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:17.990
<v Speaker 3>you might need light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might need middle and one of those </v>

2619
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:17.990
<v Speaker 3>situations might actually make it worse </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

2620
01:49:18.330 --> 01:49:23.330
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual variability is the </v>

2621
01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:24.981
<v Speaker 3>important point there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would You figure out which one you </v>

2622
01:49:24.981 --> 01:49:27.261
<v Speaker 3>needed a performance test and what kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of performance sets would use in this </v>

2623
01:49:27.261 --> 01:49:27.261
<v Speaker 3>project?</v>

2624
01:49:27.261 --> 01:49:31.850
<v Speaker 3>You can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say I'm going to run a mile and </v>

2625
01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:33.561
<v Speaker 3>a half and recording my time and put </v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing in your mouth as you're </v>

2626
01:49:33.561 --> 01:49:34.200
<v Speaker 3>running or as your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As your warmup as your warm.</v>

2627
01:49:34.201 --> 01:49:39.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you sit there and you put it in your </v>

2628
01:49:39.201 --> 01:49:39.201
<v Speaker 3>mouth and you do you just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you only use it to do drills.</v>

2629
01:49:39.201 --> 01:49:42.420
<v Speaker 3>You don'T necessarily use it to actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>work out the vast majority of the time.</v>

2630
01:49:42.421 --> 01:49:45.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what I recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do it in your workout,</v>

2631
01:49:45.410 --> 01:49:48.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would be for different reasons.</v>

2632
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:50.830
<v Speaker 3>So when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you recommend doing?</v>

2633
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Like say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say if I got an o two trainer,</v>

2634
01:49:52.811 --> 01:49:57.811
<v Speaker 3>I've put it in like what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>workouts am I doing with this thing in </v>

2635
01:49:57.811 --> 01:49:57.811
<v Speaker 3>my mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I?</v>

2636
01:49:57.811 --> 01:49:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Or breathing exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2637
01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:03.300
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hate this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably some of your fans getting </v>

2638
01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:05.341
<v Speaker 3>irritated by now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it depends on the goal of the </v>

2639
01:50:05.341 --> 01:50:05.341
<v Speaker 3>workout.</v>

2640
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:08.920
<v Speaker 3>So if the goal of the workout is to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best score possible,</v>

2641
01:50:09.010 --> 01:50:14.010
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you do probably 30 or 40 breaths </v>

2642
01:50:14.010 --> 01:50:15.340
<v Speaker 3>with the optimal resistance feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2643
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:20.430
<v Speaker 3>But at the point of the workout is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually improve the strength of the </v>

2644
01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:24.990
<v Speaker 3>diaphragm and go then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you put yourself in sub optimal </v>

2645
01:50:24.990 --> 01:50:28.231
<v Speaker 3>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right back to what I said at the </v>

2646
01:50:28.231 --> 01:50:29.631
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adapting or optimizing a different </v>

2647
01:50:29.631 --> 01:50:29.800
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the muscles in between the ribs,</v>

2648
01:50:29.801 --> 01:50:31.590
<v Speaker 3>can you actually strengthen those to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>point where.</v>

2649
01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:34.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a huge issue with guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting injured.</v>

2650
01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can strengthen those with that o two</v>

2651
01:50:36.371 --> 01:50:41.371
<v Speaker 3>trainer with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one mechanism that you can do it </v>

2652
01:50:41.371 --> 01:50:42.400
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have done a.</v>

2653
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:44.620
<v Speaker 3>You've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've had wim hof on,</v>

2654
01:50:44.621 --> 01:50:44.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2655
01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:49.840
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've been working with for couple of </v>

2656
01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:49.930
<v Speaker 3>years now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so doing initial stuff with him and it's</v>

2657
01:50:49.931 --> 01:50:54.931
<v Speaker 3>very clear like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can mess with a lot of different </v>

2658
01:50:54.931 --> 01:50:56.110
<v Speaker 3>breathing protocols and get you a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediate and delayed.</v>

2659
01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:59.110
<v Speaker 3>sorry brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one more time.</v>

2660
01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had his conversation with jon jones </v>

2661
01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:05.640
<v Speaker 3>on wednesday before the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First time that ever met someone,</v>

2662
01:51:05.650 --> 01:51:10.650
<v Speaker 3>put them in contact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian put them through some of these </v>

2663
01:51:10.650 --> 01:51:12.601
<v Speaker 3>breathing protocols.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they hung up the phone or as </v>

2664
01:51:12.601 --> 01:51:12.601
<v Speaker 3>soon as they are done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don was like,</v>

2665
01:51:12.601 --> 01:51:12.730
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you fly down here on saturday?</v>

2666
01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Flew them down that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had I'm in his corner,</v>

2667
01:51:14.981 --> 01:51:19.981
<v Speaker 3>walked him all the way down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was right next to probably you and dana </v>

2668
01:51:19.981 --> 01:51:22.840
<v Speaker 3>are when he's doing all the things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like this is how impactful some of </v>

2669
01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:23.380
<v Speaker 3>these breathing things aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our women's was great to get us started.</v>

2670
01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Bosses device was awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the train master work work concepts,</v>

2671
01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:32.400
<v Speaker 3>but now brian has really evolved and </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed and said actually there's a </v>

2672
01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:33.580
<v Speaker 3>bunch of different ways we can do it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has protocols you're going to have to</v>

2673
01:51:33.581 --> 01:51:35.200
<v Speaker 3>ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he is the one that can say like,</v>

2674
01:51:35.201 --> 01:51:40.201
<v Speaker 3>do this for this thing to exactly this </v>
<v Speaker 3>way for this thing and you this </v>

2675
01:51:40.201 --> 01:51:40.201
<v Speaker 3>adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want this effect.</v>

2676
01:51:40.201 --> 01:51:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has it all dialed in.</v>

2677
01:51:41.230 --> 01:51:46.230
<v Speaker 3>I go to a cryo chamber cryotherapy place</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you put a surgical mask on your </v>

2678
01:51:47.261 --> 01:51:50.920
<v Speaker 3>mom's and your whole body's immersed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a below the neck.</v>

2679
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2680
01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I use the wim hof breathing </v>

2681
01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:00.031
<v Speaker 3>method,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like somebody made it 50 </v>

2682
01:52:00.031 --> 01:52:00.031
<v Speaker 3>degrees warmer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ways.</v>

2683
01:52:00.031 --> 01:52:04.000
<v Speaker 3>And I just got back from montauk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent three days and jumping a nice </v>

2684
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:04.000
<v Speaker 3>bass the whole time out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2685
01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:09.120
<v Speaker 3>but we actually have multiple protocols.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's more akin to what some would </v>

2686
01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:10.150
<v Speaker 3>call the breath of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this when you're with dennis said.</v>

2687
01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were at an event out there with laird</v>

2688
01:52:12.101 --> 01:52:14.110

<v Speaker 3>vocabularies and laird hamilton started </v>

2690
01:52:19.111 --> 01:52:22.561
<v Speaker 3>a company called xpt that kind of puts a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of this lifestyle stuff into </v>

2691
01:52:22.561 --> 01:52:24.070
<v Speaker 3>practice and so they put on these live </v>
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>

2692
01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:29.100
<v Speaker 3>They also sent me some of their new </v>
<v Speaker 3>super food stuff that they add to the </v>

2693
01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:29.840
<v Speaker 3>creamer stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

2694
01:52:29.841 --> 01:52:31.000
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2695
01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:34.370
<v Speaker 3>it's a little espresso based powder plus</v>
<v Speaker 3>super star.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's fantastic.</v>

2697
01:52:36.461 --> 01:52:37.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2698
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:40.690
<v Speaker 3>so I've been working with for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of years,</v>

2699
01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:42.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since they got started,</v>

2700
01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:45.290
<v Speaker 3>but we go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do these things and so we can say,</v>

2701
01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:47.390
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get you through the breath of fire</v>

2702
01:52:47.391 --> 01:52:50.060
<v Speaker 3>protocol and you'll feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2703
01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:55.180
<v Speaker 3>you get hot and get warmed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's other ways we can do it that'll </v>

2704
01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:55.180
<v Speaker 3>bring you back down where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2705
01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:55.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a nap.</v>

2706
01:52:56.210 --> 01:52:57.950
<v Speaker 3>There's euphoria ones where you can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2707
01:52:57.951 --> 01:53:02.951
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm on psychedelics right </v>

2708
01:53:02.951 --> 01:53:03.140
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm super high tropic breathing,</v>

2709
01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:06.320
<v Speaker 3>bunch of apnea stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pranayama stuff.</v>

2710
01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:10.220
<v Speaker 3>All of these things can have different </v>
<v Speaker 3>outcomes depending on,</v>

2711
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:11.420
<v Speaker 3>on what you're looking for.</v>

2712
01:53:12.650 --> 01:53:17.650
<v Speaker 3>So they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian has got the system developed now </v>

2713
01:53:17.650 --> 01:53:17.650
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2714
01:53:17.650 --> 01:53:17.880
<v Speaker 3>that's what he did was john the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>one he did,</v>

2715
01:53:17.881 --> 01:53:19.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like 10:00</v>

2716
01:53:19.281 --> 01:53:20.260
<v Speaker 3>at night and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2717
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:21.800
<v Speaker 3>let me relax you to kind of bring it </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

2718
01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:22.850
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2719
01:53:22.851 --> 01:53:23.750
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then he's like,</v>

2720
01:53:23.751 --> 01:53:25.060
<v Speaker 3>actually got to go train right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2721
01:53:25.061 --> 01:53:26.290
<v Speaker 3>can you give me back up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a garden.</v>

2722
01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Let's go back the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of backup.</v>

2723
01:53:29.650 --> 01:53:34.650
<v Speaker 3>So is there any benefit stuff too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm using those breathing techniques </v>

2724
01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:38.150
<v Speaker 3>versus an o two trainer or is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>different situations?</v>

2725
01:53:38.210 --> 01:53:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Its situation based.</v>

2726
01:53:39.591 --> 01:53:44.591
<v Speaker 3>There's things I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you mentioned what boss says of the </v>

2727
01:53:44.591 --> 01:53:47.741
<v Speaker 3>opening valve at the end of the o two </v>
<v Speaker 3>trainer and allows you to dump out </v>

2728
01:53:47.741 --> 01:53:47.741
<v Speaker 3>carbon dioxide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2729
01:53:47.741 --> 01:53:49.220
<v Speaker 3>The training masks for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't.</v>

2730
01:53:49.730 --> 01:53:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not right or wrong,</v>

2731
01:53:51.561 --> 01:53:54.050
<v Speaker 3>it's just depending on what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking to do,</v>

2732
01:53:54.051 --> 01:53:59.051
<v Speaker 3>because one thing you can train your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body to do is how well do you perform </v>

2733
01:53:59.051 --> 01:54:00.380
<v Speaker 3>when you generated a bunch of carbon </v>
<v Speaker 3>dioxide.</v>

2734
01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:04.010
<v Speaker 3>So carbon dioxide is what actually makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like you want to breathe,</v>

2735
01:54:04.670 --> 01:54:05.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not lack of oxygen,</v>

2736
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:07.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2737
01:54:07.071 --> 01:54:12.071
<v Speaker 3>So I can put you in a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a bunch of carbon dioxide build </v>

2738
01:54:12.071 --> 01:54:16.331
<v Speaker 3>up and if I don't let you dump it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to fatigue a lot </v>

2739
01:54:16.331 --> 01:54:17.990
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not necessarily a bad thing.</v>

2740
01:54:18.110 --> 01:54:20.720
<v Speaker 3>You could learn to then deal with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of fatigue,</v>

2741
01:54:20.770 --> 01:54:25.770
<v Speaker 3>deer with it mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically as well as </v>

2742
01:54:25.770 --> 01:54:25.880
<v Speaker 3>physiologically there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptations.</v>

2743
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:29.570
<v Speaker 3>So because of the fact that your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>has more carbon dioxide in the system,</v>

2744
01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:34.980
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body adapts to process that carbon </v>

2745
01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:37.571
<v Speaker 3>dioxide more efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This would be the assumption like you </v>

2746
01:54:37.571 --> 01:54:37.571
<v Speaker 3>have to be scientifically shown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2747
01:54:37.571 --> 01:54:38.380
<v Speaker 3>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2748
01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:40.370
<v Speaker 3>where we were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the thought process.</v>

2749
01:54:41.130 --> 01:54:43.130
<v Speaker 3>You can feel this intuitively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2750
01:54:43.131 --> 01:54:43.810
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2751
01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:46.580
<v Speaker 3>and it's also a way for us to get a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of training volume in,</v>

2752
01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:52.100
<v Speaker 3>or sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of cardiovascular training in </v>

2753
01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:52.730
<v Speaker 3>because your heart rate goes way up </v>
<v Speaker 3>without actually doing a lot of physical</v>

2754
01:54:52.731 --> 01:54:53.150
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2755
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:56.750
<v Speaker 3>And so for mma guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we're looking for sometimes</v>

2756
01:54:56.751 --> 01:55:01.751
<v Speaker 3>because of physical work and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>training camps so high we can't add any </v>

2757
01:55:01.751 --> 01:55:02.120
<v Speaker 3>more volume to them is going to beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>them up.</v>

2758
01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:04.970
<v Speaker 3>SO now we can get them a cardiovascular </v>
<v Speaker 3>workout in.</v>

2759
01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:07.490
<v Speaker 3>That's easy on the joints and ligaments </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the bones.</v>

2760
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:13.510
<v Speaker 3>So the other approach would be dump all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ceo two or do other things like </v>

2761
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:16.520
<v Speaker 3>nasal breathing only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the whole workout you're only allowed</v>

2762
01:55:16.521 --> 01:55:18.980
<v Speaker 3>to breathe through your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you breathe through your nose,</v>

2763
01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:23.060
<v Speaker 3>It actually can release nitric oxide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a basal dilator.</v>

2764
01:55:24.110 --> 01:55:25.670
<v Speaker 3>So this is why when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only,</v>

2765
01:55:25.671 --> 01:55:27.320
<v Speaker 3>when you breathe through your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only,</v>

2766
01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:29.180
<v Speaker 3>but especially when you breathe through </v>
<v Speaker 3>your nose,</v>

2767
01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:34.660
<v Speaker 3>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does your body produce more nitric </v>

2768
01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:34.660
<v Speaker 3>oxide when you breathe through your </v>
<v Speaker 3>nose?</v>

2769
01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2770
01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:39.290
<v Speaker 3>That's weird because you would think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that just breathing wim hoff.</v>

2771
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:42.790
<v Speaker 3>I was asking him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just anywhere.</v>

2772
01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he always says like any hole,</v>

2773
01:55:45.061 --> 01:55:46.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2774
01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:49.590
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women's not wrong or anything like that,</v>

2775
01:55:49.591 --> 01:55:54.591
<v Speaker 3>but a whimsy style is great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's many styles is the point I </v>

2776
01:55:54.871 --> 01:55:56.490
<v Speaker 3>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he'S great.</v>

2777
01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:59.430
<v Speaker 3>We've done some science stuff together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do you feel about saunas?</v>

2778
01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing benefits their potential,</v>

2779
01:56:03.091 --> 01:56:06.210
<v Speaker 3>but there's no free passes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiology.</v>

2780
01:56:06.810 --> 01:56:09.010
<v Speaker 3>So when you get something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably coming to the compromise</v>

2781
01:56:09.011 --> 01:56:11.250
<v Speaker 3>that something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would the compromise be when you do</v>

2782
01:56:11.251 --> 01:56:14.820
<v Speaker 3>a sauna to know we just don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough evidence on this stuff.</v>

2783
01:56:14.821 --> 01:56:16.950
<v Speaker 3>We know we focused on the heat shock </v>
<v Speaker 3>proteins.</v>

2784
01:56:16.951 --> 01:56:18.930
<v Speaker 3>That's like everyone knows about those </v>
<v Speaker 3>by now.</v>

2785
01:56:19.630 --> 01:56:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to deal with a uncomfort,</v>

2786
01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:25.320
<v Speaker 3>fatigue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of stuff.</v>

2787
01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:27.990
<v Speaker 3>The difficult is when you run a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific study,</v>

2788
01:56:27.991 --> 01:56:29.640
<v Speaker 3>you get one or two or three variables.</v>

2789
01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:31.320
<v Speaker 3>You don't get a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2790
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:34.050
<v Speaker 3>So we focused on the one or two that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2791
01:56:34.051 --> 01:56:35.610
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is moving something here.</v>

2792
01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:41.840
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the example we went over with </v>

2793
01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:41.840
<v Speaker 3>the cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2794
01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:41.840
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2795
01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:42.360
<v Speaker 3>it's great for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or actually it's terrible.</v>

2796
01:56:42.361 --> 01:56:47.361
<v Speaker 3>And people say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to make blanket statements </v>

2797
01:56:47.361 --> 01:56:47.361
<v Speaker 3>like heats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good or cold is good or bad.</v>

2798
01:56:47.361 --> 01:56:48.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we study it more,</v>

2799
01:56:48.181 --> 01:56:53.181
<v Speaker 3>we start to finding out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually it's good for this and </v>

2800
01:56:53.181 --> 01:56:53.181
<v Speaker 3>it's good for this and it's bad for that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that and that and that.</v>

2801
01:56:53.181 --> 01:56:54.930
<v Speaker 3>So we'd have to assume someone would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way.</v>

2802
01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:58.560
<v Speaker 3>There has to be consequences to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just depends on application.</v>

2803
01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:02.250
<v Speaker 3>But there's gotta be some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits in terms of recovery.</v>

2804
01:57:02.251 --> 01:57:07.251
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that someone should do </v>

2805
01:57:07.251 --> 01:57:07.600
<v Speaker 3>maybe like cryo one day sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neck?</v>

2806
01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Should they do them in the same day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like so for example,</v>

2807
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:15.470
<v Speaker 3>a fighter in camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I generally don't go out of my way to </v>

2808
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.470
<v Speaker 3>recommend sauna because they already get</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hot and training.</v>

2809
01:57:16.110 --> 01:57:17.970
<v Speaker 3>You're grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're doing stuff,</v>

2810
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.000
<v Speaker 3>they're getting heat shock protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go to hot yoga in </v>

2811
01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.571
<v Speaker 3>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this study they're doing right </v>

2812
01:57:26.571 --> 01:57:26.571
<v Speaker 3>now at harvard apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2813
01:57:26.571 --> 01:57:27.630
<v Speaker 3>somebody was telling me about it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other day where they're,</v>

2814
01:57:27.631 --> 01:57:32.631
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're concentrating on hot yoga and </v>

2815
01:57:32.631 --> 01:57:32.970
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of hot yoga and heat shock </v>
<v Speaker 3>proteins.</v>

2816
01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they're gonna find a lot like </v>

2817
01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:38.020
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty.</v>

2818
01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:38.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean that ship's sailed a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're,</v>

2819
01:57:38.821 --> 01:57:40.890
<v Speaker 3>we're confident something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of detail to workout,</v>

2820
01:57:40.891 --> 01:57:43.580
<v Speaker 3>but something's going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably something similar to sauna.</v>

2821
01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:48.360
<v Speaker 3>So I generally say for people like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like me,</v>

2822
01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:52.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't go out of my way to do too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>sauna work because of the way I train.</v>

2823
01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:57.680
<v Speaker 3>I get really hot and sometimes we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>train specifically with a little bit </v>

2824
01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.590
<v Speaker 3>more clothing sometimes and get kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2825
01:57:58.591 --> 01:58:03.591
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of sitting in a sauna for 45 </v>

2826
01:58:03.591 --> 01:58:05.091
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me wear a little bit extra clothing </v>

2827
01:58:05.091 --> 01:58:05.091
<v Speaker 3>during my training session and get real </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot dr.</v>

2828
01:58:05.091 --> 01:58:09.210
<v Speaker 3>But for the average people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a fantastic modality </v>

2829
01:58:09.210 --> 01:58:11.010
<v Speaker 3>because there may be only working out </v>
<v Speaker 3>once a week or less,</v>

2830
01:58:11.490 --> 01:58:13.200
<v Speaker 3>and you gave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get them hot and we can actually</v>

2831
01:58:13.201 --> 01:58:17.940
<v Speaker 3>work on those health benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While we're building good quality habits</v>

2832
01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:20.530
<v Speaker 3>and we can eventually lead them down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>path to more exercise.</v>

2833
01:58:20.650 --> 01:58:22.790
<v Speaker 3>And emmanuel stewart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he used to run the crump.</v>

2834
01:58:22.791 --> 01:58:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2835
01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:27.300
<v Speaker 3>he used to crank the temperature of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gym over 100 degrees.</v>

2836
01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:32.500
<v Speaker 3>that was his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he wanted guys to box like in </v>

2837
01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:32.940
<v Speaker 3>essentially like a hot yoga room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2838
01:58:32.941 --> 01:58:36.660
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of things too that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>done a lot of that in my life and I used</v>

2839
01:58:36.661 --> 01:58:37.110
<v Speaker 3>to hate it.</v>

2840
01:58:37.530 --> 01:58:42.530
<v Speaker 3>We used to just fight for the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like wait for the round to go over </v>

2841
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:42.530
<v Speaker 3>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling practice theory.</v>

2842
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:44.710
<v Speaker 3>So it really has to mma with it all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2843
01:58:44.711 --> 01:58:47.680
<v Speaker 3>And like the problem was it was scary </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the floor is water.</v>

2844
01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:48.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

2845
01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2846
01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:51.490
<v Speaker 3>you're terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>

2847
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.900
<v Speaker 3>He was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hated it.</v>

2848
01:58:52.930 --> 01:58:55.150
<v Speaker 3>That's real bad for kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skip those practices.</v>

2849
01:58:55.210 --> 01:58:57.240
<v Speaker 3>A logical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2850
01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:59.970
<v Speaker 3>but so example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2851
01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:01.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>needed.</v>

2852
01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:05.020
<v Speaker 3>What the exception of one time when pat </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes fought in Brazil,</v>

2853
01:59:05.021 --> 01:59:08.080
<v Speaker 3>it was like 110 outside and it was 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent humidity or something.</v>

2854
01:59:08.081 --> 01:59:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Which fight was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2855
01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:11.230
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2856
01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:13.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2857
01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:14.920
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that fight?</v>

2858
01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:16.180
<v Speaker 3>It was outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2859
01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:17.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was indoors,</v>

2860
01:59:17.561 --> 01:59:19.180
<v Speaker 3>but if everything was open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2861
01:59:19.181 --> 01:59:21.040
<v Speaker 3>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So super,</v>

2862
01:59:21.041 --> 01:59:26.041
<v Speaker 3>super hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we didn't train for that or </v>

2863
01:59:26.041 --> 01:59:28.051
<v Speaker 3>anticipate that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could see if you knew you're </v>

2864
01:59:28.051 --> 01:59:28.051
<v Speaker 3>fighting in a venue like that.</v>

2865
01:59:28.051 --> 01:59:32.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they used to do in bodog and Costa </v>

2866
01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Rica and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2867
01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:32.260
<v Speaker 3>they would fight on the beach dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2868
01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:33.490
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just horrid outside.</v>

2869
01:59:33.491 --> 01:59:34.600
<v Speaker 3>So you could say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2870
01:59:34.601 --> 01:59:36.070
<v Speaker 3>in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's needed,</v>

2871
01:59:36.071 --> 01:59:41.071
<v Speaker 3>but you're fighting in vegas or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something indoors and maybe we don't </v>

2872
01:59:41.321 --> 01:59:42.830
<v Speaker 3>need it for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2873
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:45.730
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>implement it once or twice.</v>

2874
01:59:46.450 --> 01:59:48.250
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't go on my way to do it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2875
01:59:48.251 --> 01:59:50.510
<v Speaker 3>So it wouldn't be a daily thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2876
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:54.250
<v Speaker 3>because what's gonna happen is you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to compromise performance.</v>

2877
01:59:54.730 --> 01:59:59.730
<v Speaker 3>A pacing is a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bisping's a great example of this to </v>

2878
01:59:59.730 --> 02:00:01.180
<v Speaker 3>dennis was a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you fight an environment like that,</v>

2879
02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:06.480
<v Speaker 3>your pace and the amount of output you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do is going to slow way down in the </v>

2880
02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:06.480
<v Speaker 3>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2881
02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:11.450
<v Speaker 3>It can be hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're to gas out and then when you go </v>

2882
02:00:11.450 --> 02:00:11.450
<v Speaker 3>to fight and your fight and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperature controlled,</v>

2883
02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:13.270
<v Speaker 3>you're not used to that pace.</v>

2884
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:16.900
<v Speaker 3>So if you're used to fighting at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pace that it takes for you to sustain 10</v>

2885
02:00:16.901 --> 02:00:21.901
<v Speaker 3>rounds of sparring and the gym at 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 degrees and then we come in and you </v>

2886
02:00:21.901 --> 02:00:21.901
<v Speaker 3>and I fight and I'm ready to go with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2887
02:00:21.901 --> 02:00:26.580
<v Speaker 3>You're not ready for that pace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not that you don't physically </v>

2888
02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:26.580
<v Speaker 3>have the conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're just like,</v>

2889
02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:28.950
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not skies and you know,</v>

2890
02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:33.960
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to be careful of training </v>

2891
02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:33.960
<v Speaker 3>too far outside of what you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna encounter.</v>

2892
02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2893
02:00:35.010 --> 02:00:40.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these guys run into those </v>

2894
02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:41.131
<v Speaker 3>problems when they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to spar 10 rounds so that I </v>

2895
02:00:41.131 --> 02:00:41.131
<v Speaker 3>can go five easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2896
02:00:41.131 --> 02:00:45.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But your pace for your five is way </v>

2897
02:00:45.570 --> 02:00:47.761
<v Speaker 3>different than your pastry or 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to be careful there a lot of</v>

2898
02:00:49.091 --> 02:00:49.930
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2899
02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:50.740
<v Speaker 3>physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2900
02:00:50.770 --> 02:00:52.360
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is part of the problem,</v>

2901
02:00:52.361 --> 02:00:52.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2902
02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:57.720
<v Speaker 3>That there are so many variables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are so many questions that there </v>

2903
02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:57.720
<v Speaker 3>is no real definitive protocol to </v>
<v Speaker 3>follow.</v>

2904
02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:59.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a bunch of different ones.</v>

2905
02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:04.200
<v Speaker 3>The pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I always say it is the truth is </v>

2906
02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:08.611
<v Speaker 3>mostly a lack of perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you think that you are on some </v>

2907
02:01:08.770 --> 02:01:13.770
<v Speaker 3>unbreakable truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because you haven't looked at it </v>

2908
02:01:13.770 --> 02:01:15.340
<v Speaker 3>from a big enough perspective for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most part.</v>

2909
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:16.100
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2910
02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:21.300
<v Speaker 3>And there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put it this way and I'm in </v>

2911
02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:24.340
<v Speaker 3>biological truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's almost always true in physics.</v>

2912
02:01:24.341 --> 02:01:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Truth of that's a lot less true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're pretty sure gravity is real,</v>

2913
02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:30.060
<v Speaker 3>like we're pretty sure and we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanically,</v>

2914
02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:31.780
<v Speaker 3>water's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure.</v>

2915
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now quantum mechanic physically,</v>

2916
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:35.710
<v Speaker 3>those get kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2917
02:01:35.711 --> 02:01:40.711
<v Speaker 3>But for the most part that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But science in terms of biological or </v>

2918
02:01:40.711 --> 02:01:42.350
<v Speaker 3>medical is a lot less true.</v>

2919
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:44.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean how many times we have to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2920
02:01:44.271 --> 02:01:45.320
<v Speaker 3>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is true,</v>

2921
02:01:45.321 --> 02:01:46.760
<v Speaker 3>this is true for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oops.</v>

2922
02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:49.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this all fun for you,</v>

2923
02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:49.640
<v Speaker 3>do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2924
02:01:49.641 --> 02:01:51.560
<v Speaker 3>it seems like you're very passionate </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

2925
02:01:51.561 --> 02:01:53.840
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also seems like wow,</v>

2926
02:01:53.841 --> 02:01:58.100
<v Speaker 3>it can become stressful having so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>variables and possibilities and I don't,</v>

2927
02:01:58.150 --> 02:01:59.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't think stress is even close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2928
02:01:59.870 --> 02:02:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I would say 99 percent fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's stress for me in terms of I </v>

2929
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:06.620
<v Speaker 3>don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it would break my heart if I gave</v>

2930
02:02:06.621 --> 02:02:08.300
<v Speaker 3>someone the wrong advice and it ruined </v>
<v Speaker 3>their career.</v>

2931
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:13.060
<v Speaker 3>Like that would be the stress stress in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of being right or like saying that</v>

2932
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:15.080
<v Speaker 3>much some stuff and being proved I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>care about that at all.</v>

2933
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's an issue with a lot of </v>

2934
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.470
<v Speaker 3>trainers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2935
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Were they given bad advice and.</v>

2936
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see it play out in a fight.</v>

2937
02:02:22.670 --> 02:02:27.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the reasons I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to do a lot of professional </v>

2938
02:02:27.670 --> 02:02:31.001
<v Speaker 3>athletes in other sports or because </v>
<v Speaker 3>other ones I gave that almost up </v>

2939
02:02:31.001 --> 02:02:34.571
<v Speaker 3>entirely and I gave up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done some actors and things like </v>

2940
02:02:34.571 --> 02:02:34.571
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I generally stay away from that.</v>

2941
02:02:34.571 --> 02:02:38.240
<v Speaker 3>Even though the money is far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far higher for me and those things,</v>

2942
02:02:39.230 --> 02:02:41.690
<v Speaker 3>but I did it because like these mma </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>

2943
02:02:41.691 --> 02:02:46.691
<v Speaker 3>like I have a real passion for someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's going to put all that on the line </v>

2944
02:02:46.691 --> 02:02:50.380
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to risk everything and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to go out there and that </v>

2945
02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:50.690
<v Speaker 3>is more exciting to me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fun,</v>

2946
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:54.560
<v Speaker 3>a really fun investment in me and it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth me investing my emotion.</v>

2947
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when helen won a golden reel,</v>

2948
02:02:57.171 --> 02:02:58.190
<v Speaker 3>like I just lost it.</v>

2949
02:02:58.190 --> 02:03:00.710
<v Speaker 3>Like emotionally I was like gone for </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>

2950
02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:03.740
<v Speaker 3>like just exhausted because I invested </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much into that.</v>

2951
02:03:03.741 --> 02:03:08.741
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do that for somebody so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can make an extra million on </v>

2952
02:03:08.741 --> 02:03:09.500
<v Speaker 3>top of that 30 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't motivate me that much.</v>

2953
02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:12.560
<v Speaker 3>So I like working with these folks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so because of that,</v>

2954
02:03:12.561 --> 02:03:13.840
<v Speaker 3>like it breaks my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're like,</v>

2955
02:03:13.870 --> 02:03:18.870
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gave up everything for this kind of </v>

2956
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:20.750
<v Speaker 3>living and the best outcome for you was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you made 20 instead of 10 k and </v>

2957
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:26.830
<v Speaker 3>then I lost that for you because I gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>you really bad rehydration advice for </v>

2958
02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:28.970
<v Speaker 3>something that's a stress for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the rest of the stuff man,</v>

2959
02:03:28.971 --> 02:03:33.971
<v Speaker 3>like it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's invigorating for me to continue to </v>

2960
02:03:33.971 --> 02:03:33.971
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we,</v>

2961
02:03:33.971 --> 02:03:36.560
<v Speaker 3>we answered that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now we don't know this oR this.</v>

2962
02:03:36.561 --> 02:03:41.561
<v Speaker 3>Like it's continual progress and and by </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I take karl popper stance on this </v>

2963
02:03:41.561 --> 02:03:45.170
<v Speaker 3>one in terms of like science is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>about identifying truth.</v>

2964
02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:49.400
<v Speaker 3>It's reducing uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to put it.</v>

2965
02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:50.630
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2966
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:53.030
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could take credit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good way to put it.</v>

2967
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:55.880
<v Speaker 3>So we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get closer and we know more of,</v>

2968
02:03:55.881 --> 02:04:00.881
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know this is not as an but we're </v>

2969
02:04:00.881 --> 02:04:00.881
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you anticipate a day when we do,</v>

2970
02:04:00.881 --> 02:04:05.320
<v Speaker 3>like when it comes to bio mechanics are </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some things that I would be </v>

2971
02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:07.640
<v Speaker 3>confident in saying like basically we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that this is true,</v>

2972
02:04:07.641 --> 02:04:11.510
<v Speaker 3>now you need to drink water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like basically say that that's true.</v>

2973
02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:13.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to have a lot of it,</v>

2974
02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:18.580
<v Speaker 3>like the verY standard stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then those are things I'm comfortable </v>

2975
02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:19.310
<v Speaker 3>saying this is basically true and as we </v>
<v Speaker 3>go on,</v>

2976
02:04:19.311 --> 02:04:22.850
<v Speaker 3>we only keep adding to that list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>SO more things get piled on.</v>

2977
02:04:22.851 --> 02:04:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Now we know for a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had told this story also on my podcast</v>

2978
02:04:26.661 --> 02:04:30.770
<v Speaker 3>about the history of strength </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning and how it went from the 19</v>

2979
02:04:30.771 --> 02:04:31.940
<v Speaker 3>hundreds to where it is now.</v>

2980
02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:38.020
<v Speaker 3>And the quick story is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy named peter [inaudible] </v>

2981
02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:38.670
<v Speaker 3>who was a scientist and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely,</v>

2982
02:04:38.671 --> 02:04:43.671
<v Speaker 3>he was the guy who started the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting weights causes you to lose </v>

2983
02:04:43.671 --> 02:04:45.720
<v Speaker 3>flexibility and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad for your health and,</v>

2984
02:04:45.721 --> 02:04:46.650
<v Speaker 3>and all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2985
02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:50.760
<v Speaker 3>This is 1950 2:54,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2986
02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:54.720
<v Speaker 3>And he's a scientist phd and he calls it</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy.</v>

2987
02:04:54.721 --> 02:04:57.360
<v Speaker 3>He gets a guy named bob hoffman is </v>
<v Speaker 3>called in,</v>

2988
02:04:57.370 --> 02:04:59.880
<v Speaker 3>do you remember bob hoffman year from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the generation?</v>

2989
02:04:59.881 --> 02:05:03.750
<v Speaker 3>You may remember york barbell muscle and</v>
<v Speaker 3>strength,</v>

2990
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:06.960
<v Speaker 3>like the magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You may recognize all this stuff,</v>

2991
02:05:07.770 --> 02:05:10.440
<v Speaker 3>but basically there was a show and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

2992
02:05:10.441 --> 02:05:11.890
<v Speaker 3>bring in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these weightlifters,</v>

2993
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:13.380
<v Speaker 3>because back then weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerlifting,</v>

2994
02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:14.820
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilding was all kinda the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2995
02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:18.390
<v Speaker 3>is it bring them in and let's put on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstration.</v>

2996
02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:23.600
<v Speaker 3>And so they bring in all these lifters </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they put on this demonstration in </v>

2997
02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:24.540
<v Speaker 3>front of the whole school in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dr.</v>

2998
02:05:24.630 --> 02:05:25.300
<v Speaker 3>Carpet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kitchen.</v>

2999
02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:28.620
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like,</v>

3000
02:05:28.621 --> 02:05:29.160
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're great.</v>

3001
02:05:29.161 --> 02:05:32.010
<v Speaker 3>They're strong enough athletic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone knoWs like the showdowns coming</v>

3002
02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:34.500
<v Speaker 3>like everyone's there to watch the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everyone is really there to watch,</v>

3003
02:05:34.501 --> 02:05:36.000
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like they are on the internet now.</v>

3004
02:05:36.001 --> 02:05:38.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like let's watch this shit show </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards.</v>

3005
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everyone's done and carpet stands up </v>

3006
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great,</v>

3007
02:05:43.321 --> 02:05:45.420
<v Speaker 3>you're strong and you got a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle and all that.</v>

3008
02:05:45.421 --> 02:05:47.100
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you a question,</v>

3009
02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:50.490
<v Speaker 3>can you scratch your back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was like,</v>

3010
02:05:50.491 --> 02:05:53.610
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know where at like what,</v>

3011
02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:58.840
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he starts scratching both land and </v>

3012
02:05:58.840 --> 02:05:58.840
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he wants to do,</v>

3013
02:05:58.840 --> 02:05:58.840
<v Speaker 3>what do you want me to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drops into a full splits,</v>

3014
02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:03.650
<v Speaker 3>grabs 50 pound dumbbells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does a standing back flip and at this </v>

3015
02:06:03.650 --> 02:06:04.050
<v Speaker 3>point carpets is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3016
02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:08.100
<v Speaker 3>like my entire career is that strength </v>
<v Speaker 3>training is bad for you.</v>

3017
02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:10.620
<v Speaker 3>It's unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You lose flexibility and these dudes the</v>

3018
02:06:10.621 --> 02:06:13.470
<v Speaker 3>strongest in the world just showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only are they not inflexible,</v>

3019
02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:17.130
<v Speaker 3>but they just did a splits there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bodybuilders ring world champions.</v>

3020
02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:20.360
<v Speaker 3>So he was at a crossroads right there in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his career to say like,</v>

3021
02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:25.430
<v Speaker 3>do I admit in front the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how wrong my entire research line </v>

3022
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:26.840
<v Speaker 3>was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do I find some excuse?</v>

3023
02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:28.560
<v Speaker 3>Well you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3024
02:06:28.561 --> 02:06:30.900
<v Speaker 3>he does the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the honorable thing and goes,</v>

3025
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:36.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And change his entire career research </v>

3026
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:40.131
<v Speaker 3>going on to actually studying three </v>
<v Speaker 3>training and of course shows that </v>

3027
02:06:40.131 --> 02:06:40.950
<v Speaker 3>doesn't do any of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do.</v>

3028
02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:46.820
<v Speaker 3>So this is the nature of science is </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're mostly wrong until we actually </v>

3029
02:06:47.311 --> 02:06:49.590
<v Speaker 3>study and then we get less than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less than this wrong.</v>

3030
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:51.960
<v Speaker 3>So that's really where we're at with </v>
<v Speaker 3>with everything.</v>

3031
02:06:51.961 --> 02:06:54.600
<v Speaker 3>That's an easy example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you tell somebody 50 years ago,</v>

3032
02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:57.320
<v Speaker 3>flexibility or strength training makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you inflexible.</v>

3033
02:06:57.321 --> 02:06:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Still like,</v>

3034
02:06:57.700 --> 02:07:02.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they look at this </v>

3035
02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:02.700
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this study.</v>

3036
02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:02.700
<v Speaker 2>They used to be an issue with boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3037
02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:06.161
<v Speaker 2>They used to always say boxers should </v>
<v Speaker 2>never strength trained till vendor </v>

3038
02:07:06.161 --> 02:07:09.041
<v Speaker 2>holyfield came along with mackie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll stone right and won the title as </v>

3039
02:07:09.041 --> 02:07:09.170
<v Speaker 2>a heavier yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3040
02:07:09.230 --> 02:07:10.340
<v Speaker 2>the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks great.</v>

3041
02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy huge.</v>

3042
02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:16.960
<v Speaker 2>He was pulling like walking out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom by himself and he had like a </v>

3043
02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:16.960
<v Speaker 2>cell phone up to his ear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm on the phone,</v>

3044
02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:21.161
<v Speaker 2>but I think his cellphone was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he just didn't want anybody to talk </v>

3045
02:07:21.161 --> 02:07:21.161
<v Speaker 2>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't blame him.</v>

3046
02:07:21.161 --> 02:07:21.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looked fantastic.</v>

3047
02:07:22.190 --> 02:07:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I just signed a buddy of mine to his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing,</v>

3048
02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:26.840
<v Speaker 2>do you know he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like coach or managing fighters now</v>

3049
02:07:26.841 --> 02:07:27.980
<v Speaker 2>or something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3050
02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:31.080
<v Speaker 2>hopefully not financially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Don't know.</v>

3051
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like buy the biggest house that </v>

3052
02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:37.000
<v Speaker 2>exists.</v>

3053
02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had that fucking stupendous mansion in </v>

3054
02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:42.130
<v Speaker 2>atlanta who was like a hundred and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>rooms or something like that.</v>

3055
02:07:42.170 --> 02:07:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Did you Put that much money in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in sport like that?</v>

3056
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're balling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you and other people were bawling </v>

3057
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.590
<v Speaker 2>and trying to ball harder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to do what you gotta do.</v>

3058
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't think mma is ever caught up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in terms of financially.</v>

3059
02:07:54.190 --> 02:07:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iT's getting close with conor mcgregor,</v>

3060
02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:58.540
<v Speaker 2>but honestly his biggest windfall right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now as a boxing match.</v>

3061
02:07:58.541 --> 02:08:03.250
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about a vendor that's weird is</v>

3062
02:08:03.251 --> 02:08:06.760
<v Speaker 2>that he never got out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked fantastic.</v>

3063
02:08:06.761 --> 02:08:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still fit.</v>

3064
02:08:07.660 --> 02:08:12.660
<v Speaker 2>He's got to be sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus he's one of the rare guys and I </v>

3065
02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:13.330
<v Speaker 2>think he had a fight as recently as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year ago.</v>

3066
02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:14.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3067
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3068
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:20.990

3069
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.880
<v Speaker 2>fight was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really want to say he had a fight like</v>

3070
02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:22.360
<v Speaker 2>a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3071
02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:23.830
<v Speaker 2>that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3072
02:08:23.831 --> 02:08:25.210
<v Speaker 2>but he's okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

3075
02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:32.280
<v Speaker 2>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting bernard.</v>

3076
02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:32.950
<v Speaker 2>THat gets amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3077
02:08:32.951 --> 02:08:35.320
<v Speaker 2>That was a freak incident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3078
02:08:35.321 --> 02:08:38.740
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't they have pads around the ring</v>

3079
02:08:38.741 --> 02:08:41.950
<v Speaker 2>case guys fall through the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't imagine that they didn't.</v>

3080
02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:47.420
<v Speaker 2>They have seen that happen before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys are getting fucked up through that </v>

3081
02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:47.420
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all fight style,</v>

3082
02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:47.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3083
02:08:49.570 --> 02:08:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3084
02:08:50.041 --> 02:08:52.570
<v Speaker 2>But that was lIke a fake charity boxing </v>
<v Speaker 2>match.</v>

3085
02:08:53.770 --> 02:08:55.670
<v Speaker 2>What does it say though in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3086
02:08:55.810 --> 02:09:00.810
<v Speaker 2>when his last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what popped up when I hit last </v>

3087
02:09:00.810 --> 02:09:00.810
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3088
02:09:00.810 --> 02:09:01.320
<v Speaker 2>But that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're lying.</v>

3089
02:09:01.410 --> 02:09:01.820
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3090
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:03.460
<v Speaker 2>just pull up his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3091
02:09:03.490 --> 02:09:08.490
<v Speaker 2>his record wikipedia record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's a wikipedia on evander </v>

3092
02:09:09.731 --> 02:09:14.731
<v Speaker 2>holyfield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian know nielsen a 2011.</v>

3093
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3094
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:18.490
<v Speaker 2>So six years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3095
02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:20.890
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty recently in consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3096
02:09:20.891 --> 02:09:25.891
<v Speaker 2>you know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe he was planning a comeback a </v>

3097
02:09:25.891 --> 02:09:27.790
<v Speaker 2>few years ago and he was having a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard time getting licensed.</v>

3098
02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:29.950
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it was.</v>

3099
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I would still say if you had asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've said 12 years ago.</v>

3100
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Like I would've guessed way longer than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3101
02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3102
02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.160
<v Speaker 2>how old is he now?</v>

3103
02:09:39.730 --> 02:09:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Sixty one and 62.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3104
02:09:43.090 --> 02:09:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3105
02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.250
<v Speaker 2>So 5:55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3106
02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:48.790
<v Speaker 2>So We essentially had his last fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was like,</v>

3107
02:09:48.791 --> 02:09:49.750
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty eight,</v>

3108
02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:51.010
<v Speaker 2>49.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

3109
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>

3110
02:09:53.410 --> 02:09:54.970
<v Speaker 2>That's a stylish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3111
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:57.550
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really remember his that much.</v>

3112
02:09:57.670 --> 02:09:59.230
<v Speaker 2>He didn't take a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he take a lot of shots?</v>

3113
02:09:59.260 --> 02:09:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell yeah.</v>

3114
02:10:00.370 --> 02:10:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Bruiser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3115
02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:04.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean he took some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just had a tremendous chin.</v>

3116
02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:09.040
<v Speaker 2>He just did an unbelievably tough guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and unbelievably fit.</v>

3117
02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:11.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the thing about holy failed was</v>

3118
02:10:11.621 --> 02:10:13.900
<v Speaker 2>that unbelievably fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievably game.</v>

3119
02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Like when he beaT Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first fight,</v>

3120
02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:20.350
<v Speaker 2>like I remember it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Kevin James.</v>

3121
02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Kevin was actually over my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were watching it together.</v>

3122
02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're jumping around screaming like a </v>

3123
02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:28.660
<v Speaker 2>bunch of school girls because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane because nobody saw that comment.</v>

3124
02:10:28.661 --> 02:10:30.550
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3125
02:10:31.110 --> 02:10:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>

3126
02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a career though.</v>

3127
02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he certainly did.</v>

3128
02:10:35.241 --> 02:10:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hope you still got it together upstairs.</v>

3129
02:10:37.281 --> 02:10:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Like that's just a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly is.</v>

3130
02:10:42.370 --> 02:10:43.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

3131
02:10:43.011 --> 02:10:44.570
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what,</v>

3132
02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:46.370
<v Speaker 3>do you ever have that conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fighter?</v>

3133
02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:48.350
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not my role,</v>

3134
02:10:48.650 --> 02:10:53.650
<v Speaker 3>so I don't bring it up at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they asked me on like a friendly </v>

3135
02:10:53.650 --> 02:10:53.650
<v Speaker 3>advice thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3136
02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:55.730
<v Speaker 3>and look at will be very careful with </v>
<v Speaker 3>names here.</v>

3137
02:10:55.731 --> 02:10:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I generally tell them all tO retire,</v>

3138
02:10:59.390 --> 02:11:02.740
<v Speaker 3>like regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my approach is no,</v>

3139
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:05.000
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>

3140
02:11:05.001 --> 02:11:06.950
<v Speaker 3>the risk is not worth the power in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ufc.</v>

3141
02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:09.860
<v Speaker 3>It's just not like there is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>occasional connor,</v>

3142
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:12.740
<v Speaker 3>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the anomaly that proves the rule</v>

3143
02:11:12.741 --> 02:11:17.741
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my advice to all of them is if it's </v>

3144
02:11:17.741 --> 02:11:19.580
<v Speaker 3>not a good investment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is not worth the risk because even if</v>

3145
02:11:19.581 --> 02:11:24.581
<v Speaker 3>you get the wind bonus and the fight of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the night one fight like that is </v>

3146
02:11:24.981 --> 02:11:26.120
<v Speaker 3>potentially years.</v>

3147
02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:28.760
<v Speaker 3>And how much income could You make in </v>
<v Speaker 3>those 10 years of working?</v>

3148
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Probably more than that hundred k.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well in terms of income for sure,</v>

3149
02:11:31.881 --> 02:11:36.881
<v Speaker 3>but for a lot of them it's not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing or not doing it for </v>

3150
02:11:36.881 --> 02:11:36.881
<v Speaker 3>glory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3151
02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:42.040
<v Speaker 3>So I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm taking it from a logical </v>

3152
02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:42.040
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not telling them what to do.</v>

3153
02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:42.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like me as your friend,</v>

3154
02:11:42.831 --> 02:11:45.170
<v Speaker 3>I would love for you to never fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was great,</v>

3155
02:11:45.171 --> 02:11:50.171
<v Speaker 3>but having said that you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let me help you as much as I can to </v>

3156
02:11:50.171 --> 02:11:51.230
<v Speaker 3>get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean you can kind of tell too,</v>

3157
02:11:51.231 --> 02:11:53.650
<v Speaker 3>like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

3158
02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:56.900
<v Speaker 3>if you just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not in that x factor,</v>

3159
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:59.150
<v Speaker 3>charisma wise and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to make that real.</v>

3160
02:11:59.151 --> 02:12:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Like life changing money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just talking about money though.</v>

3161
02:12:01.450 --> 02:12:06.450
<v Speaker 3>In terms of damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you notice in terms of physical </v>

3162
02:12:06.450 --> 02:12:08.180
<v Speaker 3>performance when you're seeing an </v>
<v Speaker 3>athlete move around?</v>

3163
02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:10.490
<v Speaker 3>I haven't gotten to the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven'T gotten anybody like that.</v>

3164
02:12:10.491 --> 02:12:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Or have you had someone come to you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

3165
02:12:12.261 --> 02:12:13.910
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about,</v>

3166
02:12:14.330 --> 02:12:15.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I get out,</v>

3167
02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:18.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not exactly sure when.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

3168
02:12:18.710 --> 02:12:19.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would,</v>

3169
02:12:19.431 --> 02:12:21.620
<v Speaker 3>I would look at them from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance side of it.</v>

3170
02:12:21.621 --> 02:12:23.300
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't look at brain damage and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

3171
02:12:23.301 --> 02:12:28.301
<v Speaker 3>well here are your numbers in the room </v>
<v Speaker 3>stack up to other folks we've had in </v>

3172
02:12:28.301 --> 02:12:29.420
<v Speaker 3>this room and you're far below their </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance wise.</v>

3173
02:12:29.421 --> 02:12:34.421
<v Speaker 3>I would say you might have a performance</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem in terms of you might not be </v>

3174
02:12:34.421 --> 02:12:37.600
<v Speaker 3>talented enough physically to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not gonna make a comment about </v>

3175
02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:38.030
<v Speaker 3>your other reasons to retire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if yeah,</v>

3176
02:12:38.031 --> 02:12:40.880
<v Speaker 3>if I tested you across the board and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were terrible at everything,</v>

3177
02:12:43.230 --> 02:12:44.380
<v Speaker 3>then I might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3178
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:49.570
<v Speaker 3>physically from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you have what it takes </v>

3179
02:12:49.570 --> 02:12:49.570
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

3180
02:12:49.570 --> 02:12:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Do you see a deterioration in physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>skills from like punishment?</v>

3181
02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:57.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I could really say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just because I don't like.</v>

3182
02:12:57.881 --> 02:13:02.881
<v Speaker 3>I don't have enough exposure to enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those folks to make a qualified </v>

3183
02:13:02.881 --> 02:13:02.881
<v Speaker 3>comment on that over long periods of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3184
02:13:02.881 --> 02:13:07.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would need dozens and dozens of guys </v>

3185
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:09.761
<v Speaker 3>over years to really fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the longest you've ever worked </v>

3186
02:13:09.761 --> 02:13:10.090
<v Speaker 3>with a guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A five,</v>

3187
02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:11.090
<v Speaker 3>six years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>

3188
02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:13.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably six years.</v>

3189
02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:14.720
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

3190
02:13:14.721 --> 02:13:16.410
<v Speaker 3>And it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3191
02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:16.960
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3192
02:13:17.060 --> 02:13:22.060
<v Speaker 3>some of them is not every single,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking to him every day and </v>

3193
02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:22.060
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's like once a camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3194
02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:26.620
<v Speaker 3>generally what my goal is is to teach </v>
<v Speaker 3>them how to think as much through this </v>

3195
02:13:26.691 --> 02:13:31.691
<v Speaker 3>stuff as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so ideally they don't need me after </v>

3196
02:13:31.691 --> 02:13:33.750
<v Speaker 3>more than a couple of camps than the few</v>
<v Speaker 3>chickens want to come to the lab,</v>

3197
02:13:33.751 --> 02:13:37.590
<v Speaker 3>get this test that I got a hunch about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this or we did this type of training for</v>

3198
02:13:37.591 --> 02:13:38.280
<v Speaker 3>six weeks.</v>

3199
02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:43.700
<v Speaker 3>We think we are addressing this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we come to get it tested to see if </v>

3200
02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:46.050
<v Speaker 3>it actually got better and no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other stuff I do is,</v>

3201
02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:51.080
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so much usually helping them calm </v>

3202
02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:54.381
<v Speaker 3>down through all the nonsense that I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>give them a settling presence in terms </v>

3203
02:13:54.381 --> 02:13:58.011
<v Speaker 3>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not something you should worry </v>

3204
02:13:58.011 --> 02:13:58.011
<v Speaker 3>about or get to here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3205
02:13:58.011 --> 02:13:58.011
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buT yeah,</v>

3206
02:13:58.011 --> 02:14:00.270
<v Speaker 3>multiple five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six years and we've got data.</v>

3207
02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:02.760
<v Speaker 3>We've got biopsy data off them from over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the years,</v>

3208
02:14:03.150 --> 02:14:04.620
<v Speaker 3>which has been very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very interesting.</v>

3209
02:14:04.621 --> 02:14:09.621
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the first reasons I </v>

3210
02:14:09.621 --> 02:14:09.621
<v Speaker 3>wanted to get into the sport because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3211
02:14:09.621 --> 02:14:09.621
<v Speaker 3>I want to biopsy these dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3212
02:14:09.621 --> 02:14:14.420
<v Speaker 3>that's got to be really as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to be really an interesting </v>

3213
02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:14.420
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3214
02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:14.520
<v Speaker 3>We had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3215
02:14:14.670 --> 02:14:17.940
<v Speaker 3>we had one fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty crazy because he's a,</v>

3216
02:14:17.941 --> 02:14:20.610
<v Speaker 3>he was a wrestler and a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very um,</v>

3217
02:14:20.730 --> 02:14:22.200
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went through attrition,</v>

3218
02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:23.400
<v Speaker 3>like that's his style.</v>

3219
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:25.080
<v Speaker 3>He's not like a knockout artist and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3220
02:14:25.110 --> 02:14:28.230
<v Speaker 3>And he was almost 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>75 percent fast twitch,</v>

3221
02:14:29.570 --> 02:14:30.660
<v Speaker 3>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3222
02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:36.640
<v Speaker 3>And then we also look this other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that we measured </v>

3223
02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:39.710
<v Speaker 3>our lab is called mild nuclear domain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the nucleus is what holds the dna and</v>

3224
02:14:41.071 --> 02:14:42.720
<v Speaker 3>it tells the cell to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shrink,</v>

3225
02:14:42.721 --> 02:14:44.490
<v Speaker 3>die repair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3226
02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:47.580
<v Speaker 3>like human biology or human muscle is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really unique.</v>

3227
02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.600
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the only cells in all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology that is multinucleated.</v>

3228
02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:54.120
<v Speaker 3>So that means it's got not only more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than one,</v>

3229
02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:57.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's got thousands of nuclei per </v>
<v Speaker 3>cell.</v>

3230
02:14:58.470 --> 02:15:03.470
<v Speaker 3>The obvious advantages that allows us a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot more plasticity so we can recover </v>

3231
02:15:03.721 --> 02:15:06.480
<v Speaker 3>and repair and adapt and adjust really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really quickly,</v>

3232
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:09.630
<v Speaker 3>which is why we see people's fiber type </v>
<v Speaker 3>change in a matter of weeks.</v>

3233
02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:12.990
<v Speaker 3>A paper that came out last year showing </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually high fat,</v>

3234
02:15:12.991 --> 02:15:14.910
<v Speaker 3>high sugar diet can change five </v>
<v Speaker 3>prototype.</v>

3235
02:15:15.630 --> 02:15:17.340
<v Speaker 3>We've seen carbon dioxide </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrations,</v>

3236
02:15:17.341 --> 02:15:19.040
<v Speaker 3>alter fiber type con,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3237
02:15:19.170 --> 02:15:24.170
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the nucleus is really interesting </v>

3238
02:15:24.170 --> 02:15:27.030
<v Speaker 3>because the more nuclei you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the faster you recover.</v>

3239
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:30.570
<v Speaker 3>It's also what determines how big a </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle will grow.</v>

3240
02:15:30.650 --> 02:15:32.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've heard of like muscle memory.</v>

3241
02:15:33.090 --> 02:15:35.700
<v Speaker 3>So that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's doing muscle memory.</v>

3242
02:15:37.110 --> 02:15:39.720
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wondered if that was real,</v>

3243
02:15:40.070 --> 02:15:42.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well working right now through it.</v>

3244
02:15:42.450 --> 02:15:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people are,</v>

3245
02:15:43.531 --> 02:15:47.280
<v Speaker 3>but the old theory would be satellite </v>
<v Speaker 3>cell would come in,</v>

3246
02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:52.760
<v Speaker 3>it would turn into a nuclei and the cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>will only grow as big as the amount of </v>

3247
02:15:53.131 --> 02:15:55.290
<v Speaker 3>nuclei that are around it or that inside</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

3248
02:15:56.520 --> 02:15:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what that basically means is,</v>

3249
02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:04.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain domain or a certain </v>

3250
02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:06.291
<v Speaker 3>size that each nucleus will control and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it won't exceed that size because it </v>

3251
02:16:06.291 --> 02:16:07.650
<v Speaker 3>loses control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>

3252
02:16:07.710 --> 02:16:09.180
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all three of us,</v>

3253
02:16:09.310 --> 02:16:12.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all the nuclei and this whole room</v>

3254
02:16:12.121 --> 02:16:12.930
<v Speaker 3>was one cell.</v>

3255
02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:17.040
<v Speaker 3>If we wanted to expand the wall we would</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to bring in another nucleus because</v>

3256
02:16:17.041 --> 02:16:17.690
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3257
02:16:17.730 --> 02:16:22.730
<v Speaker 3>like it's too much area to control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you go through about a training </v>

3258
02:16:22.730 --> 02:16:26.360
<v Speaker 3>a year or something of heavy lifting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we add those satellite cells that turned</v>

3259
02:16:26.370 --> 02:16:28.920
<v Speaker 3>into my own nuclei and we expand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>size.</v>

3260
02:16:29.550 --> 02:16:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Well we used to think like if we stopped</v>
<v Speaker 3>training in this and the room gets </v>

3261
02:16:34.550 --> 02:16:37.621
<v Speaker 3>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used to think that are like time to </v>

3262
02:16:37.621 --> 02:16:41.041
<v Speaker 3>kick me out of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gone but now will look like </v>

3263
02:16:41.041 --> 02:16:41.041
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he staying around?</v>

3264
02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:46.150
<v Speaker 3>So then when I go to retrain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got more of those nuclei right </v>

3265
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.150
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's easy.</v>

3266
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.450
<v Speaker 3>It's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got excited,</v>

3267
02:16:46.451 --> 02:16:51.451
<v Speaker 3>hit the mic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easier for me to expand my size </v>

3268
02:16:51.451 --> 02:16:51.451
<v Speaker 3>because the nuclear there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3269
02:16:51.451 --> 02:16:51.451
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3270
02:16:51.451 --> 02:16:53.920
<v Speaker 3>so there's an actual scientific reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>for muscle memory.</v>

3271
02:16:53.930 --> 02:16:58.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can increase the amount of </v>

3272
02:16:58.930 --> 02:17:01.381
<v Speaker 3>nuclear just by increasing the size of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the muscle and that makes it easier to </v>

3273
02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:04.000
<v Speaker 3>go back to that if you lose some muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3274
02:17:04.001 --> 02:17:09.001
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The demo nuclei would allow for the </v>

3275
02:17:09.001 --> 02:17:09.001
<v Speaker 3>muscles get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3276
02:17:09.001 --> 02:17:09.280
<v Speaker 3>so a little bit in reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically the same thing.</v>

3277
02:17:10.030 --> 02:17:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was really fascinating.</v>

3278
02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Anything else to add before we get out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of here?</v>

3279
02:17:13.310 --> 02:17:18.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm the book man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a book out on all this stuff </v>

3280
02:17:18.310 --> 02:17:21.670
<v Speaker 3>called on plugged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolving from technology to upgrade your</v>

3281
02:17:21.671 --> 02:17:24.850
<v Speaker 3>fitness performance and consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't on amazon,</v>

3282
02:17:24.851 --> 02:17:27.160
<v Speaker 3>although all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there an audio book available?</v>

3283
02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:28.390
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm telling you.</v>

3284
02:17:28.630 --> 02:17:29.050
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

3285
02:17:29.051 --> 02:17:31.630
<v Speaker 3>There's a kindle that I would highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>recommend.</v>

3286
02:17:31.631 --> 02:17:34.360
<v Speaker 3>You don't get it because the kindle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3287
02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:36.160
<v Speaker 3>you mean that's the digital version,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3288
02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Why get the hard copy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3289
02:17:38.170 --> 02:17:43.170
<v Speaker 3>Because the book is really a guide for </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to use some of these training </v>

3290
02:17:43.170 --> 02:17:46.411
<v Speaker 3>technologies in your training and how it</v>
<v Speaker 3>can ruin your training and how it can </v>

3291
02:17:46.411 --> 02:17:46.411
<v Speaker 3>help your training.</v>

3292
02:17:46.930 --> 02:17:50.230
<v Speaker 3>So a part of that is the importance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a couple of things,</v>

3293
02:17:50.231 --> 02:17:55.231
<v Speaker 3>getting back to nature and how that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the physiology behind how that helps as </v>

3294
02:17:55.231 --> 02:18:00.121
<v Speaker 3>well as this concept of choosing </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering and choosing discomfort and </v>

3295
02:18:00.371 --> 02:18:02.410
<v Speaker 3>how that's physiologically important for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3296
02:18:03.010 --> 02:18:06.730
<v Speaker 3>So a part of the book is built in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the photos,</v>

3297
02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:12.180
<v Speaker 3>the layout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quality of the paper is all part of </v>

3298
02:18:12.180 --> 02:18:12.180
<v Speaker 3>the reading experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have that in.</v>

3299
02:18:12.180 --> 02:18:14.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm like kindle with the photographs </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3300
02:18:14.531 --> 02:18:15.630
<v Speaker 3>It's not even close to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3301
02:18:15.730 --> 02:18:16.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all black and white.</v>

3302
02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:21.100
<v Speaker 3>The texture of the paper is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have one of those kindle hds,</v>

3303
02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:25.290
<v Speaker 3>the ones that are digital and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

3304
02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that would be good.</v>

3305
02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:27.370
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying though,</v>

3306
02:18:27.630 --> 02:18:29.220
<v Speaker 3>but you recommend the proper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3307
02:18:29.250 --> 02:18:30.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really care.</v>

3308
02:18:30.830 --> 02:18:33.690
<v Speaker 3>Like for the experience of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still cheap.</v>

3309
02:18:33.850 --> 02:18:38.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the physiological benefit of </v>

3310
02:18:38.850 --> 02:18:38.850
<v Speaker 3>getting back to nature?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3311
02:18:38.850 --> 02:18:39.070
<v Speaker 3>we have so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3312
02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:45.420
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty incredible in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything from visualization or.</v>

3313
02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:47.970
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyesight.</v>

3314
02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:51.550
<v Speaker 3>Did you listen to that amazing podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eyesight?</v>

3315
02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:54.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Radiolab did one on the color blue.</v>

3316
02:18:55.710 --> 02:18:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hear that one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

3317
02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:01.720
<v Speaker 3>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a teaser and I could tell you </v>

3318
02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:01.720
<v Speaker 3>the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it called?</v>

3319
02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:01.720
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3320
02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:02.530
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the episode.</v>

3321
02:19:02.531 --> 02:19:05.560
<v Speaker 3>Find it if you google the radio lab </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode on the color blue.</v>

3322
02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically we as humans didn't really </v>

3323
02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:11.770
<v Speaker 3>recognize the color blue until the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bible.</v>

3324
02:19:12.730 --> 02:19:13.750
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3325
02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:19.320
<v Speaker 3>So we had the cones and the like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the physiology didn't change but we </v>

3326
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:20.520
<v Speaker 3>didn't have a word for the color blue </v>
<v Speaker 3>until the bible came along.</v>

3327
02:19:20.530 --> 02:19:22.780
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at any past there prior </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

3328
02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:28.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably why isn't the sky blue </v>

3329
02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:28.740
<v Speaker 3>on radio?</v>

3330
02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:28.880
<v Speaker 3>Radiolab?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3331
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:32.540
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

3332
02:19:32.541 --> 02:19:37.541
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they've identified is we didn't </v>

3333
02:19:37.541 --> 02:19:39.101
<v Speaker 3>have a separate color for several word </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the color blue because we didn't </v>

3334
02:19:39.101 --> 02:19:42.161
<v Speaker 3>differentiate blue shade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't important for the world </v>

3335
02:19:42.161 --> 02:19:42.161
<v Speaker 3>because blue doesn't happen very </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently.</v>

3336
02:19:42.161 --> 02:19:47.141
<v Speaker 3>And in biology in nature it wasn't until</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had textiles and we started printing </v>

3337
02:19:47.141 --> 02:19:49.310
<v Speaker 3>and making cloth and paper and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

3338
02:19:49.311 --> 02:19:51.320
<v Speaker 3>that we had all these different dyes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shade the blue.</v>

3339
02:19:51.321 --> 02:19:53.750
<v Speaker 3>So then we developed different shades of</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue in different colors,</v>

3340
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:59.170
<v Speaker 3>so because of that we started perceiving</v>
<v Speaker 3>and focusing on different shades of </v>

3341
02:19:59.170 --> 02:20:03.311
<v Speaker 3>blue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now the average person that comes in </v>

3342
02:20:03.311 --> 02:20:04.130
<v Speaker 3>the room and be able to identify all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different blues or prior to this,</v>

3343
02:20:04.131 --> 02:20:05.840
<v Speaker 3>we didn't care about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't focus on it.</v>

3344
02:20:05.841 --> 02:20:07.610
<v Speaker 3>So we all just saw that as one color </v>
<v Speaker 3>blue.</v>

3345
02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:11.240
<v Speaker 3>So things like that are important.</v>

3346
02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:13.610
<v Speaker 3>So what are we paying attention to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we being conscious of?</v>

3347
02:20:13.611 --> 02:20:15.470
<v Speaker 3>What are we perceiving?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we focusing on?</v>

3348
02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Has a direct influence on our </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiology.</v>

3349
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:24.070
<v Speaker 3>It's very adaptable to those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how does that make going to nature?</v>

3350
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:29.830
<v Speaker 3>So if we think about it from this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening in the exposure when </v>

3351
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:31.490
<v Speaker 3>we're in this artificial environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus being in the external environment</v>

3352
02:20:31.491 --> 02:20:36.491
<v Speaker 3>like nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are we not being exposed to now </v>

3353
02:20:36.491 --> 02:20:37.850
<v Speaker 3>that we could be exposed to out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature?</v>

3354
02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:41.360
<v Speaker 3>The third part of the book is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness aspect,</v>

3355
02:20:41.361 --> 02:20:43.850
<v Speaker 3>which is we talked to a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3356
02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:47.070
<v Speaker 3>tim ferriss wrote a section or a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>interview thing for it.</v>

3357
02:20:47.071 --> 02:20:52.071
<v Speaker 3>Steven kotler did one as well and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about the things like getting into </v>

3358
02:20:52.071 --> 02:20:55.601
<v Speaker 3>flow state and the stress relief of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the other psychological benefits</v>

3359
02:20:56.001 --> 02:21:00.170
<v Speaker 3>that we have from detaching a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>from our constant tech exposure.</v>

3360
02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dopamine as another great example,</v>

3361
02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:08.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we look at the dopamine rush that </v>

3362
02:21:08.620 --> 02:21:09.620
<v Speaker 3>we get from the constant exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not from the actual tech,</v>

3363
02:21:09.621 --> 02:21:10.520
<v Speaker 3>but from things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3364
02:21:10.521 --> 02:21:13.010
<v Speaker 3>I want to look at my likes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to continue to look at this.</v>

3365
02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:18.700
<v Speaker 3>That's completely different than when we</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't we get out in nature and expose </v>

3366
02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:22.211
<v Speaker 3>ourself to physiological elements </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to the cold and the hot and </v>

3367
02:21:22.211 --> 02:21:22.640
<v Speaker 3>thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Hungary.</v>

3368
02:21:22.641 --> 02:21:25.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've been out in the woods and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff before,</v>

3369
02:21:25.371 --> 02:21:29.030
<v Speaker 3>like you know what it feels like going a</v>
<v Speaker 3>full day without food or being extremely</v>

3370
02:21:29.031 --> 02:21:32.990
<v Speaker 3>cold for a few days and then getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and then you like the euphoria,</v>

3371
02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:34.790
<v Speaker 3>like the sensations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can't really.</v>

3372
02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Well you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really beneficial to have </v>

3373
02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:39.820
<v Speaker 3>herself exposed to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3374
02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:41.420
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a problem now,</v>

3375
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:45.020
<v Speaker 3>but really the book is about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait 20 years.</v>

3376
02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:50.860
<v Speaker 3>And think about the problem that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be in 20 years when this technology </v>

3377
02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:51.980
<v Speaker 3>thing only gets more advanced and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes more portion of our life.</v>

3378
02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Alright dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one more time.</v>

3379
02:21:54.231 --> 02:21:55.670

<v Speaker 3>Evolve from technology to upgrade your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fitness,</v>

3381
02:21:58.251 --> 02:22:00.320
<v Speaker 3>performance and consciousness.</v>
