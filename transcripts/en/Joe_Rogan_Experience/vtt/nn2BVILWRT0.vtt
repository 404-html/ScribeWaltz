<v Speaker 1>They're that close.</v>

58
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:41.760

<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

81
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you dictum they're both actually super</v>

82
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be honest.</v>

83
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be lying if I said I didn't have,</v>

84
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:34.440
<v Speaker 1>so you're talking about spinal injuries</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

85
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.510
<v Speaker 1>obviously the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

86
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a long way to go before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a guy in San Diego at doctor</v>

87
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>who I guess works with electrical</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulses,</v>

88
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he has had some success in sort of,</v>

89
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.970
<v Speaker 1>he shoots and electrical sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Paul [inaudible] in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases.</v>

91
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.151
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

92
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>it's given some feeling back on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs and stuff.</v>

93
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's promising,</v>

94
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're way now they're going to</v>

95
00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>fix all that stuff.</v>

96
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>They just can't figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerate spinal tissue.</v>

97
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>They can't figure out how to connect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once your cord is severed,</v>

98
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>they can't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're very,</v>

99
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>they're very hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're doing it with</v>

100
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>penises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that you're unable to transplant</v>

101
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>a penis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only did the guy that they</v>

102
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>transplanted his penis and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>excited,</v>

103
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 1>he got his girlfriend pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

104
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Craig was the hardest thing for so many</v>

106
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>veterans is when they get their legs</v>
<v Speaker 1>blown off.</v>

107
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>The first thing they talked to was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

108
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 1>the first thing young men got to say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with my,</v>

109
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad of course.</v>

110
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so devastating.</v>

111
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:34.160
<v Speaker 1>It's such a devastating wound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that they were</v>

112
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 1>trying to get money for it and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

113
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:35.971
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

114
00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 1>we legs are more important.</v>

115
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea what you're talking</v>

116
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>about mentally for a young man when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets an injury to his groin,</v>

117
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking more devastating than</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost anything else.</v>

118
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Just to it down sizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

119
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick gets blown off with your balls like</v>

120
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.320
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have testosterone even</v>

121
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:53.154
<v Speaker 1>planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

122
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot a lot to say about that.</v>

123
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 1>The horrors of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you can just figure out</v>

124
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>how to fix bodies to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's broken can just get</v>

125
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 1>repaired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

126
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:11.971
<v Speaker 1>think about like 105 hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you got a broken leg like 500 years</v>

127
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a dead man.</v>

128
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to put you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>

129
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you know the one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't figure out how to help your</v>

130
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:20.310
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only company kept figuring out</v>

131
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

132
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 1>You're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like.</v>

133
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they just drill a hole and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot some stem cells on there?</v>

134
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.021
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

135
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>It's this crispr crispr cas nine is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking incredible.</v>

136
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the new frontier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in 10 years we're going to be,</v>

137
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.740
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be literally taking your</v>
<v Speaker 1>DNA and putting a gene in the area.</v>

138
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Apparently just shooting a gene in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>area of that.</v>

139
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>When they snip your DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this whole,</v>

140
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know how it works?</v>

141
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a great radio lab podcast on</v>

142
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to it twice so I could figure</v>

143
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>out what they were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

144
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>The con is tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This though is the,</v>

145
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>all this advancement and medical and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff and we're fixing everyone is,</v>

146
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>it's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's gonna get over populated.</v>

147
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Right Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when to stop dying.</v>

148
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>There will always be plain old death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest question is how the</v>

149
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>average lives can be way long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already increasing.</v>

150
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.823
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

151
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>how do you pay for like there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain cancer treatments that are</v>

152
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>$1,000 a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

153
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>you can cure hep c now and it's $1,000 a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill.</v>

154
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>It'll cost you $84,000 but you'll cure</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

155
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.110
<v Speaker 1>You will for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the cap.</v>

156
00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>C is is a curable disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

157
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 1>It's no longer a manageable disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Used to be really hard.</v>

158
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to take interferon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would only work on northern</v>

159
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.690

<v Speaker 1>with the bullet.</v>

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the hottest dog.</v>

186
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:40.091
<v Speaker 1>The lady I saw Raquel Welsh when she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in her sixties and a straight up dime</v>

187
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:41.780
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some women are beautiful.</v>

188
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.670
<v Speaker 1>They're whole fucking lake and hang in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

<v Speaker 1>rick and hang in there.</v>

190
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Fucking rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much effort it must take to keep</v>

191
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:50.910
<v Speaker 1>that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a day.</v>

192
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think it's genetics.</v>

193
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.370
<v Speaker 1>It's probably that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also effort.</v>

194
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any woman who</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at that fantastic that doesn't do</v>

195
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 1>something like either the fillers on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their face or they work out like a</v>

196
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 1>fucking demon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a mandatory or they go to,</v>

197
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to probably do cryogenics like</v>

198
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:14.380
<v Speaker 1>that's Christie Brinkley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's 62 that's nuts.</v>

199
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>My mom is very similar in age now.</v>

200
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I would go on a date with her too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's hot and that's not even a good</v>

201
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 1>picture because like the sun's behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>her or faces in the shade.</v>

202
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:28.310

203
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might fall off it though when you</v>

204
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>get in the sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

205
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Like bones of which probably just sleeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

206
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Just like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bathtub.</v>

207
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 1>It's filled with blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started noticing,</v>

208
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I started noticing like for me like</v>
<v Speaker 1>about about four years ago,</v>

209
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

210
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that girls just didn't look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>me the same when I come off stage like</v>

211
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.370

212
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.360
<v Speaker 1>but when when you as a young man like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing standup,</v>

213
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.620

<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

214
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.630
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's died down quite a bit.</v>

233
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Give him a chance and the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>

234
00:09:56.591 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking my sports to a new level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time I'm 60 drugs playing tennis.</v>

235
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 1>What does this tennis thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you so obsessed with that?</v>

236
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.250
<v Speaker 1>It's always been somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take them something manly.</v>

237
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Look at Jujitsu I box bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

238
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:08.720
<v Speaker 1>you do bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

239
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go four rounds.</v>

240
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't why you're looking at his past and</v>

241
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.830
<v Speaker 1>as Chris van Heerden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the answer.</v>

242
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.630
<v Speaker 1>That's on the answer to that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about,</v>

243
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to get out of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>details stuff going on.</v>

244
00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you have about three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about three weeks ago.</v>

245
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Did you watch the UFC this weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

246
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would I and by the way,</v>

247
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.711
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to brag,</v>

248
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:33.120
<v Speaker 1>but I called every single fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the Rose Page fight and the</v>

249
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankie Edgar,</v>

250
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Edgar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

251
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.570
<v Speaker 1>well you didn't call the result.</v>

252
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just picked those guys.</v>

253
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Pick the winners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick the winners.</v>

254
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought Frankie had a real good shot</v>

255
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 1>at decisioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when my friends ask me like who's</v>

256
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:46.260
<v Speaker 1>going to win?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was going to win that.</v>

257
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I said Frankie has a real good shot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisioning chat.</v>

258
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 1>The chat also has a good shot at</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking Franklin percent.</v>

259
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 1>The only reason I picked so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>

260
00:10:55.081 --> 00:11:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean he knocked out Ricardo Lamas mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>he bangs and he also loads up.</v>

261
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just figured I,</v>

262
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.790
<v Speaker 1>for me I pick frankie because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew frankie wouldn't gas and I think</v>

263
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought if Chad had to keep up with</v>

264
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Frankie's pace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would gas toward,</v>

265
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>we'll chat actually came into this fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>light cause I think he anticipated that</v>

266
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 1>kind of pace that frankie was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on him.</v>

267
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.170
<v Speaker 1>So I was talking about two different</v>
<v Speaker 1>buckles and he said the chat was way</v>

268
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>later for this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a shit ton of cardio.</v>

269
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Like he was embarrassed by the conor</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight that he gassed out so quick.</v>

270
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously took that fight on two weeks</v>

271
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:28.830
<v Speaker 1>notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a joke when you're a big guy</v>

272
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 1>like him and you've got to cut weight to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get down to one 45,</v>

273
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.930
<v Speaker 1>his entire campus is probably all about</v>
<v Speaker 1>him losing weight,</v>

274
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

275
00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 1>this camp you got in real good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got clip a lot of these fights or</v>

276
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a tossup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's so close to the matches were</v>

277
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 1>so close so he could have went either</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

278
00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 1>So many people were so fucking mad at</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

279
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.330
<v Speaker 1>We're after the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give suggestions like the UFC says,</v>

280
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:52.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truck will say,</v>

281
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 1>who do you think should get the next</v>

282
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 2>shot in your hair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

283
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.000
<v Speaker 2>they say the golden goliaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

284
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

285
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.430
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

286
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the footage based up for Frankie Edgar.</v>

287
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

288
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

289
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that a rematch is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

290
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you definitely could do a rematch.</v>

291
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.100
<v Speaker 2>The problem with doing a rematch is with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aldo,</v>

292
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.680
<v Speaker 2>conor mcgregor and Aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with doing a rematch as it'd</v>

293
00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:21.610
<v Speaker 2>be so hard to sell when a guy gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked out that quick.</v>

294
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:23.740
<v Speaker 2>When you hype it up for as long as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

295
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 2>you'll hype it up for two separate</v>
<v Speaker 2>events.</v>

296
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.840
<v Speaker 2>It dies off and then the first punch</v>
<v Speaker 2>connor connects with it,</v>

297
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:30.250
<v Speaker 2>puts him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a star,</v>

298
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to sell that.</v>

299
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like lineage and you look,</v>

300
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 2>look as history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd say,</v>

301
00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:38.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

302
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 2>the guy was a champion for 10 years.</v>

303
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.240
<v Speaker 2>He should ever eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to,</v>

304
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 2>but does he sees it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the thing.</v>

305
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 2>There's a giant list of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say that Cain got an immediate</v>

306
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:49.210
<v Speaker 2>rematch as a junior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>junior dos Santos knocked him out,</v>

307
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.130
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought big foot Silva.</v>

308
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out big foot Silva and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got a rematch.</v>

309
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.310
<v Speaker 2>But traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditionally inboxing,</v>

310
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 2>correct me if you're not in box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the wrong argument.</v>

311
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.470
<v Speaker 2>You'll go off the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's the counter.</v>

312
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.440
<v Speaker 2>I can go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you as soon as don't be,</v>

313
00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:03.274
<v Speaker 2>we're like rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

314
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.340
<v Speaker 2>well he just got murked in 13 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not much of a rematch.</v>

315
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.290
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the history of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC,</v>

316
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.960
<v Speaker 2>he should get a rematch just based off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they usually do things.</v>

317
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.760
<v Speaker 2>So we look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at Barao,</v>

318
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get brow,</v>

319
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:18.430
<v Speaker 2>he lost immediate rematch.</v>

320
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.550
<v Speaker 2>We look at Anderson Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate rematch.</v>

321
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.540
<v Speaker 2>You know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's tons in the history.</v>

322
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Ronda rousey immediately match all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

323
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a bad ass.</v>

324
00:13:27.551 --> 00:13:30.490
<v Speaker 2>He should get immediate rematch</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to what they've done before.</v>

325
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It make sense.</v>

326
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Not think what they've done before is</v>
<v Speaker 2>based.</v>

327
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it is based on like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of compelling contenders do</v>

328
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:43.090
<v Speaker 2>they have for that title and especially</v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling contenders where you look at</v>

329
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their style versus like the style of the</v>

330
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Speaker 2>guy who is now the current champion and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to pick like the most</v>

331
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:54.100
<v Speaker 2>intriguing stylistic matchup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Frankie Edgar.</v>

332
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie Edgar.</v>

333
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.860
<v Speaker 2>Because I've fought at 55 and one the</v>
<v Speaker 2>title of 55 meet legends and Bj Penn</v>

334
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 2>just knocked out Chad Mendez with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>punch before that.</v>

335
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Beat the fuck out of cub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swanson shut it out.</v>

336
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean he beat Uriah Faber.</v>

337
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.780
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking,</v>

338
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 2>he's smushed everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put in front of them for a few</v>

339
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 2>years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a monster.</v>

340
00:14:12.341 --> 00:14:15.580
<v Speaker 2>He deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how can you give someone say like</v>

341
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an immediate rematch and make holly</v>

342
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:19.210
<v Speaker 2>weight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good question.</v>

343
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:20.710
<v Speaker 2>As you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

344
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that Rhonda should get an</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate rematch.</v>

345
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.251
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You weren't,</v>

346
00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:26.560
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part she's getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate rematch,</v>

347
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:27.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's guaranteed.</v>

348
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she has to pass the medical to make</v>

349
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.340
<v Speaker 2>sure she's healthy and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the plan is she's going to get the</v>

350
00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:38.920
<v Speaker 2>rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's only financial.</v>

351
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:43.240
<v Speaker 2>But financially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Holly Holm fight with Ronda is the</v>

352
00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 2>biggest fight for Holly Holm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holmes going to make like $7</v>

353
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.650
<v Speaker 2>million for the Ronda Rousey for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was Holly Holm,</v>

354
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't want to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants to stay active.</v>

355
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.590
<v Speaker 2>And I totally understand that and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

356
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be her prerogative as a</v>

357
00:14:56.391 --> 00:15:00.290
<v Speaker 2>champion to kind of choose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but financially,</v>

358
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:01.760
<v Speaker 2>that's the smart fight for her.</v>

359
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Like it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to make the most money.</v>

360
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.400
<v Speaker 2>She does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants to fight me.</v>

361
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Should tape before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

362
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Speaker 2>she does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her and her camera.</v>

363
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Let's do Ameesha one's a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The UFC saying no.</v>

364
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.410
<v Speaker 2>So how can you grow this law?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying you can't play favorites</v>

365
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 2>because when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

366
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 2>when the public smells favorites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're losing credibility.</v>

367
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.190
<v Speaker 2>But does he have one tab for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage?</v>

368
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Is that favorites or is that smart?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Financially was really good.</v>

369
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.520
<v Speaker 2>What about Verdomme cane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's comedian Kane and verdomme.</v>

370
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:30.170
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to have an immediate</v>
<v Speaker 2>rematch.</v>

371
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.920
<v Speaker 2>They offered for doom other fights and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how they came to the</v>

372
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 2>conclusion of cane fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I apparently there was a bunch of</v>

373
00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:39.350
<v Speaker 2>other people in the mix and they came to</v>
<v Speaker 2>settle on cane.</v>

374
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:44.220
<v Speaker 2>It might have been that it was her dooms</v>
<v Speaker 2>choice because financial reasons like</v>

375
00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 2>the f the cane fight will be much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>financially viable.</v>

376
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.373
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

377
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Hanan Barao you know what I'm saying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

378
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Give and morale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a draw at all.</v>

379
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Right Tj?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoops.</v>

380
00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:55.430
<v Speaker 2>His asked you like left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy's been a champ for so long.</v>

381
00:15:55.431 --> 00:15:57.440
<v Speaker 2>We give him enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

382
00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.520
<v Speaker 2>That there should be consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There has to be,</v>

383
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.550
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

384
00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:02.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what you talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

385
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.240
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't play.</v>

386
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>

387
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't play favorites because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're standing in line for a second.</v>

388
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 2>The whole erupting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

389
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.900
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there just has to be some sort of</v>

390
00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 2>consistent where you just can't play</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorites.</v>

391
00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Well this is good here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is good here.</v>

392
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:22.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep the same with the,</v>

393
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.590
<v Speaker 2>and Damien Meyer brought the sub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great point.</v>

394
00:16:24.591 --> 00:16:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same with the,</v>

395
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:30.200
<v Speaker 2>the rankings because who the fuck where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you?</v>

396
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Here's one that doesn't make any sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

397
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.040
<v Speaker 2>How come you Riaa hall knocked out Gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>Garden.</v>

398
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saucy but gig massage.</v>

399
00:16:37.491 --> 00:16:40.360
<v Speaker 2>He was ahead of him in the rankings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked him out of his last visit.</v>

400
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.200
<v Speaker 2>A bunch like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch like that.</v>

401
00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:44.000
<v Speaker 2>That's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the most egregious,</v>

402
00:16:44.001 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been bigger ones that I've seen,</v>

403
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.010
<v Speaker 2>but most of the fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we laugh at the rankings.</v>

404
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 2>We used to laugh in the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one and two,</v>

405
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.310
<v Speaker 2>whatever it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take a rocket scientist to</v>

406
00:16:53.311 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 2>figure out what to after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's voting on these?</v>

407
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing with a lot of these</v>

408
00:16:58.611 --> 00:16:59.570
<v Speaker 2>title shots like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

409
00:16:59.571 --> 00:17:02.570
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you won't be taken seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be wwe style.</v>

410
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's an inherent problem</v>

411
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:10.601
<v Speaker 2>with the promotion being the UFC also</v>
<v Speaker 2>being the ones who dictate what,</v>

412
00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:12.800
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

413
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Who fights for title 100% because</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally it's not like,</v>

414
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>WBC like is a sanctioning body,</v>

415
00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:20.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Boxing,</v>

416
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:26.080
<v Speaker 2>the WBC decides who's the mandatory</v>
<v Speaker 2>contender and then Bob Arum or don king</v>

417
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.570
<v Speaker 2>or golden boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the ones who promote the</v>

418
00:17:29.571 --> 00:17:32.780
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The UFC is both right there,</v>

419
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:35.540
<v Speaker 2>the sanctioning body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're also the promoters of the</v>

420
00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:38.540
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have a vested interest in going</v>

421
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 2>with the best financial option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why Tyson fury was just stripped</v>

422
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:44.990
<v Speaker 2>of his heavyweight title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson Fury,</v>

423
00:17:44.991 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 2>just legitimately outbox Vladimir</v>
<v Speaker 2>Klitschko beat his ass just a hundred</v>

424
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of weird,</v>

425
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 2>clunky style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have won every round,</v>

426
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.850
<v Speaker 2>every fucking beat Vladimir Klitschko</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and lost in 10 fucking years.</v>

427
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.560
<v Speaker 2>And they had an immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

428
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defense of the title that they were</v>

429
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 2>imposing on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he passed on.</v>

430
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>

431
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.110
<v Speaker 2>They stripped him of his title.</v>

432
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.710
<v Speaker 2>This is within weeks of him beating</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vladimir Klitschko to the title.</v>

433
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 2>So this is a drast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drastic,</v>

434
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.360
<v Speaker 2>drastic contrast to what the UFC has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The UFC would say,</v>

435
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.051
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

436
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what the ratings are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting Vladimir Klitschko</v>

437
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.670
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's where all the fucking</v>

438
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

439
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they would do.</v>

440
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of the NFL and NBA did this,</v>

441
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.290
<v Speaker 2>or mlb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if these other major leagues did this,</v>

442
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 2>you'd have the most popular teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to say that he's in the</v>

443
00:18:33.541 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 2>playoff lot of time you'd have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a valid comparison.</v>

444
00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.520
<v Speaker 2>It is because not because you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

445
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:38.851
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

446
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.320
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're talking about teams.</v>

447
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about teams versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

448
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not about Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think disagrees?</v>

449
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 2>I think you need to play for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>championship.</v>

450
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 2>You have to go through a whole season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go through a whole season.</v>

451
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.840
<v Speaker 2>You have to win to even be in contention</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play for the super bowl to be in</v>

452
00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:57.500
<v Speaker 2>contention to play for the major league,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still not.</v>

453
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.150
<v Speaker 2>It's very black and white when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

454
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.770
<v Speaker 2>but let me go see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not black and white.</v>

455
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I may ask you guys a question about</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

456
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.590
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's not a valid comparison</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't sand junket taking</v>

457
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Speaker 2>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to come up with a</v>

458
00:19:08.971 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 2>formula where people can see the madness</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind your reasons.</v>

459
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I cannot tell her rhythm or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

460
00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what Demian Maia was saying.</v>

461
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia was saying that after the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

462
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I think he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many victories in a row</v>

463
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:22.620
<v Speaker 2>he's had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at welterweight he's been virtually</v>

464
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.500
<v Speaker 2>like flawless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think one person might have</v>

465
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 2>beaten them at welter weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

466
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Who beat Damien Maia at welterweight.</v>

467
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia made a very good point.</v>

468
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's such a fucking respectful</v>

469
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 2>gentlemen and such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a perfect representative of martial</v>

470
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:41.880
<v Speaker 2>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is a gym.</v>

471
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.040
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

472
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.660
<v Speaker 2>I just do punching to set up my take</v>
<v Speaker 2>down so I can do Jujitsu cause I don't</v>

473
00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:51.420
<v Speaker 2>want to hurt my opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to train the next day</v>

474
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.420
<v Speaker 2>because I just want to get in there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>win by Jujitsu so I can go back,</v>

475
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.480
<v Speaker 2>train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can go back to train.</v>

476
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the good ones that he's</v>

477
00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:59.850
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the fucking young guy.</v>

478
00:19:59.851 --> 00:20:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Destroy though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

479
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:04.140
<v Speaker 2>let's quit tossing these young up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>comers and he just raped.</v>

480
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who cares?</v>

481
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I man each gun or just edit it and set</v>
<v Speaker 2>it up and let him choke them all.</v>

482
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Roy McDonald beat him.</v>

483
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 2>That was the last guy at welter weight.</v>

484
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right before that was jake shields</v>

485
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:18.790
<v Speaker 2>beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a great fucking fire man.</v>

486
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.500
<v Speaker 2>But that was a split decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy beat them unanimous decision.</v>

487
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Split decisions are so weird because</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they are clear.</v>

488
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 2>You just got an idiot judge and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember how about Romero and jock</v>

489
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 2>array.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a very close fight.</v>

490
00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:35.760
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was going to be a drawl or</v>
<v Speaker 2>split decision have been,</v>

491
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.650
<v Speaker 2>well I thought it could have been a draw</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think eol definitely got a 10,</v>

492
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:43.350
<v Speaker 2>eight round the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the question is will they scored a</v>

493
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:46.290
<v Speaker 2>ten eight round when you got a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely on Queer Street,</v>

494
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 2>you spinning back fist him in the jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock him and John Corey was,</v>

495
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.260
<v Speaker 2>he got up to his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

496
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:56.380
<v Speaker 2>after he took a fucking prolonged</v>
<v Speaker 2>beating on the ground,</v>

497
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:59.260
<v Speaker 2>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got hit with some bombs by Yo el.</v>

498
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.000
<v Speaker 2>He gets up to go to his corner and he is</v>
<v Speaker 2>on wobbly legs.</v>

499
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Like they could have easily stopped the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

500
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.290
<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking that they might</v>
<v Speaker 2>should have stopped that fight.</v>

501
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.400
<v Speaker 2>But jock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

502
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Being the stud that is came back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reestablish himself in the second round.</v>

503
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Partially because Yo el gassed cause eol</v>
<v Speaker 2>who looks like a fucking superhero.</v>

504
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.780
<v Speaker 2>The most ridiculous history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just for five,</v>

505
00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 2>three you mean three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

506
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.210
<v Speaker 2>That's why that's why he fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fights luke rockhold and tries to go</v>

507
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:29.650
<v Speaker 2>five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my aunt Jo.</v>

508
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:31.720
<v Speaker 2>You can't give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought after that fight,</v>

509
00:21:31.721 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 2>whoever wins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't give those guys a title shot.</v>

510
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.640
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do Weidman rockhold to you don't</v>

511
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:39.220
<v Speaker 2>give the winner of that bullshit fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a title shot.</v>

512
00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:39.971
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

513
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I think you could make a real good point</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

514
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this sort of contradicts what you</v>

515
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 2>said about having a very clear algorithm</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as like who becomes a number one</v>

516
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 2>contender and who fight too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is the thing,</v>

517
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm going based off past UFC history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I think they should do.</v>

518
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I really think this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there should be a way where</v>

519
00:21:56.921 --> 00:22:01.000
<v Speaker 2>people sign in on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know like you sign in using your</v>

520
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:04.150
<v Speaker 2>facebook so we know you're a real person</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the public votes.</v>

521
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Then you also have the media vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the mixed martial arts media,</v>

522
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 2>like the the guys who was like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Golden Globes almost.</v>

523
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

524
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.280
<v Speaker 2>And then you have fighters vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have,</v>

525
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 2>so just like how you have three judges</v>
<v Speaker 2>that score a fight,</v>

526
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:24.090
<v Speaker 2>you have three sources that you use to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick who the contenders are.</v>

527
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:25.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a good idea.</v>

528
00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Who the number one contender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom of crowds.</v>

529
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bad idea and I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to lead to a lot of trouble if you</v>

530
00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:34.570
<v Speaker 2>just leave it up to the UFC brass to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

531
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:35.873
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

532
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.410
<v Speaker 2>even though I work for the UFC and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked for the UFC forever,</v>

533
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 2>like people ask me questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

534
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I get,</v>

535
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who the fuck does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who makes the rankings.</v>

536
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:44.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I get to work,</v>

537
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:47.530
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do when I get to the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say hi to everybody,</v>

538
00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:48.364
<v Speaker 2>a hug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

539
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.570
<v Speaker 2>I get excited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

540
00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start going over the,</v>

541
00:22:52.221 --> 00:22:54.220
<v Speaker 2>the matchups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I um,</v>

542
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I've already watched video on fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody in the card pretty much by</v>

543
00:22:58.421 --> 00:23:00.670
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I say I don't do research,</v>

544
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of full of shit.</v>

545
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 2>But it's not that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it as research.</v>

546
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I just do it because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

547
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.380
<v Speaker 2>it will be coming to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's he fucking how to handle this</v>

548
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 2>dude's got a nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we re Alvarez kind of fucking wicked</v>

549
00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:13.210
<v Speaker 2>good team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if they go,</v>

550
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.190
<v Speaker 2>if he tries to take this kid to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>

551
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:16.660
<v Speaker 2>he's going to shoot for that double is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get caught.</v>

552
00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Nikea teen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not your job as is a fucking nasty</v>

553
00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:21.280
<v Speaker 2>kickboxer he's gonna want to take this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy down,</v>

554
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.250
<v Speaker 2>but it is my job sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would have,</v>

555
00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:26.700
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't know like the rankings and</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide that.</v>

556
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do everything that I do even if</v>

557
00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't working for the UFC just cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like freaking out about these events</v>

558
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:35.970
<v Speaker 2>and that's just what I get in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because again,</v>

559
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck is going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>besides that.</v>

560
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.040
<v Speaker 2>When I get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I show up,</v>

561
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.750
<v Speaker 2>I say my highs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get my shit.</v>

562
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>They put the mic on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I high five</v>

563
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Goldberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hug each other.</v>

564
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

565
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Don't they know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on.</v>

566
00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Share more about your opinion and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

567
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 1>especially in the public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not,</v>

568
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 1>some people are mad though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we got into the beginning</v>

569
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.970
<v Speaker 1>that I said I don't think that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart to have all doe fight right away.</v>

570
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 1>My opinion is that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although got knocked dead.</v>

571
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get knocked dead like that and</v>

572
00:24:08.411 --> 00:24:11.570
<v Speaker 1>you need a long time off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need at least six months off conor</v>

573
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:13.270
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor fight next Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

574
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.500
<v Speaker 1>And I think that Frankie Edgar could</v>
<v Speaker 1>also fight next to 100% I also think</v>

575
00:24:18.501 --> 00:24:22.580
<v Speaker 1>that death fight will be fucking bananas</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for a Fan.</v>

576
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I am so excited to watch that fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I think Frankie has a really</v>

577
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:31.340
<v Speaker 1>dangerous style for a guy like conor</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's taken it down repeatedly by Chad</v>

578
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Mendez.</v>

579
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:34.100
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking nasty wrestler.</v>

580
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:37.670
<v Speaker 1>His cardio is off the chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His footwork is fantastic.</v>

581
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:40.700
<v Speaker 1>He's got Mark Henry in his corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to come up with a bad ass</v>

582
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:44.900
<v Speaker 1>game plan between Kenrey Henry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cavenaugh and Frankie,</v>

583
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:47.230
<v Speaker 1>who's a fucking winner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Connor,</v>

584
00:24:47.231 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 1>who's a fucking winner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

585
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you be most excited about?</v>

586
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 1>You ready for this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

587
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy to beat dos Anjos dos Anjos</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connor in Dublin in front 80,000 fans.</v>

588
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred percent hundred percent you're</v>

589
00:25:03.231 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about more writing.</v>

590
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.770
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The title Donald Serone.</v>

591
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just say one thing giant if,</v>

592
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hofeld dos Anjos is a fucking beast and</v>

593
00:25:15.561 --> 00:25:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I think those two are going to clash and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's going to happen.</v>

594
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Especially since still sun just beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowboy.</v>

595
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 1>The first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be a wild wicked</v>

596
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:24.910
<v Speaker 1>fight drug that I'm no longer right.</v>

597
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug testing.</v>

598
00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Did you just say there's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>that crf but wait,</v>

599
00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:30.500
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take me back to a second.</v>

600
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Let me say one thing about you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give Josie Aldo a rematch in my opinion</v>

601
00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:37.310
<v Speaker 1>for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

602
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that at the end of the day he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the champion for 10 years and if</v>

603
00:25:42.411 --> 00:25:46.250
<v Speaker 1>anybody's earned a shot too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I believe.</v>

604
00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I think conor mcgregor is has a secret</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is he's,</v>

605
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.820
<v Speaker 1>he's watching these guys strike and know</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

606
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:54.260
<v Speaker 1>They don't know he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he somehow,</v>

607
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he sending to doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

608
00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Hold on Hon because that's just saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you think is going to,</v>

609
00:25:57.831 --> 00:26:01.280
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you knock a champion who's been</v>

610
00:26:01.281 --> 00:26:06.281
<v Speaker 1>that dominant and that good for 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in 14 seconds there is the question.</v>

611
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.980
<v Speaker 1>There is a question which is was that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways a fluke,</v>

612
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.140
<v Speaker 1>what did he make one mistake and paid</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>

613
00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:17.030
<v Speaker 1>which can happen in mma with those small</v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves,</v>

614
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.660
<v Speaker 1>does he get another shot to at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind call longer how it goes.</v>

615
00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:22.640
<v Speaker 1>He's going to come out extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>

616
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to count and I know that and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold it and you see the video of him</v>

617
00:26:26.601 --> 00:26:30.920
<v Speaker 1>warming up in the dressing room and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>in contrast like a split screen with him</v>

618
00:26:30.921 --> 00:26:33.410
<v Speaker 1>warming up right next to the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight itself.</v>

619
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 1>He was preparing exactly for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuver and he's making,</v>

620
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.500
<v Speaker 1>he's mimicking all those face first</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement and he does this little slight</v>

621
00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>step to his right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes</v>

622
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.840
<v Speaker 2>an adjustment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He throws the first left hand,</v>

623
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 2>the first land hat and debt doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

624
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.290
<v Speaker 2>So if you watch him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him moving,</v>

625
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:53.010
<v Speaker 2>he throws that sidekick to the leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he makes a very slight step to the</v>

626
00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:57.150
<v Speaker 2>right although moves to the right hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>counters them with the left boom.</v>

627
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Hey know something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying,</v>

628
00:26:59.111 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 2>cause I think that he would fight him</v>
<v Speaker 2>again and knock them out of that's real.</v>

629
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 2>I think it's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Champion gets a rematch.</v>

630
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I think he deserves it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

631
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ties up the title for a long time and</v>

632
00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:14.080
<v Speaker 2>you have all these contenders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

633
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.530
<v Speaker 2>You have an amazing group listed</v>
<v Speaker 2>contenders.</v>

634
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 2>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you have Joe's a Aldo fight,</v>

635
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Max Holloway and you have a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>great fight between one of the top</v>

636
00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:25.350
<v Speaker 2>contenders and Max Holloway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This young,</v>

637
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.450
<v Speaker 2>exciting kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>24 years old,</v>

638
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Pete and everybody just figure it out.</v>

639
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Stevens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's elusive.</v>

640
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.820
<v Speaker 2>He slick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He puts on a fucking show where a</v>

641
00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.510
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has crazy cardio.</v>

642
00:27:36.511 --> 00:27:40.800
<v Speaker 2>He's driven and fired up and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite have them fight for the title yet</v>

643
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.950
<v Speaker 2>because Frankie's ahead of him and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

644
00:27:42.951 --> 00:27:46.000
<v Speaker 2>the division is super exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie fucking clear.</v>

645
00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:47.850
<v Speaker 2>The way man fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie was pissed.</v>

646
00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 2>He didn't get the shot when Chad got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After he beat Uriah,</v>

647
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.560
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought that Frankie,</v>

648
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.170
<v Speaker 2>his safety first style gets Uriah was</v>
<v Speaker 2>boring.</v>

649
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.390
<v Speaker 2>You want a decision?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't try to finish him.</v>

650
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Chad went out and blew ricardo lamas out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the water.</v>

651
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Chad gets to shun Frankie's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

652
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.010
<v Speaker 2>But I did the cub Swanson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what I did do all these other</v>

653
00:28:05.011 --> 00:28:06.540
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then what does he do?</v>

654
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.020
<v Speaker 2>He goes out there and takes it out on</v>
<v Speaker 2>chat.</v>

655
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Merck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merck,</v>

656
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:12.450
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put some away in my opinion,</v>

657
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.730
<v Speaker 2>like as a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited to see that.</v>

658
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:20.070
<v Speaker 2>I think here's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe this wholeheartedly and</v>

659
00:28:20.071 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a very important point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fighters should wait a long fucking time</v>

660
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:26.700
<v Speaker 2>after they get knocked out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

661
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.480
<v Speaker 2>He got cleaned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got flat,</v>

662
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.610
<v Speaker 2>and then he got hammer fist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As he was out,</v>

663
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.640
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got up and he was asking what</v>

664
00:28:35.641 --> 00:28:37.060
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was putting his hands up and</v>

665
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.370
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he's saying because</v>

666
00:28:38.371 --> 00:28:40.680
<v Speaker 2>he's speaking in Portuguese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he was shaking his head and they</v>

667
00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:42.460
<v Speaker 2>were nodding their head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were saying yes and that would be</v>

668
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.771
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

669
00:28:42.771 --> 00:28:43.081
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

670
00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:43.801
<v Speaker 2>And they were going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

671
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:44.190
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

672
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Here's the other thing Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are talking about,</v>

673
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I hate to be a stickler and I took some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking shit for saying this.</v>

674
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.830
<v Speaker 2>You're bat shit crazy if you don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josie Aldos body looked different.</v>

675
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.080
<v Speaker 2>You're batshit crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think he's going to fight the</v>

676
00:28:58.081 --> 00:29:01.740
<v Speaker 2>same also and all these people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving me all the shit for it.</v>

677
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.910
<v Speaker 2>His Camp I think is one in seven Oh and</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight since this drug test and came out.</v>

678
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.160
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter man,</v>

679
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.810
<v Speaker 2>a completely different fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

680
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.920
<v Speaker 2>so for me that's a huge x factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a leaked audio from inside the</v>

681
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:18.010
<v Speaker 2>truck of me saying that someone got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

682
00:29:18.011 --> 00:29:20.310
<v Speaker 2>when the audio goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an audio feed when the main</v>

683
00:29:20.311 --> 00:29:23.280
<v Speaker 2>event happens and when that main event</v>
<v Speaker 2>audio feed goes out,</v>

684
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.160
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody could listen to it.</v>

685
00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:29.220
<v Speaker 2>That is it picking up the feed to it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast.</v>

686
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>And I said that his body looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>deflated,</v>

687
00:29:31.921 --> 00:29:34.850
<v Speaker 2>it looks smooth and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

688
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.710
<v Speaker 2>I felt like he looked really nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said he looked nervous as fuck and I</v>

689
00:29:37.711 --> 00:29:38.970
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to jump to conclusions.</v>

690
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:42.640
<v Speaker 2>He might just be doing a lot of cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is possible because one of all</v>

691
00:29:42.641 --> 00:29:44.740
<v Speaker 2>those big problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Dana White,</v>

692
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:46.540
<v Speaker 2>he said this is a perfect way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>describing it,</v>

693
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 2>that all of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very best fighter ever for two</v>

694
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 2>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he would always gas and then he</v>

695
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 2>would always sorta coast like Ricardo</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lamas.</v>

696
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 2>He'd beat the shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alarmists the first round,</v>

697
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.480
<v Speaker 2>the end of the fifth round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ricardo Lamas was on top grounding</v>

698
00:29:58.481 --> 00:30:01.000
<v Speaker 2>pounding dominic to mark comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same Goddamn thing.</v>

699
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was on the antibiotics with harmonic,</v>

700
00:30:02.531 --> 00:30:03.640
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for staff.</v>

701
00:30:03.641 --> 00:30:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

702
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.290
<v Speaker 2>I never heard that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he fought harmonic,</v>

703
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.710
<v Speaker 2>he had just done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd had staff need done.</v>

704
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.653
<v Speaker 2>Google that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jane.</v>

714
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Like denny was dying on stat from staff</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to come to you surprised by the,</v>

715
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:34.300
<v Speaker 2>by Luke's domination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>

716
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Totally surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally surprised by a lot of thing and</v>

717
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:39.190
<v Speaker 2>we totally should get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

718
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:43.270
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if Aldo had concentrated</v>

719
00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:46.750
<v Speaker 2>more on cardio or if he had gotten off</v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>

720
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.720
<v Speaker 2>but I do know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is nonspecific,</v>

721
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:55.230
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge problem in mma with</v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids is a huge problem and that</v>

722
00:30:56.441 --> 00:31:01.441
<v Speaker 2>problem is being cut away like cancer by</v>
<v Speaker 2>this new program by Jeff Novitsky.</v>

723
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I also know that they tried to test all</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't camp and all those people had the</v>

724
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:08.920
<v Speaker 2>cops pulled on these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to get him kicked out of the</v>

725
00:31:08.921 --> 00:31:10.890
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to de de de,</v>

726
00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.660
<v Speaker 2>de port them out of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when they finally did give him a</v>

727
00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:16.870
<v Speaker 2>urine sample,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tripped and spilled his pice.</v>

728
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Is this not weird to anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

729
00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't take them a true way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spilled piss in my entire career.</v>

730
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is his cups all the time.</v>

731
00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.910
<v Speaker 2>It does get feathery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All there was covering from an</v>

732
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:33.160
<v Speaker 2>undisclosed infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was on antibiotic hall.</v>

733
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Callan,</v>

734
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.520

735
00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:39.430
<v Speaker 2>doesn't take away anything that all was</v>
<v Speaker 2>done in his career.</v>

736
00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Even if he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying he's never failed a test.</v>

737
00:31:41.831 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 2>So who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

738
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.410
<v Speaker 2>We needed Lance Armstrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

739
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:48.220
<v Speaker 2>All insane is all I'm saying is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed with Lance Armstrong steam was</v>

740
00:31:48.221 --> 00:31:50.470
<v Speaker 2>baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was exonerated.</v>

741
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.570
<v Speaker 2>He stolen the pitch on some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

742
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.080
<v Speaker 2>everyone's on some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

743
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.990
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter whether he's honored or not,</v>

744
00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:57.450
<v Speaker 2>he's greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This I'll,</v>

745
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Josie Aldo is one of the greatest pound</v>
<v Speaker 2>for pound fighters ever.</v>

746
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:01.323
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever,</v>

747
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.050
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

748
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.890
<v Speaker 2>And to go on a 10 year run like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't in the UFC has said like,</v>

749
00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:07.930
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know he'd played it safe and he goes</v>

750
00:32:07.931 --> 00:32:09.040
<v Speaker 2>to decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't do that.</v>

751
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:10.360
<v Speaker 2>But you know what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>

752
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.970
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fucking wins.</v>

753
00:32:12.971 --> 00:32:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like him risking losing,</v>

754
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.450
<v Speaker 2>like to unload on somebody like Uriah</v>
<v Speaker 2>Faber did.</v>

755
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Like uriah faber flat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie signs and your riots sort of</v>

756
00:32:22.301 --> 00:32:25.450
<v Speaker 2>faded in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reason why faded is cause he</v>

757
00:32:25.451 --> 00:32:28.020
<v Speaker 2>landed a bomb on frankie signs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rocked them.</v>

758
00:32:28.021 --> 00:32:31.720
<v Speaker 2>And then when after I'm blue as load,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking frankie signs guy,</v>

759
00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:36.580
<v Speaker 2>he's tough as shit cause that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 35 year old guy who's got like one</v>

760
00:32:36.581 --> 00:32:38.470
<v Speaker 2>other fight in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe two.</v>

761
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he's fighting Uriah</v>

762
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:42.170
<v Speaker 2>motherfucking favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

763
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was this crazy?</v>

764
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.260
<v Speaker 2>It was ranked 13 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

765
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:49.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's your why of Faber is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most experienced guys and one</v>

766
00:32:49.221 --> 00:32:51.320
<v Speaker 2>of the best guys ever did not win a UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>title.</v>

767
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's only lost title fight.</v>

768
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:53.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

769
00:32:53.681 --> 00:32:57.950
<v Speaker 2>he bombs on this guy and then nails him</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a knee to the,</v>

770
00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a temple tart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some parts,</v>

771
00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:02.780
<v Speaker 2>some bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the kids all over the place and</v>

772
00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:06.170
<v Speaker 2>your rise unloading on him and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow the guy survives and then your</v>

773
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:07.880
<v Speaker 2>eyes like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh boy.</v>

774
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

775
00:33:09.871 --> 00:33:13.430
<v Speaker 2>she's took a deep breath and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at the clock is like you know</v>

776
00:33:13.431 --> 00:33:15.950
<v Speaker 2>better than anybody that when you unload</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

777
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.010
<v Speaker 2>that's never how anybody fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you unload like that,</v>

778
00:33:19.011 --> 00:33:21.290
<v Speaker 2>you're going all in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing all your chips and this</v>

779
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:22.910
<v Speaker 2>guy just pulls out four aces.</v>

<v Speaker 2>perfect one sample palm strike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys never use plumbing skit from</v>

784
00:33:32.001 --> 00:33:33.530
<v Speaker 2>the huddle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about your eye goes,</v>

785
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.880
<v Speaker 2>our friendships done.</v>

786
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Tj dillashaw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your Ryan White.</v>

787
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.280
<v Speaker 2>He was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was saying it's going to be like</v>

788
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:41.740
<v Speaker 2>rocky and the good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gonna wait,</v>

789
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.620
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

790
00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him and Tj,</v>

791
00:33:43.791 --> 00:33:46.250
<v Speaker 2>they had a falling out because tj went</v>
<v Speaker 2>to muscle farm.</v>

792
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.790
<v Speaker 2>The muscle farm offered him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't follow the will.</v>

793
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:52.380
<v Speaker 2>The reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why Tj went to muscle</v>

794
00:33:52.381 --> 00:33:54.080
<v Speaker 2>farm is two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One money,</v>

795
00:33:54.081 --> 00:33:55.640
<v Speaker 2>but to Duane Ludwig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

796
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Duane Ludwig and Tj have a fantastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>working relationship.</v>

797
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Duane Ludwig is a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got some crazy mental disorder that</v>

798
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:07.490
<v Speaker 2>makes him concentrate on fighting every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single second of every day.</v>

799
00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I think he's got a running thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he could be hanging out with his</v>

800
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:12.920
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to the movies,</v>

801
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:16.070
<v Speaker 2>eating dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about baseball in the back of</v>

802
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:17.900
<v Speaker 2>his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's watching counter,</v>

803
00:34:17.901 --> 00:34:19.820
<v Speaker 2>right hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg kicks,</v>

804
00:34:19.821 --> 00:34:22.430
<v Speaker 2>movement session.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks the rain man of fighting.</v>

805
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.420
<v Speaker 2>He's obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

806
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:25.820
<v Speaker 2>He's obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what you want from a</v>

807
00:34:25.821 --> 00:34:28.670
<v Speaker 2>trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tj recognizes that and his personality</v>

808
00:34:28.671 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 2>and Dwayne's personality jive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas your bias personality and</v>

809
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Dwayne's personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're water and oil.</v>

810
00:34:34.251 --> 00:34:37.850
<v Speaker 2>They fucking clashed hardcore and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryan never wanted to have anything to do</v>

811
00:34:37.851 --> 00:34:38.511
<v Speaker 2>with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

812
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 2>fuck this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And dwayne and him didn't get along and</v>

813
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Dwayne was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck him.</v>

814
00:34:42.891 --> 00:34:44.950
<v Speaker 2>And they argued about stupid shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

815
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.240
<v Speaker 2>here's something that a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

816
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:51.710
<v Speaker 2>There was a point in time where we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>considering buying that Jim on it and I</v>

817
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:53.060
<v Speaker 2>was going to be on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

818
00:34:53.061 --> 00:34:55.310
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna buy the ultimate training</v>

819
00:34:55.311 --> 00:34:57.690
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were thinking about buying it and</v>

820
00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.790
<v Speaker 2>making that team like an audit team and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking to those guys about how</v>

821
00:35:01.791 --> 00:35:04.010
<v Speaker 2>to make this work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was right when they were starting</v>

822
00:35:04.011 --> 00:35:04.700
<v Speaker 2>to go at it.</v>

823
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.280
<v Speaker 2>When dwayne and Uriah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to go at it and we were</v>

824
00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:08.150
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

<v Speaker 2>how would I do this and be impartial.</v>

827
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

848
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Thank Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

849
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.390
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the nicest guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to do,</v>

850
00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:01.650
<v Speaker 2>you'll see now with them every now and</v>

851
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.470
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so I have to be completely</v>

852
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:05.580
<v Speaker 2>impartial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

853
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:07.950
<v Speaker 2>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to figure out how to separate</v>

854
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:10.350
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is it even,</v>

855
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.950
<v Speaker 2>can you even ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I ask myself to do that?</v>

856
00:36:13.951 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 2>If I owned a gym and I had fighters who</v>
<v Speaker 2>were fighting against guys who are a</v>

857
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:20.550
<v Speaker 2>team that you own basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what I mean?</v>

858
00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:23.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody always thinks that they're</v>

859
00:36:23.191 --> 00:36:24.870
<v Speaker 2>always gonna feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are always gonna feel like you're</v>

860
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:26.400
<v Speaker 2>biased in some way or another.</v>

861
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.300
<v Speaker 2>If they find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>

862
00:36:27.301 --> 00:36:30.180
<v Speaker 2>if you're rooting for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're rooting for someone and</v>

863
00:36:30.181 --> 00:36:32.640
<v Speaker 2>you're calling the fight against that</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

864
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:34.240
<v Speaker 2>that they're rooting for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to consider it.</v>

865
00:36:34.241 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 2>It some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen,</v>

866
00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard you be biased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm todd [inaudible].</v>

867
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.020
<v Speaker 2>You are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that Russia shit.</v>

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Damn dumb ass down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever been harder than you.</v>

869
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 2>It's the hardest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardest fights ever to call.</v>

870
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Cause like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

871
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I can do it when you lost a travis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was</v>

872
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 2>broken up man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hard.</v>

873
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Turns to me he's had at least he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>get hurt.</v>

874
00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 2>That's the important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hard.</v>

875
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.860
<v Speaker 2>That was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kallan was right behind me.</v>

876
00:37:01.861 --> 00:37:05.430
<v Speaker 2>He was sitting right behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a hard [inaudible] he came in</v>

877
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:08.220
<v Speaker 2>here like close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

878
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Well it was close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was super close fight.</v>

879
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's,</v>

880
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:21.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a tricky but so this is all we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talking about Duane and Uriah like</v>

881
00:37:21.181 --> 00:37:23.060
<v Speaker 2>they just didn't get along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is totes.</v>

882
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.120
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a fucking bummer because if</v>

883
00:37:27.121 --> 00:37:29.910
<v Speaker 2>their personalities did like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost felt like man,</v>

884
00:37:29.911 --> 00:37:32.880
<v Speaker 2>if there's a middleman here that comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and sorts all this debt,</v>

885
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:34.530
<v Speaker 2>like what did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like what is the issue?</v>

886
00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Is this a financial thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Personality things,</v>

887
00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:39.870
<v Speaker 2>two Alphas personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

888
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.460
<v Speaker 2>guys who get territorial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys who want your [inaudible] really</v>

889
00:37:44.461 --> 00:37:49.130
<v Speaker 2>strong personality and he's also like</v>
<v Speaker 2>super organized and successful.</v>

890
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Super successful and super focused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your Riaa is like,</v>

891
00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a very admirable person.</v>

892
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Like when you watch like how he conducts</v>
<v Speaker 2>business and also look at the tight knit</v>

893
00:37:59.941 --> 00:38:02.300
<v Speaker 2>bond that he's created with his team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

894
00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only create that kind of a bond when</v>

895
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:06.430
<v Speaker 2>you are that kind of a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

896
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.240
<v Speaker 2>and that's what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for him,</v>

897
00:38:09.241 --> 00:38:12.960
<v Speaker 2>when Tj took off and went to this muscle</v>
<v Speaker 2>farm camp,</v>

898
00:38:12.961 --> 00:38:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that it was like a knife in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

899
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Fucking devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Tj and your I should fight no</v>

900
00:38:18.511 --> 00:38:20.520
<v Speaker 2>matter what happens with Tj Dominick</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cruz,</v>

901
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.710
<v Speaker 2>that fight has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think so.</v>

902
00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm so excited about teachers'</v>
<v Speaker 2>excitement of this.</v>

903
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.660
<v Speaker 2>The back story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We love a good story.</v>

904
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.920
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be so don't we do that dominick</v>

905
00:38:31.921 --> 00:38:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tj fight might be one of the greatest</v>

906
00:38:34.351 --> 00:38:37.510
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dominic Dominic would have dominic wins</v>

907
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.410
<v Speaker 2>and then Uriah and Tj fight for a number</v>
<v Speaker 2>one contender status.</v>

908
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.840
<v Speaker 2>But your eye in dominic have a history</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

909
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.420
<v Speaker 2>That's not a bad story either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bad story.</v>

910
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you think of another more compelling</v>

911
00:38:50.441 --> 00:38:54.190
<v Speaker 2>contender that would be ahead of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>Riaa besides Tj?</v>

912
00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say if Dominic Beats Tj or,</v>

913
00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever wins that fight,</v>

914
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:01.780
<v Speaker 2>who would be next in line for the title</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of Uriah.</v>

915
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Who else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 and brow</v>

916
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.570

<v Speaker 2>He'll make the argument,</v>

917
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 2>he could make the argument but he's have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to win again.</v>

918
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:13.080
<v Speaker 2>He got destroyed and his last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tj didn't destroyed teenagers,</v>

919
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 2>didn't just beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lit him up like a Christmas tree,</v>

920
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:21.220
<v Speaker 2>covered them with gasoline and lit them</v>
<v Speaker 2>on fire and drug testing and through him</v>

921
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.930
<v Speaker 2>threw him off a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

922
00:39:22.931 --> 00:39:24.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was not a moment in that fight</v>

923
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.240
<v Speaker 2>other than the first initial exchanges</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he was like fired up and it's like</v>

924
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:32.500
<v Speaker 2>bully beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tj and dominick Cruz have such similar</v>

925
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:33.610
<v Speaker 2>styles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost feel like,</v>

926
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:37.450
<v Speaker 2>like dwayne watched a lot of dominick</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cruz fights and kind of,</v>

927
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I wrong about that?</v>

928
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a lot of guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>employing that sort of neo footwork</v>

929
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:45.580
<v Speaker 2>movement now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think dominick was the best at it,</v>

930
00:39:45.581 --> 00:39:48.460
<v Speaker 2>the earliest he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so elusive.</v>

931
00:39:48.461 --> 00:39:49.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

932
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:54.090
<v Speaker 2>like you get used to a guy like here's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different weight class but is a</v>

933
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.740
<v Speaker 2>quintessential like Thai style.</v>

934
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.320
<v Speaker 2>The style striker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thiago Silva stands right in front</v>

935
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:02.110
<v Speaker 2>of you and he's got that fucking rhythm</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

936
00:40:02.111 --> 00:40:02.944
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>

937
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.190
<v Speaker 2>not mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you got the complete polar</v>

938
00:40:06.191 --> 00:40:07.720
<v Speaker 2>opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like connor.</v>

939
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Connor is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you see conor fighting Aldo,</v>

940
00:40:11.021 --> 00:40:14.080
<v Speaker 2>he slide Nin he slide now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's very difficult to judge,</v>

941
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.660
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best ever at that is dominic</v>

942
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.800
<v Speaker 2>dominic's all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's fucking move in a sliding.</v>

943
00:40:20.801 --> 00:40:23.110
<v Speaker 2>He's over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's over there and you're trying to</v>

944
00:40:23.111 --> 00:40:26.560
<v Speaker 2>figure out when you can uncork a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a good luck time.</v>

945
00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:28.120
<v Speaker 2>And that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever had a conversation with</v>

946
00:40:28.121 --> 00:40:29.170
<v Speaker 2>dominic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

947
00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:32.050
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have the highest MMA Iq I've ever seen.</v>

948
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

949
00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it was my favorite out of</v>

950
00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:39.060
<v Speaker 2>those guys that breaks down fights and</v>
<v Speaker 2>analyzes what went wrong,</v>

951
00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.230
<v Speaker 2>why it went wrong and he's a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>student.</v>

952
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time,</v>

953
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominic and chill.</v>

954
00:40:43.851 --> 00:40:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Sonya and myself went to unbreakable gym</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were trading with jails before</v>

955
00:40:47.681 --> 00:40:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Charles fight and Jon Jones and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>training jail and dominic was breaking</v>

956
00:40:51.341 --> 00:40:52.270
<v Speaker 2>things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

957
00:40:52.271 --> 00:40:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God gets an oracle can also,</v>

958
00:40:56.310 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 2>he's had all this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's had all his time while he's been</v>

959
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:03.580
<v Speaker 2>injured to think and work on things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>

960
00:41:03.581 --> 00:41:06.360
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you stopped paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to mma I keys,</v>

961
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.680
<v Speaker 2>he's been focusing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas,</v>

962
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he hadn't been injured,</v>

963
00:41:10.661 --> 00:41:12.340
<v Speaker 2>he'd be in camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting ready for fights,</v>

964
00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:17.260
<v Speaker 2>like almost might've benefited his MMA</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iq to have that time off and to be</v>

965
00:41:17.261 --> 00:41:21.050
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with returning about what he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna have his hands full kcls.</v>

966
00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.050
<v Speaker 2>And you've had that surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you get,</v>

967
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.770
<v Speaker 2>when you get acl surgery nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

968
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:29.560
<v Speaker 2>is your knee as strong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm strong,</v>

969
00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.830
<v Speaker 2>it's stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>

970
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.440
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit stronger.</v>

971
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my right knee has a cadaver graft.</v>

972
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.610
<v Speaker 2>It had a cadaver graft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what the cadaver graft does is they</v>

973
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:43.670
<v Speaker 2>take an Achilles tendon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is way thicker than a regular acl,</v>

974
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 2>and then they put it in place and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body re proliferates.</v>

975
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.030
<v Speaker 2>That acts as a scaffolding and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not stem cells.</v>

976
00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Your body grows like they restat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they connect it and your body starts</v>

977
00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:01.280
<v Speaker 2>putting blood through it and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing new tissue.</v>

978
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>

979
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.860
<v Speaker 2>your acl becomes your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a,</v>

980
00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I had a cadaver graft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those cells are not cadaver cells</v>

981
00:42:09.651 --> 00:42:10.720
<v Speaker 2>that are in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>near south.</v>

982
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 2>Those are myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's way thicker than it would have</v>

983
00:42:13.671 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Donald 150% stronger than</v>

984
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.023
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

985
00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.010
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the case maybe with Dominic's</v>

986
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.260
<v Speaker 2>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tore the same one twice and then</v>

987
00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 2>toward the other one he taught tour one</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice toward the other one and he tore</v>

988
00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:28.700
<v Speaker 2>his groin and he broke both his hands.</v>

989
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:29.291
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

990
00:42:29.291 --> 00:42:31.790
<v Speaker 2>he's a fragile God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I had him on,</v>

991
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:34.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of those UFC interview shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was joking around.</v>

992
00:42:34.881 --> 00:42:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show me scars in his hands.</v>

993
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 2>He's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a bitch hands.</v>

994
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:38.460
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is what it was like.</v>

995
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.510
<v Speaker 2>This Guy Greg Cook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Guy Greg Cook who has full bar,</v>

996
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:46.280
<v Speaker 2>like the NFL now has what's called a</v>
<v Speaker 2>full body screening or some functional</v>

997
00:42:46.281 --> 00:42:48.800
<v Speaker 2>body screening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The UFC has got that now too with their</v>

998
00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:51.410
<v Speaker 2>new camp because they were finding they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would bring him in and he would find</v>

999
00:42:51.411 --> 00:42:54.080
<v Speaker 2>that that is all amazing athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then one guy kept tearing,</v>

1000
00:42:54.081 --> 00:42:58.370
<v Speaker 2>he'd run and he kept tearing his groin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept telling the tenant had attached</v>

1001
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 2>his like to his pelvis to his quad and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't figure it out.</v>

1002
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:04.670
<v Speaker 2>And he's the guy who comes in and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what the problem is.</v>

1003
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.030
<v Speaker 2>You're off balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One side of your body is stronger than</v>

1004
00:43:08.031 --> 00:43:10.580
<v Speaker 2>the other and that's a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really common.</v>

1005
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the training centers around,</v>

1006
00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:17.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically finding out where you're weak</v>

1007
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.150
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you very common around that with</v>

1008
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:23.300
<v Speaker 2>pictures cause you know you throw in</v>
<v Speaker 2>with one arm.</v>

1009
00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And kickers like nfl kickers,</v>

1010
00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:29.060
<v Speaker 2>they have real problems with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like back problems because you're always</v>

1011
00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:32.310
<v Speaker 2>kicking that one leg in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Dominic though.</v>

1012
00:43:32.311 --> 00:43:35.420
<v Speaker 2>It's years of wrestling and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>champion for ever.</v>

1013
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:37.310
<v Speaker 2>He's only had one loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's up.</v>

1014
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.380
<v Speaker 2>It adds up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can chalk it up to inbounds.</v>

1015
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Nomad is Uriah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uriah caught him with a good team so me.</v>

1016
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Well you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets your neck.</v>

1017
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:49.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fucking giant people often get done</v>

1018
00:43:49.021 --> 00:43:50.630
<v Speaker 2>the cruise beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demetrius Johnson,</v>

1019
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:55.660
<v Speaker 2>he beat Dj dam but they also forget that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was one day they didn't live anywhere</v>

1020
00:43:56.451 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 2>near Matt Hume.</v>

1021
00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:00.470
<v Speaker 2>He was coming into town once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a fact.</v>

1022
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't training like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ian Mccall fight was the big</v>

1023
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:06.710
<v Speaker 2>turnaround for Dj.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had him on the podcast.</v>

1024
00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:08.030
<v Speaker 2>He talked about it cause he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1025
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Ian fucking rattled his cage and it hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1026
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.930
<v Speaker 2>He had vertigo after that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty fucked up and I'm mad</v>

1027
00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:16.250
<v Speaker 2>human pulled him aside and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1028
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.890
<v Speaker 2>you've got to stop fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're going to do this.</v>

1029
00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Or you should maybe get an education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you should figure out what the fuck</v>

1030
00:44:21.741 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 2>you going to do with your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this ain't it.</v>

1031
00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Like you've got to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he went all in,</v>

1032
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:30.080
<v Speaker 2>moved near the the gym and now he's here</v>
<v Speaker 2>five days a week and look at him now.</v>

1033
00:44:30.081 --> 00:44:32.180
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying dumb dum ba dum</v>

1034
00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.330
<v Speaker 1>different one though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And different weight classes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and like one 35 is a cut for him.</v>

1039
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Demetrius Johnson is to put a rock in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his pocket to make one 35 wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1107
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:26.430
<v Speaker 1>you know when you see a Weidman versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>rockhold and then Weidman wanted to</v>

1108
00:47:26.431 --> 00:47:28.860
<v Speaker 1>fight Jon Jones for the light</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight title.</v>

1109
00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weidman's movement wasn't the same.</v>

1110
00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I weidman looked off to loss a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

1111
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.280
<v Speaker 1>He was a in the one nineties in Hawaii</v>
<v Speaker 1>biblically on me like that.</v>

1112
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a strategy where he said,</v>

1113
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:41.734
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

1114
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1115
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's just not the guy.</v>

1116
00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.820
<v Speaker 1>I think what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come in there,</v>

1117
00:47:51.821 --> 00:47:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hit them with pace,</v>

1118
00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:54.311
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardio pace.</v>

1119
00:47:54.311 --> 00:47:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wear him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

1120
00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I think he did do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was,</v>

1121
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was throwing a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not full power kicks to the body,</v>

1122
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:04.030
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pressure,</v>

1123
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.510
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pressure with his grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just fucked up throwing that we'll</v>

1124
00:48:07.511 --> 00:48:09.760
<v Speaker 1>kick stay in your lane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1125
00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the biggest mistakes in the</v>

1126
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:15.540
<v Speaker 1>history of mma championship fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% talking about it like,</v>

1127
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1128
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go through like throw a or leg kick</v>

1129
00:48:20.561 --> 00:48:22.030
<v Speaker 1>and you get countered with the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and get hurt.</v>

1130
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.020
<v Speaker 1>That's normal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy acrobatic move</v>

1131
00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:29.640
<v Speaker 1>that he's telling beach bar.</v>

1132
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably was right because that's</v>

1133
00:48:32.531 --> 00:48:35.350
<v Speaker 1>what knocked out rockhold maybe thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a sucker for wheel kicks.</v>

1134
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 1>The grind is working for you when he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking him down and starting to work.</v>

1135
00:48:39.161 --> 00:48:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Starting to weird lookout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially like we knew luke was on</v>

1136
00:48:41.441 --> 00:48:42.620
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

1137
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 1>keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't think he knew.</v>

1138
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.650
<v Speaker 1>He knew that Luke's pace was slowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1139
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell.</v>

1140
00:48:48.671 --> 00:48:52.330
<v Speaker 1>I think what happened was he realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was a lot stronger than Chris</v>

1141
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:52.811
<v Speaker 1>Weidman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1142
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:54.970
<v Speaker 1>he looked just stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

1143
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.440
<v Speaker 1>and I think he went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>

1144
00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I wrestled with Cain Velasquez and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1145
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stronger and bigger than this guy.</v>

1146
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:04.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he just started.</v>

1147
00:49:04.821 --> 00:49:06.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something that happened at all.</v>

1148
00:49:06.191 --> 00:49:08.440
<v Speaker 1>He caught him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made a mistake and he took him down</v>

1149
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:12.760
<v Speaker 1>the keys through a wheel kick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally gave his fucking body up.</v>

1150
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:16.480
<v Speaker 1>You get taken down and when rockhold</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets you on the ground,</v>

1151
00:49:16.481 --> 00:49:18.360
<v Speaker 1>his fucking top games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nasty,</v>

1152
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:20.590
<v Speaker 1>super nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you saw it against Leo Machida.</v>

1153
00:49:20.591 --> 00:49:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Like I would like to see rockhold in</v>
<v Speaker 1>just straight up Brazilian jujitsu</v>

1154
00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.100
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he is at a very high level mother</v>

1155
00:49:26.101 --> 00:49:28.780
<v Speaker 1>fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that that's why I'd like to</v>

1156
00:49:28.781 --> 00:49:31.120
<v Speaker 1>see a rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say that kick doesn't happen.</v>

1157
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:33.760
<v Speaker 1>We've got a hell of a firefighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a fight anyway.</v>

1158
00:49:33.761 --> 00:49:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Cause that back kick that happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third round.</v>

1159
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a fourth round stop it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had at one to one.</v>

1160
00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did wonder one.</v>

1161
00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:41.860
<v Speaker 1>It was a really good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

1162
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weidman came out guns blazing face first</v>

1163
00:49:45.611 --> 00:49:48.850
<v Speaker 1>and rockhold connected with straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>left with like conor and Aldo.</v>

1164
00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 1>This is like a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end of the war,</v>

1165
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:54.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean rockhold got that advantage.</v>

1166
00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Never let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adding Weidman in the face more.</v>

1167
00:49:56.831 --> 00:49:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel as though he was kind of standing</v>

1168
00:49:59.651 --> 00:50:02.510
<v Speaker 1>on the edge of that pocket and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has hands down and I,</v>

1169
00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I felt like rockhold seems so confident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was gas,</v>

1170
00:50:06.081 --> 00:50:07.780
<v Speaker 1>but he looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just confident enough to just,</v>

1171
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:10.630
<v Speaker 1>he knew where the shots were coming in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would counter,</v>

1172
00:50:10.631 --> 00:50:13.660
<v Speaker 1>he was hitting him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More Weidman was pressuring him and his</v>

1173
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.690
<v Speaker 1>kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his body,</v>

1174
00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:18.730
<v Speaker 1>it put more pressure on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really paying off to the body is thrown</v>

1175
00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.320
<v Speaker 1>a lot of body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're Luke's though.</v>

1176
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.380
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were hard.</v>

1177
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:25.330
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he who you didn't like laying to any</v>

1178
00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.820
<v Speaker 1>flushing and cottey kicks hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God exert her cane side.</v>

1179
00:50:28.821 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 1>What does that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be just one of the hardest</v>

1180
00:50:30.651 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 1>kickers in the division for sure.</v>

1181
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Rock holds long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what's interesting when I</v>

1182
00:50:34.671 --> 00:50:36.260
<v Speaker 1>talked to Javier Mendez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1183
00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 1>did he have a traditional martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 1>background?</v>

1184
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:39.140
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

1185
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.670
<v Speaker 1>He came to me when he was 17 and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1186
00:50:40.671 --> 00:50:42.830
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Because when you watch like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flexibility and dexterity,</v>

1188
00:50:45.951 --> 00:50:49.910
<v Speaker 1>like the looseness of his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when he throws that question mark</v>

1189
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 1>kick off the front leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so fucking Lou serone style.</v>

1190
00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1191
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:59.290
<v Speaker 1>like ceremonies had more time for</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking years and you look at Rocco's</v>

1192
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:01.430
<v Speaker 1>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dad was a professional basketball</v>

1193
00:51:01.431 --> 00:51:03.380
<v Speaker 1>player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brother's a professional surfer.</v>

1194
00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Have this monster just looming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wayne,</v>

1195
00:51:06.511 --> 00:51:09.630
<v Speaker 1>do you find something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He found his calling him and me at 17</v>

1196
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:12.770
<v Speaker 1>what we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're starting to see is</v>

1197
00:51:12.771 --> 00:51:14.330
<v Speaker 1>we're getting guys who are martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>

1198
00:51:14.331 --> 00:51:17.240
<v Speaker 1>but they're really good athletes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's who's taking over Holly Holm.</v>

1199
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freak athlete.</v>

1200
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.940
<v Speaker 1>John Jones [inaudible] think you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally right.</v>

1201
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're totally right.</v>

1202
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.040
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1203
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's just so shocking to me out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those that I see.</v>

1204
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holly obviously has a long extensive</v>

1205
00:51:32.721 --> 00:51:35.540
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing background under winkeljohn</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a fantastic trainer,</v>

1206
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.360
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that freaks me out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most about rockhold is the,</v>

1207
00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flexibility and dexterity of his</v>

1208
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:43.460
<v Speaker 1>legs that takes so long to develop that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of whip.</v>

1209
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his kicks aren't just hard.</v>

1210
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Like Weidman has strong kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's strong like he throws him,</v>

1211
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:53.120
<v Speaker 1>but there's a stiffness to him that</v>
<v Speaker 1>rockwell doesn't have.</v>

1212
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Rock holds got like a taekwondo thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

1213
00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big fucks up.</v>

1214
00:51:57.771 --> 00:52:01.370
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just 16 and and San Jose when we</v>

1215
00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:02.360
<v Speaker 1>were hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1216
00:52:02.361 --> 00:52:03.200
<v Speaker 1>how much do you weigh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1217
00:52:03.201 --> 00:52:04.910
<v Speaker 1>sure was 16 of course I did.</v>

1218
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I took them down and in your face I took</v>
<v Speaker 1>him in and I took him in.</v>

1219
00:52:07.761 --> 00:52:10.580
<v Speaker 1>But don't kid yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had My hand on his back couple times.</v>

1220
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Talk this track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian came back from hanging out with</v>

1221
00:52:15.471 --> 00:52:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had got his haircut just like him.</v>

1222
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you doing?</v>

1223
00:52:18.621 --> 00:52:20.080
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds around luke.</v>

1224
00:52:20.081 --> 00:52:22.580
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to get my hair cut like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 48 copy.</v>

1225
00:52:22.581 --> 00:52:26.900
<v Speaker 1>And I look him in the eye and I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly like loop when we go to a bar.</v>

1226
00:52:26.901 --> 00:52:29.270
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at my one that is and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught eyes and I looked at him,</v>

1227

<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell Ya.</v>

1228
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:31.870
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he smiling.</v>

1229
00:52:31.871 --> 00:52:34.700
<v Speaker 1>He went six three and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you are.</v>

1230
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:38.930
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at his hair and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to take you to go deeper</v>

1231
00:52:38.931 --> 00:52:41.420
<v Speaker 1>with your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a moment,</v>

1232
00:52:41.421 --> 00:52:41.630
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

1233
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:46.400
<v Speaker 1>We had a moment here that I went right</v>
<v Speaker 1>to super cuts for $12 and I go,</v>

1234
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.520
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked through the camera picture</v>

1235
00:52:49.521 --> 00:52:53.240
<v Speaker 1>of Luke rockhold that you fucking piss</v>
<v Speaker 1>my and fingers.</v>

1236
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.060
<v Speaker 1>My friend Tarik who trains luke goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think you'd would suck luke stick.</v>

1238
00:52:58.161 --> 00:53:02.150
<v Speaker 1>We asked them did</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take I think out of that</v>

1239
00:53:02.151 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1240
00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:06.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it just as a goof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell anybody.</v>

1241
00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:10.700
<v Speaker 1>What a shocking moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is shocking turn of event that one</v>

1242
00:53:10.701 --> 00:53:13.910
<v Speaker 1>wheel kick changes the entire fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She see Chris crying.</v>

1243
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also the,</v>

1244
00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:19.940
<v Speaker 1>the pressure that rockhold put on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think surprised Weidman,</v>

1245
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:23.090
<v Speaker 1>like when rockhold mounted him and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure not gonna eat those on.</v>

1246
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I would never eat those when brock hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>mounted him</v>

1247
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he couldn't get them off of him.</v>

1248
00:53:28.051 --> 00:53:29.790
<v Speaker 2>I think he was fucking shocked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when,</v>

1249
00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lyman has really good Jitsu and when he</v>

1250
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 2>felt rock holds pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's first time he's ever been taken</v>

1251
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:37.800
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Time it's backspin on the mat and</v>

1252
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:38.460
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1253
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 2>he's strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's stronger than,</v>

1254
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:44.310
<v Speaker 2>he had a technique to stronger t his</v>
<v Speaker 2>technique was superior.</v>

1255
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.640
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1256
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.330
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking beast and I think</v>

1257
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:52.050
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't underestimate the benefit of</v>

1258
00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:54.660
<v Speaker 2>training with Daniel Cormay and Cain</v>
<v Speaker 2>Velasquez,</v>

1259
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.900
<v Speaker 2>the heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the former heavyweight champion and the</v>

1260
00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 2>light heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to ask her if there's a</v>

1261
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:03.360
<v Speaker 2>chance they could have the heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 2>champ light heavyweight champ,</v>

1262
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 2>and now middleweight champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All training together all came up</v>

1263
00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:07.680
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that?</v>

1264
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:09.860
<v Speaker 2>It is a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the light heavyweight,</v>

1265
00:54:09.861 --> 00:54:11.930
<v Speaker 2>you got to put a little asterisk next to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1266
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:13.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

1267
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying right now you gotta pull</v>
<v Speaker 2>astro,</v>

1268
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:18.690
<v Speaker 2>big astrid analytic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially now.</v>

1269
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Now that John's trite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought left and 600 pounds,</v>

1270
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Graham and I watch him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watch him throw my phone away,</v>

1271
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.030
<v Speaker 2>run out the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be around.</v>

1272
00:54:27.031 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's a monster right now.</v>

1273
00:54:29.461 --> 00:54:31.860
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's also a monster that's overcoming a</v>

1274
00:54:31.861 --> 00:54:34.650
<v Speaker 2>really bad moment in his life and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the straight and now,</v>

1275
00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:37.380
<v Speaker 2>now he's on the path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's care while he should be.</v>

1276
00:54:37.381 --> 00:54:39.150
<v Speaker 2>And those are good things to happen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1277
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

1278
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you know I've said this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll say it again.</v>

1279
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I love a comeback story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking,</v>

1280
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I like a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who does the right thing and gets it all</v>

1281
00:54:48.841 --> 00:54:52.650
<v Speaker 2>together and I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also like a guy who fucks his life</v>

1282
00:54:52.651 --> 00:54:56.790
<v Speaker 2>up and brings it all together and love</v>
<v Speaker 2>those stories though.</v>

1283
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think John should be someone who</v>

1284
00:54:58.831 --> 00:55:00.240
<v Speaker 2>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1285
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Like do all this stuff is great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but be the heel man,</v>

1286
00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:06.630
<v Speaker 2>be the fucking joker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC and fucks to destroy.</v>

1287
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:09.390
<v Speaker 2>He wants to be Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think John Thinks of himself as</v>

1288
00:55:09.391 --> 00:55:11.130
<v Speaker 2>a bad guy and I don't think he is a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1289
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a young guy who's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have fun and he's made some mistakes.</v>

1290
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's a bad person to</v>

1291
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.800
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's a bad person.</v>

1292
00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:22.830
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a far cry from Holly Holm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1293
00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.640
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a holiday for me.</v>

1294
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Home is the perfect represent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to her after the fight.</v>

1295
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Nice person of all time after the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh she might be easily,</v>

1296
00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.820
<v Speaker 2>I talked to her after the fight this</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend and you know we were talking,</v>

1297
00:55:35.821 --> 00:55:38.490
<v Speaker 2>hanging out her and her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just said congratulations.</v>

1298
00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:39.420
<v Speaker 2>How's it feel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1299
00:55:39.421 --> 00:55:40.860
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It still feels weird.</v>

1300
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:42.510
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing so many.</v>

1301
00:55:42.511 --> 00:55:44.280
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't even want to think about it.</v>

1302
00:55:44.281 --> 00:55:45.780
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to get back to training</v>

1303
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.540
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't want to get a big head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1304
00:55:48.541 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 2>and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knows the traps and we were talking</v>

1305
00:55:50.431 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 2>about the fight and she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1306
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.033
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1307
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.100
<v Speaker 2>the reality is what happened tonight to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josie,</v>

1308
00:55:56.101 --> 00:55:58.650
<v Speaker 2>all that could have happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can happen to anybody and she goes,</v>

1309
00:55:58.651 --> 00:56:00.570
<v Speaker 2>you get caught with a punch and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked out.</v>

1310
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:03.300
<v Speaker 2>It's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's been in the sport too long I think</v>

1311
00:56:03.301 --> 00:56:06.360
<v Speaker 2>to get a big head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she realizes the traps and she's</v>

1312
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:09.930
<v Speaker 2>been fighting for world champions before</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she doesn't want to fall in that same</v>

1313
00:56:09.931 --> 00:56:11.460
<v Speaker 2>kind of Rut that Rhonda did.</v>

1314
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to give this fight to,</v>

1315
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:15.360
<v Speaker 2>let's say they do do it in July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>July,</v>

1316
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:20.410
<v Speaker 2>whatever the UFC 200 you give holly six</v>
<v Speaker 2>months to know exactly what Rhonda</v>

1317
00:56:21.031 --> 00:56:24.520
<v Speaker 2>brings to the table and train for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come up with a better game plan that she</v>

1318
00:56:24.521 --> 00:56:27.610
<v Speaker 2>had before and make sure that her</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning is on point,</v>

1319
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 2>makes your body's healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rehabilitate any possible injuries she</v>

1320
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:33.910
<v Speaker 2>might've had assessed to make sure she</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't overtrain but you got to</v>

1321
00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:35.380
<v Speaker 2>remember Rhonda shooting movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1322
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Holly Kia bud plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when has anybody ever overtrained at</v>

<v Speaker 2>about that kind of shit.</v>

1324

<v Speaker 2>Jackson is really fucking smart about</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>

1325
00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:49.060

<v Speaker 2>They've got some hardcore training</v>

1326
00:56:49.061 --> 00:56:50.490
<v Speaker 2>ethics in that gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Winkeljohn was a fantastic kickboxer.</v>

1328

<v Speaker 2>He's a really good coach and Jackson is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really good strategist and they've got</v>

<v Speaker 2>excellent training partners and you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>got all this motivation about their</v>

1330
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:05.830
<v Speaker 2>lineup.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You got Greg Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1332
00:57:06.941 --> 00:57:10.240
<v Speaker 2>He's like the fucking Yoda of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been doing it forever.</v>

1333
00:57:10.241 --> 00:57:12.920
<v Speaker 2>He's a genius game planner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he got winkle John,</v>

1334

<v Speaker 2>who's a phenomenal coach obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he got izzy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>who's my trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1340
00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:28.770
<v Speaker 2>With all that experience game planning</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1341
00:57:28.771 --> 00:57:30.190
<v Speaker 2>for somebody just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1342
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:33.050
<v Speaker 2>it's becoming a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I love about mma now is it,</v>

1343
00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:36.760
<v Speaker 2>it really is about your team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just the brains behind you as well.</v>

1344
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Just that strata has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be.</v>

1345
00:57:39.131 --> 00:57:41.230
<v Speaker 2>There are no lone wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1346
00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:45.310
<v Speaker 2>and I had a conversation with John</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he moved to Albuquerque.</v>

1347
00:57:45.311 --> 00:57:48.610
<v Speaker 2>We had this conversation with may or may</v>
<v Speaker 2>not have been smuggled marijuana.</v>

1348
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:51.800
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in my hotel room in Montreal and</v>

1349
00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:52.690
<v Speaker 2>if he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1350
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.640
<v Speaker 2>before he won the title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like way before,</v>

1351
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:55.750
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look dude,</v>

1352
00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:58.450
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an incredibly talented guy,</v>

1353
00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.970
<v Speaker 2>but you got to get all the right people.</v>

1354
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.550
<v Speaker 2>The only way to do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do it on your own because</v>

1355
00:58:03.551 --> 00:58:07.210
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a guy like you who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>also incredibly talented and that guys</v>

1356
00:58:07.211 --> 00:58:09.730
<v Speaker 2>can have the best team African.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's going to get the best</v>

1357
00:58:09.731 --> 00:58:12.580
<v Speaker 2>training partners and that guy's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have the best strategist and that</v>

1358
00:58:12.581 --> 00:58:14.710
<v Speaker 2>guy's going to beat you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might just beat you by an edge,</v>

1359
00:58:14.711 --> 00:58:18.190
<v Speaker 2>but that edge you could have overcome if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had all that same coaching.</v>

1360
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:22.330
<v Speaker 2>And I think a guy like John also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he grew up with two super athlete</v>

1361
00:58:22.331 --> 00:58:24.010
<v Speaker 2>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one older,</v>

1362
00:58:24.011 --> 00:58:27.460
<v Speaker 2>one younger freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think he recognizes that he's,</v>

1363
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.340
<v Speaker 2>he might be special compared to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>average person to his brother,</v>

1364
00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:35.260
<v Speaker 2>not even in his own house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His brother Arthur was doing mma.</v>

1365
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:39.670
<v Speaker 2>I on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like while he was playing for the NFL</v>

1366
00:58:39.671 --> 00:58:40.930
<v Speaker 2>and beaten John's ass job.</v>

1367
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:43.630
<v Speaker 2>John [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a heavyweight champ in high school.</v>

1368
00:58:43.631 --> 00:58:44.230
<v Speaker 2>His brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1369
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:46.890
<v Speaker 2>just pressing the fuck out of John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the youngest brothers,</v>

1370
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:49.750
<v Speaker 2>one of the best players in the NFL draft</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick.</v>

1371
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:53.170
<v Speaker 2>So I think I want an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John had a unique point of view as to</v>

1372
00:58:53.171 --> 00:58:56.590
<v Speaker 2>what freak athleticism really is and</v>
<v Speaker 2>about hard work and talent,</v>

1373
00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:57.453
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>

1374
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:02.700
<v Speaker 2>I think he just was getting by in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC without having to go 100% as far as</v>

1375
00:59:04.061 --> 00:59:07.060
<v Speaker 2>his training and his preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds going to be horrific.</v>

1376
00:59:07.061 --> 00:59:10.450
<v Speaker 2>If he really does get it really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll be the best of all time.</v>

1377
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Didn't he say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worst thing that happened to him was not</v>

1378
00:59:13.001 --> 00:59:15.100
<v Speaker 2>training for Gustafson and beating him</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

1379
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:18.220
<v Speaker 2>And he said that that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it was trouble.</v>

1380
00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:20.800
<v Speaker 2>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God I can do this and still get away</v>

1381
00:59:20.801 --> 00:59:22.640
<v Speaker 2>with you said it added and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

1382
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll just keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just speed.</v>

1383
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:28.070
<v Speaker 2>This guy who trained the best campy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are had in his life and I did nothing.</v>

1384
00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Still beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a freak.</v>

1385
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:31.401
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>

1386
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:35.150
<v Speaker 2>how many fighters going to incorporate a</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement coach now after connor doing</v>

1387
00:59:35.151 --> 00:59:39.130
<v Speaker 2>all that shit out of them before I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been obsessed with the Europa Pitaro for</v>

1388
00:59:39.131 --> 00:59:40.430
<v Speaker 2>I long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm,</v>

1389
00:59:40.431 --> 00:59:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessed with him and I'm also</v>
<v Speaker 2>assessed with that guy that I'm Carlos</v>

1390
00:59:44.121 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 2>condit uses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does that move nat stuff.</v>

1391
00:59:46.581 --> 00:59:48.620
<v Speaker 2>I was watching a video on him training</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

1392
00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.650
<v Speaker 2>see if he could find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I appreciate I retweeted it.</v>

1393
00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does all this crazy shit.</v>

1394
00:59:54.141 --> 00:59:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Like he's like doing chin ups with</v>
<v Speaker 2>trees,</v>

1395
00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:02.080
<v Speaker 2>like hanging off of trees and he's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance beam stuff and they're throwing</v>

1396
01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.420
<v Speaker 2>sticks at him and he's catching them</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's bouncing on stuff.</v>

1397
01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 2>He's Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's at common for stuff.</v>

1398
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:10.190
<v Speaker 2>He's even doing training specifically</v>
<v Speaker 2>for bow hunting.</v>

1399
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.120
<v Speaker 2>He's got like reps that he does for bow</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting while he's squatting and</v>

1400
01:00:14.121 --> 01:00:19.121
<v Speaker 2>standing up while holding a bow posture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to try to like solidify his balance</v>

1401
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:22.190
<v Speaker 2>in precarious positions on hillsides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do that.</v>

1402
01:00:22.191 --> 01:00:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Erin make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's like some of the weird stuff that</v>

1403
01:00:25.251 --> 01:00:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Carlos is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Carlos is a really fucking smart</v>

1404
01:00:29.511 --> 01:00:31.220
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really articulate.</v>

1405
01:00:31.221 --> 01:00:34.290
<v Speaker 2>So when he talked like let's play this</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we could hear it brings in the</v>

1406
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:35.900
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it to the beginning.</v>

1407
01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:39.470
<v Speaker 2>He's also been doing the same training</v>
<v Speaker 2>for about 20 years.</v>

1408
01:00:39.471 --> 01:00:41.840
<v Speaker 2>So this must be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring it to the beginning first please.</v>

1409
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.510
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

1410
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:46.570
<v Speaker 3>Somebody is watching a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the punches,</v>

1411
01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.740
<v Speaker 3>the kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the takedowns,</v>

1412
01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:51.070
<v Speaker 3>the grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what people are less aware of is,</v>

1413
01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:54.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a fighter to be in correct position</v>

1414
01:00:54.311 --> 01:00:59.311
<v Speaker 3>to execute a strike effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need to have mastery of their</v>

1415
01:00:59.741 --> 01:01:01.180
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their position,</v>

1416
01:01:01.181 --> 01:01:04.990
<v Speaker 3>of their balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's really what separates the</v>

1417
01:01:04.991 --> 01:01:07.800
<v Speaker 3>elite fighters from somebody who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1418
01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:12.910
<v Speaker 3>good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Irwin and I have been training for about</v>

1419
01:01:12.911 --> 01:01:14.920
<v Speaker 3>seven to eight months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People listening,</v>

1420
01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:18.520
<v Speaker 3>students walking outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>balancing on a log.</v>

1421
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the most challenging</v>
<v Speaker 3>things about training in nature is the</v>

1422
01:01:22.091 --> 01:01:23.080
<v Speaker 3>unpredictability.</v>

1423
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.140
<v Speaker 3>It's talking about hae suffered an acl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meniscus tear while signing move.</v>

1424
01:01:29.141 --> 01:01:34.141
<v Speaker 3>Nat definitely accelerated my recovery</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that I was not only doing these</v>

1425
01:01:34.931 --> 01:01:38.320
<v Speaker 3>movements and these different stretches</v>
<v Speaker 3>in physical therapy,</v>

1426
01:01:38.321 --> 01:01:43.321
<v Speaker 3>but also in my training sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Irwin and myself started training,</v>

1427
01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:48.310
<v Speaker 3>he looked at some of my previous fights</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he saw some things that my head</v>

1428
01:01:48.311 --> 01:01:52.300
<v Speaker 3>coach Greg Jackson saw independently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They saw the same exact thing,</v>

1429
01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:56.140
<v Speaker 3>but what was great with working with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Irwin and working in the movement that</v>

1430
01:01:56.141 --> 01:02:01.120
<v Speaker 3>program is he specifically had exercises</v>
<v Speaker 3>and drills to make those changes.</v>

1431
01:02:01.121 --> 01:02:02.170
<v Speaker 3>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1432
01:02:02.171 --> 01:02:05.590
<v Speaker 3>some of my other coaches saw that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to be made but weren't sure how</v>

1433
01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:09.340
<v Speaker 3>to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was extremely challenging for me.</v>

1434
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:15.510
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to relearn something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we may have lost that as adults having</v>

1435
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:19.120
<v Speaker 3>sat in chairs or having laid on a bench</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do,</v>

1436
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very linear stuff like bench press or</v>

1437
01:02:21.991 --> 01:02:23.130
<v Speaker 3>squat or whatever.</v>

1438
01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.880
<v Speaker 3>We've kind of lost that natural movement</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability and to gain it.</v>

1439
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 3>It takes a lot of focus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come home after I trained with Irwin</v>

1440
01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:35.700
<v Speaker 3>and I'm exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as we go on and I have made these</v>

1441
01:02:35.701 --> 01:02:40.701
<v Speaker 3>adjustments in my body has adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's less and less mentally taxing and</v>

1442
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:43.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more fun today.</v>

1443
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:48.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>today we had a blast for my last fight,</v>

1444
01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:51.690
<v Speaker 3>meaner when working specifically on</v>
<v Speaker 3>positioning of my body,</v>

1445
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.950
<v Speaker 3>lower level stability in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lower stance position of my feet,</v>

1446
01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:58.590
<v Speaker 3>which helped me move forward and</v>
<v Speaker 3>backward quicker,</v>

1447
01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:01.470
<v Speaker 3>which I think ultimately really helped</v>
<v Speaker 3>me with the victor,</v>

1448
01:03:01.471 --> 01:03:05.490
<v Speaker 3>I was able to move in and out of range</v>
<v Speaker 3>effectively and land strikes and</v>

1449
01:03:05.491 --> 01:03:07.340
<v Speaker 3>ultimately get the win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1450
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.720
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just for elite athletes,</v>

1451
01:03:09.721 --> 01:03:11.190
<v Speaker 3>it's for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for anybody.</v>

1452
01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:11.731
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1453
01:03:11.731 --> 01:03:12.564
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1454
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:16.020
<v Speaker 3>anybody who wants to get in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who wants to try something</v>

1455
01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:18.450
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you were in the lifting or you're</v>

1456
01:03:18.451 --> 01:03:20.730
<v Speaker 3>into yoga or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any different thing.</v>

1457
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.250
<v Speaker 3>I hear all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm plateauing,</v>

1458
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't move.</v>

1459
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have no power.</v>

1460
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to be the most functional</v>

1461
01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:36.150
<v Speaker 3>able bodied athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1462
01:03:36.151 --> 01:03:37.380

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got two boyfriends and by the way,</v>

1479

<v Speaker 1>cross counters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third boyfriend.</v>

1480
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:16.490
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard for me to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You line all those guys up in a jail</v>

1481
01:04:16.491 --> 01:04:17.960
<v Speaker 1>cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea who I got to choose,</v>

1482
01:04:17.961 --> 01:04:19.160

<v Speaker 1>Santa Monica the week before the fight,</v>

1542
01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.800
<v Speaker 1>depending on who he's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think these benefits,</v>

1543
01:06:32.801 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 1>these movements and learning how to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body like that,</v>

1544
01:06:35.411 --> 01:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>we'll definitely benefit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And benefits are all the,</v>

1545
01:06:38.331 --> 01:06:41.500
<v Speaker 1>keeps you from winning or losing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a balance.</v>

1549
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>That's some stupid course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe I'm just a hate.</v>

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you try?</v>

1598
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Why Saint?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're hating that hixson now.</v>

1599
01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:54.951
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1600
01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you'll have to qualify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

1601
01:08:58.231 --> 01:09:00.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying Hickson was doing and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this isn't,</v>

1602
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 2>you can't let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ain't chanting this route and was</v>

1603
01:09:02.751 --> 01:09:03.610
<v Speaker 2>doing camps.</v>

1604
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Bas rutten was doing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shavar did that.</v>

1605
01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Can't be in chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was in on chains and like,</v>

1606
01:09:08.961 --> 01:09:13.070
<v Speaker 2>fuck with his hair done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what is,</v>

1607
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:16.130
<v Speaker 2>what are you running from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you running from my now?</v>

1608
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can give it that guy</v>

1609
01:09:18.171 --> 01:09:19.940
<v Speaker 2>that much credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask you a question?</v>

1610
01:09:19.941 --> 01:09:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask you an honest question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not doing that.</v>

1611
01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:24.280
<v Speaker 2>We're saying the guy's impressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically and that it helped connor to</v>

1612
01:09:24.281 --> 01:09:26.600
<v Speaker 2>train with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously conor is not stupid.</v>

1613
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:29.900
<v Speaker 2>He's figured out how to become the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>champion with one punch.</v>

1614
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not a stupid guy.</v>

1615
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:34.640
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a marketing genius.</v>

1616
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 fives even more trouble.</v>

1617
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not cutting.</v>

1618
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that because a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of what gets him there is he cuts.</v>

1619
01:09:41.931 --> 01:09:42.764
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

1620
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1621
01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.250
<v Speaker 2>he looks like he looks shit dog shit at</v>
<v Speaker 2>45,</v>

1622
01:09:46.251 --> 01:09:48.560
<v Speaker 2>but whatever he does to rehydrate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next day,</v>

1623
01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:49.610
<v Speaker 2>he looks amazing.</v>

1624
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.280
<v Speaker 2>And he's done it with no ivy this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:54.770
<v Speaker 2>But think if he doesn't have cut all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that weight so he doesn't deplete his</v>

1626
01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:56.730
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's faster than all of these city</v>

1627
01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:59.060
<v Speaker 2>bigger guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take them down like Chad</v>

1628
01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:01.280
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got a moisture problem.</v>

1629
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Much bigger problem chat as a tiny guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in comparison to a lot of 55 or it's</v>

1630
01:10:05.471 --> 01:10:07.790
<v Speaker 2>like dos Anjos dos Anjos gets on top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1631
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:10.460
<v Speaker 2>That is a totally different world of</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics.</v>

1632
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.050
<v Speaker 2>And wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1633
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.830
<v Speaker 2>But you look at matchups like co Donald</v>
<v Speaker 2>serone phenomenal match up.</v>

1634
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Pettis.</v>

1635
01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your best match shows are great.</v>

1636
01:10:18.771 --> 01:10:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Match up certain match ups that 55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>

1637
01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.340
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100%.</v>

1638
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:23.331
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1639
01:10:23.331 --> 01:10:26.810
<v Speaker 2>I think if you think of dos Anjos wins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll fight.</v>

1640
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1641
01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:31.670
<v Speaker 2>It's only if calloway wins really cowboy</v>
<v Speaker 2>winds as the money.</v>

1642
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the medical,</v>

1643
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a mega fan.</v>

1644
01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Why do you guys say that w did not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if just Sandhya this way.</v>

1645
01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:40.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1646
01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking if he's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I think like Joe mentioned that</v>

1647
01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dos Anjos can put in that Chad Mendez</v>

1648
01:10:47.601 --> 01:10:51.920
<v Speaker 2>game plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll also dos Anjos hits fucking hard</v>

1649
01:10:51.921 --> 01:10:56.921
<v Speaker 2>and he's got nasty Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a fucking pressuring game.</v>

1650
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:59.960
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connor might laugh at it.</v>

1651
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Connor might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1652
01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:04.160
<v Speaker 2>like I got the solution to that look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Stevens,</v>

1653
01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:05.300
<v Speaker 2>doc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dude dead.</v>

1654
01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1655
01:11:07.721 --> 01:11:11.060
<v Speaker 2>it's very possible that connor might</v>
<v Speaker 2>just see holes in his game that we're</v>

1656
01:11:11.061 --> 01:11:15.680
<v Speaker 2>not seeing and he might be able to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think a big payday like dos Anjos</v>

1657
01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor's not a superstar fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1658
01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.080
<v Speaker 2>It's really not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is a superstar fight.</v>

1659
01:11:19.081 --> 01:11:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Whenever connor fights anybody and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a big challenge in front of him</v>

1660
01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:24.270
<v Speaker 2>fighting for the lightweight title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be a gigantic,</v>

1661
01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:24.990
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

1662
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:27.660
<v Speaker 2>College big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what color cow bully,</v>

1663
01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:31.950
<v Speaker 2>that's the bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If cowboy can win next Saturday against</v>

1664
01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:35.850
<v Speaker 2>dos Anjos would become the champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world that is the,</v>

1665
01:11:35.851 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 2>and I guarantee you they'll probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>call connor out,</v>

1666
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:39.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless they,</v>

1667
01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.850
<v Speaker 2>unless it was a crazy war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you want a rematch?</v>

1668
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like each other,</v>

1669
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:44.940
<v Speaker 2>but unless it's a crazy war and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1670
01:11:44.941 --> 01:11:46.470
<v Speaker 2>everybody says like you gotta do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1671
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:47.570
<v Speaker 2>And they both said we've got to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1672
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.500
<v Speaker 2>The UFC says they have to do again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1673
01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.830
<v Speaker 2>like this is like when people upset at</v>
<v Speaker 2>me about the Frankie Edgar thing,</v>

1674
01:11:52.831 --> 01:11:55.290
<v Speaker 2>like I don't get to call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not my choice.</v>

1675
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my opinion is just an opinion.</v>

1676
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I just see a guy get knocked dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1677
01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy can't fight for at least six</v>

1678
01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:05.910
<v Speaker 2>months at least and really shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting probably for a year.</v>

1679
01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.340
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't much of a fight I ride</v>
<v Speaker 2>with right away.</v>

1680
01:12:08.341 --> 01:12:08.701
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1681
01:12:08.701 --> 01:12:09.481
<v Speaker 2>Joe's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

1682
01:12:09.481 --> 01:12:11.110
<v Speaker 2>There's a rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I thought about,</v>

1683
01:12:11.111 --> 01:12:11.431
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1684
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:13.310
<v Speaker 2>they gave all these other champs</v>
<v Speaker 2>incident remains,</v>

1685
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.620
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't decane cain got knocked</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead two against junior dos Santos.</v>

1686
01:12:16.621 --> 01:12:17.640
<v Speaker 2>He had a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Foot.</v>

1687
01:12:17.641 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Keep people get saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get an instant rematch.</v>

1688
01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:20.483
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't.</v>

1689
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:23.580
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not More rematches then not.</v>

1690
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.490
<v Speaker 2>But he fought big foot Silva and by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1691
01:12:26.491 --> 01:12:28.920
<v Speaker 2>the Anderson Silva rematch to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon.</v>

1692
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:31.860
<v Speaker 2>And I said it and he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got lucky that he broke his leg.</v>

1693
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:33.570
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Obviously,</v>

1694
01:12:33.571 --> 01:12:36.210
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was getting beaten the fuck up.</v>

1695
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.690
<v Speaker 2>He got hurt real bad and the clinch</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weidman caught him with a punch in the</v>

1696
01:12:39.691 --> 01:12:41.340
<v Speaker 2>clinch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His legs went rubber.</v>

1697
01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:44.190
<v Speaker 2>He went to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he held on as much as he could and</v>

1698
01:12:44.191 --> 01:12:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Weidman beat the fuck out of him for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that first round.</v>

1699
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.020
<v Speaker 2>And then Anderson threw that kick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke his leg.</v>

1700
01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:52.830
<v Speaker 2>And it was almost fortunate that he went</v>
<v Speaker 2>out like that because why?</v>

1701
01:12:52.831 --> 01:12:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Mum's going to beat his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson was not able to take a punch</v>

1702
01:12:56.731 --> 01:13:00.360
<v Speaker 2>anymore the same way he used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson used to eat punches.</v>

1703
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Watch the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to watch a crazy fucking fight.</v>

1704
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Watch his fight with Jorge Rivera where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lets rivera punch him in the face.</v>

1705
01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Really lets him just punch with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good in front of Rivera.</v>

1706
01:13:10.711 --> 01:13:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Let them pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

1707
01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Hey Rivera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jorge Rivera versus Anderson Silva in</v>

1708
01:13:15.631 --> 01:13:19.060
<v Speaker 2>cage wars in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before Anderson came to the</v>

1709
01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:23.550
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a gigantic Anderson Silva Fan long</v>

1710
01:13:23.551 --> 01:13:28.551
<v Speaker 2>before everyone that title I will you</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch my calling the fight against Chris</v>

1711
01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Weidman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid in a fucking candy store</v>

1712
01:13:30.901 --> 01:13:32.850
<v Speaker 2>because he wasn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't a new guy to me.</v>

1713
01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Like you're saying when he fought Chris</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leben who I say Weidman,</v>

1714
01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I meant [inaudible] sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he fought Chris Leben,</v>

1715
01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:40.260
<v Speaker 2>when he came to central seating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy.</v>

1716
01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid in a candy store cause I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fuck this.</v>

1717
01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:45.190
<v Speaker 2>This guy is a different kind of stryker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1718
01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:48.420
<v Speaker 2>this is a whole different animal you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with like in Lehman's gonna come</v>

1719
01:13:48.421 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Face first.</v>

1720
01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.590
<v Speaker 2>The tailor made</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1721
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:56.910
<v Speaker 2>So Jorge Rivera who was on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is a fucking hard punch,</v>

1722
01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:00.840
<v Speaker 2>good hand and Anderson standing right in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of them and there's a one point in</v>

1723
01:14:00.841 --> 01:14:02.610
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long does this fight go,</v>

1724
01:14:02.611 --> 01:14:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes.</v>

1725
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:07.020
<v Speaker 2>There's one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight before Anderson knocks him out</v>

1726
01:14:07.021 --> 01:14:10.800
<v Speaker 2>where Anderson stands right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and literally lets him punch him in</v>

1727
01:14:10.801 --> 01:14:14.410
<v Speaker 2>the face and Markdale [inaudible] who</v>
<v Speaker 2>was with Jorge was like,</v>

1728
01:14:14.411 --> 01:14:15.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1729
01:14:15.301 --> 01:14:16.134
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1730
01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.133
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1731
01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.530
<v Speaker 2>You should hear mark talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark.</v>

1732
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:23.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a hilarious mark talks about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love that guy.</v>

1733
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:24.970
<v Speaker 2>He's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1734
01:14:24.971 --> 01:14:28.900
<v Speaker 2>mark was also agreeing with me that all</v>
<v Speaker 2>though look different physically.</v>

1735
01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks smooth,</v>

1736
01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:32.740
<v Speaker 2>he looks the entire world except for</v>
<v Speaker 2>South America.</v>

1737
01:14:32.741 --> 01:14:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Agreed with you joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1738
01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:35.750
<v Speaker 2>there's some people on the underground</v>
<v Speaker 2>that disagree.</v>

1739
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:38.710
<v Speaker 2>We call Zack cody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just when you see a guy,</v>

1740
01:14:38.711 --> 01:14:41.440
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to tell from a a still photo</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1741
01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:46.450
<v Speaker 2>A lot of what you see is in movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see like in the like they don't look</v>

1742
01:14:46.451 --> 01:14:49.060
<v Speaker 2>as as explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the still photo,</v>

1743
01:14:49.061 --> 01:14:51.310
<v Speaker 2>it shows a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not much.</v>

1744
01:14:51.311 --> 01:14:52.144
<v Speaker 2>It could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1745
01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:54.250
<v Speaker 2>it could have been attributable to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardio.</v>

1746
01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean is let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1747
01:14:56.111 --> 01:14:57.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence at all.</v>

1748
01:14:57.121 --> 01:14:58.180
<v Speaker 2>They'll ever did steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1749
01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:02.620
<v Speaker 2>So let's say he never did steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say he just did way more cardio</v>

1750
01:15:02.621 --> 01:15:06.340
<v Speaker 2>for that fight and didn't do nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much strength training and that's what</v>

1751
01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:07.780
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference in the way it</v>

1752
01:15:07.781 --> 01:15:10.660
<v Speaker 2>looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Silva was the biggest,</v>

1753
01:15:10.661 --> 01:15:15.320
<v Speaker 2>that was the big contrast and the door</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course [inaudible] it's public,</v>

1754
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:17.560
<v Speaker 2>but the tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knew to look for it.</v>

1755
01:15:17.561 --> 01:15:19.690
<v Speaker 2>We knew it was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We knew about the testing,</v>

1756
01:15:19.691 --> 01:15:21.460
<v Speaker 2>we knew about everything with Eric</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silver.</v>

1757
01:15:21.461 --> 01:15:22.810
<v Speaker 2>You're like hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1758
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:25.930
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so bonded out with that apple</v>

1759
01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:30.010
<v Speaker 2>bottom and everything too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he walks in and he's taught here,</v>

1760
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:33.820
<v Speaker 2>when he walked into the octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was literally like a scooby doo sound</v>

1761
01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:37.710
<v Speaker 2>all across the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canny panty drawer.</v>

1762
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.823
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1763
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:40.510
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>

1764
01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.190
<v Speaker 2>In the last fight crisis in the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

1765
01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:47.260
<v Speaker 2>last buys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>melted cheese,</v>

1766
01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:48.430
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't make any sense.</v>

1767
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:51.640
<v Speaker 2>But again it could have been that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed his approach.</v>

1768
01:15:51.641 --> 01:15:54.290
<v Speaker 2>He decided his gas and out in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights like against Matt Brown,</v>

1769
01:15:54.291 --> 01:15:58.840
<v Speaker 2>he gassed out and he has all this muscle</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this power and he's always going</v>

1770
01:15:58.841 --> 01:16:01.060
<v Speaker 2>for it and he is a young guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't even 30 years old.</v>

1771
01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:05.410
<v Speaker 2>It is possible that he just changed his</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire approach.</v>

1772
01:16:05.411 --> 01:16:08.050
<v Speaker 2>No more strength and conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only just training,</v>

1773
01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:12.130
<v Speaker 2>only cardio from a sparring and from you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1774
01:16:12.131 --> 01:16:14.350
<v Speaker 2>repetition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's totally possible.</v>

1775
01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:17.080
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible elster over him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he got busted,</v>

1776
01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:20.320
<v Speaker 2>it was in this protein shake to look how</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful Anderson's movement.</v>

1777
01:16:20.321 --> 01:16:20.651
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1778
01:16:20.651 --> 01:16:24.110
<v Speaker 2>he checked that kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all like automatic when he</v>

1779
01:16:24.111 --> 01:16:25.750
<v Speaker 2>was in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1780
01:16:25.751 --> 01:16:28.930
<v Speaker 2>he didn't come to the UFC until,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was like 35 man,</v>

1781
01:16:28.931 --> 01:16:30.490
<v Speaker 2>look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going to retire with four is</v>

1782
01:16:30.491 --> 01:16:31.090
<v Speaker 2>going to retire.</v>

1783
01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:32.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked them out of it.</v>

1784
01:16:32.261 --> 01:16:34.520
<v Speaker 2>How old was he when he came to the UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His third tour?</v>

1785
01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was 32 you might be right</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1786
01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I know he's going to retire and he might</v>
<v Speaker 2>be right.</v>

1787
01:16:39.921 --> 01:16:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Eggnog talked them out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like you have to fight.</v>

1788
01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:44.170
<v Speaker 2>While he had had some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1789
01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.480
<v Speaker 2>crazy tough fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also had a falling out with shoot the</v>

1790
01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:47.770
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surprise.</v>

1791
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.170
<v Speaker 2>He's not retiring now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

1792
01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:52.790
<v Speaker 2>why do you think he still went to Moitai</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dream Team and it be like he,</v>

1793
01:16:52.791 --> 01:16:55.570
<v Speaker 2>they created a team and he didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>good training partners and there was a</v>

1794
01:16:55.571 --> 01:16:58.420
<v Speaker 2>lot of shit going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he pulled it together right when he</v>

1795
01:16:58.421 --> 01:17:00.340
<v Speaker 2>came to the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traditi ever.</v>

1796
01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.080
<v Speaker 2>And will he pull it together in cage</v>
<v Speaker 2>wars?</v>

1797
01:17:02.081 --> 01:17:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he came to the UFC after that.</v>

1798
01:17:04.341 --> 01:17:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I remember he was about to fight Roy</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones and then everyone's like,</v>

1799
01:17:06.881 --> 01:17:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have been so ridiculous.</v>

1800
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Been awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got</v>

1801
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.990
<v Speaker 1>lit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been awesome.</v>

1802
01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wake up call to a lot of MMA fighters.</v>

1803
01:17:15.291 --> 01:17:17.030
<v Speaker 1>They think they can box with the garlic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones.</v>

1804
01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>

1805
01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 1>get knocked down in the fourth round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1806
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:24.480
<v Speaker 1>stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a head lead commentate on HBO.</v>

1807
01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1808
01:17:25.751 --> 01:17:28.180
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's going to fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his commentary for sure.</v>

1809
01:17:28.230 --> 01:17:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent not going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk that good after that knockout.</v>

1810
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a while before he recovered</v>

1811
01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.440
<v Speaker 1>that he's had like five of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1812
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:38.060
<v Speaker 1>unless he's getting paid crazy amounts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money,</v>

1813
01:17:38.061 --> 01:17:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't get why he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one really watched it blinked.</v>

1814
01:17:40.361 --> 01:17:41.840
<v Speaker 1>The reason we watched cause he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>highlight,</v>

1815
01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:42.780
<v Speaker 1>knockout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1816
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:47.090
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile Jorge Rivera did a lot better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than rich Franklin.</v>

1817
01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.710
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sure did.</v>

1818
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I figured out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1819
01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Jorge's it Moitai guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured out how to fight Anderson from</v>

1820
01:17:52.491 --> 01:17:56.480
<v Speaker 1>the clinch Anderson like at this point</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fight is sorta just chipping away</v>

1821
01:17:56.481 --> 01:17:57.314
<v Speaker 1>at them.</v>

1822
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:59.780
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much more time is in this fight?</v>

1823
01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:00.860
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we at?</v>

1824
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:03.350
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment before the fights dot.</v>

1825
01:18:03.351 --> 01:18:05.200
<v Speaker 1>That nice knee to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1826

<v Speaker 1>this is Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really in his prime.</v>

1827
01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:12.100
<v Speaker 1>So you see Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Jones shadowbox into yeah,</v>

1828
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.030
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting,</v>

1829
01:18:14.031 --> 01:18:16.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addison against that of rockhold called</v>

1830
01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Luke rockhold beat him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

1831
01:18:18.081 --> 01:18:20.750
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's over.</v>

1832
01:18:20.751 --> 01:18:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The champ,</v>

1833
01:18:22.071 --> 01:18:24.950
<v Speaker 1>the new crown champions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old Anderson Silva.</v>

1834
01:18:24.951 --> 01:18:25.771
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson's,</v>

1835
01:18:25.771 --> 01:18:26.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1836
01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.120
<v Speaker 1>look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

1837
01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.910
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1838
01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:31.530
<v Speaker 1>you're crunk for the Ken Shamrock Holy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Space.</v>

1839
01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:35.900
<v Speaker 1>You fight to Anderson took them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you are on testosterone</v>

1840
01:18:35.901 --> 01:18:37.700
<v Speaker 1>replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hit your late thirties like</v>

1841
01:18:37.701 --> 01:18:40.000
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no way you can't compete.</v>

1842
01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I compete in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1843
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:44.120
<v Speaker 1>if you got Anderson on the Vito Belfort</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet,</v>

1844
01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:48.070
<v Speaker 1>I think Anderson goes back in there like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a demon and,</v>

1845
01:18:48.071 --> 01:18:50.720
<v Speaker 1>and who knows who he can beat until his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1846
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:54.650
<v Speaker 1>40th fucking birthday or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be when the wheels fall off.</v>

1847
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:57.590
<v Speaker 1>But Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're talking about a guy who was</v>

1848
01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:02.890
<v Speaker 1>brutally owed by Chris Weidman and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the second fight had a seriously hard</v>

1849
01:19:03.111 --> 01:19:05.690
<v Speaker 1>time staying conscious from a punch in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clinch.</v>

1850
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:07.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

1851
01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the body can only take so much</v>

1852
01:19:10.491 --> 01:19:11.720
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he took it all.</v>

1853
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Victoria Anderson makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's where it gets,</v>

1854
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:18.440
<v Speaker 1>here's towards the end of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the second round where I'm</v>

1855
01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:20.120
<v Speaker 1>pretty sure he stopped him the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

1856
01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:21.253
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1857
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:24.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a point where it's just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me start.</v>

1858
01:19:24.231 --> 01:19:26.810

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1859
01:19:26.811 --> 01:19:29.390

<v Speaker 1>could find it because it's fucking</v>

1860
01:19:29.391 --> 01:19:31.760
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andersen to standing of fraud of them.</v>

1911
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I speak very clearly and I tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>clarify everything he says.</v>

1912
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Like when he fought,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I had a long conversation with them.</v>

1915
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.070

01:21:47.071 --> 01:21:49.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to find out what he's saying.</v>

01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:45.600
<v Speaker 2>It was Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John John's manager.</v>

1939
01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Great guy though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

1940
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's the idea of like what your son,</v>

1941
01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.170
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to talk for John.</v>

1942
01:22:55.171 --> 01:22:56.750
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1943
01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what's going on in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

1944
01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:02.070
<v Speaker 2>but go fuck cheese out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor guy.</v>

1945
01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:07.330
<v Speaker 2>He got tortured online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people were mad at him like even</v>

1946
01:23:07.331 --> 01:23:11.380
<v Speaker 2>like reputable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sports broadcasters were tweeting</v>

1947
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:14.620
<v Speaker 2>at how are horrendous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he said was and terrible.</v>

1948
01:23:14.621 --> 01:23:18.070
<v Speaker 2>What he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking yelling at my computer.</v>

1949
01:23:18.071 --> 01:23:18.970
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget.</v>

1950
01:23:18.971 --> 01:23:22.870
<v Speaker 2>He says the same gags that do the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ranking and they can't even get your oil</v>

1951
01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:23.800
<v Speaker 2>shit straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1952
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:26.190
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do tr under the rankings kings.</v>

1953
01:23:26.670 --> 01:23:30.570
<v Speaker 2>How's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be an undercut or no,</v>

1954
01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.950
<v Speaker 2>let's do the rankings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure,</v>

1955
01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:34.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some some head journalists.</v>

1956
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:40.070
<v Speaker 2>What do you do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>who does it make more sense?</v>

1957
01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryan seacrest who does the ranking?</v>

1958
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where does that,</v>

1959
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:45.850
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the people,</v>

1960
01:23:45.851 --> 01:23:48.160
<v Speaker 2>who are the people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reikis aren't that horrible.</v>

1961
01:23:48.161 --> 01:23:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I just think that when you know someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Uriah Hall knocks out Gig Arbonne</v>

1962
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Saucy and he's below him on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rankings,</v>

1963
01:23:54.041 --> 01:23:54.910
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking stupid.</v>

1964
01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Well you know the UFC brass was like we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't do the rankings because it's some</v>

1965
01:23:58.571 --> 01:24:00.070
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause whenever they're going to do,</v>

1966
01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.920
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do pay dictate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's based off your ranking.</v>

1967
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.780
<v Speaker 2>And then that was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they're like,</v>

1968
01:24:04.781 --> 01:24:06.820
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't do that because bill,</v>

1969
01:24:06.821 --> 01:24:10.790
<v Speaker 2>he's a huge fan of whoever he's lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven in a row and they want to ranking</v>

1970
01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:14.050
<v Speaker 2>number 10 do you have any idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you guys have any idea how much a</v>

1971
01:24:14.051 --> 01:24:16.600
<v Speaker 2>veteran makes off a UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I off the robot.</v>

1972
01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Let's not even talking about it cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll start throwing up on my keyboard</v>

1973
01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.310
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1974
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.230
<v Speaker 2>that's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1975
01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Can I do a positive spin though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit on Reebok so much.</v>

1976
01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Can I do a positive one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dug the mcgregor trunks,</v>

1977
01:24:29.710 --> 01:24:34.120
<v Speaker 2>the green and gold trunks and all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>black and gold for the first time ever.</v>

1978
01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.160
<v Speaker 2>First time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1979
01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:37.510
<v Speaker 2>those look good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they were there,</v>

1980
01:24:37.511 --> 01:24:39.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're responding to criticism and</v>

1981
01:24:39.101 --> 01:24:41.230
<v Speaker 2>doing a good job of responding to</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism.</v>

1982
01:24:41.231 --> 01:24:43.780
<v Speaker 2>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the whole,</v>

1983
01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:48.340
<v Speaker 2>the real reality of this whole situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it could have been all been</v>

1984
01:24:48.341 --> 01:24:50.140
<v Speaker 2>handled better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody would agree to that.</v>

1985
01:24:50.530 --> 01:24:53.740
<v Speaker 2>And I think the fighters are very</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointed at their lack of ability to</v>

1986
01:24:53.741 --> 01:24:56.620
<v Speaker 2>be autonomous as far as like how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>money they can make from sponsors.</v>

1987
01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.530
<v Speaker 2>And like you're the perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1988
01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've used you as an example and you</v>

1989
01:25:01.571 --> 01:25:03.130
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people said that you weren't telling the</v>

1990
01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:06.520
<v Speaker 2>truth and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we know that that's not not correct.</v>

1991
01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:09.370
<v Speaker 2>You brought me my fund,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your financials,</v>

1992
01:25:09.371 --> 01:25:11.230
<v Speaker 2>and I brought them to the fucking top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1993
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:14.550
<v Speaker 2>And we had a nice conversation about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that it's,</v>

1994
01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:17.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an unfortunate reality that we're</v>

1995
01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:18.520
<v Speaker 2>going to have to live with now.</v>

1996
01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:21.850
<v Speaker 2>And I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see out of this is,</v>

1997
01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean the argument against it was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are having condom depo on their</v>

1998
01:25:24.641 --> 01:25:25.780
<v Speaker 2>trunks on that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1999
01:25:25.781 --> 01:25:28.840
<v Speaker 2>well how about don't have condom depot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you have you,</v>

2000
01:25:28.841 --> 01:25:30.730
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make a very specific like,</v>

2001
01:25:30.731 --> 01:25:32.500
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get all the sponsors you want,</v>

2002
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:35.770
<v Speaker 2>but you can't have anything that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be bad for the image of the UFC.</v>

2003
01:25:35.771 --> 01:25:37.390
<v Speaker 2>This is what we think are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why Khan,</v>

2004
01:25:37.391 --> 01:25:40.420
<v Speaker 2>which is what they did by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why condoms will be bad.</v>

2005
01:25:40.421 --> 01:25:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Is it bad to not get aids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what it was.</v>

2006
01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.360
<v Speaker 2>It was bandaid depot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that be okay?</v>

2007
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:51.690
<v Speaker 2>But aspirin depot was that okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to submit your sponsors to</v>

2008
01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.540
<v Speaker 2>check them off so you weren't allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol,</v>

2009
01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:57.760
<v Speaker 2>tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything competed with the UFC.</v>

2010
01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Did anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it really diminish the entertainment</v>

2011
01:26:01.211 --> 01:26:04.580
<v Speaker 2>value for anybody when someone was</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking with dynamic fastener on their</v>

2012
01:26:04.581 --> 01:26:06.680
<v Speaker 2>shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he give a fuck at all?</v>

2013
01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:10.370
<v Speaker 2>I will never give a fuck if Chris</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weidman was walking to the octagon and</v>

2014
01:26:10.371 --> 01:26:14.480
<v Speaker 2>he had muscle farm or fucking fill in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blank,</v>

2015
01:26:14.481 --> 01:26:16.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking where all those logos now</v>

2016
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.140
<v Speaker 2>they're on the mat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what bonds.</v>

2017
01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the map looks like a nascar.</v>

2018
01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.200
<v Speaker 2>The fighters are in black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're a champ looking like</v>

2019
01:26:24.201 --> 01:26:26.540
<v Speaker 2>assholes get not getting paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only issue I have with it.</v>

2020
01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely something to be said</v>

2021
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:32.240
<v Speaker 2>about that because none of that money is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going towards the fighters and the</v>

2022
01:26:32.370 --> 01:26:34.460
<v Speaker 2>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's changed besides</v>

2023
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:37.910
<v Speaker 2>the fighters look in plain as fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>black and white is the matte looks like</v>

2024
01:26:37.911 --> 01:26:39.380
<v Speaker 2>a fucking toys are us now.</v>

2025
01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a real,</v>

2026
01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:42.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>option,</v>

2027
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:47.570
<v Speaker 2>a real possibility for fighters to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>super involved in social media and put</v>

2028
01:26:47.571 --> 01:26:50.700
<v Speaker 2>out a lot of videos and get people</v>
<v Speaker 2>excel.</v>

2029
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:54.550
<v Speaker 2>If you put out a lot of content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people respond and they loved like this.</v>

2030
01:26:54.570 --> 01:26:56.140
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that I follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2031
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:58.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that I follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know Ross training,</v>

2032
01:26:58.071 --> 01:26:59.870
<v Speaker 2>you know at Ross training guy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram?</v>

2033
01:26:59.930 --> 01:27:02.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is like some pretty uh,</v>

2034
01:27:02.171 --> 01:27:03.340
<v Speaker 2>intense,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's got all these great workout things</v>

2036
01:27:05.691 --> 01:27:08.060
<v Speaker 2>that he does on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I follow that guy all the time.</v>

2037
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:11.720
<v Speaker 2>If he was a fighter and he had all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people following him all the time,</v>

2038
01:27:11.721 --> 01:27:14.390
<v Speaker 2>or a lot of other guys that do these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things where girls who do these things</v>

2039
01:27:14.391 --> 01:27:15.530
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that will girls,</v>

2040
01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:16.700
<v Speaker 2>they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't look at their asses.</v>

2041
01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I followed Jeff.</v>

2042
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I know you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>get his head.</v>

2043
01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.690
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] the way I talk when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about either mortality or voice</v>

2044
01:27:25.691 --> 01:27:28.550
<v Speaker 2>just got too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that what it gives an</v>

2045
01:27:28.551 --> 01:27:32.750
<v Speaker 2>opportunity for fighters to adjust and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adjustment is to concentrate or have</v>

2046
01:27:32.751 --> 01:27:34.970
<v Speaker 2>someone that works where you concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>on social media,</v>

2047
01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.910
<v Speaker 2>put out a lot of content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know miles jury does a lot of shit</v>

2048
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:38.930
<v Speaker 2>bomber though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is about,</v>

2049
01:27:38.931 --> 01:27:41.300
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't have to do it.</v>

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.690
<v Speaker 2>My buddy went to a soccer game in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ireland.</v>

2283
01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:31.340
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't get to the stadium.</v>

2284
01:37:31.341 --> 01:37:33.080
<v Speaker 2>There were so many fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was nuts.</v>

2285
01:37:33.450 --> 01:37:34.880
<v Speaker 2>It's just what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2286
01:37:34.881 --> 01:37:37.630
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be like a big ass movie stars.</v>

2287
01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says he's gotten offers.</v>

2288
01:37:39.801 --> 01:37:43.760
<v Speaker 2>He's not hold him for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what he's doing is smart and</v>

2289
01:37:43.761 --> 01:37:46.820
<v Speaker 2>what Rondo did was not smart in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>regard,</v>

2290
01:37:46.821 --> 01:37:49.790
<v Speaker 2>that she got distracted and spread</v>
<v Speaker 2>herself thin.</v>

2291
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Took all of that short money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2292
01:37:51.931 --> 01:37:53.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but took it all.</v>

2293
01:37:54.230 --> 01:37:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Khan or like no danks</v>

2294
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any more than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it made a difference.</v>

2295
01:37:58.771 --> 01:38:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I think Holly Holm is a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

2296
01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I think she met a different file.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly made a difference.</v>

2297
01:38:03.451 --> 01:38:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you distract yourself,</v>

2298
01:38:05.191 --> 01:38:07.060
<v Speaker 1>you are distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I understand.</v>

2299
01:38:07.130 --> 01:38:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what this is Brian standing up</v>

2300
01:38:11.671 --> 01:38:14.010
<v Speaker 1>for distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holly Holm is a hot,</v>

2301
01:38:14.011 --> 01:38:16.590
<v Speaker 1>much higher level striker and would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been regardless.</v>

2302
01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

2303
01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2304
01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:20.700
<v Speaker 1>you can come meet with somebody like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2305
01:38:20.701 --> 01:38:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Who's that far advanced as a striker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2306
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:25.200
<v Speaker 1>certainly not striking and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger than Rhonda.</v>

2307
01:38:25.201 --> 01:38:27.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looked like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's drunk as fuck.</v>

2308
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>

2309
01:38:28.051 --> 01:38:29.790
<v Speaker 1>she's definitely leaner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2310
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:34.290
<v Speaker 1>and it looks more muscular and bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's fought as high as 152 pounds.</v>

2311
01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:37.230
<v Speaker 1>And Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

2312
01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:39.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not a big double leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single lecture.</v>

2313
01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:40.760
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a junior person who just got to</v>

2314
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:44.220
<v Speaker 1>get her hips close to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when she has people who in her camp,</v>

2315
01:38:44.610 --> 01:38:46.890
<v Speaker 1>like this guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he or whoever it is who can neutralize</v>

2316
01:38:46.891 --> 01:38:48.270
<v Speaker 1>that judo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push your hips away,</v>

2317
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:51.930
<v Speaker 1>drop level when she gets close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no drop in levels.</v>

2318
01:38:51.931 --> 01:38:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the big thing,</v>

2319
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:57.240
<v Speaker 1>they just avoided that left arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda always ties up with that left</v>

2320
01:38:57.241 --> 01:38:57.630
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2321
01:38:57.630 --> 01:39:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean she does the same approach and</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of our fights and it works on</v>

2322
01:39:00.961 --> 01:39:03.930
<v Speaker 1>this amateur and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of putting it.</v>

2323
01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not to say that like she doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have other approaches,</v>

2324
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:11.100
<v Speaker 1>but that is the approach that she's most</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with and she goes to more</v>

2325
01:39:11.101 --> 01:39:13.080
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it wasn't working,</v>

2326
01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:15.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck you that you had,</v>

2327
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:20.630
<v Speaker 1>you had that camp game planning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've seen a lot and I feel like</v>

2328
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:24.390
<v Speaker 1>they've gained plan for very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good fighters who are men who have</v>

2329
01:39:24.450 --> 01:39:25.740
<v Speaker 1>a lot more complex.</v>

2330
01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.010
<v Speaker 1>And Rhonda for those guys was probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>much easier to game plan.</v>

2331
01:39:29.011 --> 01:39:30.750
<v Speaker 1>And then they had holly Holm who has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been striking.</v>

2332
01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2333
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:36.520
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2334
01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:38.750
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old men like the guy's eyes.</v>

2335
01:39:38.751 --> 01:39:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I fuck guys like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2336
01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:41.610
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2337
01:39:41.611 --> 01:39:42.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2338
01:39:42.961 --> 01:39:44.510
<v Speaker 1>I just heard he came out of the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2339
01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.760
<v Speaker 1>that's what I heard from eve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't Rhonda doing movies and these</v>

2340
01:39:47.761 --> 01:39:48.930
<v Speaker 1>distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2341
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:50.250
<v Speaker 1>that's on her team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not wrong.</v>

2342
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:51.143
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>

2343
01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:51.871
<v Speaker 1>you should do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2344
01:39:51.871 --> 01:39:54.570
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so much better than we know that</v>

2345
01:39:54.571 --> 01:39:56.580
<v Speaker 1>she's got some shit advice coming her</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2346
01:39:56.790 --> 01:40:00.060
<v Speaker 1>But what is from a lot of people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2347
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:01.980
<v Speaker 1>What is her camp like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've,</v>

2348
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:03.660
<v Speaker 1>you've been close to her while she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

2349
01:40:03.661 --> 01:40:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Like what is her camp like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2350
01:40:05.890 --> 01:40:07.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna go into crazy detail.</v>

2351
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:11.910
<v Speaker 1>All I know she works harder than anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if she gets with the right people,</v>

2352
01:40:11.911 --> 01:40:14.250
<v Speaker 1>she's going to be a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she gets with the right team that</v>

2353
01:40:14.251 --> 01:40:16.350
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe don't do this movie right now,</v>

2354
01:40:16.351 --> 01:40:18.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe let's save this move after you</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat holly.</v>

2355
01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Maybe let's do this then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a problem now too,</v>

2356
01:40:21.331 --> 01:40:23.480
<v Speaker 1>because if she's prepping for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rematches and she,</v>

2357
01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:27.390
<v Speaker 1>we're about to go do that roadhouse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and isn't a problem.</v>

2358
01:40:27.391 --> 01:40:30.500
<v Speaker 1>That roadhouse movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like movies are hard to sell when you're</v>

2359
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:33.090
<v Speaker 1>a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the world knows and that your last</v>

2360
01:40:33.091 --> 01:40:34.690
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got flat lined.</v>

2361
01:40:35.010 --> 01:40:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I would suggest it wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising to me the way Hollywood</v>

2362
01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood works there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they go.</v>

2363
01:40:40.711 --> 01:40:43.800
<v Speaker 1>A lot of this movie is built on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>being the baddest girl on the planet and</v>

2364
01:40:43.801 --> 01:40:46.800
<v Speaker 1>undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be surprised if sometimes those</v>

2365
01:40:46.801 --> 01:40:50.220
<v Speaker 1>kinds of movies fall through or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>downgrade or maybe they just don't</v>

2366
01:40:50.221 --> 01:40:52.620
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what kind of contract is</v>

2367
01:40:52.621 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got like big</v>

2368
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.860
<v Speaker 2>time movie agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a wonder if that was like built in</v>

2369
01:40:56.861 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 2>protection against that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would assume there is.</v>

2370
01:40:59.230 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 2>If I'm Dana White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go look at me,</v>

2371
01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:05.020
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing amy fucking movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your contracts with us.</v>

2372
01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:06.850
<v Speaker 2>We're not giving permission to do any of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2373
01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:10.030
<v Speaker 2>So anyone who says yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make a movie and still beat</v>

2374
01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Holly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fire right now.</v>

2375
01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do this and still do and still</v>

2376
01:41:14.861 --> 01:41:17.530
<v Speaker 2>be world champion is full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not true.</v>

2377
01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:20.710
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about her fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>holly in July?</v>

2378
01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2379
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck she going to do if you</v>

2380
01:41:28.961 --> 01:41:29.650
<v Speaker 2>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she'd make,</v>

2381
01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:32.370
<v Speaker 2>if she's filming roadhouse while Holly's</v>
<v Speaker 2>focused,</v>

2382
01:41:32.371 --> 01:41:33.430
<v Speaker 2>like you just talked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call you the other day,</v>

2383
01:41:33.431 --> 01:41:34.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well she wanted to train.</v>

2384
01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.880
<v Speaker 2>She wants to go right back to the gym</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the fight.</v>

2385
01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She might have gone to a fucking hotel</v>

2386
01:41:39.131 --> 01:41:43.090
<v Speaker 2>room and hit pads and Rhonda can eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>solid foods and then she's going to make</v>

2387
01:41:43.091 --> 01:41:47.230
<v Speaker 2>a movie and then jump into camp in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same camp that has been telling her to</v>

2388
01:41:47.231 --> 01:41:48.640
<v Speaker 2>do all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2389
01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.170
<v Speaker 2>and the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2390

<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2391
01:41:52.330 --> 01:41:55.630
<v Speaker 2>God blessed her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully shit works out but it's a</v>

2392
01:41:55.631 --> 01:41:57.780
<v Speaker 2>mother fucker man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a motherfucker,</v>

2393
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:59.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to get ready for a fight</v>

2394
01:41:59.441 --> 01:42:02.800
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would want to go through a battery</v>

2395
01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:06.010
<v Speaker 2>of physical tests like as far as your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain goes,</v>

2396
01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:11.640
<v Speaker 2>cat scans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mris like that was a fucking wall up she</v>

2397
01:42:11.711 --> 01:42:13.960
<v Speaker 2>took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you know,</v>

2398
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.690
<v Speaker 2>well I've had people on like Doctor</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda,</v>

2399
01:42:16.691 --> 01:42:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Patrick and Dr. Mark Gordon who talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the damage to the pituitary gland</v>

2400
01:42:20.621 --> 01:42:24.700
<v Speaker 2>and what happens when you get chaos like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and how important rest is in</v>

2401
01:42:24.701 --> 01:42:27.850
<v Speaker 2>recovery and how long it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recover from something like that.</v>

2402
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:30.370
<v Speaker 2>And then we saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Anderson fight that we're just</v>

2403
01:42:30.371 --> 01:42:32.420
<v Speaker 2>talking about how Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's take this tremendous punch.</v>

2404
01:42:32.421 --> 01:42:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Then he fought Weidman and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't the same guy anymore.</v>

2405
01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Like to jump right back in like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>

2406
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:41.410
<v Speaker 2>look at Mendez to Mendez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets knocked out by connor,</v>

2407
01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:43.750
<v Speaker 2>gets right back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never seen him get dropped.</v>

2408
01:42:43.751 --> 01:42:46.190
<v Speaker 2>So he's not just drop flatline with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>file.</v>

2409
01:42:46.610 --> 01:42:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2410
01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean he came back and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and frank,</v>

2411
01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.020
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2412
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Frankie's a motherfucker man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He throws combos and he's very active</v>

2413
01:42:53.381 --> 01:42:54.310
<v Speaker 2>and he stays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2414
01:42:54.311 --> 01:42:56.650
<v Speaker 2>he's more of a barrage of punches and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Combo Poncho.</v>

2415
01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:59.950
<v Speaker 2>But Frank is not a knockout artist by</v>
<v Speaker 2>any means.</v>

2416
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.550
<v Speaker 2>And there's also the factor of kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>

2417
01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.500
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine any fighter who gets in</v>

2418
01:43:05.501 --> 01:43:09.130
<v Speaker 2>the ring and realizes that they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2419
01:43:09.190 --> 01:43:11.510
<v Speaker 2>that's a riddle that's very hard to</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve right now.</v>

2420
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine for Ronda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as great as she is and this athletic or</v>

2421
01:43:14.101 --> 01:43:15.280
<v Speaker 2>she has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2422
01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:20.400
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt that Holly Holm looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she was just far advanced in how to</v>

2423
01:43:21.250 --> 01:43:24.010
<v Speaker 2>dispatch somebody with kicks and she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>disguising her cakes,</v>

2424
01:43:24.011 --> 01:43:26.800
<v Speaker 2>punching and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine there's an emotional</v>

2425
01:43:26.801 --> 01:43:29.080
<v Speaker 2>factor which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I even do this?</v>

2426
01:43:29.081 --> 01:43:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Can I solve this riddle riddle in six</v>
<v Speaker 2>months?</v>

2427
01:43:31.091 --> 01:43:33.520
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a lot of time to catch up to</v>

2428
01:43:33.521 --> 01:43:36.820
<v Speaker 2>somebody who's that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also to let all the dust settle.</v>

2429
01:43:36.821 --> 01:43:39.550
<v Speaker 2>As far as like the devastation to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>motions,</v>

2430
01:43:39.551 --> 01:43:44.440
<v Speaker 2>your confidence or you know Ron does his</v>
<v Speaker 2>very special kind of pit bull.</v>

2431
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Is She chomping at the bit to get back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there?</v>

2432
01:43:46.931 --> 01:43:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean is she like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just straight up spreading.</v>

2433
01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.520
<v Speaker 2>She's a special person and don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a middle ground either.</v>

2434
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I think she's going to come back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just be a fucking demon or we're going</v>

2435
01:43:56.751 --> 01:44:00.020
<v Speaker 2>to see a shell and she's going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking kicked in the face again and we</v>

2436
01:44:00.021 --> 01:44:01.400
<v Speaker 2>never see her again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see it.</v>

2437
01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:04.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a middle ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if she comes back in fucking</v>

2438
01:44:04.311 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal shape and gets fired up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated and does everything the right</v>

2439
01:44:07.911 --> 01:44:10.400
<v Speaker 2>way and no distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly might still mark.</v>

2440
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still don't have the skills to stand</v>

2441
01:44:12.651 --> 01:44:13.461
<v Speaker 2>there with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2442
01:44:13.461 --> 01:44:14.920
<v Speaker 2>and move in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

2443
01:44:15.190 --> 01:44:17.630
<v Speaker 2>she can't take holly down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's hot.</v>

2444
01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:19.970
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what of Holly's game plans even</v>

2445
01:44:19.971 --> 01:44:21.500

<v Speaker 2>Cause let me tell you something about</v>

2447
01:44:24.021 --> 01:44:25.940

<v Speaker 2>trained together.</v>

2460
01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:57.013
<v Speaker 2>I'd fake an injury.</v>

2461
01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2462
01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:03.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean she wants to fight her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she thinks she's going to get me,</v>

2463
01:45:03.891 --> 01:45:05.880
<v Speaker 2>she's going to get images.</v>

2466
01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:13.070
<v Speaker 2>not going to fight that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not going to charge after a</v>

2467
01:45:13.071 --> 01:45:15.110
<v Speaker 2>different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different fight.</v>

2468
01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:17.510
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who would fight me.</v>

2469
01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:19.460
<v Speaker 2>She is me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got a different style of</v>

2470
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 2>takedowns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll shoot for doubles if she gets to</v>

2471
01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:23.420
<v Speaker 2>clinch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll very,</v>

2472
01:45:23.421 --> 01:45:25.910
<v Speaker 2>her approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got ricky lundell working with her</v>

2473
01:45:25.911 --> 01:45:28.940
<v Speaker 2>who was also an excellent coach and</v>
<v Speaker 2>coach.</v>

2474
01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:34.220
<v Speaker 2>She's got some good things going for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know what you're dealing</v>

2475
01:45:34.221 --> 01:45:36.980
<v Speaker 2>with also is when you see a fight or get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the octagon,</v>

2476
01:45:36.981 --> 01:45:39.350
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what kind of injuries</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had.</v>

2477
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:42.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what they're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>in training camp that they're trying to</v>

2478
01:45:42.261 --> 01:45:44.450
<v Speaker 2>overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when Luke rockhold said after the</v>

2479
01:45:44.451 --> 01:45:47.180
<v Speaker 2>fight they had staph infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I talked to Bob Cook about it.</v>

2480
01:45:47.181 --> 01:45:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Bob Cook right when I go congratulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

2481
01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.710
<v Speaker 2>he almost fucking pulled out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2482
01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:52.340
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2483
01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:52.970
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2484
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:55.820
<v Speaker 2>he's just had really bad staff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been on antibiotics for two weeks</v>

2485
01:45:55.821 --> 01:45:58.310
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking kidding me because you never</v>

2486
01:45:58.311 --> 01:46:00.800
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When holly fought Raquel Pennington,</v>

2487
01:46:01.190 --> 01:46:04.010
<v Speaker 2>she did not look very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the reasons why I</v>

2488
01:46:04.011 --> 01:46:06.290
<v Speaker 2>didn't think that was a good fight to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have right now.</v>

2489
01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:09.560
<v Speaker 2>She had a split decision victory over</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raquel Pennington.</v>

2490
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raquel almost beat her.</v>

2491
01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:13.490
<v Speaker 2>She came within a hair of beating her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this,</v>

2492
01:46:13.491 --> 01:46:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2493
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:14.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with these,</v>

2494
01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:18.740
<v Speaker 2>I want to say more well rounded</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>

2495
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Whenever we see a fighter who charges</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's almost no skill just to rush</v>

2496
01:46:22.410 --> 01:46:24.230
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get fucked up by the better</v>

2497
01:46:24.231 --> 01:46:25.430
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2498
01:46:25.431 --> 01:46:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Aldo fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda fucked up.</v>

2499
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:30.290
<v Speaker 2>We see these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also fight.</v>

2500
01:46:30.291 --> 01:46:33.080
<v Speaker 2>So emotionally come straight forward and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you see the more talented find it</v>

2501
01:46:33.081 --> 01:46:34.970
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck pink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2502
01:46:34.971 --> 01:46:36.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't do it.</v>

2503
01:46:36.401 --> 01:46:39.110
<v Speaker 2>And it was way more successful than Aldo</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it and she,</v>

2504
01:46:39.111 --> 01:46:41.800
<v Speaker 2>she's fighting less for competitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it worked well.</v>

2505
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Holly's a fucking Hoe for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly is very high level,</v>

2506
01:46:45.450 --> 01:46:47.180
<v Speaker 2>high level it,</v>

01:51:00.881 --> 01:51:05.881
<v Speaker 2>So I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how often you've been doing this yoga.</v>

2622
01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Three times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome dude.</v>

2623
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:10.600
<v Speaker 2>It's so good for your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:11.860

2625
01:51:11.890 --> 01:51:14.290
<v Speaker 2>like your back's loosening up and loosen</v>
<v Speaker 2>on everything?</v>

2626
01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.030
<v Speaker 2>For me it's more of a mental thing.</v>

2627
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:18.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just feel great after I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

2628
01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:20.450
<v Speaker 2>More compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed.</v>

2629
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bored.</v>

2630
01:51:23.290 --> 01:51:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say I'm bored with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

2631
01:51:24.731 --> 01:51:26.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all the same to me.</v>

2632
01:51:26.081 --> 01:51:27.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to the same guy so I</v>

2633
01:51:27.671 --> 01:51:29.540
<v Speaker 2>wasn't feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you move around,</v>

2634
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:32.120
<v Speaker 2>go to a different job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you go in gear.</v>

2635
01:51:32.130 --> 01:51:33.190

<v Speaker 2>A lot of Gnocchi,</v>

2638
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:38.260

<v Speaker 2>Just have you thought about doing</v>

2639
01:51:38.261 --> 01:51:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu competitions?</v>

2640
01:51:40.511 --> 01:51:44.680
<v Speaker 2>the time to put the proper training into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and just because of doing the podcast</v>

2641
01:51:44.681 --> 01:51:47.440

<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

2716
01:54:56.330 --> 01:55:00.650

<v Speaker 2>in wrestling how you'd start off,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Spider web.</v>

2720
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Spider web means someone's defending the</v>
<v Speaker 2>arm bar,</v>

2721
01:55:10.641 --> 01:55:13.410
<v Speaker 2>but you have both legs locked on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground there.</v>

2722
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:17.360
<v Speaker 2>They're on their back flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're inside control with one arm</v>

2723
01:55:17.361 --> 01:55:19.370
<v Speaker 2>hooked and you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're holding onto the leg.</v>

2724

2726
01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Can you start from there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or the other position is you take the</v>

2727
01:55:24.861 --> 01:55:26.090
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both hooks in,</v>

2728
01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:26.721
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under,</v>

2729
01:55:26.721 --> 01:55:29.810
<v Speaker 2>not under the Chin but over under it</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this and they're allowed to hold</v>

2730
01:55:29.811 --> 01:55:31.130
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're defending the,</v>

2731
01:55:31.131 --> 01:55:32.450
<v Speaker 2>they hold on your hand,</v>

<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

2733
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:36.620
<v Speaker 2>And then it's a battle for their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everyone's in fucking danger.</v>

2734
01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's in danger.</v>

2735
01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:41.270
<v Speaker 2>It's really similar to college football</v>
<v Speaker 2>overtime where they built,</v>

2736
01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:43.160
<v Speaker 2>you're both in a dangerous position.</v>

2737
01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Whoever scores first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the cool thing is,</v>

2738
01:55:45.901 --> 01:55:49.090
<v Speaker 2>is whoever got out fastest at the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she wants,</v>

2739
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:51.210
<v Speaker 2>so if there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no submission.</v>

2740
01:55:51.211 --> 01:55:53.970
<v Speaker 2>So they'll do like three rounds of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it three rounds?</v>

2741
01:55:53.971 --> 01:55:56.130
<v Speaker 2>So you bounce back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One you want,</v>

2742
01:55:56.131 --> 01:55:57.160
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

2743
01:55:57.161 --> 01:56:00.330
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets his manager or whoever taps the</v>

2744
01:56:00.331 --> 01:56:04.710
<v Speaker 2>person first gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go and you tap him,</v>

2745
01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:07.680
<v Speaker 2>he has an opportunity to tap you next</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he gets position.</v>

2746
01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:10.260
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so good.</v>

2747
01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.150
<v Speaker 2>So there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're at the orpheum,</v>

2748
01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:14.190
<v Speaker 2>it's sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's thousands of people.</v>

2749
01:56:14.191 --> 01:56:16.590
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking Jujitsu fans and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going crazy.</v>

2750
01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:18.450
<v Speaker 2>We had so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2751
01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:21.260
<v Speaker 2>It was so good for Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bravo is killing it.</v>

2752
01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:22.920
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you.</v>

2753
01:56:22.930 --> 01:56:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Any problems?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got 50 fucking schools.</v>

2754
01:56:24.930 --> 01:56:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more now I'm saying 50 that's</v>

2755
01:56:27.031 --> 01:56:28.530
<v Speaker 2>the last count I know of.</v>

2756
01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I think he opened up a couple more of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them all across the country has got</v>

2757
01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:34.230
<v Speaker 2>affiliates in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about an eggshell?</v>

2758
01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

2759
01:56:36.871 --> 01:56:41.070
<v Speaker 2>$50,000 grand prize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be a mogul for grappling</v>

2760
01:56:41.130 --> 01:56:42.680
<v Speaker 2>for grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 grand.</v>

2761
01:56:42.850 --> 01:56:46.890
<v Speaker 2>It's about if such a geek is about doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do really well and focusing</v>

2762
01:56:46.891 --> 01:56:49.590
<v Speaker 2>just on that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it look like I'm loving it and he's got</v>

2763
01:56:49.591 --> 01:56:53.700
<v Speaker 2>the best personality ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just such a character and he's,</v>

2764
01:56:53.701 --> 01:56:57.870
<v Speaker 2>he's joking around while he's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>referees saying funny things while he's</v>

2765
01:56:57.871 --> 01:56:59.600
<v Speaker 2>referencing but not trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something happened and he jokes</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2769
01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:09.600

<v Speaker 2>out a way to make grappling really</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2830
01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:15.730
<v Speaker 2>But those are fun things.</v>

2831
01:59:15.730 --> 01:59:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2832
01:59:16.781 --> 01:59:18.460
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>training is fun.</v>

2833
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Standup comedy couldn't be any fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

2834
01:59:21.221 --> 01:59:25.330
<v Speaker 2>the only real work work is like got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline myself to sometimes work out</v>

2835
01:59:25.331 --> 01:59:27.400
<v Speaker 2>when I don't want to write when I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to,</v>

2836
01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:29.230
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2837
01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:32.500
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how I feel is harder for me to</v>

2838
01:59:32.501 --> 01:59:35.680
<v Speaker 2>not do what I'm supposed to do then it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is for me to do what I'm supposed to do.</v>

2839
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Because if I don't do what I'm supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

2840
01:59:37.541 --> 01:59:40.430
<v Speaker 2>then I deal with regret and doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2841
01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I've done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it a lot of when my life,</v>

2842
01:59:43.001 --> 01:59:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I've felt those feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

2843
01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:48.730
<v Speaker 2>So what I do is I just don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just say,</v>

2844
01:59:48.731 --> 01:59:50.470
<v Speaker 2>well what is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I don't do it,</v>

2845
01:59:50.471 --> 01:59:52.810
<v Speaker 2>then I'm gonna have to feel like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do it and feel like a loser.</v>

2846
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:56.590
<v Speaker 2>So get after it bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good for just for people to</v>

2847
01:59:56.591 --> 01:59:58.480
<v Speaker 2>hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know your schedule cause you're at</v>

2848
01:59:58.481 --> 01:59:59.380
<v Speaker 2>where you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2849
01:59:59.381 --> 02:00:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Because your work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2850
02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.980
<v Speaker 2>so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I look at someone,</v>

2851
02:00:02.981 --> 02:00:03.431
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2852
02:00:03.431 --> 02:00:05.360
<v Speaker 2>how'd they get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

2853
02:00:05.361 --> 02:00:09.250
<v Speaker 2>And the schedule is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that someone is</v>

2854
02:00:09.251 --> 02:00:11.410
<v Speaker 2>successful that doesn't have a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule.</v>

2855
02:00:11.710 --> 02:00:13.750
<v Speaker 2>And if they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to appreciate it.</v>

2856
02:00:14.110 --> 02:00:15.570
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2857
02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:18.910
<v Speaker 2>it's all like what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is where you're at.</v>

2858
02:00:19.210 --> 02:00:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Like is where you're at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you want to be.</v>

2859
02:00:20.861 --> 02:00:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Like are you enjoying it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm,</v>

2860
02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:26.770
<v Speaker 2>what I'm happy about the most is that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy what I do.</v>

2861
02:00:27.010 --> 02:00:29.770
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I was working as a ceo of some</v>

2862
02:00:29.771 --> 02:00:32.560
<v Speaker 2>fucking corporation or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I was putting all these crazy</v>

2863
02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:33.580
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the same kind of hours,</v>

2864
02:00:33.581 --> 02:00:37.510
<v Speaker 2>I put it now the same kind of effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably be a miserable drunk pill</v>

2865
02:00:37.511 --> 02:00:41.950
<v Speaker 2>popping psychopath who's just looking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>escape and go bang hookers or something.</v>

2866
02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I'd be looking for some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>release.</v>

2867
02:00:43.530 --> 02:00:46.570
<v Speaker 2>You know why you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think you got to get back to the</v>

2868
02:00:46.571 --> 02:00:49.270
<v Speaker 2>why sometimes lose motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got it.</v>

2869
02:00:49.271 --> 02:00:52.560
<v Speaker 2>You've got to go back to the why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you really trying to do?</v>

2870
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:53.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2871
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:55.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like with standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this this weekend a</v>

2872
02:00:55.931 --> 02:00:58.480
<v Speaker 2>lot and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get to a point in stand up and</v>

2873
02:00:58.481 --> 02:01:00.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is making a lot of people laugh for</v>

2874
02:01:00.881 --> 02:01:04.660
<v Speaker 2>an hour is not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people can do that.</v>

2875
02:01:05.170 --> 02:01:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you growing?</v>

2876
02:01:06.821 --> 02:01:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Are you writing new stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you being thematic?</v>

2877
02:01:09.371 --> 02:01:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Are you surprising yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you coming up with a whole new</v>

2878
02:01:12.131 --> 02:01:13.450
<v Speaker 2>angle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new idea?</v>

2879
02:01:13.690 --> 02:01:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Or are you falling back on your old</v>
<v Speaker 2>tricks?</v>

2880
02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's a variation on that theme</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that challenge never goes away.</v>

2881
02:01:19.890 --> 02:01:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that feeling when you don't do a</v>

2882
02:01:21.881 --> 02:01:24.460
<v Speaker 2>new joke because you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're scared of it.</v>

2883
02:01:24.461 --> 02:01:26.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not going so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go back to some old stuff,</v>

2884
02:01:26.450 --> 02:01:28.760
<v Speaker 2>you know works and it gets a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pills,</v>

2885
02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:31.810
<v Speaker 2>but you feel hollow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel dead inside and you feel hollow.</v>

2886
02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't fake yourself.</v>

2887
02:01:34.570 --> 02:01:35.930
<v Speaker 2>You can't trick yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2888
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:39.080
<v Speaker 2>The guys who can or monsters look</v>
<v Speaker 2>terribly,</v>

2889
02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.033
<v Speaker 2>don't</v>

2890
02:01:40.530 --> 02:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I feel inauthentic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also when you just send them,</v>

2891
02:01:42.861 --> 02:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>you have people coming back to see you</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times or whatever you owe it to</v>

2892
02:01:46.671 --> 02:01:48.440
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't come up with the same bag of</v>

2893
02:01:48.441 --> 02:01:50.540
<v Speaker 1>tricks and it's really hard to write new</v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

2894
02:01:50.541 --> 02:01:53.300
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to have a new hour and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be thematic after a year.</v>

2895
02:01:53.301 --> 02:01:54.530
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really difficult.</v>

2896
02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:59.780
<v Speaker 1>But part of me dies when I go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in my [inaudible] old faithful</v>

2897
02:01:59.781 --> 02:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>just to get that laugh just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you also have to be entertaining</v>

2898
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I said talk to Jim</v>

2899
02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:06.441
<v Speaker 1>Jefferies about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2900
02:02:06.441 --> 02:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>when you do nudge him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey's Ya Jim Gaffigan.</v>

2901
02:02:08.690 --> 02:02:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I like when you do a new specialty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned all your own material.</v>

2902
02:02:11.661 --> 02:02:13.070
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2903
02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he goes,</v>

2904
02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:18.200
<v Speaker 1>it's important for me to do news top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also important for me to do</v>

2905
02:02:18.201 --> 02:02:21.260
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people pay a lot of money to</v>

2906
02:02:21.261 --> 02:02:21.860
<v Speaker 1>come see me.</v>

2907
02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I have to make sure the show is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and sometimes I get people shout</v>

2908
02:02:25.101 --> 02:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they liked some of the old stuff.</v>

2909
02:02:26.511 --> 02:02:27.730
<v Speaker 1>They want to see the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new,</v>

2910
02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>the old songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll give it to him and stuff.</v>

2911
02:02:30.081 --> 02:02:31.490
<v Speaker 1>But with Jeffrey says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or excuse me,</v>

2912
02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>cafe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I keep doing that.</v>

2913
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Gaffigan has that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that hotpockets thing,</v>

2914
02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do stand up without doing that hot</v>

2915
02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2916
02:02:39.590 --> 02:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes Louis C k they'll yell out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bag of Dicks.</v>

2917
02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:45.350
<v Speaker 1>That bag of dicks choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2918
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2919
02:02:46.401 --> 02:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>you missed some of those old beats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those old songs,</v>

2920
02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:53.390
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're not constantly a</v>

2921
02:02:53.391 --> 02:02:55.880
<v Speaker 1>little bit uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna sound weird,</v>

2922
02:02:55.881 --> 02:03:00.080
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go and spar with Chris mannered and he</v>

2923
02:03:00.081 --> 02:03:01.310
<v Speaker 1>doesn't beat me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't hit me.</v>

2924
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:02.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll hit me,</v>

2925
02:03:02.031 --> 02:03:03.200
<v Speaker 1>but I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't break my job.</v>

2926
02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't please don't hit me in the nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm nervous.</v>

2927
02:03:05.571 --> 02:03:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm always nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go spark.</v>

2928
02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm nervous and we move around and we'll</v>

2929
02:03:10.581 --> 02:03:11.780
<v Speaker 1>go four rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm exhausted.</v>

2930
02:03:11.781 --> 02:03:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I looked like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get hit.</v>

2931
02:03:13.491 --> 02:03:13.851
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2932
02:03:13.851 --> 02:03:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel good.</v>

2933
02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:18.110
<v Speaker 1>But when I do that and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable and I sit in my car and</v>

2934
02:03:18.111 --> 02:03:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm all sweaty and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2935
02:03:19.851 --> 02:03:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a bad job,</v>

2936
02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:24.140
<v Speaker 1>but I overcame that fear on a Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went and did it anyway.</v>

2937
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Something happens where I get more</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative where I just start writing.</v>

2938
02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it opens up a different camera.</v>

2939
02:03:31.401 --> 02:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>It's brain trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's also a lack of regret because</v>

2940
02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:38.270
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the regret that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

2941
02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you didn't shy away from something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was challenging.</v>

2942
02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you embraced it and then you get</v>

2943
02:03:42.741 --> 02:03:43.970
<v Speaker 1>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he did it.</v>

2944
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it,</v>

2945
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:47.840
<v Speaker 1>and being excited about things also is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like creative fuel.</v>

2946
02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so important to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not finding that physically.</v>

2947
02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I get it mentally from all the shows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>our merchandise and doing all this in</v>

2948
02:03:55.491 --> 02:03:58.890
<v Speaker 1>the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as physically plus class,</v>

2949
02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:01.790
<v Speaker 1>but you're getting it a little bit out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 'em.</v>

2950
02:04:01.850 --> 02:04:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I just realized that's a fighter and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid tee shirt,</v>

2951
02:04:03.621 --> 02:04:06.440
<v Speaker 1>that metallica shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our west coast.</v>

2952
02:04:07.210 --> 02:04:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait for scrooge mcduck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be a scrooge mcduck slider</v>

2953
02:04:12.371 --> 02:04:14.600
<v Speaker 1>when the kid's shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will be wearing it on this podcast.</v>

2954
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:17.150
<v Speaker 1>It will be limited edition because</v>
<v Speaker 1>warner brothers,</v>

2955
02:04:17.151 --> 02:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>we'll find out about it and it will be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2956
02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Let it sit on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The darkness is going to have to sell</v>

2957
02:04:22.650 --> 02:04:26.420
<v Speaker 1>only with bitcoin so nobody could get</v>
<v Speaker 1>money out of it.</v>

2958
02:04:26.421 --> 02:04:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Hooks to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2959
02:04:27.561 --> 02:04:29.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get the money for those.</v>
