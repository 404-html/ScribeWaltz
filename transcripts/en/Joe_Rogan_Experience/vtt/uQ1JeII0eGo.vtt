00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>your sound of your voice in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>headphones.</v>

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time you ever worn </v>
<v Speaker 1>headphones or a podcast?</v>

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Definitely the first time I've heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself talk because it weird.</v>

10
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>After a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get over it.</v>

12
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Be conscious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got to be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take them off.</v>

14
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>You want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's freaking you out too much,</v>

15
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.123
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get through this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just take this bucket that we </v>

16
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.280
<v Speaker 1>don't need these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep this sucker close to you.</v>

17
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for doing this.</v>

19
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>You've been on this crazy sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whirlwind tour.</v>

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.833
<v Speaker 1>Have you gone anywhere or you just been </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it most from mostly from your </v>

21
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>house?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly from my house.</v>

22
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Just on skype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for people who don't know the story,</v>

23
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:57.174
<v Speaker 1>let's give them the short version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were working at Google and what </v>

24
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>prompted you to write this memo?</v>

25
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would have these company wide </v>

26
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.024
<v Speaker 3>meetings where they just push a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this diversity stuff and some of it was </v>

27
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 3>kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I decided to go to these,</v>

28
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these secret meetings,</v>

29
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.054
<v Speaker 3>sort of that we're about 100 people a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely unrecorded and they would </v>

30
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:20.274
<v Speaker 3>talk about some of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing and it would really </v>

31
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 3>contradict what they're saying publicly </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

32
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.403
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not changing any of our hiring </v>

33
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 3>practices for these candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

34
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.373
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we basically are a making it easier for </v>

35
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 3>some kind of ways to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

36
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:37.624
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I voiced some concerns but people have </v>

37
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 3>just chain me and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

38
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just like,</v>

39
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 3>have white male privilege.</v>

40
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have white male privilege.</v>

41
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>That was the actual word that he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

42
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.343
<v Speaker 3>there is a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they asked for feedback on the </v>

43
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.850
<v Speaker 3>program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

44
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I wrote this document to clarify my </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts.</v>

45
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 3>I sent it to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they looked at it,</v>

46
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 3>but they just ignored it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never told me anything.</v>

47
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 3>So I went to a couple more of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs and you know,</v>

48
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:08.390
<v Speaker 3>I gave similar feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave the same document,</v>

49
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.580
<v Speaker 3>they kept looking at it but just never </v>
<v Speaker 3>said anything and you know,</v>

50
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.270
<v Speaker 3>I would send it to random people that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew and half the people will be like,</v>

51
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

52
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:19.094
<v Speaker 3>This is what I've been thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other half would maybe disagree </v>

53
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:23.624
<v Speaker 3>with some points,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would never be emotional </v>

54
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 3>outbursts or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would just be like,</v>

55
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.003
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you sure that this is actually </v>

56
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 3>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

57
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

58
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.753
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've actually been to these unrecorded </v>

59
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 3>meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's happened.</v>

60
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.923
<v Speaker 4>So if you could get into specifics like </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in these meetings and </v>

61
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:40.840
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is their concern?</v>

62
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.703
<v Speaker 4>And their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to promote an image of </v>

63
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:46.204
<v Speaker 4>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they trying to promote actual </v>

64
00:02:47.831 --> 00:02:49.150
<v Speaker 4>diversity?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

65
00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:49.984
<v Speaker 4>do they think that there's a benefit for</v>
<v Speaker 4>diversity or is it a part of their </v>

66
00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:53.284
<v Speaker 4>public public image?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is it a lot of it to avoid </v>

67
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:56.644
<v Speaker 4>criticism?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I think there's a big issue </v>

68
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.651
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

69
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have all your bases </v>
<v Speaker 4>covered,</v>

70
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 4>two black women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two Asian men,</v>

71
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have all your bases </v>
<v Speaker 4>covered,</v>

72
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 4>you can get like pretty roundly </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticized as not being diverse or being</v>

73
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 4>possibly racist when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're kind of fucked.</v>

74
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.833
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Google definitely has a huge target </v>

75
00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:20.810
<v Speaker 3>on its back and so there are people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to complain that Oh,</v>

76
00:03:20.811 --> 00:03:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Google is not diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore it's racist and sexist.</v>

77
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.693
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a lot of their fear that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at their representation and then </v>

78
00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:32.210
<v Speaker 3>compare it to the overall us population </v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

79
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we only have 20 percent women.</v>

80
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.400
<v Speaker 3>We should have 50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's obviously some sexism happening.</v>

81
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.060
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of their stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

82
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:44.660
<v Speaker 3>we need to fix this because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this sexism is bad.</v>

83
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.000
<v Speaker 3>And obviously if you disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexism,</v>

84
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 3>that's of course bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I obviously don't want there to</v>

85
00:03:52.671 --> 00:03:53.504
<v Speaker 3>be any sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just don't think that that's the </v>

86
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:59.861
<v Speaker 3>sole cause of this disparity in </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>

87
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.893
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like in the interest of </v>

88
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 4>promoting an image of diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're willing to bypass science.</v>

89
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 4>And the truth and the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>

90
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 4>the reality of human biology and </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary psychology,</v>

91
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:17.374
<v Speaker 4>there's just so much that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to look past to get to this one </v>

92
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 4>thing which seems to be like this really</v>
<v Speaker 4>important thing today.</v>

93
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 4>Society that you want to promote an </v>
<v Speaker 4>image of diversity.</v>

94
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.933
<v Speaker 4>It's more important than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like when you're in these classes or </v>

95
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:34.041
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

96
00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't call it a class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it?</v>

97
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:36.930
<v Speaker 4>A meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they are.</v>

98
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are classes somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

99
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.160
<v Speaker 3>our day long programs teach you things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what would they teach you?</v>

100
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.240
<v Speaker 3>They would talk about unconscious bias </v>
<v Speaker 3>and no,</v>

101
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lucky you might be racist.</v>

102
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 4>You have to find the racism in you.</v>

103
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.890
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole program that's trying to</v>

104
00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:56.724
<v Speaker 3>retrain your brain to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think about race in a new way or </v>

105
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

106
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 4>So they're just assuming you're guilty</v>

107
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.420
<v Speaker 3>pretty much because someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're white.</v>

108
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.350
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

109
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.333
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they look at the representation </v>

110
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:10.340
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racism,</v>

111
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.203
<v Speaker 3>sexism.</v>

112
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.070
<v Speaker 4>Do a black people have to go to this?</v>

113
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know one has to have been asked to.</v>

114
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.080
<v Speaker 3>They are definitely pushing it on people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

115
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.023
<v Speaker 3>now managers are being evaluated by how </v>
<v Speaker 3>well they promote diversity and </v>

116
00:05:26.481 --> 00:05:27.314
<v Speaker 3>inclusion and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a slippery slope and I think </v>

117
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.340
<v Speaker 3>it will eventually become part of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance review.</v>

118
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.570
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a white woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have to go to this?</v>

119
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.741
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did that,</v>

120
00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:41.270
<v Speaker 4>are you encouraged to go to this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you like,</v>

121
00:05:41.271 --> 00:05:42.104
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you made it through like this will have </v>

122
00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 4>been looking for your fine or if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>an Indian woman even better,</v>

123
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:47.503
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that how it works or would you still </v>

124
00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 4>have to go there and approach your </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious biases?</v>

125
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.933
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say everyone has these unconscious </v>

126
00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 3>bias</v>

127
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 4>even towards white people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do they have those</v>

128
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.993
<v Speaker 5>where they have like black people with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their unconscious biases towards white </v>

129
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:01.904
<v Speaker 5>people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they never acknowledged that anyone </v>

130
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 5>could be racist against white people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

131
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 5>Why would you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

132
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 5>It's all this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you have,</v>

133
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.573
<v Speaker 5>you can only be racist if you have power</v>
<v Speaker 5>or sexist if you have power and they </v>

134
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 5>believe that the racist part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

135
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's insane.</v>

136
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.393
<v Speaker 5>That's a redefinition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very recent redefinition of the </v>

137
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 5>term racism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's very slippery,</v>

138
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 5>very dangerous because you could see it </v>
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

139
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.633
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>promoting in fact like exonerating </v>

140
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 5>racism towards other ethnicities or </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards white people were towards people</v>

141
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 5>that you feel like are in a privileged </v>
<v Speaker 5>class.</v>

142
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.073
<v Speaker 5>You'd get away with it because it's no </v>
<v Speaker 5>big deal because they're the ones who </v>

143
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 5>are racist even if it's not even that </v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

144
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 5>If it's people who look like them that </v>
<v Speaker 5>have lived for centuries,</v>

145
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 5>like somehow or another.</v>

146
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.823
<v Speaker 5>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guilty person just with your white </v>

147
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.993
<v Speaker 5>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like what would they tell you when </v>

148
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:55.120
<v Speaker 5>you would go to these?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you do,</v>

149
00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.160
<v Speaker 5>did you like express some discontent or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

150
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 5>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

151
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.953
<v Speaker 5>my main concern was them saying 50 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent in the population look who only </v>

152
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:11.340
<v Speaker 5>has 20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so we're obviously women.</v>

153
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.283
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

154
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were clear reasons,</v>

155
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:16.664
<v Speaker 5>at least in my mind that that's not as </v>
<v Speaker 5>simple as they're making out to be and </v>

156
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.274
<v Speaker 5>that there are some differences and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>could explain some of the issues that </v>

157
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:27.164
<v Speaker 5>women are facing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so a lot of these women issues in </v>

158
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:31.664
<v Speaker 5>tech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel are actually not really gender </v>

159
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 5>issues there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

160
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

161
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 5>women on average are more cooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

162
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 5>and so they may find it harder to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

163
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:43.664
<v Speaker 5>lean in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the corporate world like Sheryl </v>

164
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.360
<v Speaker 5>Sandberg is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

165
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 5>there are men that also feel like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not very assertive.</v>

166
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm actually pretty shy and so I feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same stuff and it's not that,</v>

167
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a ton of sexism.</v>

168
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.733
<v Speaker 5>It's maybe that male typical behavior is</v>
<v Speaker 5>rewarded just as competitiveness is </v>

169
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 5>rewarded in a lot of corporate world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not that we're just,</v>

170
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a woman,</v>

171
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 5>therefore you're obviously bad at </v>
<v Speaker 5>coding,</v>

172
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one has ever saying that.</v>

173
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.693
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there is absolutely an issue </v>

174
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 5>with assertive women being treated very </v>
<v Speaker 5>differently than assertive men.</v>

175
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 5>Like an assertive woman is a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't want to be around them.</v>

176
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.011
<v Speaker 5>That's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

177
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:25.600
<v Speaker 5>the bias.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

178
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.483
<v Speaker 5>that's a real issue I think for women </v>
<v Speaker 5>that want to enter into any sort of a </v>

179
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:29.834
<v Speaker 5>competitive field.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know where a man would be </v>

180
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:32.864
<v Speaker 5>assertive if a woman does the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing she's looked down upon or looked </v>

181
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 5>upon like a problem woman or like </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone you don't want to work with,</v>

182
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 5>whereas the guy is just ambitious yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although some people will twist that and</v>

183
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:45.374
<v Speaker 5>say that because I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of it is just they try to fit </v>

184
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:48.884
<v Speaker 5>their ideology and they see one data </v>
<v Speaker 5>point and they extrapolate so they see </v>

185
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 5>these studies and it's true that these </v>
<v Speaker 5>women are viewed as less</v>

186
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.813
<v Speaker 3>likable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are seen as just as competent </v>

187
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 3>and so their performance reviewed isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>affected really by being assertive.</v>

188
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.510
<v Speaker 3>It's just that socially they may not be </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

189
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.683
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then it's got to be a factor in the </v>

190
00:09:09.651 --> 00:09:10.484
<v Speaker 4>way they behave because for men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a ball busting successful man is </v>

191
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.540
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be like looked up to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

192
00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 4>this is the guy who was kicking ass in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the corporate world.</v>

193
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:20.930
<v Speaker 4>He's doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

194
00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:22.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bob is ruthless.</v>

195
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.160
<v Speaker 4>But if Jenny's ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you don't want to be around her,</v>

196
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

197
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.650
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

198
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.160
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like if there is a real bias with</v>

199
00:09:31.161 --> 00:09:32.690
<v Speaker 4>men who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously I don't work in tech,</v>

200
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.060
<v Speaker 4>but I would assume that that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>real bias.</v>

201
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean I think some of the solution </v>

202
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:41.841
<v Speaker 3>to that is just allowing people to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>more cooperative and you know,</v>

203
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for example,</v>

204
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:45.504
<v Speaker 3>a google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really rewarded for owning a </v>

205
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:50.550
<v Speaker 3>particular project and seeing that one </v>
<v Speaker 3>project go through,</v>

206
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.980
<v Speaker 3>but if you're someone that is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

207
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:53.903
<v Speaker 3>can really help a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and you're not necessarily the </v>

208
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 3>sole owner of any individual thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're,</v>

209
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.893
<v Speaker 3>you provide a lot of value to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>company that isn't really seen as </v>

210
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 3>positive as someone that really drove </v>
<v Speaker 3>the project alone.</v>

211
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

212
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.540
<v Speaker 4>that seems like a bad thing for </v>
<v Speaker 4>teamwork,</v>

213
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.443
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that just a bad philosophy or </v>

214
00:10:16.781 --> 00:10:19.000
<v Speaker 4>something that got stuck in the way the </v>
<v Speaker 4>system works?</v>

215
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's sorta just,</v>

216
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.750
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to evaluate if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

217
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.920
<v Speaker 3>10 percent of my time on 10 different </v>
<v Speaker 3>projects and I help them.</v>

218
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.293
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

219
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.313
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you'd have to essentially trust the </v>

220
00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:32.474
<v Speaker 4>workers instincts and work ethic and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>the blow back from this has been very </v>

221
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:39.620
<v Speaker 4>intriguing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

222
00:10:39.621 --> 00:10:43.010
<v Speaker 4>as an outsider looking at it from the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I first heard about it,</v>

223
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

224
00:10:43.761 --> 00:10:44.594
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this mean angry man must have written </v>

225
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:50.330
<v Speaker 4>some things saying that women's suck at </v>
<v Speaker 4>tech or they suck at this and you know,</v>

226
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:51.164
<v Speaker 4>and people were reacting to this blatant</v>
<v Speaker 4>misogynistic tribe that are ascribed </v>

227
00:10:56.091 --> 00:10:56.924
<v Speaker 4>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

228
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was hearing about what,</v>

229
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:01.580
<v Speaker 4>when I read it I was so confused because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

230
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.790
<v Speaker 4>where's the mean stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where is this?</v>

231
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:05.743
<v Speaker 4>And you also think that the other thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was really confusing was it some </v>

232
00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:10.940
<v Speaker 4>people were reprinting it without </v>
<v Speaker 4>citations.</v>

233
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.870
<v Speaker 4>Did that freak you out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're being misrepresented?</v>

234
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when people would say,</v>

235
00:11:17.171 --> 00:11:19.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so unscientific because it didn't</v>

236
00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:21.790
<v Speaker 3>have citations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was their entire argument.</v>

237
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.640
<v Speaker 3>Who did it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who printed it with outside citations?</v>

238
00:11:24.641 --> 00:11:25.474
<v Speaker 3>Because some major publications </v>
<v Speaker 3>republished it yet I think it was </v>

239
00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Gizmodo or motherboard or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

240
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.240
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck would they do that without </v>
<v Speaker 3>citations?</v>

241
00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:38.320
<v Speaker 3>That seems so unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unreasonable and so irresponsible.</v>

242
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.453
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of these companies just </v>
<v Speaker 3>have certain narrative that they're </v>

243
00:11:41.681 --> 00:11:42.940
<v Speaker 3>trying to push.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

244
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.930
<v Speaker 3>And so like even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

245
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.773
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to talk to a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>reporters and I'll give hour long </v>

246
00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:51.544
<v Speaker 3>interviews with some of them and at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end they'll just write the same sort of </v>

247
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 3>article of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

248
00:11:57.971 --> 00:11:58.804
<v Speaker 3>he's just a misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think even if I can convince </v>

249
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:08.551
<v Speaker 3>the individual journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are under pressure by their boss to</v>

250
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 3>write a certain type of article,</v>

251
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.440
<v Speaker 4>what a weird world we're in right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to that,</v>

252
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.680
<v Speaker 4>because I was looking for something that</v>
<v Speaker 4>could be,</v>

253
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.460
<v Speaker 3>could be like</v>

254
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.660
<v Speaker 4>evidence of massage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that I could find,</v>

255
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 4>and this is a very mild criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you were saying,</v>

256
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.463
<v Speaker 4>I believe you used the term neurotic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that women were more likely to be </v>

257
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 4>neurotic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Neuroticism.</v>

258
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

259
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 4>That's one where a lot of women go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well fuck this guy.</v>

260
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.830
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>

261
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:42.664
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

262
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.280
<v Speaker 3>what'd you base that on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

263
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:46.114
<v Speaker 3>So at there's the psychological big five</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality traits and neuroticism is </v>

264
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:53.280
<v Speaker 3>just one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

265
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the actual term that they use and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of unfortunate that that's the</v>

266
00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:58.780
<v Speaker 3>term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

267
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that one.</v>

268
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 3>I feel like maybe you could have danced </v>
<v Speaker 3>around that,</v>

269
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.073
<v Speaker 3>but that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just I was too much into </v>

270
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.533
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've seen the word so often that I </v>

271
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:16.900
<v Speaker 3>didn't really associate it with neurotic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and negative connotations.</v>

272
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.873
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I've seen a bunch of your </v>

273
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.100
<v Speaker 4>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've listened to you talk to Ben Shapiro</v>

274
00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:25.560
<v Speaker 4>and a couple other folks and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

275
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.940
<v Speaker 4>your thought process is very reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 4>and very wealth sorted out.</v>

276
00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:30.774
<v Speaker 4>And another thing that I'm not hearing </v>
<v Speaker 4>from anybody is how you wrote a whole </v>

277
00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:34.674
<v Speaker 4>page and a half describing all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>different ways that women could be more </v>

278
00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:43.850
<v Speaker 4>involved in tech or you can encourage </v>
<v Speaker 4>more women to tackle like,</v>

279
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:44.693
<v Speaker 4>this is not the work of a massage test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the work of someone who is </v>

280
00:13:47.251 --> 00:13:50.460
<v Speaker 4>carefully considering an issue and </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at it from a very.</v>

281
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.630
<v Speaker 4>What I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

282
00:13:54.631 --> 00:13:59.631
<v Speaker 4>but that you felt frustrated that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were looking at something that was a,</v>

283
00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:03.240
<v Speaker 4>that people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they're approaching this wasn't.</v>

284
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.280
<v Speaker 4>They weren't looking at it for what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

285
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.293
<v Speaker 4>They had kind of decided how they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to describe it and how they were </v>

286
00:14:11.011 --> 00:14:11.844
<v Speaker 4>going to deal with it and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really based on facts or reality and </v>

287
00:14:15.211 --> 00:14:16.044
<v Speaker 4>certainly not on science and you sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>felt frustrated by this and you decided </v>

288
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:20.634
<v Speaker 4>to try to interject with as much of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>current science as you could that could </v>

289
00:14:24.241 --> 00:14:26.640
<v Speaker 4>possibly explain choices.</v>

290
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.720
<v Speaker 4>Not why women are bad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not why were they,</v>

291
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.820
<v Speaker 4>why they shouldn't be in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what I kept reading,</v>

292
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.830
<v Speaker 4>but more that why women choose to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>into certain professions.</v>

293
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:38.723
<v Speaker 4>What could be the impediment and what we</v>
<v Speaker 4>could do to maybe encourage more women </v>

294
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:43.194
<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of doing this sort of a blanket </v>

295
00:14:46.771 --> 00:14:48.870
<v Speaker 4>style diversity where you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

296
00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 4>we need two of these and we do two of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

297
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 4>Which is what I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I seem to think that they were doing.</v>

298
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that a good assessment?</v>

299
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

300
00:14:57.741 --> 00:15:00.590
<v Speaker 4>this will never trend on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might get $5 million hits.</v>

301
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.600
<v Speaker 4>It'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a real problem too.</v>

302
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of censorship when it</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to these sort of conversations.</v>

303
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:07.244
<v Speaker 4>Like they would rather look at me who </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like a meathead and look at you </v>

304
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:11.804
<v Speaker 4>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well these fucking guys are just </v>

305
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 4>talking shit about women for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

306
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you feel that?</v>

307
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'll be labeled right now</v>

308
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.590
<v Speaker 4>I've already been labeled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

309
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.980
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't matter how many left wing </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions I support.</v>

310
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 4>I look all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is obviously like sexist,</v>

311
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.690
<v Speaker 4>Short,</v>
<v Speaker 4>misogynist,</v>

312
00:15:33.691 --> 00:15:35.070
<v Speaker 4>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>

313
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

314
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.623
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean just labeling us because </v>

315
00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:41.760
<v Speaker 3>we're white man or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A certain label because it's.</v>

316
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's prejudice.</v>

317
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people don't mind prejudices in that</v>

318
00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:49.170
<v Speaker 4>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

319
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.350
<v Speaker 4>they only like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

320
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.473
<v Speaker 4>they have an issue with prejudices when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes to what they feel like are </v>

321
00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:58.570
<v Speaker 4>disenfranchised or marginalized people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But white people,</v>

322
00:15:58.571 --> 00:15:59.500
<v Speaker 4>fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

323
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:00.660
<v Speaker 4>he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

324
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.050
<v Speaker 4>that's the thought process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

325
00:16:02.051 --> 00:16:03.580
<v Speaker 4>You can't be racist towards white </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

326
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:04.803
<v Speaker 4>So like what are the most egregious </v>
<v Speaker 4>things like one of the most ridiculous </v>

327
00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:07.444
<v Speaker 4>things that they were trying to push </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were at these classes or </v>

328
00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:10.470
<v Speaker 4>meetings.</v>

329
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.303
<v Speaker 3>So I mean besides the fact of just </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things in our hiring process </v>

330
00:16:16.381 --> 00:16:17.214
<v Speaker 3>that would favor certain people which </v>
<v Speaker 3>would create negative stereotypes for </v>

331
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:24.560
<v Speaker 3>people just in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

332
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.823
<v Speaker 3>one thing about stereotypes that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't realize is that people will </v>

333
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.154
<v Speaker 3>automatically create stereotypes no </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter what and it's based on their </v>

334
00:16:31.681 --> 00:16:32.514
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we see this with affirmative action </v>

335
00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:36.294
<v Speaker 3>to in academia where if you create a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of situation where people have </v>

336
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.270
<v Speaker 3>portions of the population are </v>
<v Speaker 3>performing differently,</v>

337
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.660
<v Speaker 3>then you'll automatically create the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stereotype that Oh,</v>

338
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.523
<v Speaker 3>maybe all the Asians are smart and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the other minorities aren't as smart </v>

339
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.860
<v Speaker 3>in this college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

340
00:16:55.861 --> 00:16:56.694
<v Speaker 3>Because you needed a 1600 to get in if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're Asian and you need lower </v>

341
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.393
<v Speaker 3>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you'll automatically create that </v>

342
00:17:05.371 --> 00:17:07.710
<v Speaker 3>stereotype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's negative for everyone because</v>

343
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it creates this tension between the </v>

344
00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:13.110
<v Speaker 3>groups and they self segregate because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>

345
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.500
<v Speaker 3>while if you just put everyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same level,</v>

346
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.930
<v Speaker 3>then they'll just intermingle and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>be great.</v>

347
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.660
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

348
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.560
<v Speaker 3>that has its negative consequences and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it may be illegal,</v>

349
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.220
<v Speaker 3>which is what I was trying to say in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>document.</v>

350
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.120
<v Speaker 3>So that aspect I think is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then also,</v>

351
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you think that,</v>

352
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.463
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this is because of sexism and </v>

353
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.230
<v Speaker 3>even though we can't really see overt </v>
<v Speaker 3>signs of sexism,</v>

354
00:17:43.231 --> 00:17:44.250
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

355
00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:45.084
<v Speaker 3>you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore you are bad and no one is </v>

356
00:17:47.431 --> 00:17:48.264
<v Speaker 3>saying these sexist slurs or then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>must be some low level bias that we all </v>

357
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:54.174
<v Speaker 3>have and that's why they're pushing all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this unconscious bias and </v>

358
00:17:57.091 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 3>microaggressions and just increasing </v>
<v Speaker 3>every one sensitivity to,</v>

359
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.023
<v Speaker 3>oh you said something that could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpreted in this one weird way and </v>

360
00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:12.120
<v Speaker 3>that might offend someone somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore you should never say anything.</v>

361
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.600
<v Speaker 3>And it's really stifling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

362
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.523
<v Speaker 4>I think we would all agree that we would</v>
<v Speaker 4>all be better off if we treated people </v>

363
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 4>nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we,</v>

364
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.900
<v Speaker 4>if we didn't have racism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we didn't have sexism,</v>

365
00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:28.734
<v Speaker 4>we just appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People for their qualities and just </v>

366
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:33.270
<v Speaker 4>could be very objective about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

367
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 4>but when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine that when you're running</v>

368
00:18:36.691 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 4>a company as large as something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Google,</v>

369
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.403
<v Speaker 4>you kind of have to put fires out before</v>
<v Speaker 4>you even see smoke and like the </v>

370
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:49.401
<v Speaker 4>writing's on the wall when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticism today and anything that,</v>

371
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.220
<v Speaker 4>that people can point to when it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's,</v>

372
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.220
<v Speaker 4>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

373
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.390
<v Speaker 4>a percentage of women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the percentage of minorities,</v>

374
00:18:57.391 --> 00:18:59.820
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where that they feel like is off.</v>

375
00:18:59.821 --> 00:19:01.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will write articles about this.</v>

376
00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:04.650
<v Speaker 4>It can damage your stock profile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

377
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean it can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can,</v>

378
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:06.414
<v Speaker 4>like companies can take a hit on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stock market because of an article that </v>

379
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 4>someone could write about a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 4>diversity.</v>

380
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:12.151
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Geez,</v>

381
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 4>they all lack of diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's a real issue.</v>

382
00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there have been reports of companies</v>

383
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.400
<v Speaker 3>that'll have these diversity programs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then blackmail companies,</v>

384
00:19:21.401 --> 00:19:24.820
<v Speaker 3>if they don't take them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so say you know,</v>

385
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.860
<v Speaker 3>they'll start complaining because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

386
00:19:26.861 --> 00:19:27.694
<v Speaker 3>all of these companies are the same and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have about 20 to 30 percent </v>

387
00:19:30.761 --> 00:19:34.060
<v Speaker 3>women so they could do the same attack </v>
<v Speaker 3>against anyone.</v>

388
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.470
<v Speaker 3>And so they blackmail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accompany,</v>

389
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.473
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

390
00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.493
<v Speaker 3>you need to do these certain programs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't then we'll start doing </v>

391
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.553
<v Speaker 3>external pressure on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who are the companies that are </v>

392
00:19:46.091 --> 00:19:50.350
<v Speaker 3>blackmailing them for the groups?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least from what I've heard.</v>

393
00:19:50.351 --> 00:19:52.600
<v Speaker 3>And this is all secondhand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>

394
00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:53.643
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the programs that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they'll hire contractors to perform </v>

395
00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.080
<v Speaker 3>some of the diversity programs.</v>

396
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have like,</v>

397
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.913
<v Speaker 4>sort of like Jesse Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should do with the rainbow </v>

398
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Speaker 4>coalition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

399
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:05.580
<v Speaker 4>the story behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little.</v>

400
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:06.640
<v Speaker 4>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

401
00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:07.923
<v Speaker 4>second secondhand story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the second hand store was that he </v>

402
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:15.171
<v Speaker 4>would go into these groups and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if anybody had said something,</v>

403
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.223
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever reason they had to get into </v>

404
00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 4>this company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would go into this company and then</v>

405
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:21.654
<v Speaker 4>they would charge them a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of money to go in and create </v>

406
00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:25.974
<v Speaker 4>these diversity programs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if they didn't do that then they </v>

407
00:20:28.471 --> 00:20:31.530
<v Speaker 4>would shame the company and they will </v>
<v Speaker 4>claim the company was racist.</v>

408
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 4>Know Jesse Jackson had like this laundry</v>
<v Speaker 4>list of things you wanted,</v>

409
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 4>like jumbo shrimp cocktail and all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy shit and live I'll ride.</v>

410
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.390
<v Speaker 4>But really like it's been kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>documented,</v>

411
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.553
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'd have to go back over it </v>

412
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:47.190
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember it only barely,</v>

413
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

414
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 1>mean that's where he got that moniker </v>
<v Speaker 1>race pimp that will,</v>

415
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.690
<v Speaker 1>he was essentially doing was race </v>
<v Speaker 1>pimping and then he was going around and</v>

416
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of threatening people that we will </v>

417
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 1>call you a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll call your company racist,</v>

418
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 1>comply in this manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

419
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.400
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's scary.</v>

420
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I see that a lot at google.</v>

421
00:21:10.701 --> 00:21:11.570
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

422
00:21:11.571 --> 00:21:12.404
<v Speaker 3>the same threatening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just people feel that they have to </v>

423
00:21:14.751 --> 00:21:15.584
<v Speaker 3>walk on eggshells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise they'll get reported to hr by </v>

424
00:21:19.191 --> 00:21:20.024
<v Speaker 3>some random activists within the company</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have activists in the </v>

425
00:21:22.641 --> 00:21:23.810
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

426
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.150
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was sort of made public,</v>

427
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:27.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

428
00:21:27.681 --> 00:21:28.514
<v Speaker 3>with all of this where there were some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that just really pushed and </v>

429
00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:35.780
<v Speaker 3>started complaining a ton based on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>document.</v>

430
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:36.853
<v Speaker 3>They would email my hr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone up my management chain and </v>

431
00:21:39.951 --> 00:21:44.951
<v Speaker 3>they'd write all these posts and try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>coordinate people to really shamed me.</v>

432
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.853
<v Speaker 3>And then they started tweeting about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>after and that's how it leaked </v>

433
00:21:49.521 --> 00:21:51.080
<v Speaker 3>externally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>

434
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 1>What was the criticism of the memo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did anything make sense?</v>

435
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Did anything make you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

436
00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I could have worded that better.</v>

437
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 3>I obviously the neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

438
00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have worded that differently.</v>

439
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:05.763
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

440
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:10.890
<v Speaker 3>the fact that I didn't talk about all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the biases are that are against women as</v>

441
00:22:11.681 --> 00:22:12.514
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was really that this was in </v>

442
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.713
<v Speaker 3>google internal document and so we </v>
<v Speaker 3>already have so much stuff about the </v>

443
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:21.214
<v Speaker 3>potential biases against women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was just the other side of the </v>

444
00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:24.814
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other perspective that wasn't being </v>

445
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:29.340
<v Speaker 3>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

446
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

447
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.573
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know any criticism that </v>

448
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:35.890
<v Speaker 3>was really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

449
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.860
<v Speaker 3>that was definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should have done that</v>

450
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:41.803
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so how you would put this memo out </v>

451
00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:49.130
<v Speaker 1>there and then the memo got leaked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then once it got leak you got fired.</v>

452
00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon after.</v>

453
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.090
<v Speaker 1>But they knew about the memo already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

454
00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:54.440
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were cool with it.</v>

455
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Like how long had the memo had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>floating around?</v>

456
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.180
<v Speaker 1>About a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

457
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.940
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as it went public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yikes.</v>

458
00:23:01.941 --> 00:23:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

459
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.833
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

460
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:09.590
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seemed to just be a PR thing.</v>

461
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

462
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.050
<v Speaker 1>But it's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weak,</v>

463
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

464
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.640
<v Speaker 1>it's really disturbing that someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't look at this for what it really</v>

465
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>is like this is an opportunity to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about the subject,</v>

466
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.460
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's this very detailed thing.</v>

467
00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>If you guys disagree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's debate it.</v>

468
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

469
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:34.800
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that I thought was even </v>
<v Speaker 1>remotely derogatory was that one word or</v>

470
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.930
<v Speaker 1>that one idea that women are more prone </v>
<v Speaker 1>to neuroticism.</v>

471
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.213
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seemed to me to be evolutionary </v>

472
00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:43.620
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to be like a lot of stuff that</v>

473
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 1>has already been really well researched</v>

474
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 4>and this is some pretty clear </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences and again,</v>

475
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:51.134
<v Speaker 4>it's not all women or all men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a tremendous amount of </v>

476
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:55.364
<v Speaker 4>evidence that shows that males lean </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards certain professions and females </v>

477
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:00.590
<v Speaker 4>lead towards other professions.</v>

478
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.073
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these are based on surveys of like </v>

479
00:24:03.431 --> 00:24:06.250
<v Speaker 3>half a million people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people are saying,</v>

480
00:24:06.251 --> 00:24:07.084
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just one study of the child is </v>

481
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.561
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

482
00:24:08.561 --> 00:24:12.640
<v Speaker 3>it's 90 different studies across many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different countries and you know,</v>

483
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.543
<v Speaker 3>there have been even experiments that </v>
<v Speaker 3>length this to just prenatal </v>

484
00:24:17.201 --> 00:24:18.580
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

485
00:24:18.581 --> 00:24:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Which is pretty strong evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some biological link.</v>

486
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.270
<v Speaker 4>We're all also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a company like Google,</v>

487
00:24:25.271 --> 00:24:27.880
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before we go any further,</v>

488
00:24:27.881 --> 00:24:30.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of Google use their </v>
<v Speaker 4>products all the time.</v>

489
00:24:30.401 --> 00:24:31.660
<v Speaker 4>I have a google phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

490
00:24:31.661 --> 00:24:35.230
<v Speaker 4>I think they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that browser is excellent.</v>

491
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.191
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

492
00:24:36.191 --> 00:24:40.090
<v Speaker 4>I use chrome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they kick ass every morning.</v>

493
00:24:40.091 --> 00:24:43.330
<v Speaker 4>I go to my phone and I check the google </v>
<v Speaker 4>news.</v>

494
00:24:43.331 --> 00:24:45.490
<v Speaker 4>I have a whole setup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's one of the first things I do.</v>

495
00:24:45.491 --> 00:24:47.530
<v Speaker 4>I check the news on my phone from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Google,</v>

496
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.320
<v Speaker 4>so it's not like I'm an google person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

497
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.260
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if</v>

498
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.563
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't some sort of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology reason or some sort of a </v>

499
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.543
<v Speaker 4>prenatal testosterone reason or some </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological reason why people were </v>

500
00:25:02.821 --> 00:25:04.830
<v Speaker 4>inclined to choose one profession over </v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

501
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.060
<v Speaker 4>google would have to be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible company.</v>

502
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.163
<v Speaker 4>If everything was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if everybody was 50 slash 50 and </v>

503
00:25:12.371 --> 00:25:15.180
<v Speaker 4>they're only hiring 20 percent women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that means they're monsters.</v>

504
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:18.230
<v Speaker 4>They're suppressing 30 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>weather.</v>

505
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.260
<v Speaker 4>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>

506
00:25:19.261 --> 00:25:21.420
<v Speaker 4>you can't work here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't get hired.</v>

507
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:24.270
<v Speaker 4>You're just as good as us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fuck off is a man's club.</v>

508
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.860
<v Speaker 4>They would have to be monsters.</v>

509
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I feel like some people </v>

510
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.650
<v Speaker 3>are shaming me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

511
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.513
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is such a bad thing to tell little </v>

512
00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:33.524
<v Speaker 3>girls that are interested in technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>when really I think this is a much </v>

513
00:25:36.021 --> 00:25:38.040
<v Speaker 3>better view of the world where it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

514
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're interested in technology,</v>

515
00:25:39.921 --> 00:25:42.400
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There aren't as many women my queue,</v>

516
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 3>but if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

517
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.210
<v Speaker 3>While the other side of the story is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

518
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.103
<v Speaker 3>even if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you'll find face all these </v>

519
00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:51.344
<v Speaker 3>challenges and it'll just be an uphill </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle against sexism and you'll never </v>

520
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.813
<v Speaker 3>be seen as good as a man and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not very encouraging to a lot of </v>

521
00:25:59.271 --> 00:25:59.950
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

522
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds so not.</v>

523
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:06.030
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessarily accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're kind of like bending the truth to</v>

524
00:26:06.491 --> 00:26:08.320
<v Speaker 4>meet your narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

525
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.340
<v Speaker 4>where instead we should maybe look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the differences between men and</v>

526
00:26:12.341 --> 00:26:13.174
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the thing people don't want </v>

527
00:26:14.411 --> 00:26:15.244
<v Speaker 4>to even accept.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a trend today to not accept </v>

528
00:26:18.071 --> 00:26:20.740
<v Speaker 4>biological differences between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sexes,</v>

529
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.620
<v Speaker 4>which is just fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like let's just not.</v>

530
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.140
<v Speaker 4>Let's not accept the fact that water </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets your wet.</v>

531
00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.573
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird when people ignore truth to </v>

532
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.163
<v Speaker 4>fit their ideology and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at like just sheer numbers of </v>

533
00:26:35.141 --> 00:26:37.240
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all you have is these numbers.</v>

534
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could have a bunch of reasons</v>
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

535
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.413
<v Speaker 4>but to say that the only reasons our </v>
<v Speaker 4>implicit biases that the only reason </v>

536
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:49.440
<v Speaker 4>this is some sort of discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 4>against women,</v>

537
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.150
<v Speaker 4>that's the only reason why they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>50 slash 50.</v>

538
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:53.460
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means we're monsters,</v>

539
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:54.391
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

540
00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 4>doesn't it mean more monsters?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means all men are monsters.</v>

541
00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it's often the exact opposite,</v>

542
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:02.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're very welcoming of women.</v>

543
00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:07.610
<v Speaker 3>We really want every woman that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get and you,</v>

544
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.223
<v Speaker 3>they'll even twist these studies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have where they'll do these large </v>

545
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:14.160
<v Speaker 3>analyses of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

546
00:27:14.161 --> 00:27:14.994
<v Speaker 3>why did you leave tech?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it will be broken down by men and </v>

547
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:18.474
<v Speaker 3>white men and it'll show a 30 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>women felt like there was unfair </v>

548
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:22.314
<v Speaker 3>treatment and harassment and then a one </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 10 women felt like there was undue </v>

549
00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:31.170
<v Speaker 3>sexual attention to them and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>media will just report on that.</v>

550
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.460
<v Speaker 3>But they don't see that 40 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>men compared to 30 percent of women felt</v>

551
00:27:35.461 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 3>like there was a unfair trade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men or harassment and then one in 12 men</v>

552
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.510
<v Speaker 3>felt like there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

553
00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.860
<v Speaker 3>unwanted sexual attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

554
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they completely disregard the other side</v>

555
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:48.930
<v Speaker 3>of the narrative that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

556
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:49.764
<v Speaker 3>it's not really a gender issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's just unfair treatment in </v>

557
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:53.874
<v Speaker 3>general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

558
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.843
<v Speaker 4>Well I think men are gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't want to work with them in an </v>

559
00:27:58.071 --> 00:27:58.904
<v Speaker 4>office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if I was a woman I would think </v>

560
00:28:00.201 --> 00:28:02.630
<v Speaker 4>that would be the worst place to work </v>
<v Speaker 4>because in an office with men,</v>

561
00:28:02.631 --> 00:28:03.464
<v Speaker 4>especially if I was attractive and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was just around a bunch of goons or </v>

562
00:28:05.871 --> 00:28:08.390
<v Speaker 4>staring at my butt and just saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid shit.</v>

563
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.253
<v Speaker 4>Men are gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think like generally is an </v>

564
00:28:11.001 --> 00:28:14.660
<v Speaker 4>issue with men and women working </v>
<v Speaker 4>together because a lot of men are gross.</v>

565
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.300
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not all of us obviously,</v>

566
00:28:17.301 --> 00:28:19.790
<v Speaker 4>but I mean just if I want to be honest </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>

567
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:23.420
<v Speaker 4>I would say that men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think women probably have to deal with</v>

568
00:28:23.421 --> 00:28:24.254
<v Speaker 4>a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is that the reason why only 20 </v>

569
00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:28.994
<v Speaker 4>percent of them are in tech because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the case with all jobs where </v>

570
00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.880
<v Speaker 4>they work together and I think men are </v>
<v Speaker 4>gross across the board.</v>

571
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.073
<v Speaker 4>They're not just growth in tech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're probably grows like what </v>

572
00:28:38.901 --> 00:28:39.734
<v Speaker 4>our jobs were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women are disproportionately </v>

573
00:28:41.061 --> 00:28:43.400
<v Speaker 4>represented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like on the other side,</v>

574
00:28:43.401 --> 00:28:45.590
<v Speaker 4>like is it like a healthcare center?</v>

575
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Nursing veterinarians schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of things that deal with people</v>

576
00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:52.670
<v Speaker 3>or animals in this case.</v>

577
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:53.683
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I bet they deal with gross dudes </v>

578
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.153
<v Speaker 4>there too here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't stop them from being </v>

579
00:29:00.441 --> 00:29:04.520
<v Speaker 4>hired at a disproportionally favorable </v>
<v Speaker 4>number percentage.</v>

580
00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>

581
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.930
<v Speaker 4>we got to look a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think collectively.</v>

582
00:29:08.931 --> 00:29:09.764
<v Speaker 4>Here's one good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the good thing about Google </v>

583
00:29:10.731 --> 00:29:11.564
<v Speaker 4>because I don't want to trash on Google.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the good thing about tech companies </v>

584
00:29:13.911 --> 00:29:14.744
<v Speaker 4>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like we are in a way better </v>

585
00:29:17.511 --> 00:29:22.430
<v Speaker 4>position that tech companies are leaning</v>
<v Speaker 4>way left.</v>

586
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.413
<v Speaker 4>I think we're in a way better position </v>
<v Speaker 4>socially that tech companies are being </v>

587
00:29:26.571 --> 00:29:30.950
<v Speaker 4>extremely concerned about diversity </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you just don't feel that.</v>

588
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.903
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of companies where they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the hard line there about the </v>

589
00:29:34.131 --> 00:29:35.510
<v Speaker 4>bottom line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making money,</v>

590
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.070
<v Speaker 4>kicking ass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking names,</v>

591
00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.380
<v Speaker 4>pushing the company ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're,</v>

592
00:29:39.381 --> 00:29:40.240
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're about,</v>

593
00:29:40.241 --> 00:29:41.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>infinite growth.</v>

594
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.620
<v Speaker 4>This is not what I see from tech </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies.</v>

595
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.453
<v Speaker 4>What I see from tech companies is </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme caution when it comes to social </v>

596
00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:53.791
<v Speaker 4>issues and this extreme desire to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought of as being very diverse,</v>

597
00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:56.170
<v Speaker 4>very fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very liberal.</v>

598
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.210
<v Speaker 4>I think that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

599
00:29:58.211 --> 00:29:59.044
<v Speaker 4>I think it balances it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I also think when I think at least </v>

600
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:03.184
<v Speaker 4>about the smartest people in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>or the most innovative people in the </v>

601
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:09.460
<v Speaker 4>world today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I almost always think about tech because</v>

602
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:10.930
<v Speaker 4>I think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you look,</v>

603
00:30:10.931 --> 00:30:15.340
<v Speaker 4>if you looked at the human organism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can look at the human organism,</v>

604
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.073
<v Speaker 4>the human species as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you looked at like what does it </v>

605
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 4>do that's most impressive?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

606
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:21.723
<v Speaker 4>what is does is his constant innovation </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this constant desire to make things </v>

607
00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:28.480
<v Speaker 4>more and more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>faster,</v>

608
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.510
<v Speaker 4>more capable that that's a big part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is tech.</v>

609
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 4>So the people that are like in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways,</v>

610
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:34.804
<v Speaker 4>at least the most technically creative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people are oftentimes very left </v>

611
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:43.330
<v Speaker 4>wing and very liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I liked the fact that Google has this</v>

612
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:44.164
<v Speaker 4>as a thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wish that it was unbiased in its </v>

613
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 4>determinations when it comes to biases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

614
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:54.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I agree that being progressive isn't </v>

615
00:30:57.451 --> 00:31:00.660
<v Speaker 3>necessarily a bad thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

616
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:05.500
<v Speaker 3>it is great that Google has this don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be evil motto and you know,</v>

617
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.080
<v Speaker 3>they've decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

618
00:31:07.081 --> 00:31:07.914
<v Speaker 3>we get a ton of ad revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore we can do a ton of random </v>

619
00:31:10.531 --> 00:31:12.870
<v Speaker 3>stuff that's good for the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

620
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.943
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think unfortunately there are </v>

621
00:31:15.301 --> 00:31:16.134
<v Speaker 3>political bias has created yet they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they haven't forgotten their don't be </v>

622
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.653
<v Speaker 3>evil motto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that don't be evil has turned </v>

623
00:31:24.361 --> 00:31:29.361
<v Speaker 3>into just don't disagree with us and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what our ideology says they got sloppy.</v>

624
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

625
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.960
<v Speaker 3>Well they're just a little off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're going the right way,</v>

626
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and look,</v>

627
00:31:37.941 --> 00:31:41.150
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

628
00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:41.984
<v Speaker 4>how could you run a giant company like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and be just totally cool and above </v>

629
00:31:45.471 --> 00:31:48.080
<v Speaker 4>ground and have it all worked out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

630
00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.310
<v Speaker 4>it just doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

631
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.870
<v Speaker 4>and especially when you have all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>internal influences,</v>

632
00:31:53.871 --> 00:31:55.850
<v Speaker 4>like you're talking with these activists</v>
<v Speaker 4>that work,</v>

633
00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:56.863
<v Speaker 4>that have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a vested interest in proving </v>

634
00:31:59.361 --> 00:32:01.340
<v Speaker 4>that there's racism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a vested interest,</v>

635
00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.990
<v Speaker 4>like when you go looking for a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

636
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a hammer,</v>

637
00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.950
<v Speaker 4>everything becomes an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

638
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.903
<v Speaker 4>If you're a person who's the type of </v>
<v Speaker 4>person that's looking for racism </v>

639
00:32:10.641 --> 00:32:11.630
<v Speaker 4>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck man.</v>

640
00:32:11.631 --> 00:32:13.320
<v Speaker 4>You're going to find it in all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird places.</v>

641
00:32:13.321 --> 00:32:14.780
<v Speaker 4>So like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't even make sense.</v>

642
00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.460
<v Speaker 4>Like these hidden unconscious biases </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you have to examine yourself.</v>

643
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:23.540
<v Speaker 4>Don't just look at overt actions and see</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not those actions or racism.</v>

644
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:24.410
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Racist.</v>

645
00:32:24.411 --> 00:32:28.940
<v Speaker 4>You have to actually examine all your </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts and try to find racist thoughts</v>

646
00:32:28.941 --> 00:32:31.390
<v Speaker 4>and because they are in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you want to believe it or not,</v>

647
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:32.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

648
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.910
<v Speaker 4>Jesus isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn goes ton.</v>

649
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:35.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a witch hunt</v>

650
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:37.370
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

651
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

652
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:40.784
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

653
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:41.803
<v Speaker 4>even though I'm a white man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really feel like it's leaning better </v>

654
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.840
<v Speaker 4>that we're shitting on white men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then,</v>

655
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was the other way,</v>

656
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.840
<v Speaker 4>if we were shitting on minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it would be very disturbing if an</v>

657
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:56.270
<v Speaker 4>enormous company like Google was going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well let's just,</v>

658
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.320
<v Speaker 4>let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Puerto Ricans are lazy.</v>

659
00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.313
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

660
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.253
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if a company comes along like </v>

661
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:02.871
<v Speaker 4>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

662
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:03.350
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

663
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.183
<v Speaker 4>white,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't be racist towards white </v>

664
00:33:05.301 --> 00:33:06.134
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

665
00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.060
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like least we can work here.</v>

666
00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 4>We could talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can talk about this,</v>

667
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:10.364
<v Speaker 4>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying something fucking crazy </v>

668
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:12.523
<v Speaker 4>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you don't think it's crazy and </v>

669
00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:14.624
<v Speaker 4>racist because you're trying so hard to </v>
<v Speaker 4>not be racist towards minorities that </v>

670
00:33:17.721 --> 00:33:19.970
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at what's a temporary </v>
<v Speaker 4>majority?</v>

671
00:33:19.971 --> 00:33:22.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean white people only majority for </v>
<v Speaker 4>another decade.</v>

672
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:24.070
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

673
00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:29.610
<v Speaker 4>I hope it evens out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like in defense of Google,</v>

674
00:33:30.171 --> 00:33:34.250
<v Speaker 4>it's better to be leaning incorrectly in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that direction</v>

675
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.220
<v Speaker 5>than to go the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

676
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's fine to have a leaning.</v>

677
00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:39.914
<v Speaker 5>It's just you need to not be blind to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other side and I think that that's </v>

678
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.620
<v Speaker 5>what's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

679
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:45.603
<v Speaker 5>Where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're completely shutting down the </v>

680
00:33:47.211 --> 00:33:48.044
<v Speaker 5>conversation and they're really making </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain employees feel completely </v>

681
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:54.200
<v Speaker 5>alienated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

682
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:55.640
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like you can't,</v>

683
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.880
<v Speaker 5>obviously you tried to talk about it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were fired.</v>

684
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:59.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

685
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.493
<v Speaker 5>I mean you were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were shamed for a little while and </v>

686
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:04.040
<v Speaker 5>then it went public and then you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>fired.</v>

687
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:06.410
<v Speaker 5>Now why did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did they do,</v>

688
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.453
<v Speaker 5>did they send it publicly because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>knew that people would have a negative </v>

689
00:34:09.411 --> 00:34:11.360
<v Speaker 5>reaction towards it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I think.</v>

690
00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know who did it.</v>

691
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:13.783
<v Speaker 5>It was probably the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>tweeting about it and saying that I was </v>

692
00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:18.240
<v Speaker 5>just a massage and it's Nazi person.</v>

693
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

694
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:23.720
<v Speaker 5>I definitely used white supremacists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nazi was used.</v>

695
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:24.763
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just keep escalating and at some </v>

696
00:34:26.811 --> 00:34:28.930
<v Speaker 5>point I don't really know it'll happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

697
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.090
<v Speaker 5>white supremacists is now being used for</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of things.</v>

698
00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:35.240
<v Speaker 5>You're a white supremacist somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

699
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.290
<v Speaker 5>And at some point people will just see </v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

700
00:34:39.291 --> 00:34:41.650
<v Speaker 5>these people aren't actually that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

701
00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.533
<v Speaker 5>they've just create a bubble of words </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they say and it just keeps getting </v>

702
00:34:47.031 --> 00:34:47.864
<v Speaker 5>more and more extreme and at some point </v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll just shatter like an economic </v>

703
00:34:52.221 --> 00:34:53.054
<v Speaker 5>bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

704
00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 5>but that's very dangerous because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>opens a door to competition to google,</v>

705
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.883
<v Speaker 5>like someone who is more rational.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's unfortunate for </v>

706
00:35:00.651 --> 00:35:04.340
<v Speaker 5>google to like to be supporting these </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous ideas.</v>

707
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.713
<v Speaker 5>Like I've read this one article with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this woman was calling you a misogynist </v>

708
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:10.010
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like a,</v>

709
00:35:10.011 --> 00:35:10.540
<v Speaker 5>she was</v>

710
00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.510
<v Speaker 4>being really brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

711
00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.660
<v Speaker 4>it was a total false narrative because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was listening,</v>

712
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.650
<v Speaker 4>I was reading it and I was trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

713
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:23.800
<v Speaker 4>I'd read your memo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I read your memo and then I read this</v>

714
00:35:23.801 --> 00:35:24.940
<v Speaker 4>article about your memo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

715
00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:25.803
<v Speaker 4>this is like an angry person that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>just decided that this is the focus of </v>

716
00:35:30.851 --> 00:35:31.684
<v Speaker 4>all the woes of the world is James and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to shit on James and the </v>

717
00:35:36.071 --> 00:35:36.904
<v Speaker 4>massages the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like James are the reason why women </v>

718
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 4>can't excel in tech.</v>

719
00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think part of that is that there's</v>

720
00:35:44.471 --> 00:35:45.304
<v Speaker 3>just an asymmetry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's no punishment for writing </v>

721
00:35:47.741 --> 00:35:51.680
<v Speaker 3>this really angry letter that says how </v>
<v Speaker 3>misogynist I am,</v>

722
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:57.270
<v Speaker 3>even though that's a negative to me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone else that has similar viewpoints.</v>

723
00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.163
<v Speaker 3>So there really needs to be some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>retribution maybe for people that just </v>

724
00:36:03.701 --> 00:36:05.680
<v Speaker 3>so openly are so negative,</v>

725
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.480
<v Speaker 4>you could just get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

726
00:36:07.481 --> 00:36:10.030
<v Speaker 4>And then no one questions it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not open for debate.</v>

727
00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.013
<v Speaker 4>That's really part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like people are so looking for </v>

728
00:36:13.451 --> 00:36:16.780
<v Speaker 4>things to be racist that when someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>cries racism,</v>

729
00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.450
<v Speaker 4>if you debate it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

730
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.393
<v Speaker 4>well how is he racist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you become a Nazi for like </v>

731
00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.050
<v Speaker 4>discussing things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you,</v>

732
00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:28.203
<v Speaker 4>even if you just objective go over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>facts and don't agree with their </v>

733
00:36:31.871 --> 00:36:33.850
<v Speaker 4>assessment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you become a racist.</v>

734
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

735
00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:37.950
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't say anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>overtly racist,</v>

736
00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:38.910
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

737
00:36:38.911 --> 00:36:43.911
<v Speaker 3>that's just dog whistling and Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell what he meant when he said</v>

738
00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 4>sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The could see it in his eyes.</v>

739
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:49.343
<v Speaker 4>This is I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not hyperbole what I'm going to </v>

740
00:36:51.331 --> 00:36:52.890
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is real.</v>

741
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 4>This is how mccarthyism got started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how it got started.</v>

742
00:36:57.781 --> 00:37:00.610
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was looking for communists and </v>
<v Speaker 4>every.</v>

743
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.960
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't even explore what communism</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like.</v>

744
00:37:03.961 --> 00:37:06.570
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't be confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I read a book today,</v>

745
00:37:06.571 --> 00:37:09.930
<v Speaker 4>like I've got a book over there by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Malice on North Korea.</v>

746
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:10.853
<v Speaker 4>If I read a book on North Korea like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what's what's going on in North </v>

747
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.673
<v Speaker 4>Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People wouldn't be like Joe Rogan's a </v>

748
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:17.940
<v Speaker 4>North Korean supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wants to move to North Korea.</v>

749
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:22.080
<v Speaker 4>He wants us all to be under a communist </v>
<v Speaker 4>dictatorship wrong by Kim Jong Moon.</v>

750
00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.730
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't say that,</v>

751
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

752
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:29.670
<v Speaker 4>back then you would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back then during the mccarthy era,</v>

753
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.653
<v Speaker 4>it gives you started reading like </v>
<v Speaker 4>communist newsletters or you started </v>

754
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:35.760
<v Speaker 4>going to a meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what?</v>

755
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:36.643
<v Speaker 4>What is this all about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could get shamed run out of </v>

756
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:40.800
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was a giant issue and people were</v>

757
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:43.740
<v Speaker 4>ratting on people and they were doing it</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the same reasons.</v>

758
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.290
<v Speaker 4>They did not want to be lumped in with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this group,</v>

759
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.000
<v Speaker 4>so they would immediately turn people </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

760
00:37:48.001 --> 00:37:48.834
<v Speaker 4>They were turning in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their neighbors were like scary time </v>

761
00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:52.680
<v Speaker 4>where people were looking for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>communists.</v>

762
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.870
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's looking for the dirty red </v>
<v Speaker 4>scare,</v>

763
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to come and infiltrate our</v>

764
00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:01.220
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very similar because it's,</v>

765
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.330
<v Speaker 4>it's a mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

766
00:38:03.331 --> 00:38:03.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

767
00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:04.653
<v Speaker 4>this mindset of not looking at things </v>
<v Speaker 4>objectively but having everything boxed </v>

768
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:12.600
<v Speaker 4>into these very convenient packages and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is one of them,</v>

769
00:38:12.601 --> 00:38:13.434
<v Speaker 4>that diversity is of the utmost </v>
<v Speaker 4>importance and that anything that does </v>

770
00:38:17.221 --> 00:38:18.054
<v Speaker 4>not challenge that idea or anything that</v>
<v Speaker 4>does not support that idea rather is </v>

771
00:38:22.111 --> 00:38:22.944
<v Speaker 4>racist.</v>

772
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was sort of what I was trying </v>

773
00:38:25.191 --> 00:38:28.070
<v Speaker 3>to say when I said demoralized diversity</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

774
00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:28.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've just put on such a pedestal and </v>

775
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.823
<v Speaker 3>we've stopped looking at the costs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits of it and we've just started </v>

776
00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:36.700
<v Speaker 3>looking for villains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

777
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:41.701
<v Speaker 3>all the racists and we just want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>punish those villains and an label.</v>

778
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:42.754
<v Speaker 3>Anyone that disagrees with any of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>precepts of diversity as some sort of </v>

779
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:48.250
<v Speaker 3>evil person.</v>

780
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.270
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just sort of foolish approach,</v>

781
00:38:50.271 --> 00:38:51.104
<v Speaker 4>especially the approach of making Asian </v>
<v Speaker 4>people get higher scores that is so </v>

782
00:38:54.651 --> 00:38:55.940
<v Speaker 4>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

783
00:38:55.941 --> 00:38:57.890
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they study harder and do better.</v>

784
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.410
<v Speaker 4>What's the reason?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

785
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.020
<v Speaker 4>whatever the reason is they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

786
00:39:03.021 --> 00:39:04.820
<v Speaker 4>is it cultural?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>

787
00:39:04.821 --> 00:39:07.070
<v Speaker 4>Is it a biological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what,</v>

788
00:39:07.071 --> 00:39:07.904
<v Speaker 4>but whatever reason it is the correct </v>
<v Speaker 4>response that is not make Asians get </v>

789
00:39:11.541 --> 00:39:13.760
<v Speaker 4>higher scores.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking insane.</v>

790
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.060
<v Speaker 4>Super Racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

791
00:39:17.061 --> 00:39:19.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean how racist is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

792
00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:20.923
<v Speaker 4>Like why are they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean and there are minority which is </v>

793
00:39:22.881 --> 00:39:23.714
<v Speaker 4>even weirder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's somehow or another that one is </v>

794
00:39:25.251 --> 00:39:28.060
<v Speaker 4>like we let that one slide because we </v>
<v Speaker 4>know they,</v>

795
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.640
<v Speaker 4>they don't complain and they kick ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they'd go and study hard.</v>

796
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.090
<v Speaker 4>So for some reason we like let that one </v>
<v Speaker 4>slip.</v>

797
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:36.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of this has some really </v>

798
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:42.980
<v Speaker 3>nefarious history were the beginnings of</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

799
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used to just have tests and then that</v>

800
00:39:45.651 --> 00:39:48.110
<v Speaker 3>would be how you got into Harvard for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

801
00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.450
<v Speaker 3>and whoever has the highest score we get</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

802
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:51.643
<v Speaker 3>but then they saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh there's too many Jewish people </v>

803
00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:58.340
<v Speaker 3>getting in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they started adding all this,</v>

804
00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.830
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's look at your extra curriculars and</v>

805
00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:05.600
<v Speaker 3>let's make it more subjective on who we </v>
<v Speaker 3>get in and that,</v>

806
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:07.730
<v Speaker 3>that way they could discriminate against</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish people.</v>

807
00:40:07.731 --> 00:40:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how it started.</v>

808
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was like early 1900.</v>

809
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.600
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

810
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:14.710
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's another one.</v>

811
00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:15.544
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a disproportion amount of </v>

812
00:40:16.571 --> 00:40:18.820
<v Speaker 4>European Jews that are Nobel prize </v>
<v Speaker 4>winners.</v>

813
00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:19.900
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

814
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking smart.</v>

815
00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:22.883
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does,</v>

816
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.700
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean that we're,</v>

817
00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:28.360
<v Speaker 4>we're prejudice against Irish people </v>
<v Speaker 4>know what does it mean?</v>

818
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it,</v>

819
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.650
<v Speaker 4>whatever it means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The end result is what's significant.</v>

820
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:35.740
<v Speaker 4>We're not stopping other people from </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking these tests.</v>

821
00:40:35.741 --> 00:40:37.700
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get a disproportion amount,</v>

822
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.260
<v Speaker 4>portion amount of European Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there should be some sort of study in.</v>

823
00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 4>There has been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there should be some sort of studies</v>

824
00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 4>as to what is it culturally like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

825
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:47.110
<v Speaker 4>What is the significance?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

826
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.123
<v Speaker 4>what has happened in the past that led </v>
<v Speaker 4>this one group of people to be </v>

827
00:40:52.211 --> 00:40:53.860
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful,</v>

828
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.060
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily successful in one area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what we should study.</v>

829
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:01.600
<v Speaker 4>We should try to keep Jewish people out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking insane.</v>

830
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.733
<v Speaker 4>And it's racist and I think Asian people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are not complaining the same way other </v>

831
00:41:08.711 --> 00:41:11.890
<v Speaker 4>folks would know with the same exact </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>

832
00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.300
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

833
00:41:13.301 --> 00:41:17.290
<v Speaker 4>it's essentially a reverse affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 4>action sort of a situation.</v>

834
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.573
<v Speaker 4>Really Weird.</v>

835
00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:20.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unfortunate.</v>

836
00:41:20.851 --> 00:41:21.684
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially since many of these are just </v>

837
00:41:23.341 --> 00:41:24.174
<v Speaker 3>first generation immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel like they necessarily </v>

838
00:41:26.461 --> 00:41:30.240
<v Speaker 3>have the power to really stand up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of this.</v>

839
00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:31.880
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

840
00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.713
<v Speaker 4>have any very Asian friends?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever been around like really </v>

841
00:41:35.181 --> 00:41:36.620
<v Speaker 4>strict Asian households?</v>

842
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:37.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the culture is definitely different and </v>

843
00:41:39.721 --> 00:41:43.510
<v Speaker 3>there is a higher priority on school and</v>
<v Speaker 3>more traditional values.</v>

844
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:44.503
<v Speaker 4>I had a good buddy of mine when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>young who was Korean and he was in </v>

845
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 4>medical school and his parents were </v>
<v Speaker 4>Burger udl.</v>

846
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean they just wanted a's across the </v>
<v Speaker 4>board.</v>

847
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:57.163
<v Speaker 4>No fucking excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will study until your hands bleed </v>

848
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.483
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was just this sort of culture of </v>

849
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.480
<v Speaker 4>success in that household and have work </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard work and hard work ethic.</v>

850
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.040
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the family's idea was like,</v>

851
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:16.670
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we came over to America from South Korea</v>

852
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:18.980
<v Speaker 4>so that you could kick ass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>

853
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.750
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to come over here and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck off.</v>

854
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.450
<v Speaker 4>And obviously he was a fucking straight </v>
<v Speaker 4>a student and a,</v>

855
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 4>just a wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this dude was just always awesome</v>

856
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:29.210
<v Speaker 4>at everything and always working really </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard.</v>

857
00:42:29.211 --> 00:42:31.890
<v Speaker 4>But he was completely stressed out all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time and everything.</v>

858
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just getting everything done.</v>

859
00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:36.860
<v Speaker 4>But I mean it's the culture that he grew</v>
<v Speaker 4>up in.</v>

860
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:38.810
<v Speaker 4>So to discriminate against that guy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

861
00:42:38.811 --> 00:42:41.350
<v Speaker 4>well you work too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

862
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:42.530
<v Speaker 4>junk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

863
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

864
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:46.160
<v Speaker 4>your scores are a little bit too high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't like it.</v>

865
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.740
<v Speaker 4>So we're gonna we're gonna need a higher</v>
<v Speaker 4>threshold for you.</v>

866
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:50.203
<v Speaker 4>That's racist.</v>

867
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing that they can do.</v>

868
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.350
<v Speaker 3>You can't work harder and know.</v>

869
00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:57.443
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's stupid.</v>

870
00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.360
<v Speaker 4>It's like saying to athletes like </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain athletes so,</v>

871
00:43:00.361 --> 00:43:00.781
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

872
00:43:00.781 --> 00:43:01.614
<v Speaker 4>you've been training too hard and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to need a faster 40 yard </v>

873
00:43:04.951 --> 00:43:07.860
<v Speaker 4>dash from you than a regular person to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get on the team.</v>

874
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:09.360
<v Speaker 4>He would never say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would say,</v>

875
00:43:09.361 --> 00:43:10.194
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy is obviously super dedicated </v>

876
00:43:11.341 --> 00:43:13.530
<v Speaker 4>and gifted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the guy we want our team.</v>

877
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:18.860
<v Speaker 4>And that's the one thing where I feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like we don't see a lot of this stuff.</v>

878
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

879
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.063
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we like results when it comes to </v>

880
00:43:22.711 --> 00:43:25.020
<v Speaker 4>athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it comes to things like,</v>

881
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.480
<v Speaker 4>what's your number?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

882
00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:28.470
<v Speaker 4>what is the fastest you can run?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>

883
00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.260
<v Speaker 4>how high can you jump?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the pole vault that you do,</v>

884
00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how far do you throw a disc?</v>

885
00:43:32.661 --> 00:43:37.050
<v Speaker 4>Is all those things like very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very clear numbers.</v>

886
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.153
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do that sort of same sort of </v>

887
00:43:39.631 --> 00:43:42.930
<v Speaker 4>approach that you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>academics or with industry.</v>

888
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.210
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that approach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it comes to athletics,</v>

889
00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:46.980
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

890
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:48.023
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not suggesting that the whole world </v>

891
00:43:50.311 --> 00:43:52.520
<v Speaker 4>is a sport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean when,</v>

892
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to things like scores and </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping people out and letting people in</v>

893
00:43:58.351 --> 00:43:59.184
<v Speaker 4>and trying to push to get more people of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain color ethnicity and like </v>

894
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.550
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

895
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.590
<v Speaker 4>doing some slippery work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

896
00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:09.870
<v Speaker 4>you know that it gets real weird when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you start doing that.</v>

897
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

898
00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:11.423
<v Speaker 3>it's all about leveling the outcomes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and yet I think there's this </v>

899
00:44:16.671 --> 00:44:17.504
<v Speaker 3>scary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Kurt vonnegut short story where if </v>

900
00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:23.180
<v Speaker 3>you're a really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you'll have to wear headphones that</v>

901
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:25.340
<v Speaker 3>just beep all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a beautiful,</v>

902
00:44:25.341 --> 00:44:28.580
<v Speaker 3>you'll have to wear a mask in the future</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're strong and you'll have to have</v>

903
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:31.470
<v Speaker 3>all of these weights on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

904
00:44:31.471 --> 00:44:32.304
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

905
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:33.343
<v Speaker 5>sort of getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the same sort of ideology and it's </v>

906
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:37.240
<v Speaker 5>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

907
00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:38.990
<v Speaker 5>life is not fair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

908
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.043
<v Speaker 5>It is just not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one wants to hear that and this is </v>

909
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.690
<v Speaker 5>really the core issue for all of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

910
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.553
<v Speaker 5>Life is not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are people that are so much </v>

911
00:44:48.751 --> 00:44:50.670
<v Speaker 5>fucking smarter than me when I talked to</v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

912
00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:53.110
<v Speaker 5>I feel like some sort of a monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

913
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 5>just just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no getting around that.</v>

914
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.410
<v Speaker 5>There are people that are so much bigger</v>
<v Speaker 5>than me,</v>

915
00:44:58.411 --> 00:45:00.510
<v Speaker 5>but then I stand next to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like a child,</v>

916
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's just no getting around that,</v>

917
00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 5>that that's just the way of the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think the key is,</v>

918
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:08.913
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess with a company is to try to </v>

919
00:45:10.201 --> 00:45:11.034
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to manage all of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>unfair aspects of being a biological </v>

920
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 5>entity and the civilization.</v>

921
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.823
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think Google is doing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right job by firing you for promoting </v>

922
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:26.250
<v Speaker 5>science because that's what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>

923
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.233
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a friend who actually was </v>

924
00:45:28.201 --> 00:45:31.410
<v Speaker 5>comparing what you did to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's that term friend knology when you</v>

925
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:34.740
<v Speaker 5>study the size of people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they got there.</v>

926
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

927
00:45:36.181 --> 00:45:38.190
<v Speaker 5>you can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not what he's doing.</v>

928
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 5>He's doing because he's not saying that </v>
<v Speaker 5>women can't do it.</v>

929
00:45:40.921 --> 00:45:42.570
<v Speaker 5>He's not saying they wouldn't be better </v>
<v Speaker 5>at it.</v>

930
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:43.583
<v Speaker 5>He's simply using science and citations </v>
<v Speaker 5>to describe many of the issues that </v>

931
00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:51.990
<v Speaker 5>probably led to people choosing what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they choose to do for a career.</v>

932
00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.000
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you can't do that,</v>

933
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:54.780
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

934
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.620
<v Speaker 5>look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're here.</v>

935
00:45:55.621 --> 00:45:57.510
<v Speaker 5>You're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about this.</v>

936
00:45:58.210 --> 00:45:59.043
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean hopefully people will start </v>

937
00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:03.750
<v Speaker 5>seeing that at least how much the media </v>
<v Speaker 5>was misrepresenting it.</v>

938
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.153
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

939
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.530
<v Speaker 5>Did you feel frustrated by all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>articles?</v>

940
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:09.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got to be weird to have people call</v>

941
00:46:09.211 --> 00:46:12.110
<v Speaker 5>you a white supremacist and a Nazi and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

942
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.103
<v Speaker 5>and they also try to dig up any dirt </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they can find on my history and </v>

943
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:20.063
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Way Back in high school that I might've </v>

944
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:26.930
<v Speaker 5>done tomb raider it as war Croft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a girl running big tits.</v>

945
00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.970
<v Speaker 5>Did they find anything?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not really.</v>

946
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:31.403
<v Speaker 5>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

947
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.540
<v Speaker 5>What if you had like some dark secret?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

948
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:37.380
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I could have done some random thing</v>

949
00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:40.920
<v Speaker 5>that was bad of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean that wouldn't change the fact</v>

950
00:46:40.921 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 5>that what I wrote wasn't the sexist </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

951
00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:45.453
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you did something horrible in the </v>

952
00:46:45.931 --> 00:46:47.610
<v Speaker 5>past,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least people can go,</v>

953
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.151
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

954
00:46:48.151 --> 00:46:48.984
<v Speaker 5>maybe this guy's a bullshit artist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he leaned this stuff toward sexism </v>

955
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:55.350
<v Speaker 5>even though there is some science behind</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

956
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.183
<v Speaker 5>What he wrote was biased,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I haven't seen a legit criticism of </v>

957
00:46:58.741 --> 00:47:00.690
<v Speaker 5>the actual work itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really haven't.</v>

958
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've read a lot of stuff on you,</v>

959
00:47:02.491 --> 00:47:03.570
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a little creepy.</v>

960
00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.800
<v Speaker 5>I haven't seen anything that made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything that was criticizing,</v>

961
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.140
<v Speaker 5>criticizing you was being really </v>
<v Speaker 5>dishonest.</v>

962
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was either just,</v>

963
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.930
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is obviously misogynist,</v>

964
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 5>or they would attack claims that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't make.</v>

965
00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:16.710
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

966
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.980
<v Speaker 5>we've shown that women are better in </v>
<v Speaker 5>school and are doing better in math.</v>

967
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:23.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

968
00:47:23.101 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't talking about that at all.</v>

969
00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does nothing to do with career paths,</v>

970
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:28.853
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

971
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 5>was really fascinating to</v>

972
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:30.933
<v Speaker 4>me that the woman who's the CEO of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Youtube responded and said it hurt her </v>

973
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.830
<v Speaker 4>and she read your memo and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're the CEO of Youtube.</v>

974
00:47:38.831 --> 00:47:39.664
<v Speaker 4>You won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're the winner of winters when it </v>

975
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 4>comes to ut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're the head of tech,</v>

976
00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 4>like no one's saying you don't exist </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying you can't do it.</v>

977
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:49.420
<v Speaker 4>You obviously did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a fucking running the thing.</v>

978
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.250
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did it hurt?</v>

979
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 4>Science hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What hurts?</v>

980
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.153
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

981
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:55.740
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

982
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:57.550
<v Speaker 4>there's outliers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

983
00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.493
<v Speaker 4>There's always going to be interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>to find out why straight white males </v>

984
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.250
<v Speaker 4>choose different career paths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why?</v>

985
00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:07.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much variation.</v>

986
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.370
<v Speaker 4>There's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So many variables.</v>

987
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.850
<v Speaker 4>There's so much difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people that are um,</v>

988
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's women that are mma fighters.</v>

989
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 4>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are they doing that?</v>

990
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:18.281
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

991
00:48:18.281 --> 00:48:19.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>

992
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.880
<v Speaker 4>there's women that are race car drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>

993
00:48:21.881 --> 00:48:22.714
<v Speaker 4>there's outliers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean that we need a exact </v>

994
00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:28.390
<v Speaker 4>representation of males to females in </v>
<v Speaker 4>mma?</v>

995
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's insane.</v>

996
00:48:29.741 --> 00:48:32.110
<v Speaker 4>That's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For whatever reason.</v>

997
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.780
<v Speaker 4>Is that the state with that Nascar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to happen.</v>

998
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:35.763
<v Speaker 4>There's not some implicit bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's keeping women from driving 250 </v>

999
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:41.410
<v Speaker 4>miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>

1000
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's probably some biological</v>

1001
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:48.940
<v Speaker 4>differences between men and women and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they vary.</v>

1002
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:49.803
<v Speaker 4>There's a spectrum,</v>

1003
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Nascar it's likely,</v>

1004
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:53.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>risk aversion.</v>

1005
00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some stuff related to that.</v>

1006
00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Same with MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1007
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I wouldn't want.</v>

1008
00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean look at it and I want to do it,</v>

1009
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:04.643
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know a lot of pretty girls that </v>

1010
00:49:05.981 --> 00:49:07.570
<v Speaker 4>are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very weird.</v>

1011
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.050
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look there's people make choices,</v>

1012
00:49:11.051 --> 00:49:11.884
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people choose to get their bodies </v>

1013
00:49:13.391 --> 00:49:14.224
<v Speaker 4>tattooed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people choose to do all sorts of </v>

1014
00:49:16.331 --> 00:49:17.740
<v Speaker 4>strange things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1015
00:49:17.741 --> 00:49:20.680
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why they do what they do,</v>

1016
00:49:20.681 --> 00:49:21.514
<v Speaker 4>but it's interesting to study them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me that all you were doing </v>

1017
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:30.030
<v Speaker 4>was talking about your own personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>frustration with this very narrow minded</v>

1018
00:49:30.131 --> 00:49:31.660
<v Speaker 4>approach to diversity.</v>

1019
00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1020
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:39.200
<v Speaker 3>they never even say what exactly I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>have done differently to not do this.</v>

1021
00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.093
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was actually a great piece in the </v>

1022
00:49:41.961 --> 00:49:46.100
<v Speaker 3>Atlantic or something that was directed </v>
<v Speaker 3>at Sundar is like,</v>

1023
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:47.083
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what specific parts of the document </v>

1024
00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:49.753
<v Speaker 3>we're against the code of conduct and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what parts are free to discuss and what </v>

1025
00:49:53.181 --> 00:49:54.014
<v Speaker 3>are not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because right now you can't discuss </v>

1026
00:49:56.091 --> 00:49:56.840
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1027
00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.830
<v Speaker 3>he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1028
00:49:57.831 --> 00:50:02.150
<v Speaker 3>this document is invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it means that no one can bring up</v>

1029
00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:06.200
<v Speaker 3>any of these issues now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just they just have to walk on these</v>

1030
00:50:06.201 --> 00:50:10.130
<v Speaker 3>really vague eggshells when really if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they said no,</v>

1031
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.790
<v Speaker 3>this specific part is unacceptable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else is fine,</v>

1032
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:15.283
<v Speaker 3>then at least there will be some wiggle </v>
<v Speaker 3>room and people would know what the </v>

1033
00:50:17.991 --> 00:50:19.160
<v Speaker 3>rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

1034
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.313
<v Speaker 3>And we see this a lot with Google policy</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they had these like no jerk </v>

1035
00:50:23.091 --> 00:50:25.170
<v Speaker 3>policies and no jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1036
00:50:25.171 --> 00:50:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Like don't be a jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1037
00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:30.110
<v Speaker 3>And were jerk is totally up to them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>define.</v>

1038
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:32.300
<v Speaker 3>And so there could be these people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1039
00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:33.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>harassed you based on your white male </v>

1040
00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:37.880
<v Speaker 3>privilege and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you're conservative,</v>

1041
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 3>therefore you're evil and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a jerk.</v>

1042
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:42.230
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1043
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:43.064
<v Speaker 3>questioning some of their viewpoints and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the narrative at Google that it's being </v>

1044
00:50:47.631 --> 00:50:48.464
<v Speaker 3>a jerk.</v>

1045
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 4>So white people are open game </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially.</v>

1046
00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:52.143
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone is questioning you about</v>
<v Speaker 4>something and you happen to be a white </v>

1047
00:50:56.601 --> 00:50:58.430
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got to get away with far more.</v>

1048
00:50:59.010 --> 00:50:59.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to invoke this a lot too in </v>

1049
00:51:02.801 --> 00:51:07.680
<v Speaker 3>these programs where you're encouraged </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you ask a question or something you</v>

1050
00:51:07.681 --> 00:51:10.990
<v Speaker 3>say as a white male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I feel.</v>

1051
00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that.</v>

1052
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:16.710
<v Speaker 3>I just think that that's really specific</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

1053
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.630
<v Speaker 4>White male with a fat Dick and a large </v>
<v Speaker 4>pornography collection on a hard drive.</v>

1054
00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 4>That's how feel like</v>

1055
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.800
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1056
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:25.643
<v Speaker 3>I think even mentioning pornography </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be some sort of microaggression </v>

1057
00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:31.120
<v Speaker 3>and that's a major aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1058
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Sexual harassment.</v>

1059
00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:34.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were a.</v>

1060
00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:39.330
<v Speaker 4>They cited that you promoted harmful </v>
<v Speaker 4>gender stereotypes.</v>

1061
00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.080
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had to go over it again.</v>

1062
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:41.621
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1063
00:51:41.621 --> 00:51:43.150
<v Speaker 4>let's read this fucking thing one more </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1064
00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:44.693
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you've promoted any </v>

1065
00:51:46.361 --> 00:51:47.194
<v Speaker 4>stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were talking with citations about </v>

1066
00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:51.243
<v Speaker 4>science and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where this whole thing really </v>

1067
00:51:54.701 --> 00:51:55.534
<v Speaker 4>confused the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What have you had many people like what </v>

1068
00:51:59.521 --> 00:52:00.400
<v Speaker 4>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1069
00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.640
<v Speaker 4>has there been like a 50 slash 50 sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of reaction,</v>

1070
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:06.220
<v Speaker 4>like 50 percent of the people were like </v>
<v Speaker 4>me kind of confused about this and,</v>

1071
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:07.363
<v Speaker 4>and then 50 percent of the people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>just knee jerk calling you some sort of </v>

1072
00:52:10.271 --> 00:52:11.800
<v Speaker 4>a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A sexist or a Nazi.</v>

1073
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at Google they had an internal poll </v>

1074
00:52:14.201 --> 00:52:17.530
<v Speaker 3>with about 800 people and about 40 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of people agreed.</v>

1075
00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:18.500
<v Speaker 3>And 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Fifty percent disagree with 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>were neutral.</v>

1077
00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:22.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cowards.</v>

1078
00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.123
<v Speaker 4>And even the 50 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably a good percentage of them are </v>

1079
00:52:26.141 --> 00:52:28.560
<v Speaker 4>just being pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't.</v>

1080
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:32.980
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem like if you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at it really objectively,</v>

1081
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:33.873
<v Speaker 4>you could look that they obviously want </v>
<v Speaker 4>a result and that result is the maximum </v>

1082
00:52:40.151 --> 00:52:45.151
<v Speaker 4>amount of diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like if that's your result,</v>

1083
00:52:45.851 --> 00:52:46.684
<v Speaker 4>if that's what you're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't the result be let's not </v>

1084
00:52:49.211 --> 00:52:50.044
<v Speaker 4>discriminate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just be open and just try to get the </v>

1085
00:52:52.661 --> 00:52:54.940
<v Speaker 4>best people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like wouldn't that be the best way to do</v>

1086
00:52:54.941 --> 00:52:56.590
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if we run into problems like,</v>

1087
00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:57.573
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've tried to do this best people </v>

1088
00:52:58.211 --> 00:53:00.220
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all we have as Asians,</v>

1089
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.233
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1090
00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:01.880
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1091
00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.440
<v Speaker 3>So even suggesting that we should go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling meritocracy thing.</v>

1092
00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.470
<v Speaker 3>That's a microaggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meritocracy is a microaggression.</v>

1093
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1094
00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:11.173
<v Speaker 3>So what's the argument for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why is meritocracy a </v>

1095
00:53:15.391 --> 00:53:16.224
<v Speaker 3>microaggression?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it will make some people feel </v>

1096
00:53:18.981 --> 00:53:23.220
<v Speaker 3>unwelcome because they have to perform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

1097
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:24.763
<v Speaker 3>it's basically just anything against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last ideology is a microaggression in </v>

1098
00:53:29.311 --> 00:53:30.144
<v Speaker 3>some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anything that could make anyone feel </v>

1099
00:53:32.611 --> 00:53:36.120
<v Speaker 3>offended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly people in certain groups.</v>

1100
00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.050
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an liberal for a long time.</v>

1101
00:53:39.051 --> 00:53:39.884
<v Speaker 4>And I've never seen it this bad before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what happened when it </v>

1102
00:53:43.881 --> 00:53:44.714
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So slippery it seems like within the </v>

1103
00:53:48.051 --> 00:53:49.100
<v Speaker 4>last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1104
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the Internet has celebrated a </v>

1105
00:53:51.481 --> 00:53:52.314
<v Speaker 3>lot of this where there can be these </v>
<v Speaker 3>online mobs that enforced these social </v>

1106
00:53:55.981 --> 00:53:59.000
<v Speaker 3>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1107
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:02.700
<v Speaker 3>I think at least now some people can see</v>
<v Speaker 3>it for what it is.</v>

1108
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

1109
00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.293
<v Speaker 4>what you're seeing is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fear of retribution and that's one of </v>

1110
00:54:08.501 --> 00:54:09.334
<v Speaker 4>the reasons why people are towing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>line is that they're worried about </v>

1111
00:54:11.801 --> 00:54:12.634
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hyper aggressive people that are </v>

1112
00:54:13.811 --> 00:54:17.650
<v Speaker 4>coming out against people that don't toe</v>
<v Speaker 4>the line there,</v>

1113
00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:18.603
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're saying shaming you and that </v>

1114
00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:21.693
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a disturbing aspect of human </v>

1115
00:54:24.191 --> 00:54:27.310
<v Speaker 4>nature that I don't think she'd ever be </v>
<v Speaker 4>reinforced.</v>

1116
00:54:27.311 --> 00:54:28.100
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1117
00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:28.933
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's hard to call those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things out individually because of </v>

1118
00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:33.813
<v Speaker 4>collectively as a group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this group of diversity minded folks </v>

1119
00:54:37.601 --> 00:54:41.050
<v Speaker 4>left wing minded social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 4>types are attacking you,</v>

1120
00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.020
<v Speaker 4>you feel very isolated and there's not a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of support,</v>

1121
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.413
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so most people just acquiesced they </v>

1122
00:54:47.291 --> 00:54:49.180
<v Speaker 4>just back off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just give in,</v>

1123
00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:50.163
<v Speaker 4>they toe the line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they alter their thoughts or they keep </v>

1124
00:54:53.801 --> 00:54:54.634
<v Speaker 4>it to themselves.</v>

1125
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I think shaming does have its</v>

1126
00:54:57.601 --> 00:55:00.660
<v Speaker 3>benefits it and when we were in small </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups,</v>

1127
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:03.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone stole something or was mean,</v>

1128
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:04.703
<v Speaker 3>Dan actually shaming them as good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're talking about tribal groups </v>

1129
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.003
<v Speaker 3>in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:13.220
<v Speaker 3>But now that anyone across the world can</v>
<v Speaker 3>just randomly shame you and attack you,</v>

1131
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:19.430
<v Speaker 3>that does not really what our brain was </v>
<v Speaker 3>meant for and just,</v>

1132
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:20.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even me seeing just random messages </v>

1133
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.100
<v Speaker 3>telling me that I'm some horrible person</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1134
00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hurts me even though I have gotten </v>

1135
00:55:29.281 --> 00:55:31.890
<v Speaker 3>a lot of actual private messages saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1136
00:55:31.891 --> 00:55:34.230
<v Speaker 3>we support you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not alone,</v>

1137
00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:37.470
<v Speaker 3>but I have to keep my mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get fired from Yahoo.</v>

1138
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met with so many people and they're</v>

1139
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:42.240
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

1140
00:55:42.241 --> 00:55:44.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't tell anyone that you.</v>

1141
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:45.953
<v Speaker 3>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you obviously we're not a public </v>

1142
00:55:48.781 --> 00:55:49.710
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1143
00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:52.490
<v Speaker 3>You were a guy just was working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is your job at Google?</v>

1144
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:53.573
<v Speaker 3>A software engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working on the indexing and </v>

1145
00:55:56.911 --> 00:55:58.560
<v Speaker 3>serving of a search.</v>

1146
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:02.550
<v Speaker 4>So to go from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1147
00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:05.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you describe yourself as an introvert,</v>

1148
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:06.583
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to go from that to this massive </v>

1149
00:56:09.121 --> 00:56:14.121
<v Speaker 4>exposure and to be the essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lightning rod for a real hot topic.</v>

1150
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:17.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is one of the most hot </v>
<v Speaker 4>button topics you can get.</v>

1151
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.300
<v Speaker 4>Men versus women in tech are men and </v>
<v Speaker 4>women in tech,</v>

1152
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:22.740
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>diversity,</v>

1153
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 4>white people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black people,</v>

1154
00:56:24.401 --> 00:56:27.800
<v Speaker 4>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nazis who you're,</v>

1155
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:30.310
<v Speaker 4>you're at the tip of the spear buddy.</v>

1156
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:31.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm really afraid that I'm actually </v>

1157
00:56:33.361 --> 00:56:38.361
<v Speaker 3>just polarizing issue even more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>separating people and because you know,</v>

1158
00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:40.773
<v Speaker 3>it's really shown that there are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stereotypes are real and some ways that </v>

1159
00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:46.853
<v Speaker 3>there are some really extreme people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left and really extreme people in </v>

1160
00:56:49.591 --> 00:56:54.270
<v Speaker 3>the right maybe and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really need to bridge it and say,</v>

1161
00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:57.540
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's actually have a discussion,</v>

1162
00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:58.403
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about what's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening and nothing is really off the </v>

1163
00:57:01.801 --> 00:57:04.920
<v Speaker 3>table in this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not happening.</v>

1164
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.800
<v Speaker 3>And Google itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I've heard,</v>

1165
00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:08.873
<v Speaker 3>they've just been doubling down on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity stuff and they haven't </v>

1166
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.050
<v Speaker 3>addressed any of the political </v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination.</v>

1167
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:14.203
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think you're right and I think </v>

1168
00:57:15.741 --> 00:57:16.574
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That has to be your motivation for </v>

1169
00:57:18.591 --> 00:57:19.850
<v Speaker 4>writing that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1170
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.863
<v Speaker 4>that was a very well thought out memo </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think someone who wanted to </v>

1171
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:29.503
<v Speaker 4>separate people would have written that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way it seemed to me as an outsider </v>

1172
00:57:33.861 --> 00:57:36.680
<v Speaker 4>with no dog in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was looking.</v>

1173
00:57:36.681 --> 00:57:37.071
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1174
00:57:37.071 --> 00:57:40.610
<v Speaker 4>this guy is probably like frustrated at </v>
<v Speaker 4>what he sees,</v>

1175
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.473
<v Speaker 4>these sort of social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 4>tactics and these aren't logical and </v>

1176
00:57:44.751 --> 00:57:45.584
<v Speaker 4>that this is not rational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like maybe my breakdown of this </v>

1177
00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:51.874
<v Speaker 4>situation scientifically evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology studies and all these </v>

1178
00:57:55.221 --> 00:57:56.054
<v Speaker 4>different random factors that may have </v>
<v Speaker 4>contributed to women choosing these </v>

1179
00:57:59.691 --> 00:58:02.120
<v Speaker 4>careers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe this will help ease off.</v>

1180
00:58:02.121 --> 00:58:03.560
<v Speaker 4>Maybe people aren't aware of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

1181
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:05.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1182
00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:06.613
<v Speaker 3>I definitely have a bias where I thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could just sit down and discuss it </v>

1183
00:58:09.441 --> 00:58:10.274
<v Speaker 3>rationally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I ever wanted was sit down </v>

1184
00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.780
<v Speaker 3>and discuss it with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1185
00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:14.773
<v Speaker 3>But I really underestimated the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>group based emotions that were behind </v>

1186
00:58:19.581 --> 00:58:22.100
<v Speaker 3>this and that's scary.</v>

1187
00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:23.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1188
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:25.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking.</v>

1189
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:28.620
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that was important </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Charlotte,</v>

1190
00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:33.830
<v Speaker 4>I think Charlottesville rather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that we got to see real Nazis,</v>

1191
00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:35.281
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1192
00:58:35.281 --> 00:58:36.420
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're real.</v>

1193
00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:39.060
<v Speaker 4>It's not the fucking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in the Google memo,</v>

1194
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:43.980
<v Speaker 4>it's this asshole with a swastika on his</v>
<v Speaker 4>chest is carry a Tiki torch walking down</v>

1195
00:58:43.981 --> 00:58:45.870
<v Speaker 4>the street with a gun in his pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1196
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:47.063
<v Speaker 4>ranting about the Jews and black people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a real Nazi and that is what you </v>

1197
00:58:53.071 --> 00:58:53.904
<v Speaker 4>were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's extreme people on the right and </v>

1198
00:58:55.801 --> 00:58:58.580
<v Speaker 4>there's extreme people on the left and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they they.</v>

1199
00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:03.590
<v Speaker 4>They don't understand that they are way </v>
<v Speaker 4>more similar than they like to believe.</v>

1200
00:59:03.871 --> 00:59:05.670
<v Speaker 4>If you believe that all white people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>racist,</v>

1201
00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:06.773
<v Speaker 4>if you believe that is an MPO is </v>
<v Speaker 4>impossible for you to be a white person </v>

1202
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.333
<v Speaker 4>and not have some implicit bias and </v>
<v Speaker 4>racism and that it's impossible to be </v>

1203
00:59:15.841 --> 00:59:16.674
<v Speaker 4>racist against white people because </v>
<v Speaker 4>racism is about using power and </v>

1204
00:59:19.981 --> 00:59:22.850
<v Speaker 4>influence and minorities do not have </v>
<v Speaker 4>power and influence,</v>

1205
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 4>so they can be prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they cannot be racist.</v>

1206
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just as bad as the fucking person</v>

1207
00:59:27.261 --> 00:59:29.600
<v Speaker 4>with the Tiki torch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't think you are.</v>

1208
00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:30.853
<v Speaker 4>I know you don't think you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you want because you're just as </v>

1209
00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:35.900
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're so off of what is real.</v>

1210
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:36.913
<v Speaker 4>You're so off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the idea that all black people </v>

1211
00:59:38.961 --> 00:59:39.794
<v Speaker 4>responsible for the woes of society and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that none of it has to do with the fact </v>

1212
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:46.010
<v Speaker 4>that were captured hundreds of years ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>and brought over here as slaves and that</v>

1213
00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:49.160
<v Speaker 4>there there are lesser as human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a disgusting,</v>

1214
00:59:49.161 --> 00:59:52.940
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous proposition and the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that think that way are fools,</v>

1215
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that rightly so,</v>

1216
00:59:54.561 --> 00:59:58.130
<v Speaker 4>most people in the center look at those </v>
<v Speaker 4>as fools.</v>

1217
00:59:59.000 --> 00:59:59.833
<v Speaker 4>I look at the people that think that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't be racist against white people as </v>

1218
01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:04.394
<v Speaker 4>just as foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You dumb fucks are fueling these </v>

1219
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:07.454
<v Speaker 4>assholes like with this dumb way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at things and pushing these </v>

1220
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.670
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous ideas that all white people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are racist.</v>

1221
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to feel bad because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're white.</v>

1222
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.450
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't do anything,</v>

1223
01:00:17.451 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 4>didn't ask to be born white,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't ask to be born male.</v>

1224
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:23.270
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't get mad at people for who</v>

1225
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:25.640
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should.</v>

1226
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:30.670
<v Speaker 4>We should be having an open discussion </v>
<v Speaker 4>about what is wrong,</v>

1227
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:32.540
<v Speaker 4>like what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how,</v>

1228
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:33.374
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1229
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 4>what is going wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is this happening?</v>

1230
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.153
<v Speaker 4>Why are these negative things happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not why don't we have more women or why </v>

1231
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:43.700
<v Speaker 4>don't we have more Indian men are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we.</v>

1232
01:00:43.701 --> 01:00:44.534
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1233
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:47.330
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

1234
01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

1235
01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.050
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The two sides are just scapegoating,</v>

1236
01:00:52.051 --> 01:00:56.880
<v Speaker 3>so it is very similar and not taking any</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal responsibility.</v>

1237
01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.531
<v Speaker 3>At least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1238
01:00:58.531 --> 01:01:00.350
<v Speaker 3>what Jordan Peterson would say is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1239
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.210
<v Speaker 3>fix yourself before trying to fix the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ills of the world.</v>

1240
01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.533
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think there's also an issue </v>

1241
01:01:06.941 --> 01:01:07.774
<v Speaker 4>here is that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to be very careful with my </v>

1242
01:01:10.331 --> 01:01:11.164
<v Speaker 4>words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like this is a game and I </v>

1243
01:01:13.991 --> 01:01:15.730
<v Speaker 4>don't mean it's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's not,</v>

1244
01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.230
<v Speaker 4>it's not a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This app,</v>

1245
01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.220
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely a real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think people play for points and I</v>

1246
01:01:21.221 --> 01:01:22.054
<v Speaker 4>think that there's a real issue when </v>
<v Speaker 4>people do things for Social Brownie </v>

1247
01:01:25.241 --> 01:01:25.990
<v Speaker 4>points,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1248
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.823
<v Speaker 4>Like Google saying that you were fired </v>
<v Speaker 4>for promoting unfair gender stereotypes </v>

1249
01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:36.190
<v Speaker 4>or dangerous or what was the word that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they use?</v>

1250
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:37.450
<v Speaker 4>Harmful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>harmful,</v>

1251
01:01:37.451 --> 01:01:42.130
<v Speaker 4>harmful gender stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a fucking play.</v>

1252
01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:44.950
<v Speaker 4>That's a play for points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

1253
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:45.873
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are the fucking harmful gender </v>

1254
01:01:47.201 --> 01:01:49.180
<v Speaker 4>stereotypes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are they promoted?</v>

1255
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:50.103
<v Speaker 4>You tell me how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't tell me how I want a </v>

1256
01:01:51.431 --> 01:01:52.264
<v Speaker 4>fucking apology because you're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're lying because you want all those </v>

1257
01:01:55.991 --> 01:01:57.340
<v Speaker 4>people on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It calmed down.</v>

1258
01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we fired him.</v>

1259
01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.300
<v Speaker 4>I fired him a month after you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You knew he wrote that Shit.</v>

1260
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.433
<v Speaker 4>Are you guys crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you go over the science before you </v>

1261
01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:05.014
<v Speaker 4>fire them or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1262
01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.460
<v Speaker 4>Like what did you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did you do?</v>

1263
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.543
<v Speaker 4>Like where's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's the harmful gender stereotypes </v>

1264
01:02:09.071 --> 01:02:09.904
<v Speaker 4>you guys talked about?</v>

1265
01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1266
01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:16.240
<v Speaker 3>it sucks too because you really need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>address some of these things if you want</v>

1267
01:02:16.731 --> 01:02:19.140
<v Speaker 3>to address the gender gap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

1268
01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:23.070
<v Speaker 3>that was what page of my thing was all </v>
<v Speaker 3>about was oh,</v>

1269
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:23.904
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if women are more cooperative and they </v>

1270
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:27.773
<v Speaker 3>approach the workplace differently than </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we can change our workplace to be </v>

1271
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:31.463
<v Speaker 3>more approachable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they're not willing to </v>

1272
01:02:32.671 --> 01:02:35.530
<v Speaker 3>acknowledge any of these differences </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>

1273
01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:39.180
<v Speaker 3>they won't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really annoying.</v>

1274
01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.233
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any interpersonal relationships with </v>

1275
01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:43.400
<v Speaker 4>random people can be messy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1276
01:02:43.401 --> 01:02:46.520
<v Speaker 4>you get a group of 30 people together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you force them to work in a building and</v>

1277
01:02:46.521 --> 01:02:48.920
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be messy to where people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are messy.</v>

1278
01:02:48.921 --> 01:02:50.270
<v Speaker 4>We're weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1279
01:02:50.271 --> 01:02:53.570
<v Speaker 4>and if you have more of one group than </v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

1280
01:02:53.571 --> 01:02:55.100
<v Speaker 4>that groves is going to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It alienated.</v>

1281
01:02:55.101 --> 01:02:57.470
<v Speaker 4>So if you have 80 percent men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 percent women,</v>

1282
01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.870
<v Speaker 4>they're going to feel alienated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way around it.</v>

1283
01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:05.380
<v Speaker 4>But the right way of approaching it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>not to distort the facts,</v>

1284
01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.350
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're thought of as </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

1285
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:14.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean Google is essentially a pillar of</v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

1286
01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hey man,</v>

1287
01:03:17.451 --> 01:03:19.940
<v Speaker 4>google it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is the thing that people say</v>

1288
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:22.700
<v Speaker 4>they're one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects of our society today.</v>

1289
01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.253
<v Speaker 4>Having the ability to instant nobody </v>
<v Speaker 4>says go bing that nobody gives a shit </v>

1290
01:03:28.731 --> 01:03:29.660
<v Speaker 4>about being right.</v>

1291
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Google is hugely important.</v>

1292
01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:38.540
<v Speaker 4>So if you are essentially in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the distribution,</v>

1293
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:43.490
<v Speaker 4>have more knowledge than arguably </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything else on earth.</v>

1294
01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:45.710
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's a big statement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think.</v>

1295
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:46.783
<v Speaker 4>I think you might be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might be able to actually say that </v>

1296
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.220
<v Speaker 4>and be empty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty honest.</v>

1297
01:03:52.221 --> 01:03:53.054
<v Speaker 4>I think Google is responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 4>distributing more information than any </v>

1298
01:03:58.071 --> 01:04:01.430
<v Speaker 4>group on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a giant responsibility.</v>

1299
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:05.480
<v Speaker 4>That responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot say that someone is promoting</v>

1300
01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:09.050
<v Speaker 4>harmful gender stereotypes when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely not,</v>

1301
01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:10.580
<v Speaker 4>because I'm going over this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1302
01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm pulling pages out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1303
01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.680
<v Speaker 4>where's the harmful gender stereotypes </v>
<v Speaker 4>other than the word neuroticism.</v>

1304
01:04:15.681 --> 01:04:16.514
<v Speaker 4>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you got fired for the word </v>

1305
01:04:18.171 --> 01:04:19.004
<v Speaker 4>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well why is that word in all of these </v>

1306
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.890
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary psychology texts?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

1307
01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.760
<v Speaker 4>What's going on?</v>

1308
01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:27.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you just google personality </v>

1309
01:04:29.141 --> 01:04:31.000
<v Speaker 3>differences between men and women or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1310
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.000
<v Speaker 3>then that'll be the first five results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

1311
01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:35.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1312
01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:38.060
<v Speaker 4>and obviously these are just some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1313
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:39.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a broad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1314
01:04:39.411 --> 01:04:42.110
<v Speaker 4>there's a broad spectrum of human beings</v>
<v Speaker 4>and both genders,</v>

1315
01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:44.390
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who are you suing them?</v>

1316
01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exploring all legal remedies.</v>

1317
01:04:48.281 --> 01:04:50.020
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have they contacted you and go,</v>

1318
01:04:50.021 --> 01:04:50.854
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1319
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.400
<v Speaker 4>James will have to be so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>James relaxed.</v>

1320
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.850
<v Speaker 4>Let's go to dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's have some falafel.</v>

1321
01:04:59.140 --> 01:04:59.973
<v Speaker 3>I am surprised that they never know when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fired me had me try to sign </v>

1322
01:05:03.131 --> 01:05:05.470
<v Speaker 3>something to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1323
01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:09.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just here's some nondisclosure agreement</v>

1324
01:05:09.161 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Speaker 3>or something and then just pay you off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1325
01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.230
<v Speaker 3>But that was a big fuck up on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

1326
01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.770
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1327
01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 3>I think they feel like they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely.</v>

1328
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:22.390
<v Speaker 5>I feel like the game again is like super</v>
<v Speaker 5>clear.</v>

1329
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.380
<v Speaker 5>Like oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just,</v>

1330
01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.170
<v Speaker 5>we sunk a three pointer in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's no problem.</v>

1331
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:28.360
<v Speaker 5>Like this is pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is pretty straightforward.</v>

1332
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.210
<v Speaker 5>One of the net dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't have to do shit.</v>

1333
01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.250
<v Speaker 5>You have to pay him because he lost the </v>
<v Speaker 5>point,</v>

1334
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.413
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think maybe they underestimated </v>

1335
01:05:36.281 --> 01:05:37.114
<v Speaker 5>how much negative press there would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>about this because a lot of the initial </v>

1336
01:05:40.181 --> 01:05:41.014
<v Speaker 5>stuff was all negative because it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming out of the people that were </v>

1337
01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:47.530
<v Speaker 5>tweeting about it and then they saw </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1338
01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:48.423
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1339
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.760
<v Speaker 5>it's really not this one sided and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1340
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.720
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the things that may happen in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>case as you know,</v>

1341
01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:59.140
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of discovery into what the</v>
<v Speaker 5>internals of Google are happening.</v>

1342
01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:03.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they want that to happen </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you will actually see that,</v>

1343
01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:04.623
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe there was this illegal </v>

1344
01:06:05.621 --> 01:06:06.790
<v Speaker 5>discrimination happening.</v>

1345
01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:10.390
<v Speaker 5>Now what is illegal about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>discrimination that they're employing?</v>

1346
01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:14.230
<v Speaker 5>So I didn't and I'm not a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I can't say,</v>

1347
01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:17.680
<v Speaker 5>but at least according to our own </v>
<v Speaker 5>policies we said,</v>

1348
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:18.963
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's illegal to use someone's protected </v>

1349
01:06:20.921 --> 01:06:21.754
<v Speaker 5>status,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so their sex or gender or sex or race </v>

1350
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:27.130
<v Speaker 5>and employment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>critical situations like,</v>

1351
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they're getting hired,</v>

1352
01:06:28.841 --> 01:06:29.674
<v Speaker 5>when they're trying to be matched to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>manager or to a team and when we're </v>

1353
01:06:34.001 --> 01:06:37.030
<v Speaker 5>choosing who to promote and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it,</v>

1354
01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 5>it is happening in a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>places.</v>

1355
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.160
<v Speaker 5>Protected status.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1356
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:44.860
<v Speaker 5>That's how they refer to it internally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or is that like a common phrase?</v>

1357
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:49.120
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a common phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well protected step.</v>

1358
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:51.700
<v Speaker 5>What's protected about like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1359
01:06:51.701 --> 01:06:52.534
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>discriminate on based on someone's age </v>

1360
01:06:55.541 --> 01:06:58.720
<v Speaker 5>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's mostly,</v>

1361
01:06:58.721 --> 01:07:00.040
<v Speaker 5>it was originally like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

1362
01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:01.750
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't be discriminated against </v>
<v Speaker 5>black people,</v>

1363
01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:04.930
<v Speaker 5>but obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it should apply to everyone.</v>

1364
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:09.990
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So by doing that,</v>

1365
01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.150
<v Speaker 5>they violated their own rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1366
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.033
<v Speaker 5>But they don't think about it that way </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're promoting diversity by </v>

1367
01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:19.564
<v Speaker 5>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yet it's kind of weird how they cited </v>

1368
01:07:22.601 --> 01:07:25.750
<v Speaker 5>some of the same parts of the code of </v>
<v Speaker 5>conduct where.</v>

1369
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.450
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every employee should do their utmost of</v>

1370
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:32.950
<v Speaker 5>reducing bias and harassment and illegal</v>
<v Speaker 5>discrimination.</v>

1371
01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.053
<v Speaker 5>When really my document was about </v>
<v Speaker 5>eliminating the bias against </v>

1372
01:07:37.121 --> 01:07:37.954
<v Speaker 5>conservatives and the harassment against</v>
<v Speaker 5>them and the legal discrimination that </v>

1373
01:07:41.621 --> 01:07:43.600
<v Speaker 5>we're doing in multiple parts of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>pipeline.</v>

1374
01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:47.550
<v Speaker 5>There's no room for conservatives today </v>
<v Speaker 5>or.</v>

1375
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:51.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you conservative?</v>

1376
01:07:51.161 --> 01:07:54.010
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel like you can tell I'm pretty</v>
<v Speaker 5>much just libertarian,</v>

1377
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.680
<v Speaker 5>but that's thought of as conservative </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's convenient.</v>

1378
01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.670
<v Speaker 5>You just immediately pushed off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1379
01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:01.630
<v Speaker 5>That right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>angry white male group.</v>

1380
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:06.390
<v Speaker 5>Everyone that's in the center or right </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that is alright.</v>

1381
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:07.560
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1382
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.920
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You favor of smaller government,</v>

1383
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:14.300
<v Speaker 5>less intrusion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1384
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm not super libertarian.</v>

1385
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Like I obviously believe that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>places where the government should be,</v>

1386
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:21.493
<v Speaker 3>but just my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my like internal leaning or in </v>

1387
01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 3>philosophy is more like the.</v>

1388
01:08:26.650 --> 01:08:27.483
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think socially I lean more left like </v>

1389
01:08:29.441 --> 01:08:33.730
<v Speaker 4>socially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in terms of like welfare and things</v>

1390
01:08:33.731 --> 01:08:34.564
<v Speaker 4>along those lines and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously this protected status is </v>

1391
01:08:38.801 --> 01:08:39.820
<v Speaker 4>driving me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1392
01:08:39.821 --> 01:08:42.020
<v Speaker 4>this thing that trump's doing with um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1393
01:08:42.370 --> 01:08:43.203
<v Speaker 4>children that were born in this country </v>
<v Speaker 4>are born in other countries and then </v>

1394
01:08:45.881 --> 01:08:48.430
<v Speaker 4>brought over here as children and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about deporting them.</v>

1395
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:49.383
<v Speaker 4>That drives me fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hard right version of that is </v>

1396
01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:53.230
<v Speaker 4>despicable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1397
01:08:53.231 --> 01:08:56.320
<v Speaker 4>these people that I see online with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why didn't they apply for citizenship?</v>

1398
01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:57.281
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

1399
01:08:57.281 --> 01:08:59.360
<v Speaker 4>Maybe because they're fucking 13,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1400
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:02.830
<v Speaker 4>like will you out there applying for </v>
<v Speaker 4>citizenship if you were 13?</v>

1401
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:03.903
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when you're 13 years old you're </v>

1402
01:09:04.631 --> 01:09:05.464
<v Speaker 4>playing games and hanging out with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends and then you find out you were </v>

1403
01:09:07.451 --> 01:09:09.040
<v Speaker 4>born in Guatemala and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1404
01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:11.080
<v Speaker 4>Like you have to go back to Guatemala.</v>

1405
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:12.040
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1406
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:13.383
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lean way left when it comes to those </v>

1407
01:09:16.601 --> 01:09:19.690
<v Speaker 4>kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gay Rights and things like,</v>

1408
01:09:19.691 --> 01:09:21.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1409
01:09:21.401 --> 01:09:22.234
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>social programs for disenfranchised </v>

1410
01:09:23.891 --> 01:09:24.724
<v Speaker 4>people and disenfranchised communities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I leaned way like if I want my tax </v>

1411
01:09:27.581 --> 01:09:29.440
<v Speaker 4>dollars to go to anything I wanted to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1412
01:09:29.441 --> 01:09:30.274
<v Speaker 4>making people's lives easier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's socialized medicine or </v>

1413
01:09:33.581 --> 01:09:37.360
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever we could do to make people have</v>

1414
01:09:37.361 --> 01:09:38.194
<v Speaker 4>an easier path to success and to not </v>
<v Speaker 4>have them so burdened down by their </v>

1415
01:09:42.671 --> 01:09:43.504
<v Speaker 4>environment and their circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That I think is like our responsibility </v>

1416
01:09:47.501 --> 01:09:48.334
<v Speaker 4>as human beings to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say even the playing </v>

1417
01:09:50.891 --> 01:09:52.750
<v Speaker 4>field because there's never going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>an even playing field,</v>

1418
01:09:52.751 --> 01:09:55.660
<v Speaker 4>but to give people opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

1419
01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Just give people an opportunity to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1420
01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.010
<v Speaker 4>not have it so completely stacked </v>
<v Speaker 4>against them.</v>

1421
01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:03.820
<v Speaker 4>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not very conservative in that way.</v>

1422
01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:04.683
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm not one of those pull yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>up by your bootstraps that because </v>

1423
01:10:06.641 --> 01:10:08.640
<v Speaker 4>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so delusional.</v>

1424
01:10:08.641 --> 01:10:10.510
<v Speaker 4>Like some people are just fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1425
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:11.250
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1426
01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.083
<v Speaker 4>they're born with a terrible hand and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be nice if more of us were </v>

1427
01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:18.580
<v Speaker 4>charitable in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1428
01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:19.414
<v Speaker 4>And some people think that that charity </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be a personal issue and that we </v>

1429
01:10:22.421 --> 01:10:23.700
<v Speaker 4>should all just do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1430
01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:25.510
<v Speaker 4>as part of our community and our </v>
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>

1431
01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1432
01:10:27.881 --> 01:10:28.714
<v Speaker 4>but maybe the argument is that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>government should be a part of our </v>

1433
01:10:31.451 --> 01:10:32.570
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1434
01:10:32.571 --> 01:10:34.600
<v Speaker 4>and that we should think about it that </v>
<v Speaker 4>way instead of thinking of it as,</v>

1435
01:10:34.601 --> 01:10:35.434
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as this overlord that decides and </v>

1436
01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:38.434
<v Speaker 4>designates where our money should go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that maybe we should have some more say </v>

1437
01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:42.330
<v Speaker 4>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be some sort of a,</v>

1438
01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.980
<v Speaker 4>a more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1439
01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:45.723
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

1440
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.290
<v Speaker 4>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a more,</v>

1441
01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:49.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more kind approach.</v>

1442
01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.660
<v Speaker 4>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I leaned pretty far left,</v>

1443
01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:55.750
<v Speaker 4>but I'm also pretty pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1444
01:10:55.770 --> 01:10:56.603
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I also know that if you give people </v>

1445
01:10:58.121 --> 01:11:01.660
<v Speaker 4>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of that winning lottery ticket</v>

1446
01:11:01.661 --> 01:11:06.010
<v Speaker 4>thing or that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if you,</v>

1447
01:11:06.011 --> 01:11:09.910
<v Speaker 4>if you make things too easy for people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't try hard.</v>

1448
01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.400
<v Speaker 4>It's just a natural part of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>

1449
01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 4>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some conservative</v>

1450
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.450
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1451
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:16.403
<v Speaker 5>you definitely need some sort of safety </v>
<v Speaker 5>net and to ensure that people can </v>

1452
01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 5>actually achieve the American dream.</v>

1453
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:24.620
<v Speaker 4>Well just be healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make our live and bleeding more and more</v>

1454
01:11:24.621 --> 01:11:27.560
<v Speaker 4>towards the universal basic income than </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1455
01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:30.860
<v Speaker 4>I think universal basic income at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain point to elegant enough that you</v>

1456
01:11:30.861 --> 01:11:31.694
<v Speaker 4>can just eat and survive and then maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would open up a lot more people to </v>

1457
01:11:35.781 --> 01:11:38.370
<v Speaker 4>pursuing dreams to going after things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1458
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:40.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's arguments for and against</v>

1459
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:41.803
<v Speaker 5>and I think it's debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will be interesting to see know </v>

1460
01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.253
<v Speaker 5>Finland I think was proposing to start </v>
<v Speaker 5>this because we don't really know what </v>

1461
01:11:49.521 --> 01:11:50.440
<v Speaker 5>will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1462
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:55.250
<v Speaker 5>And maybe people will start doing their </v>
<v Speaker 5>hobbies and really find their passion.</v>

1463
01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.130
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they'll just sit at home and watch</v>
<v Speaker 5>TV and die.</v>

1464
01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:59.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1465
01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.393
<v Speaker 5>it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are the problems that we as a </v>

1466
01:12:02.661 --> 01:12:05.900
<v Speaker 5>society will have to overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1467
01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.120
<v Speaker 5>of course these are just first world </v>
<v Speaker 5>problems,</v>

1468
01:12:08.121 --> 01:12:10.910
<v Speaker 5>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that will be what the world is like.</v>

1469
01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:15.910
<v Speaker 5>There was another country today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read about it on Google a,</v>

1470
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:19.460
<v Speaker 5>another country today that's considering</v>
<v Speaker 5>universal basic income.</v>

1471
01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:23.660
<v Speaker 5>Fucking was it South Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

1472
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:26.003
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1473
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:29.780
<v Speaker 5>see if he could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's in Scotland.</v>

1474
01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:30.723
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it was?</v>

1475
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:32.683
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1476
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.440
<v Speaker 4>I think there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many people that are.</v>

1477
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:38.333
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Elon Musk has been promoting this </v>

1478
01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.373
<v Speaker 4>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scotland will begin funding universal </v>

1479
01:12:41.731 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 4>basic income experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1480
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.700
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it was.</v>

1481
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.840
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii considers universal basic income </v>
<v Speaker 4>as robot scene,</v>

1482
01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:49.674
<v Speaker 4>stealing jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking robots running around the </v>

1483
01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:51.750
<v Speaker 4>streets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stealing jobs.</v>

1484
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Hawaii</v>

1485
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:57.070
<v Speaker 5>I think are,</v>

1486
01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.070
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1487
01:12:58.070 --> 01:13:00.290
<v Speaker 4>some real arguments to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

1488
01:13:00.291 --> 01:13:01.124
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Elon musk who is of course a part of </v>

1489
01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.970
<v Speaker 4>this automated a car revolution and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1490
01:13:07.971 --> 01:13:09.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's creating these,</v>

1491
01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:10.603
<v Speaker 4>these trucks that they're gonna start </v>
<v Speaker 4>using to haul things and they're going </v>

1492
01:13:14.581 --> 01:13:15.414
<v Speaker 4>to be automated and it's going to remove</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of jobs and they're starting to </v>

1493
01:13:18.291 --> 01:13:20.390
<v Speaker 4>talk about universal basic income as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1494
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.640
<v Speaker 4>a real solution to that mean</v>

1495
01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.590
<v Speaker 5>it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly an argument,</v>

1496
01:13:26.650 --> 01:13:29.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's certainly worth discussing yet,</v>

1497
01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:30.933
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And hopefully the incentives will be </v>

1498
01:13:32.771 --> 01:13:36.550
<v Speaker 5>better than some of the current welfare </v>
<v Speaker 5>systems where you know,</v>

1499
01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.620
<v Speaker 5>you're not incentivized to get off of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1500
01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:39.573
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you start working then you'll lose </v>

1501
01:13:40.601 --> 01:13:41.434
<v Speaker 5>all of it while universal basic income </v>
<v Speaker 5>can be made such that you start working </v>

1502
01:13:46.061 --> 01:13:46.894
<v Speaker 5>and then you'll lose a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's never an actual incentive to </v>

1503
01:13:50.111 --> 01:13:52.210
<v Speaker 5>not work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1504
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.890
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not an incentive to not work,</v>

1505
01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:54.993
<v Speaker 5>but it's an,</v>

1506
01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:59.170
<v Speaker 4>it gives you food and shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1507
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:02.280
<v Speaker 4>So then you could go pursue a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think it would be wonderful.</v>

1508
01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:02.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1509
01:14:02.761 --> 01:14:06.390
<v Speaker 4>if there's anything that our tax dollars</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be going towards,</v>

1510
01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:07.523
<v Speaker 4>it's creating less losers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less people who feel disenfranchised by </v>

1511
01:14:10.951 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 4>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You</v>

1512
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:12.670
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1513
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:13.503
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can pay x amount of tax dollars </v>

1514
01:14:16.061 --> 01:14:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but live in an exponentially more safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and friendly and happy environment.</v>

1515
01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I think most people would be leaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards that.</v>

1516
01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:23.993
<v Speaker 1>I think it would</v>

1517
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:25.410
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1518
01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:26.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll see this.</v>

1519
01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:27.940
<v Speaker 3>We see us too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1520
01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:32.680
<v Speaker 3>people that start companies where as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge risk to start a company,</v>

1521
01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:36.700
<v Speaker 3>most people fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most entrepreneurs in silicon valley</v>

1522
01:14:36.701 --> 01:14:41.440
<v Speaker 3>are men who are much more willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take risks,</v>

1523
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:42.423
<v Speaker 3>but if we do have some sort of strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>safety net then it won't be so bad if </v>

1524
01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:47.524
<v Speaker 3>you fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that'll help address some of </v>

1525
01:14:49.871 --> 01:14:50.710
<v Speaker 3>the gender gap too.</v>

1526
01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:52.840
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1527
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:55.463
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want women to succeed in these </v>

1528
01:14:58.501 --> 01:15:03.501
<v Speaker 1>positions so badly that like a woman ceo</v>
<v Speaker 1>can become like a superstar.</v>

1529
01:15:06.121 --> 01:15:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Like that lady from that blood testing </v>
<v Speaker 1>company that turned out to be bullshit.</v>

1530
01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Was that Thanos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the name of it?</v>

1531
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:13.261
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1532
01:15:13.261 --> 01:15:15.630
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a fascinating case.</v>

1533
01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:16.613
<v Speaker 1>This woman essentially was role playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a female steve jobs with a bullshit </v>

1534
01:15:21.901 --> 01:15:26.901
<v Speaker 1>product that didn't really do what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was advertised to do and her company was</v>

1535
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:28.433
<v Speaker 1>valued at something like 30 something </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars and she was thought to </v>

1536
01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.560
<v Speaker 1>be the richest self made woman in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1537
01:15:34.561 --> 01:15:35.394
<v Speaker 1>And then almost overnight she's worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing because they found out it </v>

1538
01:15:38.941 --> 01:15:41.610
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the company sort of fell apart.</v>

1539
01:15:41.611 --> 01:15:44.820
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How Elizabeth Holmes House of cards game</v>

1540
01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:45.773
<v Speaker 1>came tumbling town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a fascinating story because this </v>

1541
01:15:48.241 --> 01:15:49.074
<v Speaker 1>woman look at her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dressed the part put on a </v>

1542
01:15:51.271 --> 01:15:52.380
<v Speaker 1>fucking black turtleneck.</v>

1543
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she dressed like Steve Jobs.</v>

1544
01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1545
01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:56.003
<v Speaker 1>she gave this speech once at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman's for women's success group for </v>

1546
01:16:00.571 --> 01:16:02.330
<v Speaker 1>something or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1547
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:06.990
<v Speaker 1>she got up there and in this like </v>
<v Speaker 1>unprepared rambling,</v>

1548
01:16:06.991 --> 01:16:11.490
<v Speaker 1>stupid speech and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is this woman this super genius?</v>

1549
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out she wasn't,</v>

1550
01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:13.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she dropped out of college at Nineteen </v>

1551
01:16:14.851 --> 01:16:16.470
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and created this company.</v>

1552
01:16:16.650 --> 01:16:19.050
<v Speaker 1>She started this when she was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>

1553
01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:20.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>

1554
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.980
<v Speaker 1>she basically just fit what people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for,</v>

1555
01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:23.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1556
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:28.900
<v Speaker 1>and bullshitted away to billions almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1557
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:30.150
<v Speaker 1>to kind of crazy.</v>

1558
01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:32.293
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are very willing to see </v>

1559
01:16:34.331 --> 01:16:36.490
<v Speaker 3>that whatever narrative they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1560
01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:37.883
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we see this all the time in the </v>

1561
01:16:38.921 --> 01:16:39.754
<v Speaker 3>media too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they just fit the data however </v>

1562
01:16:42.881 --> 01:16:43.520
<v Speaker 3>they want.</v>

1563
01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.353
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is why they wanted to call you a </v>

1564
01:16:45.171 --> 01:16:46.440
<v Speaker 1>misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1565
01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:47.930
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first read that,</v>

1566
01:16:47.931 --> 01:16:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1567
01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

1568
01:16:50.601 --> 01:16:54.380
<v Speaker 1>this is a hot take by this lady who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1569
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:55.223
<v Speaker 1>The article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she wrote one of them was a let </v>

1570
01:16:57.501 --> 01:17:01.220
<v Speaker 1>me lady explain what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in tech.</v>

1571
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Did you read that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw.</v>

1572
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:04.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many.</v>

1573
01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of it,</v>

1574
01:17:06.741 --> 01:17:07.940
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of it.</v>

1575
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:09.950
<v Speaker 1>So where are you right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1576
01:17:09.951 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 1>do</v>

1577
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.510
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you obviously,</v>

1578
01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:15.020
<v Speaker 4>did they give you some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pension or something like that?</v>

1579
01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:16.430
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have any money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just fire you</v>

1580
01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.553
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1581
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.433
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been cheap throughout the years </v>

1582
01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:20.750
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he saved up some cash.</v>

1583
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:23.960
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still trying to figure out what's next.</v>

1584
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.823
<v Speaker 3>Have you got any job offers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten random job offers from </v>

1585
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:31.630
<v Speaker 3>people but I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1586
01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:36.380
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell how serious they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you thought about writing a book yet.</v>

1587
01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:40.370
<v Speaker 3>I have not seen much of a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you wrote that memo pretty well?</v>

1588
01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm famous for what I wrote,</v>

1589
01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:45.530
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1590
01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:46.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had been studying how to write and </v>

1591
01:17:48.471 --> 01:17:50.690
<v Speaker 3>stuff my entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have been an engineer,</v>

1592
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.000
<v Speaker 3>but we did a great job with it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1593
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:57.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was very thorough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to think so.</v>

1594
01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:58.400
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1595
01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:03.020
<v Speaker 3>it addressed a lot of things and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunate that there was that one part</v>

1596
01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:03.913
<v Speaker 3>that is getting so much attention when </v>
<v Speaker 3>really it pointed out a lot of problems </v>

1597
01:18:07.941 --> 01:18:08.774
<v Speaker 3>in our culture and a lot of suggestions </v>
<v Speaker 3>for how to fix things and it seems like </v>

1598
01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:15.650
<v Speaker 3>none of that is really gaining traction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1599
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:18.650
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it least,</v>

1600
01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.230
<v Speaker 3>it started the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1601
01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.170
<v Speaker 3>Not at least for you because you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>fired.</v>

1602
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:26.423
<v Speaker 3>I mean in some ways though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has made it even more dangerous to </v>

1603
01:18:29.511 --> 01:18:31.040
<v Speaker 3>bring these up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least,</v>

1604
01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:35.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of empowered some people to at</v>

1605
01:18:35.601 --> 01:18:36.434
<v Speaker 3>least understand some of the issues and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully these things will get brought </v>

1606
01:18:40.881 --> 01:18:43.430
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But right now it's sort of a toxic,</v>

1607
01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.640
<v Speaker 3>a tough topic to bring up at Google at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least.</v>

1608
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that it's toxic in,</v>

1609
01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:50.013
<v Speaker 4>in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the long term it'll inspire a </v>

1610
01:18:54.161 --> 01:18:54.994
<v Speaker 4>more reasoned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>balanced conversation once the dust has </v>

1611
01:18:57.221 --> 01:18:58.054
<v Speaker 4>settled,</v>

1612
01:18:58.150 --> 01:18:59.350
<v Speaker 3>hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1613
01:18:59.351 --> 01:19:04.351
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of one of the hopes with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lawsuit is to show people that no,</v>

1614
01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.373
<v Speaker 3>Google can't just do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are limits to how much they </v>

1615
01:19:07.361 --> 01:19:09.070
<v Speaker 3>can silence things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:13.570
<v Speaker 3>And you shouldn't be afraid to point out</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues in the workplace.</v>

1617
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:15.103
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you just said with the lawsuit like </v>

1618
01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:21.751
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1619
01:19:21.821 --> 01:19:22.654
<v Speaker 3>I believe we filed a claim with the nlrb</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the national labor relations </v>

1620
01:19:25.991 --> 01:19:27.040
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1621
01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.850
<v Speaker 3>and so they usually work with unions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1622
01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:31.733
<v Speaker 3>it's often employers that try to break </v>
<v Speaker 3>up unions and fire people for joining </v>

1623
01:19:35.111 --> 01:19:38.290
<v Speaker 3>unions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's illegal and you know,</v>

1624
01:19:38.291 --> 01:19:39.124
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was doing was a conservative </v>

1625
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:44.560
<v Speaker 3>effort between multiple people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1626
01:19:44.561 --> 01:19:45.394
<v Speaker 3>trying to improve the workplace and </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually know whistle blow on some of </v>

1627
01:19:50.891 --> 01:19:52.330
<v Speaker 3>the illegal practices.</v>

1628
01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.233
<v Speaker 4>Did you save emails where people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>shaming people for being white or </v>

1629
01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:57.434
<v Speaker 4>shaming people for having implicit bias </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there were white or harassing </v>

1630
01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:01.970
<v Speaker 4>people for</v>

1631
01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.870
<v Speaker 3>yet a lot of people have been doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1632
01:20:04.871 --> 01:20:05.704
<v Speaker 3>like there's some efforts within google </v>
<v Speaker 3>to at least document some of this </v>

1633
01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:15.150
<v Speaker 3>because while they may not be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>majority,</v>

1634
01:20:15.151 --> 01:20:18.240
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're sort of a silent,</v>

1635
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:22.260
<v Speaker 3>a coalition within Google that's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>upset about a lot of this.</v>

1636
01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:23.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1637
01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:27.060
<v Speaker 1>So there are some conservative people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that work at Google.</v>

1638
01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:28.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's definitely more than </v>

1639
01:20:29.851 --> 01:20:31.410
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than zero.</v>

1640
01:20:31.690 --> 01:20:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it like 20 percent,</v>

1641
01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:33.894
<v Speaker 1>like the amount that are represented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like women that are representing the </v>

1642
01:20:36.301 --> 01:20:37.134
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

1643
01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.570
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1644
01:20:38.890 --> 01:20:42.740
<v Speaker 3>it may be that or even lower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of libertarians.</v>

1645
01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:46.940
<v Speaker 3>So that would be the main counter to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme left.</v>

1646
01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.910
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then like,</v>

1647
01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:50.744
<v Speaker 3>so like what the main retributions </v>
<v Speaker 3>against people are the social </v>

1648
01:20:54.291 --> 01:20:58.310
<v Speaker 3>conservatives and they feel completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>alienated.</v>

1649
01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:04.420
<v Speaker 3>So it's really unfortunate for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1650
01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:08.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's at least hundreds of them</v>

1651
01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:11.320
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say like social conservatives,</v>

1652
01:21:11.321 --> 01:21:12.970
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

1653
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.290
<v Speaker 1>how do you classify that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what would,</v>

1654
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:21.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess people that believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional values and</v>

1655
01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:26.980
<v Speaker 1>homophobes say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is</v>

1656
01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:32.520
<v Speaker 3>a lot of what's happening too on where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people just assume,</v>

1657
01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:33.354
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you believe say in traditional </v>

1658
01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:40.170
<v Speaker 3>values and you think that your marriage </v>
<v Speaker 3>is an important thing and you know,</v>

1659
01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.430
<v Speaker 3>I think that there is evidence that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1660
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.460
<v Speaker 3>bringing out people in a two parent </v>
<v Speaker 3>household whether or not it's,</v>

1661
01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:48.693
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same sex or different sex that is </v>

1662
01:21:50.611 --> 01:21:51.444
<v Speaker 3>important for children and there there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a huge disparity and outcome of people </v>

1663
01:21:54.871 --> 01:21:55.704
<v Speaker 3>with only one parent versus two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is something to be said about </v>

1664
01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:04.490
<v Speaker 3>marriage and having cultural norms that </v>
<v Speaker 3>support that,</v>

1665
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:06.143
<v Speaker 3>but so you're just completely alienating</v>
<v Speaker 3>that side of the argument is really </v>

1666
01:22:12.121 --> 01:22:14.850
<v Speaker 3>negative and that's hurt our society in </v>
<v Speaker 3>general,</v>

1667
01:22:14.851 --> 01:22:15.610
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1668
01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:16.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think anytime you silence </v>

1669
01:22:19.341 --> 01:22:20.174
<v Speaker 1>discussion based on your own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas of what should and shouldn't be </v>

1670
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:29.860
<v Speaker 1>debated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think becomes an issue.</v>

1671
01:22:29.861 --> 01:22:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can disagree with someone and that's</v>

1672
01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:38.490
<v Speaker 1>a very complicated issue when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to whether or not to parents or,</v>

1673
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:39.703
<v Speaker 1>or more beneficial to a child than one </v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously there's a lot of </v>

1674
01:22:43.631 --> 01:22:45.730
<v Speaker 1>reasons why people break up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1675
01:22:45.731 --> 01:22:48.820
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to encourage people to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in toxic relationships and then show the</v>

1676
01:22:48.821 --> 01:22:50.680
<v Speaker 1>child that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1677
01:22:50.681 --> 01:22:53.110
<v Speaker 1>this is a framework for a loving </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

1678
01:22:53.111 --> 01:22:53.944
<v Speaker 1>People that scream at each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever horrible shit they do to each </v>

1679
01:22:55.871 --> 01:22:58.060
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets super complicated and very,</v>

1680
01:22:58.061 --> 01:22:58.900
<v Speaker 1>very personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1681
01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1682
01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:02.990
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a touchy subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very personal one.</v>

1683
01:23:03.230 --> 01:23:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1684
01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:09.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to address that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's at least something that</v>

1685
01:23:10.121 --> 01:23:12.430
<v Speaker 3>we should be cognizant of.</v>

1686
01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.453
<v Speaker 1>Has Anybody said when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these white people are being shamed in </v>

1687
01:23:16.341 --> 01:23:17.100
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1688
01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:18.530
<v Speaker 1>as anybody ever stepped up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1689
01:23:18.531 --> 01:23:19.610
<v Speaker 1>this is racist.</v>

1690
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:24.380
<v Speaker 3>They might've but never in a public </v>
<v Speaker 3>forum that I ever.</v>

1691
01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:27.720
<v Speaker 1>But publicly white people have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized.</v>

1692
01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1693
01:23:30.030 --> 01:23:34.970
<v Speaker 3>there's all these negative stereotypes </v>
<v Speaker 3>of men and white people and you know,</v>

1694
01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:37.720
<v Speaker 3>those gender stereotypes are fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1695
01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:40.650
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole idea that,</v>

1696
01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:42.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm only here because of my white male </v>

1697
01:23:43.621 --> 01:23:44.454
<v Speaker 3>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore I'm somehow worst programmer </v>

1698
01:23:46.711 --> 01:23:51.240
<v Speaker 3>than all the other non white non males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that implied or is that stated?</v>

1699
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:52.833
<v Speaker 3>I think it's implied that they get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>easier in life and in the interview </v>

1700
01:23:57.121 --> 01:23:59.940
<v Speaker 3>process and evaluations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1701
01:23:59.941 --> 01:24:02.780
<v Speaker 3>white and Asian males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how's it implied though?</v>

1702
01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:03.693
<v Speaker 3>Can you give me an example?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll say explicitly that just </v>

1703
01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:08.310
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1704
01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.830
<v Speaker 3>these groups of people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>disadvantaged,</v>

1705
01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:11.813
<v Speaker 3>these are advantaged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this privilege that they have </v>

1706
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:15.383
<v Speaker 3>and we've seen it time and again through</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these evaluation processes that </v>

1707
01:24:18.661 --> 01:24:23.480
<v Speaker 3>they're better evaluated and these are </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse and yeah,</v>

1708
01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:24.323
<v Speaker 3>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they often just see whatever data that </v>

1709
01:24:26.731 --> 01:24:27.940
<v Speaker 3>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1710
01:24:27.941 --> 01:24:28.774
<v Speaker 3>like the case before where they just </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out the female side without </v>

1711
01:24:33.121 --> 01:24:33.954
<v Speaker 3>seeing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh the male side was pretty much the </v>

1712
01:24:34.771 --> 01:24:38.530
<v Speaker 3>same [inaudible] and it's crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1713
01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:40.980
<v Speaker 3>you even see it in some of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>internal studies where,</v>

1714
01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:41.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to show how racist or </v>

1715
01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:48.100
<v Speaker 3>sexist Google was and how worse women </v>
<v Speaker 3>habits.</v>

1716
01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:50.880
<v Speaker 3>So they were looking at the code review </v>
<v Speaker 3>process where you know,</v>

1717
01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:55.290
<v Speaker 3>you can submit code to be reviewed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then someone has to approve it before it</v>

1718
01:24:55.291 --> 01:24:57.930
<v Speaker 3>goes into the code base and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>

1719
01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.330
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a woman's the author of it,</v>

1720
01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:04.120
<v Speaker 3>how many comments do they get on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>review and you know,</v>

1721
01:25:04.130 --> 01:25:04.963
<v Speaker 3>if they got more comments then that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would mean that their work is more </v>

1722
01:25:07.951 --> 01:25:11.070
<v Speaker 3>scrutinized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they got fewer comments then they</v>

1723
01:25:11.071 --> 01:25:14.640
<v Speaker 3>were just ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's no way out of it,</v>

1724
01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:15.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any result which show that women are </v>

1725
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:22.050
<v Speaker 3>being discriminated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discriminated against somehow.</v>

1726
01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1727
01:25:25.221 --> 01:25:30.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I don't work where you worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You happy to be free of that at all?</v>

1728
01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I missed the free food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good food there.</v>

1729
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the food a lot.</v>

1730
01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who is a big executive </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there,</v>

1731
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:41.810
<v Speaker 1>a woman by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

1732
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1733
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:45.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1734
01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:48.020
<v Speaker 1>she enjoyed it but she said it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mess like in.</v>

1735
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:49.723
<v Speaker 1>She didn't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously have the same issues that you </v>

1736
01:25:52.311 --> 01:25:54.230
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was like that.</v>

1737
01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:59.150
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is just chaos yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid shit going on over there.</v>

1738
01:25:59.151 --> 01:25:59.984
<v Speaker 1>She hated it.</v>

1739
01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I went in a little bit in this,</v>

1740
01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:09.041
<v Speaker 3>in the document to where if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>company that's to progressively run,</v>

1741
01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:12.500
<v Speaker 3>then it'll be sort of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1742
01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:13.334
<v Speaker 3>everyone's equal and no hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all chaos and are constantly changing </v>

1743
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.821
<v Speaker 3>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1744
01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:23.420
<v Speaker 3>the opposite of a really conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>company where there's a lot of hierarchy</v>

1745
01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:27.380
<v Speaker 3>decisions are made from the top with </v>
<v Speaker 3>which may not be,</v>

1746
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very easy to change things.</v>

1747
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:31.423
<v Speaker 3>So like iron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google is definitely more of the former </v>

1748
01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:36.373
<v Speaker 3>where there is a lot of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's multiple teams working on the </v>

1749
01:26:38.781 --> 01:26:43.781
<v Speaker 3>same thing and it's just this is how we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have multiple products that end up doing</v>

1750
01:26:44.541 --> 01:26:47.750
<v Speaker 3>the same thing and we have to deprecate </v>
<v Speaker 3>some bright like we have.</v>

1751
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:50.930
<v Speaker 3>That's very inefficient for different </v>
<v Speaker 3>chat apps.</v>

1752
01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Well Google is</v>

1753
01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.100
<v Speaker 1>as in the technology realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not,</v>

1754
01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:57.800
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a lot of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really interesting.</v>

1755
01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.680
<v Speaker 1>But then they do in certain ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1756
01:27:00.710 --> 01:27:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Like they do in the phone way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they put out the Pixel,</v>

1757
01:27:03.621 --> 01:27:05.600
<v Speaker 1>which I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of a fucked up phone.</v>

1758
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like the,</v>

1759
01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:10.430
<v Speaker 1>the microphone doesn't work all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1760
01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like could you have to let go to </v>

1761
01:27:12.471 --> 01:27:14.270
<v Speaker 1>speakerphone and then bring it back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>microphone?</v>

1762
01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Just a bunch of bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So quite a few issues with it.</v>

1763
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the android operating </v>
<v Speaker 1>system which a lot of people prefer.</v>

1764
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So I think they're like pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive in that round.</v>

1765
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:26.450
<v Speaker 1>But like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to like search engine,</v>

1766
01:27:26.451 --> 01:27:31.030
<v Speaker 1>so they don't really have competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets real sneaky because</v>

1767
01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.320
<v Speaker 1>a lot of power in that search search </v>
<v Speaker 1>engine.</v>

1768
01:27:33.650 --> 01:27:35.160
<v Speaker 1>And then in Gmail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1769
01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:35.870
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh.</v>

1770
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what competition they have in Gmail as a</v>

1771
01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:42.800
<v Speaker 1>fuck about hotmail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started using</v>

1772
01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:43.683
<v Speaker 3>Yahoo Mail because people were really </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspicious that google would eventually </v>

1773
01:27:48.191 --> 01:27:51.370
<v Speaker 3>read my email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1774
01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:54.460
<v Speaker 3>Do you really worry about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they would spy on your email?</v>

1775
01:27:54.850 --> 01:27:56.920
<v Speaker 3>There were some weird things happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>to my phone,</v>

1776
01:27:56.921 --> 01:28:00.100
<v Speaker 3>so I had like one attached to it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1777
01:28:00.190 --> 01:28:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my Corp,</v>

1778
01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:04.630
<v Speaker 3>so Corp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my work phone and basically.</v>

1779
01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.593
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it started like rebooting and after </v>

1780
01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:14.010
<v Speaker 3>this whole controversy given android.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1781
01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:15.123
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this had never happened before and </v>

1782
01:28:16.811 --> 01:28:21.550
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't happened and didn't like all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these random apps started updating.</v>

1783
01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:23.560
<v Speaker 3>It was Kinda scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

1784
01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.140
<v Speaker 3>So do you think they start spying on </v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

1785
01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.393
<v Speaker 3>It's your way to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there's a way to find </v>

1786
01:28:29.531 --> 01:28:30.470
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

1787
01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd put my phone aside and bring it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>light the top technologist and go,</v>

1788
01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.273
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to go over this because </v>

1789
01:28:37.841 --> 01:28:40.360
<v Speaker 1>that'll be giant dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you found they were spying on you,</v>

1790
01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:43.390
<v Speaker 1>is there anything in your contract that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows them to spy on you?</v>

1791
01:28:43.391 --> 01:28:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1792
01:28:44.210 --> 01:28:46.150
<v Speaker 3>there's some random things where they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1793
01:28:46.151 --> 01:28:49.090
<v Speaker 3>they can basically just spy on you </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely.</v>

1794
01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how,</v>

1795
01:28:50.761 --> 01:28:51.594
<v Speaker 3>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all of your keystrokes or sort of </v>

1796
01:28:53.831 --> 01:28:58.780
<v Speaker 3>logged in at work or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the work computer.</v>

1797
01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:00.153
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily your personal laptop or </v>

1798
01:29:01.261 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1799
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:06.030
<v Speaker 3>What about your phone yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know exactly what they do,</v>

1800
01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:06.864
<v Speaker 3>but the corporate phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my Google Dot com account attached to </v>

1801
01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:12.060
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1802
01:29:12.061 --> 01:29:14.370
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't your personal phone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1803
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:15.750
<v Speaker 3>I bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then.</v>

1804
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

1805
01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:19.213
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they reserved the right to like </v>

1806
01:29:20.191 --> 01:29:23.660
<v Speaker 3>completely new kit and what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1807
01:29:24.090 --> 01:29:26.310
<v Speaker 4>served right to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to nuke your personal phone.</v>

1808
01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:27.413
<v Speaker 4>Now this corporate phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you allowed to use it for like say </v>

1809
01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 4>if you go on a date or you want to buy a</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie ticket or.</v>

1810
01:29:31.921 --> 01:29:32.754
<v Speaker 4>So you're allowed to use that.</v>

1811
01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:33.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's a weird marriage of two </v>

1812
01:29:35.721 --> 01:29:36.554
<v Speaker 3>worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1813
01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1814
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:40.400
<v Speaker 3>some people would own two phones because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>

1815
01:29:40.401 --> 01:29:42.140
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1816
01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:43.063
<v Speaker 3>I'm a cheap person again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have google pay for </v>

1817
01:29:46.521 --> 01:29:47.354
<v Speaker 3>extra stuff and I mean I can understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>why they would want that because </v>

1818
01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:52.333
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1819
01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:57.400
<v Speaker 3>I was traveling to China for some of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>work and supposedly if they see that you</v>

1820
01:29:58.221 --> 01:29:59.054
<v Speaker 3>work for Google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll just steal your laptop or your </v>

1821
01:30:00.951 --> 01:30:03.410
<v Speaker 3>phone or they won't even explicitly </v>
<v Speaker 3>steal it.</v>

1822
01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:04.483
<v Speaker 3>They'll go into your room and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>install some software on it and then </v>

1823
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:09.403
<v Speaker 3>just put it there and then the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 3>government will somehow get into </v>

1824
01:30:12.981 --> 01:30:14.660
<v Speaker 3>Google's networks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1825
01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:17.990
<v Speaker 3>So I mean they're rightfully paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 3>about somethings,</v>

1826
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:23.350
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes it's you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give one entity too much power.</v>

1827
01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:27.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend who worked for Google was very</v>

1828
01:30:27.101 --> 01:30:27.934
<v Speaker 4>upset at this whole China thing because </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially she was saying they have to </v>

1829
01:30:31.271 --> 01:30:35.350
<v Speaker 4>agree to censorship the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 4>censorship and that the only alternative</v>

1830
01:30:35.351 --> 01:30:36.184
<v Speaker 4>is to let China steel all of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>Google's doing and make a fake google </v>

1831
01:30:41.290 --> 01:30:42.670
<v Speaker 4>because that's what they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently.</v>

1832
01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:43.693
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To make sure that they didn't allow </v>

1833
01:30:45.431 --> 01:30:46.264
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then to do that they had to have </v>

1834
01:30:47.801 --> 01:30:48.634
<v Speaker 4>certain things like tenement square,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't search for that and it's </v>

1835
01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.473
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of weird shit that they would</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to sensor any dissented the </v>

1836
01:30:55.391 --> 01:31:00.160
<v Speaker 4>government and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets very slippery.</v>

1837
01:31:00.161 --> 01:31:01.350
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like yeah,</v>

1838
01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:03.970
<v Speaker 4>you're anti diverse or you're pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>diversity,</v>

1839
01:31:03.971 --> 01:31:07.900
<v Speaker 4>but you're also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're supporting that like as a company</v>

1840
01:31:09.370 --> 01:31:10.203
<v Speaker 4>that's a giant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like to allow China to censor it </v>

1841
01:31:14.611 --> 01:31:15.670
<v Speaker 4>citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're,</v>

1842
01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:19.540
<v Speaker 4>you're essentially promoting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dictatorship in that regard.</v>

1843
01:31:19.710 --> 01:31:22.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of a lose lose.</v>

1844
01:31:22.531 --> 01:31:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what exactly they should do</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just did it for business.</v>

1845
01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:29.850
<v Speaker 3>I think I just made a business choice </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so fucking scary choice to.</v>

1846
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I mean they.</v>

1847
01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:35.250
<v Speaker 3>They were in China and they supported </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of this stuff,</v>

1848
01:31:35.251 --> 01:31:38.160
<v Speaker 3>but then they eventually chose not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they backed out of it.</v>

1849
01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Is that recent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a,</v>

1850
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before my time at Google at nationally,</v>

1851
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:46.920
<v Speaker 3>so they decided to get out so they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not involved with China anymore.</v>

1852
01:31:47.190 --> 01:31:50.400
<v Speaker 3>It's blocked by the firewall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>China block,</v>

1853
01:31:50.401 --> 01:31:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Google and all of Google services.</v>

1854
01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.110
<v Speaker 4>Don't they have some weird thing you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>get around that though,</v>

1855
01:31:56.111 --> 01:31:58.480
<v Speaker 4>but that's super illegal if you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>around that,</v>

1856
01:31:58.481 --> 01:31:59.950
<v Speaker 4>you get in really big trouble.</v>

1857
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:00.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although their official policy is that </v>

1858
01:32:02.410 --> 01:32:06.190
<v Speaker 3>there is no firewall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know if they have any laws to</v>

1859
01:32:06.191 --> 01:32:10.660
<v Speaker 3>actually imagine that fucking building </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1860
01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:12.320
<v Speaker 3>They figured out how to do that to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>

1861
01:32:12.450 --> 01:32:15.760
<v Speaker 3>although I think China is not the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>case where this is happening.</v>

1862
01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:20.080
<v Speaker 3>There's other countries where Google </v>
<v Speaker 3>also has the sensor.</v>

1863
01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:21.161
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1864
01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:21.994
<v Speaker 3>like in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some company or some countries </v>

1865
01:32:25.301 --> 01:32:29.170
<v Speaker 3>that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets really complicated.</v>

1866
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine.</v>

1867
01:32:31.531 --> 01:32:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't envy them,</v>

1868
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:34.183
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't envy any of the people that </v>

1869
01:32:35.821 --> 01:32:39.930
<v Speaker 1>work there and management that are sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of responsible for putting out,</v>

1870
01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:41.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an infinite number of forest fires all </v>

1871
01:32:43.231 --> 01:32:46.380
<v Speaker 1>around them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social Economic,</v>

1872
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:50.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with different cultures.</v>

1873
01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:51.733
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like it'd be an easy </v>

1874
01:32:52.501 --> 01:32:53.334
<v Speaker 1>gig.</v>

1875
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1876
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:57.510
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways they have now too is you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1877
01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:02.150
<v Speaker 3>even though they have a large market </v>
<v Speaker 3>share for a search,</v>

1878
01:33:02.630 --> 01:33:03.463
<v Speaker 3>they see search as sort of a gateway to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and they don't necessarily </v>

1879
01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:09.350
<v Speaker 3>have a huge market share for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

1880
01:33:09.351 --> 01:33:14.351
<v Speaker 3>facebook and twitter are also ways to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to the world's information and a lot</v>

1881
01:33:15.951 --> 01:33:16.784
<v Speaker 3>of facebook just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a walled garden where Google </v>

1882
01:33:19.521 --> 01:33:22.160
<v Speaker 3>can't really get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some people just.</v>

1883
01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:23.173
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your phone you spend most of your </v>

1884
01:33:24.441 --> 01:33:25.274
<v Speaker 3>time on facebook or something and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily just doing random google </v>

1885
01:33:28.911 --> 01:33:29.744
<v Speaker 3>searches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1886
01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got off of that.</v>

1887
01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't really go on facebook for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>very reason.</v>

1888
01:33:35.251 --> 01:33:39.510
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be to be the biggest sucker </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that we have.</v>

1889
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like twitter to me is like,</v>

1890
01:33:42.061 --> 01:33:45.870
<v Speaker 1>it's limited by 140 characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems pretty straightforward.</v>

1891
01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I get links.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1892
01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stories get sent to me that for my needs</v>

1893
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:53.220
<v Speaker 1>that's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more appealing.</v>

1894
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And then instagram is very appealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I like images so you can look at</v>

1895
01:33:56.581 --> 01:33:57.414
<v Speaker 1>pictures and sometimes people write cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>captions and you find out about </v>

1896
01:34:00.031 --> 01:34:02.450
<v Speaker 1>interesting shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But facebook is like,</v>

1897
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:03.420
<v Speaker 1>whew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1898
01:34:03.421 --> 01:34:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna lose a lot of time on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

1899
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is a random tangent.</v>

1900
01:34:10.561 --> 01:34:15.561
<v Speaker 3>But I knew so I worked on image search </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they also see that even though there</v>

1901
01:34:17.191 --> 01:34:18.960
<v Speaker 3>isn't a huge competitor for image </v>
<v Speaker 3>search,</v>

1902
01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:23.910
<v Speaker 3>there's instagram and pinterest which </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very similar things and you know,</v>

1903
01:34:23.911 --> 01:34:24.744
<v Speaker 3>we do our demographic research and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>really look into why people are using </v>

1904
01:34:28.111 --> 01:34:28.944
<v Speaker 3>these products and we see that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>majority of the users are women and you </v>

1905
01:34:33.691 --> 01:34:35.580
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually know why that is.</v>

1906
01:34:35.581 --> 01:34:37.770
<v Speaker 3>It's that women prefer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1907
01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:42.420
<v Speaker 3>art and aesthetics over men and on </v>
<v Speaker 3>average.</v>

1908
01:34:42.421 --> 01:34:43.254
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what I had in the </v>

1909
01:34:44.401 --> 01:34:45.234
<v Speaker 3>document,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we openly acknowledge this when </v>

1910
01:34:48.631 --> 01:34:52.740
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at the products because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you're not going to give these</v>

1911
01:34:52.741 --> 01:34:53.574
<v Speaker 3>random ads to people that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know that they're a man and </v>

1912
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to give them ads for</v>

1913
01:34:58.330 --> 01:34:59.210
<v Speaker 5>women products,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1914
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:04.910
<v Speaker 5>So ad science does discriminate and </v>
<v Speaker 5>stereotype people in some ways,</v>

1915
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:11.310
<v Speaker 5>but it's okay now they're getting into </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to de bias machine learning.</v>

1916
01:35:17.331 --> 01:35:18.164
<v Speaker 5>So if they do see any things that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>machine learning has learned these </v>

1917
01:35:22.601 --> 01:35:27.601
<v Speaker 5>statistical anomalies or just trends in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the data,</v>

1918
01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:28.853
<v Speaker 5>then they'll try to remove that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why that seems like it would be less </v>

1919
01:35:32.271 --> 01:35:34.640
<v Speaker 5>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's less effective,</v>

1920
01:35:34.641 --> 01:35:36.830
<v Speaker 5>but they see it as discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Social Justice.</v>

1921
01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:37.664
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's</v>

1922
01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.740
<v Speaker 5>and mess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a mess.</v>

1923
01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:43.780
<v Speaker 5>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to step up your game.</v>

1924
01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:47.080
<v Speaker 5>Come on back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bring back that windows phone.</v>

1925
01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.810
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hotmail.</v>

1926
01:35:50.530 --> 01:35:52.000
<v Speaker 5>Microsoft had hotmail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1927
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:54.280
<v Speaker 5>Nobody uses hotmail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does that even real anymore?</v>

1928
01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:59.930
<v Speaker 5>They have hotmail I think so I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been getting a lot of emails from,</v>

1929
01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.153
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty paranoid people and some of them </v>

1930
01:36:03.551 --> 01:36:04.690
<v Speaker 5>are from hot now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1931
01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:06.790

<v Speaker 5>Where are you right now?</v>

1935
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:15.400

<v Speaker 5>where are you?</v>

1936
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:19.060
<v Speaker 5>What do you do with your time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The I read books,</v>

1937
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:21.970
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>respond to media requires a lot of them.</v>

1938
01:36:22.330 --> 01:36:24.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still get a lot and you know,</v>

1939
01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.400
<v Speaker 5>thankfully now some of them are more of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the long form,</v>

1940
01:36:27.401 --> 01:36:31.780
<v Speaker 5>which ilr I like a lot more than just </v>
<v Speaker 5>the five minute TV thing.</v>

1941
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:33.643
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to give you as much time as he </v>
<v Speaker 5>could to just talk about this and </v>

1942
01:36:37.121 --> 01:36:38.960
<v Speaker 5>especially after I heard you on Ben </v>
<v Speaker 5>Shapiro,</v>

1943
01:36:38.961 --> 01:36:42.070
<v Speaker 5>Cheryl show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like this getting the shaft.</v>

1944
01:36:42.071 --> 01:36:45.580
<v Speaker 5>You're very reasonable person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not a misogynist at all as far as</v>

1945
01:36:45.581 --> 01:36:48.880
<v Speaker 5>I can tell he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't seem like a sexist.</v>

1946
01:36:48.881 --> 01:36:51.940
<v Speaker 5>You don't seem cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not like the type of person.</v>

1947
01:36:51.941 --> 01:36:52.774
<v Speaker 5>I think we'd go out of their way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>promote some sort of a quote unquote </v>

1948
01:36:54.971 --> 01:36:59.620
<v Speaker 5>harmful stereotype gender stereotype.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just seems so weird.</v>

1949
01:36:59.710 --> 01:37:00.543
<v Speaker 5>Especially like I personally am just </v>
<v Speaker 5>very conscious about a lot of these </v>

1950
01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:07.900
<v Speaker 5>gender stereotypes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use the word day whenever the,</v>

1951
01:37:08.630 --> 01:37:09.463
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I read the gender of someone is </v>

1952
01:37:11.021 --> 01:37:11.854
<v Speaker 5>unknown or just unimportant [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 5>and like I try to avoid using guys </v>

1953
01:37:16.150 --> 01:37:18.110
<v Speaker 5>instead of just like you all or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

1954
01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:19.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say folks,</v>

1955
01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:22.030
<v Speaker 5>I try to say folks now because I used to</v>
<v Speaker 5>say guys lot,</v>

1956
01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:26.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try to use the term folks yet for that</v>

1957
01:37:26.381 --> 01:37:27.214
<v Speaker 5>very reason.</v>

1958
01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1959
01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.640
<v Speaker 5>if I get married,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1960
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:34.450
<v Speaker 5>I would actually try to merge our last </v>
<v Speaker 5>name somehow.</v>

1961
01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.640
<v Speaker 5>Don't do that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

1962
01:37:35.670 --> 01:37:37.660
<v Speaker 5>not like the highest band,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the hyphen,</v>

1963
01:37:37.661 --> 01:37:40.210
<v Speaker 5>but just like create a new name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>create a new name.</v>

1964
01:37:40.211 --> 01:37:42.310
<v Speaker 5>That would be the coolest if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can do it.</v>

1965
01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:42.791
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1966
01:37:42.791 --> 01:37:44.620
<v Speaker 5>the former mayor of Los Angeles did </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1967
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:45.371
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1968
01:37:45.371 --> 01:37:46.204
<v Speaker 5>His name is Tony Volare and his wife had</v>
<v Speaker 5>this ethnic name and so they changed it </v>

1969
01:37:51.011 --> 01:37:56.011
<v Speaker 5>and put it together and he came to Villa</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arago Lavilla or Villaraigosa.</v>

1970
01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:00.390
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what his name was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it made him seem like he was Mexican</v>

1971
01:38:00.930 --> 01:38:05.430
<v Speaker 5>and so that's why you went with it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he kept it even after they got divorced.</v>

1972
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:07.423
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's super like Adam Kroll is shits on </v>

1973
01:38:09.161 --> 01:38:09.994
<v Speaker 5>them for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even know about it until he </v>

1974
01:38:11.131 --> 01:38:12.540
<v Speaker 5>explained it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went what?</v>

1975
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:16.380
<v Speaker 5>Like it's a fake name because I mean I </v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

1976
01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:18.090
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

1977
01:38:18.091 --> 01:38:22.470
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't want my wife to take my last </v>
<v Speaker 5>name and lose theirs.</v>

1978
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.600
<v Speaker 5>I refuse to let my wife use her own </v>
<v Speaker 5>name.</v>

1979
01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.510
<v Speaker 5>You can?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1980
01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:32.300

<v Speaker 5>Go saw Villaraigosa for Laura goes.</v>

1981
01:38:33.670 --> 01:38:35.550
<v Speaker 5>You could make a really cool last name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1982
01:38:35.551 --> 01:38:36.990
<v Speaker 5>that's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1983
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:42.020
<v Speaker 5>he was Volare Antonio Ramon Volare </v>
<v Speaker 5>junior and his wife was a Ria.</v>

1984
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:44.760
<v Speaker 5>Goza.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty cool.</v>

1985
01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.640
<v Speaker 5>Then they split up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he kept that name.</v>

1986
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:49.103
<v Speaker 5>Kept that fucking ethnic name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as you don't Google search at </v>

1987
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:53.280
<v Speaker 5>when you do you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1992
01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:06.660

<v Speaker 5>about that and she stand up.</v>

1993
01:39:06.661 --> 01:39:08.700
<v Speaker 5>Comedian,</v>

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your old name,</v>

1995
01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:12.503
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then like when a woman gets married </v>

1996
01:39:13.770 --> 01:39:16.920
<v Speaker 5>and then like her all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her name is when her son and gets locked</v>

1997

<v Speaker 5>out of his bank account and needs to </v>
<v Speaker 5>know mom was your old day.</v>

1998
01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:25.110
<v Speaker 5>Like in terms of like how to access his </v>
<v Speaker 5>account with a password.</v>

1999
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:26.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2000
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.863
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'd be nice if everybody just kept </v>

2001
01:39:28.381 --> 01:39:31.410
<v Speaker 5>their own fucking name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then once you do to the kids,</v>

2002
01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.810
<v Speaker 5>that's yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To kill the kid,</v>

2003
01:39:33.811 --> 01:39:36.670
<v Speaker 5>to pick your favorite parent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2004
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:37.523
<v Speaker 5>Who's your favorite parent?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have a meritocracy inside your own </v>

2005
01:39:41.251 --> 01:39:43.710
<v Speaker 5>family now you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2006
01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:45.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then if you have it,</v>

2007
01:39:45.491 --> 01:39:48.040
<v Speaker 5>so the first child is this second child,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>

2008
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.280
<v Speaker 5>then it just gets too confusing.</v>

2009
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.050
<v Speaker 5>And then what if you changed your name </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you break up,</v>

2010
01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:52.913
<v Speaker 5>you go back to your old name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It depends on how cool it is a bit out </v>

2011
01:39:57.161 --> 01:40:00.450
<v Speaker 5>of and then you keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's good.</v>

2012
01:40:00.630 --> 01:40:04.620
<v Speaker 5>It keeps you in great shape with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ethnic market markets maybe.</v>

2013
01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:05.790
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2014
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:07.290
<v Speaker 5>Tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2015
01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:11.400
<v Speaker 5>Marriage in itself is very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's some sort of strange legal contract</v>

2016
01:40:11.401 --> 01:40:13.440
<v Speaker 5>with the state that involves </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships,</v>

2017
01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:14.274
<v Speaker 5>which is just so bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why 50 percent of them fall </v>

2018
01:40:17.161 --> 01:40:18.310
<v Speaker 5>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2019
01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:21.420
<v Speaker 5>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chris Rock had a great joke about that.</v>

2020
01:40:21.421 --> 01:40:25.170
<v Speaker 5>That's the coward's that stay like how </v>
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>

2021
01:40:25.230 --> 01:40:28.290
<v Speaker 5>how many of the people stay 50 percent </v>
<v Speaker 5>left.</v>

2022
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:29.263
<v Speaker 5>Like how many people are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>miserable and they're still involved in </v>

2023
01:40:33.001 --> 01:40:36.060
<v Speaker 5>that contract and it's 50 percent that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fail.</v>

2024
01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:37.800
<v Speaker 5>It's a good argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2025
01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

2026
01:40:39.541 --> 01:40:40.374
<v Speaker 5>It the 50 percent of the initial ones </v>
<v Speaker 5>get a breaking up or just 50 percent of </v>

2027
01:40:44.521 --> 01:40:45.210
<v Speaker 5>all marriages.</v>

2028
01:40:45.210 --> 01:40:49.740
<v Speaker 5>So like there are some that get married </v>
<v Speaker 5>10 times and they get counted in that 50</v>

2029
01:40:49.741 --> 01:40:50.574
<v Speaker 5>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2030
01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:53.890
<v Speaker 5>Because initial marriages,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you get a union.</v>

2031
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:54.760
<v Speaker 5>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

2032
01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.510
<v Speaker 5>How many of those work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fifty percent stay unionized?</v>

2033
01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:00.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of the first one.</v>

2034
01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:02.320
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not good.</v>

2035
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:03.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not good.</v>

2036
01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:04.993
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm happily married and I tell people </v>

2037
01:41:06.011 --> 01:41:09.670
<v Speaker 5>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm worried that it's not worth it,</v>

2038
01:41:09.671 --> 01:41:12.400
<v Speaker 5>it's a fucking ridiculous proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you're,</v>

2039
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:15.010
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you're male or female,</v>

2040
01:41:15.011 --> 01:41:17.350
<v Speaker 5>that makes a lot of money and the spouse</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't,</v>

2041
01:41:17.410 --> 01:41:20.110
<v Speaker 5>then you run into this very weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation,</v>

2042
01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:22.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2043
01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:25.520
<v Speaker 5>it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] and you know,</v>

2044
01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:28.120
<v Speaker 5>potential of losing custody of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2045
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:29.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets real weird,</v>

2046
01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:32.230
<v Speaker 5>but it makes sense with children because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2047
01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:33.093
<v Speaker 5>like look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>creating life is way more of a </v>

2048
01:41:35.261 --> 01:41:38.110
<v Speaker 5>commitment than divorce and marriage </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you could,</v>

2049
01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:39.460
<v Speaker 5>you could easily get divorced.</v>

2050
01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:42.610
<v Speaker 5>People do it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but creating life is like,</v>

2051
01:41:42.970 --> 01:41:47.380
<v Speaker 5>that's a significant responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's gigantic.</v>

2052
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:48.363
<v Speaker 5>You could get along with someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could get divorced and go </v>

2053
01:41:51.311 --> 01:41:52.144
<v Speaker 5>through all the turmoil and all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stress and then find a new person and </v>

2054
01:41:55.301 --> 01:41:57.280
<v Speaker 5>maybe they'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it'll be better.</v>

2055
01:41:57.281 --> 01:41:58.114
<v Speaker 5>Maybe marry that person and to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe you learned from your first </v>

2056
01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:01.414
<v Speaker 5>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think the commitment of raising a </v>

2057
01:42:06.941 --> 01:42:11.941
<v Speaker 5>human being is way more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a serious long term responsibility.</v>

2058
01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:15.970
<v Speaker 5>So if you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you can stay married,</v>

2059
01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:20.110
<v Speaker 5>if it work it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as long as the person's reasonable get a</v>

2060
01:42:20.111 --> 01:42:20.944
<v Speaker 5>reasonable person would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know anyone that's getting an </v>

2061
01:42:22.811 --> 01:42:25.510
<v Speaker 5>arranged marriage or has arranged </v>
<v Speaker 5>marriage?</v>

2062
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:26.583
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't because those actually it was a </v>

2063
01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:30.970
<v Speaker 5>weird day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stay together more than not 50 percent.</v>

2064
01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:31.840
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2065
01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

2066
01:42:33.610 --> 01:42:34.360
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2067
01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.193
<v Speaker 5>like rich parents get together with </v>
<v Speaker 5>another rich family and they bring over </v>

2068
01:42:38.021 --> 01:42:41.650
<v Speaker 5>the daughter and we kind of not </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily just rich.</v>

2069
01:42:41.651 --> 01:42:46.090
<v Speaker 5>I think that happens a lot and more </v>
<v Speaker 5>traditional countries like India,</v>

2070
01:42:46.091 --> 01:42:47.400
<v Speaker 5>it's still happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that,</v>

2071
01:42:47.410 --> 01:42:49.870
<v Speaker 5>the divorce is over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the myth lives on.</v>

2072
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:52.830
<v Speaker 5>That's a chick or wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just thought propaganda.</v>

2073
01:42:52.831 --> 01:42:55.570
<v Speaker 5>That's fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get that shit off the screen.</v>

2074
01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:58.660
<v Speaker 5>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just saw another article in psychology</v>

2075
01:42:58.661 --> 01:42:59.494
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It said it's down to about 25 or 75 </v>

2076
01:43:01.451 --> 01:43:03.400
<v Speaker 5>percent survive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2077
01:43:03.401 --> 01:43:04.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One in four and a divorce.</v>

2078
01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:06.460
<v Speaker 5>But if you get married a second or third</v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2079
01:43:06.461 --> 01:43:07.620
<v Speaker 5>the rates go way up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2080
01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:12.070
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It says it's like a myth,</v>

2081
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:13.840
<v Speaker 5>quote unquote myth from the seventies </v>
<v Speaker 5>and eighties.</v>

2082
01:43:13.841 --> 01:43:14.674
<v Speaker 5>But there also isn't the amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you got married in the last 10 years </v>

2083
01:43:17.501 --> 01:43:20.170
<v Speaker 5>to say you're going to get divorced in </v>
<v Speaker 5>20 more years,</v>

2084
01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:21.213
<v Speaker 5>I would like to know what the actual </v>
<v Speaker 5>hard data with the United States of </v>

2085
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:24.813
<v Speaker 5>America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because culturally it gets weird when </v>

2086
01:43:25.511 --> 01:43:26.344
<v Speaker 5>you look across the different countries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what about the United States of </v>

2087
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:30.333
<v Speaker 5>America?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are the percentage of people who </v>

2088
01:43:32.021 --> 01:43:34.390
<v Speaker 5>get married to wind up getting divorced?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's find that out.</v>

2089
01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:36.120
<v Speaker 5>What do you say it is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2090
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:37.950
<v Speaker 5>across the world?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2091
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.260
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2092
01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:40.450
<v Speaker 5>Just United States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The United States.</v>

2093
01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:43.390
<v Speaker 5>I would think I'm sort of trusting that </v>
<v Speaker 5>random.</v>

2094
01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:45.670
<v Speaker 5>You think it's about 25 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get divorced.</v>

2095
01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:49.330
<v Speaker 5>Divorce rate in the US drops to nearly </v>
<v Speaker 5>40 year low.</v>

2096
01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:52.240
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this represents</v>

2097
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:56.990
<v Speaker 4>a jump from 31 point nine and 2014 and </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the highest number.</v>

2098
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:58.940
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 two point two.</v>

2099
01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:00.553
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marriage rates the other hand have </v>

2100
01:44:01.701 --> 01:44:04.640
<v Speaker 4>increased.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's 32 point two marriages for every</v>

2101
01:44:04.641 --> 01:44:06.890
<v Speaker 4>thousand unmarried,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what is the divorce rate?</v>

2102
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:10.100
<v Speaker 4>16 point nine for a thousand married </v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

2103
01:44:10.101 --> 01:44:12.080
<v Speaker 4>Fifteen year old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the fucking percentage?</v>

2104
01:44:12.081 --> 01:44:12.914
<v Speaker 4>You fucking 23.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They throw around too many 50 percent </v>

2105
01:44:16.491 --> 01:44:17.324
<v Speaker 4>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2106
01:44:17.630 --> 01:44:20.810
<v Speaker 4>Typical marriage is still have a 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent chance of lasting.</v>

2107
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.510
<v Speaker 4>That's all I said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So same goddamn number.</v>

2108
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:24.463
<v Speaker 4>Researchers have found that typical </v>
<v Speaker 4>marriage is still have about a 50 </v>

2109
01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:30.870
<v Speaker 4>percent chance of lasting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's very fucking.</v>

2110
01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:36.460
<v Speaker 3>This is still just colored including the</v>
<v Speaker 3>second and third marriages and beyond.</v>

2111
01:44:38.850 --> 01:44:39.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marriage is marriage.</v>

2112
01:44:40.170 --> 01:44:42.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you have a second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marriage means you failed.</v>

2113
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.490
<v Speaker 4>It means you got divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2114
01:44:44.491 --> 01:44:45.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if.</v>

2115
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:46.303
<v Speaker 4>Go back to that Jamie please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says researchers have found that </v>

2116
01:44:51.431 --> 01:44:55.060
<v Speaker 4>typical marriages still have a 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent chance of lasting.</v>

2117
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:58.240
<v Speaker 4>That means you have a 50 percent chance </v>
<v Speaker 4>of not lasting,</v>

2118
01:44:59.010 --> 01:45:02.550
<v Speaker 3>but that's just assuming you look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>every single marriage,</v>

2119
01:45:02.551 --> 01:45:03.384
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at the first marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe you have a 70 percent chance </v>

2120
01:45:07.201 --> 01:45:11.010
<v Speaker 3>of never getting a divorce and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you do get it,</v>

2121
01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:15.640
<v Speaker 4>so you like factored in when people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>in like the second,</v>

2122
01:45:15.641 --> 01:45:16.840
<v Speaker 4>third and fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maryland.</v>

2123
01:45:17.230 --> 01:45:20.680
<v Speaker 4>Those Elizabeth Taylor type folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like nine or 10 marriages,</v>

2124
01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:26.340
<v Speaker 3>so it might have reduced because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are just getting married later,</v>

2125
01:45:26.370 --> 01:45:29.220
<v Speaker 3>so they're choosing rather than just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2126
01:45:29.221 --> 01:45:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I got pregnant when I was young or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have anything else to do,</v>

2127
01:45:33.751 --> 01:45:34.540
<v Speaker 3>so I got married.</v>

2128
01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:35.373
<v Speaker 4>We'll get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii had the lowest because it's </v>

2129
01:45:36.911 --> 01:45:37.744
<v Speaker 4>fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then maybe if you live somewhere </v>

2130
01:45:38.921 --> 01:45:40.960
<v Speaker 4>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have universal basic income.</v>

2131
01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:42.091
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2132
01:45:42.091 --> 01:45:44.680
<v Speaker 4>They're great marriages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you put up,</v>

2133
01:45:44.681 --> 01:45:46.190
<v Speaker 4>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you highlighted?</v>

2134
01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.073
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just other things that they're saying </v>

2135
01:45:48.341 --> 01:45:49.174
<v Speaker 3>factor and like cohabitating has become </v>
<v Speaker 3>less stigmatized so they're not living </v>

2136
01:45:52.151 --> 01:45:53.950
<v Speaker 3>together but not getting married as </v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing.</v>

2137
01:45:54.490 --> 01:45:54.971
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2138
01:45:54.971 --> 01:45:58.570
<v Speaker 4>People don't look to shore up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>unstable relationship.</v>

2139
01:45:58.571 --> 01:46:00.580
<v Speaker 4>Marriage rates have been declining for </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

2140
01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:03.870
<v Speaker 4>so less people get married,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the percentage is still.</v>

2141
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:05.890
<v Speaker 4>You also don't have to get married when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a kid right now.</v>

2142
01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:06.790
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2143
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:07.940
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brushing and do it.</v>

2144
01:46:08.010 --> 01:46:08.740
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2145
01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:10.420
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's less stigmatized.</v>

2146
01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.710
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2147
01:46:11.711 --> 01:46:14.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine if that was a friendship thing.</v>

2148
01:46:14.230 --> 01:46:16.360
<v Speaker 4>Okay man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we be best friends or what?</v>

2149
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:18.400
<v Speaker 4>Fucking go to court dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and do this.</v>

2150
01:46:19.450 --> 01:46:21.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just this weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2151
01:46:21.611 --> 01:46:23.980
<v Speaker 4>it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does,</v>

2152
01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:25.870
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense for some people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like it.</v>

2153
01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:27.700
<v Speaker 4>People like rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2154
01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:28.893
<v Speaker 4>feels good to know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say it and do it and make it real </v>

2155
01:46:32.861 --> 01:46:35.240
<v Speaker 4>and jump over the broom like they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>roots.</v>

2156
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.863
<v Speaker 3>I think one interesting thing that I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking into a little bit was the rates </v>

2157
01:46:41.521 --> 01:46:45.990
<v Speaker 3>of divorce for homosexual marriages </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that,</v>

2158
01:46:46.050 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 3>that's also sort of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one thing about heterosexual is</v>

2159
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.280
<v Speaker 5>women and initiate the divorce in 70 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent of cases.</v>

2160
01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:55.440
<v Speaker 5>Of course they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

2161
01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:56.483
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have necessarily predicted </v>

2162
01:46:57.901 --> 01:46:58.734
<v Speaker 5>that Adeline.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think when we get pissed more like </v>

2163
01:47:01.531 --> 01:47:04.230
<v Speaker 5>that on you tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2164
01:47:04.231 --> 01:47:06.300
<v Speaker 5>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but relationships that you've been in,</v>

2165
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:07.343
<v Speaker 5>have women been pissed off at you more </v>
<v Speaker 5>than you've been pissed off at them or </v>

2166
01:47:09.271 --> 01:47:11.550
<v Speaker 5>the opposite?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely.</v>

2167
01:47:11.551 --> 01:47:14.020
<v Speaker 5>They get mad at me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Says you're a God damn.</v>

2168
01:47:14.190 --> 01:47:19.020
<v Speaker 5>Promoting harmful gender stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I sign up.</v>

2169
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:22.500
<v Speaker 5>I generally just don't get that angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think that's part of it,</v>

2170
01:47:22.501 --> 01:47:23.730
<v Speaker 5>but that's probably where they get mad </v>
<v Speaker 5>at you.</v>

2171
01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:26.460
<v Speaker 5>You don't even fucking care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so like,</v>

2172
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.640
<v Speaker 5>not to push on the one thing that sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of hurt me,</v>

2173
01:47:29.641 --> 01:47:34.641
<v Speaker 5>but the neuroticism trait is actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>has been linked to on stable marriages.</v>

2174
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:39.090
<v Speaker 5>Women having more of that has been part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the explanation for why.</v>

2175
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:40.253
<v Speaker 5>And so you see in lesbian couples,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they also have a higher rate of divorce </v>

2176
01:47:44.581 --> 01:47:46.680
<v Speaker 5>then the gay couple,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the gay men.</v>

2177
01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:47.933
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like part of it is women want to </v>

2178
01:47:50.191 --> 01:47:54.420
<v Speaker 5>settle down much faster so they'll move </v>
<v Speaker 5>in within like a month.</v>

2179
01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:57.860
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which obviously is,</v>

2180
01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:01.150
<v Speaker 5>you're too soon to know whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a longterm chip.</v>

2181
01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:02.453
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if neither one of you are </v>

2182
01:48:02.941 --> 01:48:03.774
<v Speaker 5>flexible and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of adapt to each other's needs and </v>

2183
01:48:06.901 --> 01:48:08.040
<v Speaker 5>desires.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2184
01:48:08.041 --> 01:48:09.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I interrupted you though.</v>

2185
01:48:09.121 --> 01:48:13.080
<v Speaker 5>What is the percentage of gay men who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how often are they get divorced,</v>

2186
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:14.423
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the exact numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's lower than the lesbian one and </v>

2187
01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:22.700
<v Speaker 5>because we only had the last few years </v>
<v Speaker 5>or so of gay marriage.</v>

2188
01:48:22.730 --> 01:48:26.130
<v Speaker 5>So we don't know the actual long term </v>
<v Speaker 5>rates,</v>

2189
01:48:27.450 --> 01:48:31.550
<v Speaker 5>but it's certainly interesting because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2190
01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.600
<v Speaker 5>it's a world that I don't know much </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

2191
01:48:33.690 --> 01:48:35.350
<v Speaker 5>Brian has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2192
01:48:37.170 --> 01:48:41.700
<v Speaker 5>how have you come through all this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like do you feel damaged by this at all?</v>

2193
01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:46.700
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel like your name is this </v>
<v Speaker 5>marched a definitely,</v>

2194
01:48:48.150 --> 01:48:48.983
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2195
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:54.350
<v Speaker 5>I just went to a party with my friends </v>
<v Speaker 5>and some of them were much closer to and</v>

2196
01:48:54.871 --> 01:48:59.260
<v Speaker 5>I had already talked to about this some </v>
<v Speaker 5>I hadn't and you know,</v>

2197
01:48:59.261 --> 01:49:02.610
<v Speaker 5>you never know how they felt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So some,</v>

2198
01:49:02.611 --> 01:49:05.700
<v Speaker 5>it seemed like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2199
01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:07.680
<v Speaker 5>I could tell that they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah man,</v>

2200
01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:12.800
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's up bus bro.</v>

2201
01:49:13.410 --> 01:49:18.410
<v Speaker 5>Keep it secret handshake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But others were maybe a little averse to</v>

2202
01:49:19.951 --> 01:49:23.190
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that may happen in the future,</v>

2203
01:49:23.191 --> 01:49:25.880
<v Speaker 5>but prejudices that they have going into</v>
<v Speaker 5>the conversation.</v>

2204
01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:27.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Oh,</v>

2205
01:49:27.871 --> 01:49:28.704
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that you are a sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What have you gotten that if he hadn't </v>

2206
01:49:32.051 --> 01:49:36.930
<v Speaker 5>been people like outright insulting you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was one person that was on just on</v>

2207

<v Speaker 5>the roads,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just f you.</v>

2208
01:49:38.730 --> 01:49:39.521

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2209
01:49:39.521 --> 01:49:42.810
<v Speaker 5>in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where was this in mountain view?</v>

2210
01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.840
<v Speaker 5>So you're driving your car?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just got out of my car and they just</v>

2213
01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:00.850

<v Speaker 3>That's why he said that.</v>

2214
01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah.</v>

2215

<v Speaker 3>except by like crazy people on the </v>

<v Speaker 3>normal nerd guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>trying to press her?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Maybe that con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Shit.</v>

01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:20.960
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

2221
01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:22.123
<v Speaker 3>most of the support or at least like </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal interactions have been in </v>

2222
01:50:26.181 --> 01:50:29.120
<v Speaker 3>support of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there've been random people like,</v>

2223
01:50:29.150 --> 01:50:30.140
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you James Tomorrow?</v>

2224
01:50:30.170 --> 01:50:31.003
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2225
01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one guy with a girl yelled out,</v>

2226
01:50:34.501 --> 01:50:36.360
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he looked like a nerd.</v>

2227
01:50:37.110 --> 01:50:38.160
<v Speaker 1>She'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll dump him.</v>

2228
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

2229
01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:42.810
<v Speaker 1>It'll all come around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend that was like that.</v>

2230
01:50:42.811 --> 01:50:47.130
<v Speaker 1>He was super fucking male feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually his,</v>

2231
01:50:47.131 --> 01:50:50.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his spouse went nutty on them and crazy.</v>

2232
01:50:50.731 --> 01:50:52.560
<v Speaker 1>And then all of her friends went nutty </v>
<v Speaker 1>on him.</v>

2233
01:50:52.561 --> 01:50:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And now he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he man,</v>

2234
01:50:53.851 --> 01:50:55.410
<v Speaker 1>woman haters club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went the other way.</v>

2235
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not totally,</v>

2236
01:50:58.651 --> 01:51:00.540
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man?</v>

2237
01:51:00.541 --> 01:51:01.081
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2238
01:51:01.081 --> 01:51:01.914
<v Speaker 1>you can't just rely on a gender to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool to rely on individual human beings </v>

2239
01:51:08.911 --> 01:51:12.030
<v Speaker 1>and their personalities and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions and their character.</v>

2240
01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe we have to actually go </v>
<v Speaker 1>over this,</v>

2241
01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:17.070
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all in all,</v>

2242
01:51:17.071 --> 01:51:18.750
<v Speaker 1>men aren't great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All in all.</v>

2243
01:51:18.751 --> 01:51:19.584
<v Speaker 1>Women aren't great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find unique people that are cool in </v>

2244
01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:23.093
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of groups.</v>

2245
01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:24.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2246
01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:29.560
<v Speaker 3>once you start aligning yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of these groups and you know,</v>

2247
01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:33.610
<v Speaker 3>if you ever go against any of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>principals and you know,</v>

2248
01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:35.960
<v Speaker 3>they're constantly changing and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>more extreme,</v>

2249
01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:38.840
<v Speaker 3>then you'll eventually get ostracized </v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

2250
01:51:38.850 --> 01:51:39.683
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened.</v>

2251
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:42.830
<v Speaker 1>That that's a big issue with the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2252
01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:44.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left eats itself,</v>

2253
01:51:44.770 --> 01:51:47.980
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that's as much of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with the conservative.</v>

2254
01:51:47.981 --> 01:51:48.814
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rational conservatives not like racists </v>

2255
01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:55.360
<v Speaker 1>and like full right wing nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2256
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:56.223
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

2257
01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:59.070
<v Speaker 3>what people just want,</v>

2258
01:51:59.970 --> 01:52:01.570
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want harmony.</v>

2259
01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I think overall they want to succeed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want harmony,</v>

2260
01:52:04.830 --> 01:52:06.760
<v Speaker 1>which sometimes are mutually exclusive.</v>

2261
01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2262
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:09.970
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people just don't acknowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2263
01:52:10.530 --> 01:52:12.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people are normal and they're just,</v>

2264
01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:16.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to live their life and you know,</v>

2265
01:52:16.091 --> 01:52:19.180
<v Speaker 3>even though they might have voted for </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump for something,</v>

2266
01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:23.620
<v Speaker 3>they're not some evil person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not the KKK,</v>

2267
01:52:24.190 --> 01:52:25.023
<v Speaker 3>which I've met a lot of people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Silicon valley that basically equate </v>

2268
01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:30.950
<v Speaker 3>voting for trump and being in the KKK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:33.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's harmful.</v>

2270
01:52:33.251 --> 01:52:36.210
<v Speaker 3>That's really splitting groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2271
01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:39.790
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to build products that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are for the entire world,</v>

2272
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:44.020
<v Speaker 3>then you really need to understand other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people especially,</v>

2273
01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:44.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the world is actually more </v>

2274
01:52:47.031 --> 01:52:47.864
<v Speaker 3>conservative than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Europe may be more liberal than </v>

2275
01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:52.723
<v Speaker 3>the US in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of Asia and Africa and South </v>

2276
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:59.090
<v Speaker 3>America is more conservative than we </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

2277
01:52:59.091 --> 01:53:04.091
<v Speaker 3>So we need to at least understand what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening and what their worldview is.</v>

2278
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:06.183
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that everyone who voted for </v>

2279
01:53:06.861 --> 01:53:08.010
<v Speaker 3>trump is a</v>

2280
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:09.103
<v Speaker 4>in the KKK so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's convenient to demonize the </v>

2281
01:53:12.951 --> 01:53:15.140
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would love to do that.</v>

2282
01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:18.860
<v Speaker 4>We'd love to look at groups and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>block ourselves off.</v>

2283
01:53:18.861 --> 01:53:19.694
<v Speaker 4>And this is us and we're on the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>and these people on the other side </v>

2284
01:53:22.821 --> 01:53:26.840
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're incorrect and it's a real normal</v>

2285
01:53:26.841 --> 01:53:30.530
<v Speaker 4>common tendency that human beings have </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we should be very,</v>

2286
01:53:30.531 --> 01:53:32.000
<v Speaker 4>very aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're not,</v>

2287
01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:32.893
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have these convenient blinders that </v>

2288
01:53:34.401 --> 01:53:35.234
<v Speaker 4>we put on whenever we're engaging in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of ideological discussions where </v>

2289
01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:42.690
<v Speaker 4>our belief systems might be challenged </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we dig our heels in and like,</v>

2290
01:53:42.710 --> 01:53:43.543
<v Speaker 4>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you see a lot of that with the </v>

2291
01:53:45.411 --> 01:53:46.490
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this whole.</v>

2292
01:53:46.491 --> 01:53:47.324
<v Speaker 4>Like you can not be progressive enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like they're getting wackier </v>

2293
01:53:50.841 --> 01:53:52.850
<v Speaker 4>and whack here with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just really weird.</v>

2294
01:53:53.590 --> 01:53:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2295
01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:56.180
<v Speaker 3>no concept of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2296
01:53:56.181 --> 01:53:59.780
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am an ally with you on this thing,</v>

2297
01:54:00.170 --> 01:54:03.230
<v Speaker 3>even though we may disagree on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>other subject.</v>

2298
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:06.200
<v Speaker 3>And that's just completely impossible in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their head.</v>

2299
01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:07.133
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I don't think there's enough real </v>

2300
01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:09.833
<v Speaker 4>discussions going on in this world too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people are a lot of times </v>

2301
01:54:13.261 --> 01:54:15.840
<v Speaker 4>following these predetermined patterns </v>
<v Speaker 4>of behavior.</v>

2302
01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:16.703
<v Speaker 4>They think they're expected to follow as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a progressive or as a conservative and </v>

2303
01:54:20.581 --> 01:54:21.414
<v Speaker 4>then they just go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when they do engage with </v>

2304
01:54:24.751 --> 01:54:29.670
<v Speaker 4>someone who has a different opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it becomes a in quotes game again,</v>

2305
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:30.763
<v Speaker 4>it's trying to win rather than trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand like what this person sees </v>

2306
01:54:35.071 --> 01:54:35.904
<v Speaker 4>and what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what is your philosophy like how </v>

2307
01:54:37.711 --> 01:54:40.500
<v Speaker 4>were you approaching this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And trying to be like really open minded</v>

2308
01:54:40.501 --> 01:54:41.670
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2309
01:54:41.850 --> 01:54:45.100
<v Speaker 3>like I see this even in myself when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to someone and you know,</v>

2310
01:54:45.210 --> 01:54:46.043
<v Speaker 3>maybe there are feminists are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme in some way and like I'll </v>

2311
01:54:49.921 --> 01:54:50.754
<v Speaker 3>discuss them and I'll immediately just </v>
<v Speaker 3>stereotype them as someone that's even </v>

2312
01:54:53.611 --> 01:54:54.444
<v Speaker 3>more extreme and I'll read into their </v>
<v Speaker 3>words of Oh you said that that means </v>

2313
01:54:58.771 --> 01:55:01.620
<v Speaker 3>that you mean this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even though you know,</v>

2314
01:55:01.650 --> 01:55:02.483
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's important to at least show </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the extreme outcome would be and </v>

2315
01:55:07.381 --> 01:55:10.080
<v Speaker 3>therefore we can't just take this on </v>
<v Speaker 3>principle.</v>

2316
01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:15.180
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone does it and it's really hard to</v>

2317
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:16.070
<v Speaker 3>not do it.</v>

2318
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:19.350
<v Speaker 4>It is hard to not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the reasons why I think like</v>

2319
01:55:19.351 --> 01:55:22.730
<v Speaker 4>long form form conversations are so </v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

2320
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:23.923
<v Speaker 4>And how often do you ever sit down like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this with someone and talk for a couple </v>

2321
01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:29.570
<v Speaker 4>hours with just you and the person </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking,</v>

2322
01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:32.570
<v Speaker 4>not looking at your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not checking the TV?</v>

2323
01:55:32.571 --> 01:55:33.270
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2324
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:35.240
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were very rarely do this.</v>

2325
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:38.720
<v Speaker 4>I think this is one of the only ways we </v>
<v Speaker 4>could really work out ideas,</v>

2326
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.823
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone that might have a different </v>

2327
01:55:42.071 --> 01:55:42.904
<v Speaker 4>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they also might intelligent and you </v>

2328
01:55:44.161 --> 01:55:44.994
<v Speaker 4>might be able to like sort it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me parse out what your thoughts are </v>

2329
01:55:48.931 --> 01:55:49.764
<v Speaker 4>and see where I differ and how you got </v>
<v Speaker 4>to where you got and maybe they'll have </v>

2330
01:55:53.161 --> 01:55:56.480
<v Speaker 4>a better understanding of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophy and.</v>

2331
01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.770
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even have a philosophy.</v>

2332
01:55:59.090 --> 01:56:00.540
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds good.</v>

2333
01:56:00.541 --> 01:56:01.374
<v Speaker 4>So they just go with this predetermined </v>
<v Speaker 4>pattern that's easy to follow as a left </v>

2334
01:56:06.781 --> 01:56:07.591
<v Speaker 4>wing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Progressive.</v>

2335
01:56:07.591 --> 01:56:09.180
<v Speaker 4>I feel this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2336
01:56:09.181 --> 01:56:11.130
<v Speaker 4>I've heard people say that before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as a Democrat,</v>

2337
01:56:11.131 --> 01:56:12.300
<v Speaker 4>I've always felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2338
01:56:12.301 --> 01:56:15.690
<v Speaker 4>we as a demo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about as a fucking person that's.</v>

2339
01:56:15.970 --> 01:56:16.803
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

2340
01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:18.763
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2341
01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.420
<v Speaker 4>ideas are hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2342
01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.313
<v Speaker 4>thoughts on life and how we cohabitate </v>
<v Speaker 4>and how we move through this fucking </v>

2343
01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:30.510
<v Speaker 4>existence together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult to work out.</v>

2344
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:33.840
<v Speaker 4>We were just so many variables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many styles of human,</v>

2345
01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:35.093
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just so many different things </v>

2346
01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:40.500
<v Speaker 4>that we have to work through together </v>
<v Speaker 4>and to try to,</v>

2347
01:56:41.010 --> 01:56:41.843
<v Speaker 4>to try to do that based on patterns that</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people have established and that </v>

2348
01:56:45.001 --> 01:56:47.000
<v Speaker 4>you cannot break and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2349
01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:48.230
<v Speaker 4>have these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2350
01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.073
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the reasons why it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>ruthless to say that all white people </v>

2351
01:56:52.621 --> 01:56:56.220
<v Speaker 4>have some implicit biases that they may </v>
<v Speaker 4>or not,</v>

2352
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:58.850
<v Speaker 4>may not even be aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>

2353
01:56:58.910 --> 01:56:59.743
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2354
01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:01.680
<v Speaker 4>unintended racism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flavors,</v>

2355
01:57:01.681 --> 01:57:05.790
<v Speaker 4>all conversations like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>poisoning this conversation,</v>

2356
01:57:05.791 --> 01:57:10.560
<v Speaker 4>you're poisoning this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 4>within a fucking fishing line.</v>

2357
01:57:10.561 --> 01:57:11.394
<v Speaker 4>It's all tangled up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we're going to have to figure out </v>

2358
01:57:13.321 --> 01:57:17.100
<v Speaker 4>what is real and pull us apart and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>it back on the spool.</v>

2359
01:57:17.710 --> 01:57:18.290
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2360
01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:19.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's no solution for some of </v>

2361
01:57:20.421 --> 01:57:21.254
<v Speaker 3>those too where you just say there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>some boogeyman man type thing that's </v>

2362
01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:26.623
<v Speaker 3>controlling all of this and there's some</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy that we can't really see and </v>

2363
01:57:30.591 --> 01:57:34.160
<v Speaker 3>we can't point out specific examples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's ever present.</v>

2364
01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:36.800
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2365
01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.433
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the treating people as </v>

2366
01:57:39.771 --> 01:57:43.160
<v Speaker 3>individuals that has become more of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarian thing.</v>

2367
01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:46.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's hard to,</v>

2368
01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:50.990
<v Speaker 3>at least for me to understand some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this more collective thinking and social</v>

2369
01:57:50.991 --> 01:57:54.050
<v Speaker 3>conformity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've never been a fan of.</v>

2370
01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:55.813
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2371
01:57:56.610 --> 01:57:59.670
<v Speaker 4>do you think it was a good idea to write</v>
<v Speaker 4>that memo?</v>

2372
01:57:59.671 --> 01:58:00.504
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had to go back again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were in front of your computer </v>

2373
01:58:02.251 --> 01:58:05.730
<v Speaker 4>and you're ready press,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you uh,</v>

2374
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:07.730
<v Speaker 3>maybe I would wait for my year end bonus</v>

2375
01:58:12.730 --> 01:58:13.563
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2376
01:58:14.170 --> 01:58:16.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think I would have pushed </v>
<v Speaker 3>harder,</v>

2377
01:58:16.031 --> 01:58:20.050
<v Speaker 3>even harder on the diversity programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although like I met with them personally</v>

2378
01:58:20.051 --> 01:58:23.240
<v Speaker 3>and I kept pinging them and I sent so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many emails.</v>

2379
01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:26.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to have a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>

2380
01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:30.460
<v Speaker 3>And I went through multiple programs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent this document,</v>

2381
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:31.383
<v Speaker 3>this exact document to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really unclear what I could've </v>

2382
01:58:34.630 --> 01:58:37.160
<v Speaker 3>done differently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2383
01:58:37.161 --> 01:58:38.050
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2384
01:58:38.051 --> 01:58:38.884
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know so much about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underground conservative network before </v>

2385
01:58:42.791 --> 01:58:45.190
<v Speaker 3>all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At Google you mean?</v>

2386
01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:47.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even within silicon valley,</v>

2387
01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:50.470
<v Speaker 3>like there's attempts to sort of connect</v>
<v Speaker 3>them between companies,</v>

2388
01:58:50.471 --> 01:58:51.304
<v Speaker 3>but there's so much verification that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to go through to be able to </v>

2389
01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:57.310
<v Speaker 3>join one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a pseudonym.</v>

2390
01:58:58.110 --> 01:58:58.943
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you don't need to be totally </v>

2391
01:59:00.311 --> 01:59:01.990
<v Speaker 3>anonymous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2392
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:02.833
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want because there's active </v>

2393
01:59:04.721 --> 01:59:06.490
<v Speaker 3>attempts to try to infiltrate these </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>

2394
01:59:06.610 --> 01:59:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2395
01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:09.413
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this happens a lot where they'll try to </v>

2396
01:59:11.441 --> 01:59:15.040
<v Speaker 3>join a group act as if they're one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and then just,</v>

2397
01:59:15.041 --> 01:59:15.874
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>record what's happening and then expose </v>

2398
01:59:17.651 --> 01:59:18.484
<v Speaker 3>them</v>

2399
01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:22.280
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take anything out of context and</v>

2400
01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:25.260
<v Speaker 1>it would be shown as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism or something.</v>

2401
01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What mean.</v>

2402
01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Think of what we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2403
01:59:27.531 --> 01:59:30.650
<v Speaker 1>not you but me joking around in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

2404
01:59:30.651 --> 01:59:34.820
<v Speaker 1>You could clearly take something I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>said out of context and make my monster,</v>

2405
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:39.470
<v Speaker 1>but if you're in an email and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining about some sort of diversity</v>

2406
01:59:39.471 --> 01:59:40.304
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

2407
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:42.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what they often do is they will </v>

2408
01:59:45.701 --> 01:59:46.534
<v Speaker 3>find someone that they disagree with and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they'll scour through their entire </v>

2409
01:59:50.471 --> 01:59:51.304
<v Speaker 3>history at Google and all of the emails </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they've signed and try to look for </v>

2410
01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:59.590
<v Speaker 3>some way to blacklist them or show that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this person is evil,</v>

2411
01:59:59.591 --> 02:00:01.140
<v Speaker 3>therefore they should be fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2412
02:00:01.930 --> 02:00:02.763
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And supposedly this is happening in </v>

2413
02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:05.613
<v Speaker 3>other companies too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they even have like these automated </v>

2414
02:00:07.151 --> 02:00:12.151
<v Speaker 3>scripts to try to find these negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>things on people that they don't like.</v>

2415
02:00:13.250 --> 02:00:14.083
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a little little psychological covert </v>

2416
02:00:17.481 --> 02:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2417
02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's also going to contribute to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people towing the line.</v>

2418
02:00:21.471 --> 02:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to keep their job.</v>

2419
02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:25.213
<v Speaker 1>Like look at you just said maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have waited until you got your </v>

2420
02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>year end bonus people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2421
02:00:29.571 --> 02:00:31.190
<v Speaker 1>and you are a single guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2422
02:00:31.210 --> 02:00:32.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So family,</v>

2423
02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>that definitely helped where I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have as many responsibilities.</v>

2424
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I imagine if he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2425
02:00:37.011 --> 02:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>you probably wouldn't have said anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had thought about it and go,</v>

2426
02:00:39.471 --> 02:00:40.304
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to worry about my family and </v>

2427
02:00:41.751 --> 02:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>taking care of my bills and</v>

2428
02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:47.340
<v Speaker 3>so weird band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2429
02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:48.213
<v Speaker 3>I mean the worst part is these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that they're doing the right </v>

2430
02:00:50.981 --> 02:00:51.814
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2431
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Like censoring people and finding these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people is the right thing because any of</v>

2432
02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:58.750
<v Speaker 3>those people are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2433
02:00:58.751 --> 02:01:00.520
<v Speaker 3>So that's how they think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think,</v>

2434
02:01:00.850 --> 02:01:03.220
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have everyone sees the world the same.</v>

2435
02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:04.233
<v Speaker 3>Therefore anyone that disagrees with me </v>
<v Speaker 3>is either misinformed or a misogynist </v>

2436
02:01:08.981 --> 02:01:09.814
<v Speaker 3>bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2437
02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:10.923
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could I have possibly said those </v>

2438
02:01:11.951 --> 02:01:12.920
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2439
02:01:13.330 --> 02:01:15.550
<v Speaker 3>When really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2440
02:01:15.551 --> 02:01:16.384
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people with different political </v>

2441
02:01:18.551 --> 02:01:23.551
<v Speaker 3>ideologies see the world differently and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have different biases and you know,</v>

2442
02:01:24.130 --> 02:01:24.963
<v Speaker 3>none of them are totally correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we need to be able to discuss </v>

2443
02:01:27.431 --> 02:01:29.980
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to show,</v>

2444
02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:31.353
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a more objective view of the world </v>

2445
02:01:34.570 --> 02:01:38.290
<v Speaker 3>without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that that is even up for debate</v>

2446
02:01:39.110 --> 02:01:41.090
<v Speaker 3>is a very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2447
02:01:41.091 --> 02:01:46.091
<v Speaker 3>that's an ideological echo chamber and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems like for whatever reason that</v>

2448
02:01:47.121 --> 02:01:47.954
<v Speaker 3>seems like where a tech is and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>where technology companies seem to lean </v>

2449
02:01:51.590 --> 02:01:55.070
<v Speaker 3>towards this very left wing ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>echo chamber.</v>

2450
02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:57.073
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I saw it a lot too on the </v>

2451
02:01:59.390 --> 02:02:02.450
<v Speaker 3>comments of a document where I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2452
02:02:02.451 --> 02:02:04.700
<v Speaker 3>these are just biases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And no,</v>

2453
02:02:04.701 --> 02:02:05.530
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2454
02:02:05.530 --> 02:02:06.363
<v Speaker 3>the right is indoctrinated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just KKK and there </v>

2455
02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:13.800
<v Speaker 3>anti-education they're anti poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're anti everything,</v>

2456
02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:15.393
<v Speaker 3>like not all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet at least the way I see it and </v>

2457
02:02:21.631 --> 02:02:22.464
<v Speaker 3>not being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2458
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.260
<v Speaker 3>total conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't necessarily say,</v>

2459
02:02:24.261 --> 02:02:28.160
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like they don't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>hate poor people or anything.</v>

2460
02:02:28.161 --> 02:02:32.930
<v Speaker 3>They just think that these certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>incentive structures are what's best for</v>

2461
02:02:32.931 --> 02:02:33.764
<v Speaker 3>society and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not best to promote or they think </v>

2462
02:02:37.971 --> 02:02:40.360
<v Speaker 3>that some things will lead to laziness </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

2463
02:02:40.670 --> 02:02:43.040
<v Speaker 3>And that's not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2464
02:02:43.041 --> 02:02:47.360
<v Speaker 3>these people are just horrible people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually want to help everyone.</v>

2465
02:02:47.361 --> 02:02:49.420
<v Speaker 3>And they think that these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2466
02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:53.180
<v Speaker 3>social norms and government programs may</v>
<v Speaker 3>be hurting people.</v>

2467
02:02:53.530 --> 02:02:54.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there certainly are some people </v>

2468
02:02:55.691 --> 02:02:56.524
<v Speaker 1>that are right wing that think like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's some people that are </v>

2469
02:02:58.031 --> 02:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>right wing that are really racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2470
02:02:59.831 --> 02:03:00.664
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they exist too and there's some people </v>

2471
02:03:01.811 --> 02:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that are left wing that are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist and they're really racist towards</v>

2472
02:03:04.901 --> 02:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2473
02:03:05.741 --> 02:03:06.574
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's there's white people that are </v>

2474
02:03:07.151 --> 02:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>racist towards white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2475
02:03:08.771 --> 02:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>I've read so many fucking tweets from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that,</v>

2476
02:03:12.190 --> 02:03:12.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've,</v>

2477
02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I follow a bunch of anti social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior accounts and they'll find people</v>

2478
02:03:18.971 --> 02:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>that tweet like really horrible shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about white people that are white.</v>

2479
02:03:23.210 --> 02:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like I get what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just try to get those Brownie points,</v>

2480
02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>trying to try super hard to get people </v>
<v Speaker 1>of color to love you.</v>

2481
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an ally,</v>

2482
02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:34.173
<v Speaker 1>it's just very strange time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it has to do with this </v>

2483
02:03:37.721 --> 02:03:41.080
<v Speaker 1>new found ability to communicate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just really did not exist in the past.</v>

2484
02:03:41.410 --> 02:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to get controversial ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

2485
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2486
02:03:45.850 --> 02:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>two massive groups of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

2487
02:03:48.761 --> 02:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>you had to write a book or you had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get an article published,</v>

2488
02:03:51.221 --> 02:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>you had to be some sort of a major media</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution center,</v>

2489
02:03:55.691 --> 02:03:59.140
<v Speaker 1>had to take your work and put it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for the people.</v>

2490
02:03:59.530 --> 02:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you get a lot of,</v>

2491
02:04:01.601 --> 02:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>like really fragile or really poorly </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought out ideas and uh,</v>

2492
02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>as long as you can hit the nerve of </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough retards,</v>

2493
02:04:09.550 --> 02:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>you can get those things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they start promoting.</v>

2494
02:04:12.761 --> 02:04:13.594
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the flat earth movement is </v>

2495
02:04:14.291 --> 02:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

2496
02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2497
02:04:17.411 --> 02:04:18.244
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enough people that just don't have </v>

2498
02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:24.693
<v Speaker 1>a sense of the importance of critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking skills or are not used to </v>

2499
02:04:28.730 --> 02:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>objectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assessing ideas.</v>

2500
02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:31.773
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they coalesce in these groups that are </v>

2501
02:04:33.851 --> 02:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>likeminded and you can get that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>

2502
02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>You can get that with sexism.</v>

2503
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.660
<v Speaker 4>You can get that with pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

2504
02:04:39.690 --> 02:04:41.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get these likeminded groups,</v>

2505
02:04:41.730 --> 02:04:42.563
<v Speaker 4>they get together and they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>confirmation bias and they get an </v>

2506
02:04:45.121 --> 02:04:48.480
<v Speaker 4>ideological echo chamber and they start </v>
<v Speaker 4>reinforcing each other,</v>

2507
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:49.070
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2508
02:04:49.070 --> 02:04:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and definitely.</v>

2509
02:04:52.101 --> 02:04:54.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean it affects who you follow and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just assume,</v>

2510
02:04:54.831 --> 02:04:56.780
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone thinks like this,</v>

2511
02:04:56.781 --> 02:04:57.920
<v Speaker 3>therefore it must be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2512
02:04:58.070 --> 02:05:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean it's really a shame though,</v>

2513
02:05:00.891 --> 02:05:01.724
<v Speaker 3>that this is happening even in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pursuit of knowledge in academia where </v>

2514
02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:09.230
<v Speaker 3>so many people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how a certain worldview,</v>

2515
02:05:09.530 --> 02:05:12.470
<v Speaker 3>like the social sciences have 90 percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people lean left.</v>

2516
02:05:12.590 --> 02:05:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2517
02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:16.393
<v Speaker 3>that can create its own confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 3>biases and especially when you know </v>

2518
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:21.713
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely bad like in tech where </v>

2519
02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:26.540
<v Speaker 3>20 percent of people are women and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can feel alienated,</v>

2520
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:31.870
<v Speaker 3>but at least no overt signs of sexism </v>
<v Speaker 3>are seen as bad.</v>

2521
02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But over signs of discriminating against</v>

2522
02:05:35.901 --> 02:05:36.734
<v Speaker 3>people based on their political </v>
<v Speaker 3>orientation is seen as okay and people </v>

2523
02:05:41.090 --> 02:05:44.150
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>

2524
02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:49.200
<v Speaker 3>there's a big asymmetry there where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually feel it's justified to.</v>

2525
02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:50.793
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it wouldn't be as big of an issue </v>
<v Speaker 4>if we had a reasonable republican </v>

2526
02:05:54.011 --> 02:05:54.844
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if we had someone who was really </v>

2527
02:05:57.371 --> 02:05:58.204
<v Speaker 4>kind and rational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mitt Romney type who seemed like far </v>

2528
02:06:01.721 --> 02:06:04.590
<v Speaker 4>more reasonable and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

2529
02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:07.760
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

2530
02:06:08.730 --> 02:06:09.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2531
02:06:09.490 --> 02:06:11.820
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a bunch of issues obviously as a</v>

2532
02:06:11.821 --> 02:06:16.821
<v Speaker 4>country now with this guy is president </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that we're also dealing with</v>

2533
02:06:17.230 --> 02:06:18.063
<v Speaker 4>a really young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an infant stage of information </v>

2534
02:06:22.231 --> 02:06:23.850
<v Speaker 4>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a,</v>

2535
02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:28.260
<v Speaker 4>the ability for anyone to mass </v>
<v Speaker 4>distribute anything is.</v>

2536
02:06:28.270 --> 02:06:31.820
<v Speaker 4>So like anyone can create a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2537
02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:35.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a youtube video and if it strikes a cord</v>

2538
02:06:35.670 --> 02:06:39.870
<v Speaker 4>it can hit a million people like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this time like that before where,</v>

2539
02:06:39.871 --> 02:06:41.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2540
02:06:41.970 --> 02:06:42.803
<v Speaker 3>and the incentive structures are all out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of whack where it's better to be </v>

2541
02:06:45.521 --> 02:06:46.354
<v Speaker 3>outrageous than it is to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that that's causing a lot of our </v>

2542
02:06:51.911 --> 02:06:53.200
<v Speaker 3>headlines to just be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2543
02:06:53.201 --> 02:06:54.034
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he starts a sexist and there's no room </v>

2544
02:06:57.701 --> 02:06:58.540
<v Speaker 3>for nuance,</v>

2545
02:06:58.730 --> 02:07:00.110
<v Speaker 4>but it'll also don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think that it's,</v>

2546
02:07:00.230 --> 02:07:01.063
<v Speaker 4>there's a lack of time that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like I told you how much time I </v>

2547
02:07:04.311 --> 02:07:07.820
<v Speaker 4>spent going over your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And and after awhile I was like,</v>

2548
02:07:07.821 --> 02:07:09.860
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it would work in tech,</v>

2549
02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:15.260
<v Speaker 4>but most people don't have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2550
02:07:15.290 --> 02:07:17.450
<v Speaker 4>Nor do they have that sort of obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 4>mindset.</v>

2551
02:07:17.451 --> 02:07:19.400
<v Speaker 4>They look at the surface of something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2552
02:07:19.401 --> 02:07:22.940
<v Speaker 4>this guy wrote a sexist memo about women</v>
<v Speaker 4>in tech.</v>

2553
02:07:22.941 --> 02:07:25.160
<v Speaker 4>Fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably a misogynist,</v>

2554
02:07:25.161 --> 02:07:29.390
<v Speaker 4>and they just marched towards their </v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting and we have to avoid the kind of</v>

2555
02:07:29.391 --> 02:07:30.224
<v Speaker 4>thinking that lead to someone thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's okay to write the Google memo </v>

2556
02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:35.030
<v Speaker 4>and then everyone like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2557
02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:36.073
<v Speaker 4>here I want my year end bonus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think as the dust settles we will get </v>

2558
02:07:44.650 --> 02:07:49.650
<v Speaker 4>more and more truth out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's a general trend with</v>

2559
02:07:50.650 --> 02:07:55.650
<v Speaker 4>information to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have information be easier and easier</v>

2560
02:07:55.841 --> 02:07:56.590
<v Speaker 4>to distribute.</v>

2561
02:07:56.590 --> 02:07:58.570
<v Speaker 4>That's the one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about technology,</v>

2562
02:07:58.571 --> 02:07:59.404
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're instantaneous access to </v>

2563
02:08:00.401 --> 02:08:05.140
<v Speaker 4>information and right now that </v>
<v Speaker 4>information is not entirely verifiable.</v>

2564
02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:06.093
<v Speaker 4>Like some of it is and some of it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the more disturbing </v>

2565
02:08:08.681 --> 02:08:12.760
<v Speaker 4>things about people reprinting your memo</v>
<v Speaker 4>without citations.</v>

2566
02:08:12.761 --> 02:08:13.600
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2567
02:08:14.050 --> 02:08:14.883
<v Speaker 4>like you fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you left out a big part of what this is </v>

2568
02:08:18.110 --> 02:08:19.810
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you did is really wrong.</v>

2569
02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:22.150
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those citations,</v>

2570
02:08:22.151 --> 02:08:26.080
<v Speaker 4>maybe people won't go into them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they won't read the studies.</v>

2571
02:08:26.081 --> 02:08:26.914
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they won't let me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes a long time if you really want </v>

2572
02:08:28.301 --> 02:08:29.134
<v Speaker 4>to get involved in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there will be a better version of </v>

2573
02:08:32.051 --> 02:08:34.600
<v Speaker 4>that in the future of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they will.</v>

2574
02:08:34.810 --> 02:08:35.900
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's where the,</v>

2575
02:08:35.901 --> 02:08:39.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's where the trend is.</v>

2576
02:08:39.401 --> 02:08:40.234
<v Speaker 4>I think the trend is leaning towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more honest interpretation of </v>

2577
02:08:43.601 --> 02:08:47.350
<v Speaker 4>facts and ideas and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll be left with some,</v>

2578
02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:48.653
<v Speaker 4>some things that we have to look at that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't just write off to sociology or </v>

2579
02:08:51.221 --> 02:08:56.221
<v Speaker 4>write off to culture or off to biases or</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexism or racism.</v>

2580
02:08:56.630 --> 02:09:00.040
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have to look at things </v>
<v Speaker 4>for what they really are and maybe we'll</v>

2581
02:09:00.041 --> 02:09:04.330
<v Speaker 4>have a better understanding of why we </v>
<v Speaker 4>behave the way we do,</v>

2582
02:09:04.331 --> 02:09:05.770
<v Speaker 4>why we have the problems that we have.</v>

2583
02:09:06.710 --> 02:09:07.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of the issue though is if </v>

2584
02:09:10.021 --> 02:09:15.021
<v Speaker 3>someone controls the access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and they want a certain area</v>

2585
02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:18.690
<v Speaker 3>to be told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>

2586
02:09:18.770 --> 02:09:23.770
<v Speaker 3>it'll really color what people see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's scary.</v>

2587
02:09:24.451 --> 02:09:25.284
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see this a lot on youtube now where </v>

2588
02:09:27.361 --> 02:09:28.194
<v Speaker 3>they're demonetizing anyone that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>see as right wing and no even censoring </v>

2589
02:09:32.761 --> 02:09:36.030
<v Speaker 3>and removing videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really scary.</v>

2590
02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:37.080
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2591
02:09:37.710 --> 02:09:39.660
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

2592
02:09:39.661 --> 02:09:40.381
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2593
02:09:40.381 --> 02:09:41.214
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's quite fascinating to watch it all </v>

2594
02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:45.960
<v Speaker 4>play out and to have them do it like </v>
<v Speaker 4>right in front of everybody's face.</v>

2595
02:09:45.961 --> 02:09:49.200
<v Speaker 4>And everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing like you are,</v>

2596
02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:52.380
<v Speaker 4>you're changing narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're altering information.</v>

2597
02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:57.330
<v Speaker 4>And they feel like they are right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing the right thing.</v>

2598
02:09:57.331 --> 02:09:58.164
<v Speaker 4>They're promoting diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're promoting liberal values and </v>

2599
02:10:01.801 --> 02:10:04.740
<v Speaker 4>progressive ideas and they think they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the right thing.</v>

2600
02:10:05.590 --> 02:10:07.110
<v Speaker 4>Don't necessarily think they're right </v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

2601
02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:09.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a lot of blow back though.</v>

2602
02:10:10.050 --> 02:10:11.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not free.</v>

2603
02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:14.070
<v Speaker 4>It's not free ride for Google right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>with what they've done to you.</v>

2604
02:10:14.071 --> 02:10:16.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's been,</v>

2605
02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:17.603
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they're doubling down because </v>

2606
02:10:18.961 --> 02:10:20.310
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to admit they're fucked </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

2607
02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:21.173
<v Speaker 4>If they admit they're fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody across the board loses that </v>

2608
02:10:24.510 --> 02:10:26.310
<v Speaker 4>year end bonus becomes a real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2609
02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:28.620
<v Speaker 4>Everybody gets fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if they,</v>

2610
02:10:28.621 --> 02:10:30.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2611
02:10:30.510 --> 02:10:33.210
<v Speaker 4>if you look at it long term over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>long run,</v>

2612
02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:37.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have definitely taken a hit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if someone forces them to sit down,</v>

2613
02:10:37.551 --> 02:10:41.270
<v Speaker 4>I would love to sit down with the guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>who said that you promote harmful gender</v>

2614
02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:43.330
<v Speaker 4>stereotypes and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go,</v>

2615
02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:45.950
<v Speaker 4>let's go to this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Step by step.</v>

2616
02:10:45.951 --> 02:10:48.680
<v Speaker 4>You tell me what's wrong and just pick </v>
<v Speaker 4>them apart.</v>

2617
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:52.550
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've always wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he'll fall apart 100 percent.</v>

2618
02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:56.000
<v Speaker 4>I just say a bunch of stupid social </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice warrior bullshit.</v>

2619
02:10:56.210 --> 02:10:59.120
<v Speaker 4>And if you just keep them in a room for </v>
<v Speaker 4>three hours of the microphone,</v>

2620
02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:01.940
<v Speaker 4>it's going to look like a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just no way around it.</v>

2621
02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:04.100
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way around it.</v>

2622
02:11:04.101 --> 02:11:04.934
<v Speaker 4>If you're just active,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you actually going off of what you </v>

2623
02:11:07.701 --> 02:11:08.534
<v Speaker 4>wrote to somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very not just dangerous to </v>

2624
02:11:13.281 --> 02:11:15.440
<v Speaker 4>say it promotes harmful gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>stereotypes.</v>

2625
02:11:15.710 --> 02:11:17.840
<v Speaker 4>It's disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And why?</v>

2626
02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:22.130
<v Speaker 4>The reason why it's dangerous is because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could just read what that guy said and</v>

2627
02:11:22.131 --> 02:11:24.650
<v Speaker 4>I would think that you're a creep and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's dangerous to you.</v>

2628
02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:29.570
<v Speaker 4>It's dangerous towards the marketplace </v>
<v Speaker 4>of free ideas.</v>

2629
02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:31.153
<v Speaker 4>The marketplace of ideas is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 4>important and I would think that if </v>

2630
02:11:34.881 --> 02:11:37.730
<v Speaker 4>anybody would know that it would be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are involved in tech,</v>

2631
02:11:38.450 --> 02:11:39.550
<v Speaker 4>you would think so?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2632
02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:40.393
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're just so wrapped up just </v>
<v Speaker 4>so wrapped up in the progressive </v>

2633
02:11:44.571 --> 02:11:45.404
<v Speaker 4>mindset.</v>

2634
02:11:46.030 --> 02:11:46.863
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2635
02:11:47.210 --> 02:11:50.020
<v Speaker 3>It's circulated to all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>microaggression.</v>

2636
02:11:50.620 --> 02:11:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Speech is violence and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all ideas are harmful and,</v>

2637
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:56.583
<v Speaker 3>and of course some ideas are harmful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's only through openly discussing </v>

2638
02:12:02.621 --> 02:12:03.454
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you actually dispel some of these </v>

2639
02:12:04.751 --> 02:12:07.170
<v Speaker 3>things by making them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2640
02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:11.390
<v Speaker 3>forbidding knowledge that's only going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to attract certain people and you know,</v>

2641
02:12:11.410 --> 02:12:12.243
<v Speaker 3>we even see this now worth some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube videos that are in this </v>

2642
02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:21.430
<v Speaker 3>purgatory type state where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't really get to them,</v>

2643
02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:22.953
<v Speaker 3>but if you know the url,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can still find that people are </v>

2644
02:12:26.261 --> 02:12:31.261
<v Speaker 3>getting aggregated lists of those and </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually viewing them and oh,</v>

2645
02:12:32.021 --> 02:12:34.000
<v Speaker 3>this is what youtube doesn't want us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>

2646
02:12:34.090 --> 02:12:37.330
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's some truth to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they want them to see it?</v>

2647
02:12:38.050 --> 02:12:38.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2648
02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:40.733
<v Speaker 4>If you win a certain amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you willing to buy a gold plated </v>

2649
02:12:43.471 --> 02:12:45.750
<v Speaker 4>Ferrari and drive around with a fur </v>
<v Speaker 4>coat?</v>

2650
02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:50.250
<v Speaker 4>Because I think that Kinda Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Ass crazy sunglasses,</v>

2651
02:12:51.190 --> 02:12:54.640
<v Speaker 4>a win.</v>

2652
02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I'm trying to.</v>

2653
02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean what I would ideally want and </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow changing their policies,</v>

2654
02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:03.733
<v Speaker 3>but I don't really know how I as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual can compel google to do </v>

2655
02:13:07.101 --> 02:13:07.934
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think at least some of the stuff </v>

2656
02:13:10.401 --> 02:13:14.330
<v Speaker 3>like the blacklisting where they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that,</v>

2657
02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:15.513
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compile these spreadsheets of names of </v>

2658
02:13:17.451 --> 02:13:21.860
<v Speaker 3>people that are conservative or even </v>
<v Speaker 3>Libertarian and Oh,</v>

2659
02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:22.873
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to work with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to sabotage their work and </v>

2660
02:13:24.710 --> 02:13:28.310
<v Speaker 3>we're going to try to get them fired </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they are looking for another job.</v>

2661
02:13:28.311 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 3>We're going to share this list so they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't get hired from any of the</v>

2662
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.400
<v Speaker 5>other major companies like that needs </v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

2663
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:35.310
<v Speaker 5>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2664
02:13:35.311 --> 02:13:36.290
<v Speaker 5>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you know that?</v>

2665
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:38.280
<v Speaker 5>That's real to have you seen this list </v>
<v Speaker 5>yet?</v>

2666
02:13:38.490 --> 02:13:42.690
<v Speaker 5>So there've been multiple people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>have admitted to having a blacklist.</v>

2667
02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:44.990
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I libertarian,</v>

2668
02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:48.610
<v Speaker 4>not even conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even right wing,</v>

2669
02:13:48.730 --> 02:13:51.310
<v Speaker 4>but smaller government libertarian.</v>

2670
02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:53.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just because,</v>

2671
02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:54.593
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's generally free thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people not telling the party line and </v>

2672
02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:05.160
<v Speaker 5>those people get blacklisted really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there's an actual list somewhere.</v>

2673
02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:10.360
<v Speaker 5>I think if you've seen an actual list.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't seen an individual list.</v>

2674
02:14:10.610 --> 02:14:13.210
<v Speaker 5>I think there's multiple lists spread </v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

2675
02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:18.170
<v Speaker 5>but people even like high up managers </v>
<v Speaker 5>have admitted to having a car,</v>

2676
02:14:18.370 --> 02:14:19.910
<v Speaker 5>a blacklist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2677
02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:20.853
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have brought this up to the highest </v>

2678
02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:25.930
<v Speaker 5>people at Google and they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely dismissed it,</v>

2679
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:27.790
<v Speaker 5>like we're not going to deal with it.</v>

2680
02:14:27.890 --> 02:14:28.723
<v Speaker 4>So do you feel like they feel that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have some sort of a social </v>

2681
02:14:30.831 --> 02:14:31.664
<v Speaker 4>responsibility to push progressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>values because they're in this massive </v>

2682
02:14:34.791 --> 02:14:38.210
<v Speaker 4>position of influence and they feel like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the right way to think.</v>

2683
02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:40.910
<v Speaker 4>So they're going to go full steam ahead.</v>

2684
02:14:41.790 --> 02:14:43.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And don't be evil.</v>

2685
02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:48.270
<v Speaker 5>Don't be conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty much the libertarian man.</v>

2686
02:14:48.690 --> 02:14:49.523
<v Speaker 5>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so fucking tough sell to say that Gary </v>

2687
02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:53.820
<v Speaker 5>Johnson's evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2688
02:14:55.110 --> 02:14:57.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2689
02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:00.113
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really hard to understand that </v>

2690
02:15:02.761 --> 02:15:04.840
<v Speaker 5>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2691
02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:06.133
<v Speaker 4>I get it though because I think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of the same things along the same </v>

2692
02:15:09.171 --> 02:15:12.110
<v Speaker 4>lines that you were talking about when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were saying that you didn't,</v>

2693
02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:13.273
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe you would have waited till </v>

2694
02:15:14.571 --> 02:15:19.370
<v Speaker 4>you got your year end bonus and you're a</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who is also a frugal.</v>

2695
02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:20.233
<v Speaker 4>You've saved your money and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a family to support and you're </v>

2696
02:15:23.061 --> 02:15:24.110
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2697
02:15:24.111 --> 02:15:26.350
<v Speaker 4>you got fired and you're still okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

2698
02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:28.310
<v Speaker 4>Whereas some people will be fucked right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

2699
02:15:28.311 --> 02:15:30.750
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they'd be over extended,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they have that goal,</v>

2700
02:15:30.751 --> 02:15:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Ferrari and the fur coat and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2701
02:15:33.861 --> 02:15:37.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean if I had a mortgage or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>scary,</v>

2702
02:15:37.490 --> 02:15:38.323
<v Speaker 4>that's where it gets scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of people's decision </v>

2703
02:15:39.801 --> 02:15:40.760
<v Speaker 4>making.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>

2704
02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:42.013
<v Speaker 4>that goes back to you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>engineering civilization and the early </v>

2705
02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:48.620
<v Speaker 4>days of Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there was writings about that,</v>

2706
02:15:48.621 --> 02:15:52.520
<v Speaker 4>about getting people to commit to </v>
<v Speaker 4>families and it's easier to control them</v>

2707
02:15:52.521 --> 02:15:54.830
<v Speaker 4>when they have other ones and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2708
02:15:55.190 --> 02:15:56.023
<v Speaker 4>and things that they enjoy and positions</v>
<v Speaker 4>of power and status that it's easier to </v>

2709
02:15:59.601 --> 02:16:03.200
<v Speaker 4>get those people to give into your needs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and desires.</v>

2710
02:16:03.201 --> 02:16:04.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it makes sense,</v>

2711
02:16:04.821 --> 02:16:05.654
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just engineering a </v>

2712
02:16:07.041 --> 02:16:07.874
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the like getting people to </v>

2713
02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:12.793
<v Speaker 4>perform and behave the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would like them to is a critical </v>

2714
02:16:16.071 --> 02:16:16.904
<v Speaker 4>component of engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any sort of civilization and is </v>

2715
02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:23.120
<v Speaker 4>essentially a civilization if you look </v>
<v Speaker 4>at it that way.</v>

2716
02:16:23.150 --> 02:16:25.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean internally there's a is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

2717
02:16:25.581 --> 02:16:26.414
<v Speaker 4>It's a structure and their engineering </v>
<v Speaker 4>that structured to be very a likeminded </v>

2718
02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:33.520
<v Speaker 4>ideological echo chamber</v>

2719
02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:37.550
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's really going to bite </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in the back at some point,</v>

2720
02:16:37.570 --> 02:16:42.570
<v Speaker 3>like they're making the easy decision of</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really facing the,</v>

2721
02:16:44.570 --> 02:16:46.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth as I see it.</v>

2722
02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:49.760
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you turn your back on that for too,</v>

2723
02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:50.773
<v Speaker 3>too long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really going to have negative </v>

2724
02:16:52.941 --> 02:16:54.020
<v Speaker 3>consequences later.</v>

2725
02:16:54.310 --> 02:16:55.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I,</v>

2726
02:16:55.971 --> 02:16:58.630
<v Speaker 4>I feel like one thing it's super </v>
<v Speaker 4>important to point out,</v>

2727
02:16:58.631 --> 02:17:02.290
<v Speaker 4>I think we kind of already did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but women do experience a lot of sexism.</v>

2728
02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:03.520
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because like I said,</v>

2729
02:17:03.550 --> 02:17:04.960
<v Speaker 4>men are gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2730
02:17:05.010 --> 02:17:10.010
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of gross men and men </v>
<v Speaker 4>working in close proximity with women.</v>

2731
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:11.783
<v Speaker 4>I mean men working with other men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to find things they don't </v>

2732
02:17:14.381 --> 02:17:15.760
<v Speaker 4>like about those men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2733
02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:17.033
<v Speaker 4>I mean people have interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships are fucking gross and </v>

2734
02:17:19.541 --> 02:17:20.374
<v Speaker 4>messy and if men work with women and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel like they can dominate them </v>

2735
02:17:23.741 --> 02:17:24.574
<v Speaker 4>with aggression or with some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird tactics that play on the </v>

2736
02:17:29.111 --> 02:17:32.360
<v Speaker 4>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>females tend to have the,</v>

2737
02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:33.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2738
02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.340
<v Speaker 4>it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think by not looking at it that by</v>

2739
02:17:36.341 --> 02:17:40.330
<v Speaker 4>not being honest about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do just as much as of a disservice.</v>

2740
02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:41.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although,</v>

2741
02:17:41.570 --> 02:17:42.403
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that there are men that are </v>

2742
02:17:44.321 --> 02:17:47.630
<v Speaker 3>just as agreeable and just as much of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushover say yeah,</v>

2743
02:17:47.631 --> 02:17:48.464
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they also get a Shandan aside and </v>

2744
02:17:53.441 --> 02:17:54.274
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's even worse for men that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fit that stereotype or don't fit the </v>

2745
02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:01.030
<v Speaker 3>typical male stereotype because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2746
02:18:01.031 --> 02:18:01.864
<v Speaker 3>there's negative consequences on both </v>
<v Speaker 3>sides for not being masculine if you're </v>

2747
02:18:06.101 --> 02:18:09.280
<v Speaker 3>a man or not being feminine enough if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a woman.</v>

2748
02:18:09.510 --> 02:18:10.343
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not allowed to just be </v>

2749
02:18:11.461 --> 02:18:12.360
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2750
02:18:12.361 --> 02:18:14.670
<v Speaker 4>You have to like fit why you're better </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

2751
02:18:14.671 --> 02:18:16.680
<v Speaker 4>You fit into some sort of a classic </v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative.</v>

2752
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:20.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So where do you go from here?</v>

2753
02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Besides sue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the form of Google.</v>

2754
02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:23.753
<v Speaker 4>Google.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just give them some money to shut him </v>

2755
02:18:25.111 --> 02:18:25.944
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to go through with a </v>

2756
02:18:27.301 --> 02:18:28.134
<v Speaker 4>lawsuit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what if they came to you with a </v>

2757
02:18:28.561 --> 02:18:29.394
<v Speaker 4>settlement?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you just take it and shut your </v>

2758
02:18:29.971 --> 02:18:30.780
<v Speaker 4>mouth?</v>

2759
02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:31.613
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really want somehow for them to </v>

2760
02:18:33.911 --> 02:18:36.280
<v Speaker 3>address it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how to do</v>

2761
02:18:37.170 --> 02:18:38.370
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if they,</v>

2762
02:18:38.371 --> 02:18:40.560
<v Speaker 4>if you lose in court,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will they address it?</v>

2763
02:18:40.561 --> 02:18:41.800
<v Speaker 4>They'll probably say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2764
02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:42.673
<v Speaker 4>although we support the court,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we disagree with the rulings and we </v>

2765
02:18:44.251 --> 02:18:48.790
<v Speaker 4>still support gender equality and yet,</v>

2766
02:18:49.430 --> 02:18:50.263
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of it is that there is </v>

2767
02:18:51.111 --> 02:18:51.944
<v Speaker 3>currently an asymmetry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe Google is acting in their best </v>

2768
02:18:54.291 --> 02:18:58.370
<v Speaker 3>interest to act the way that they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they think that,</v>

2769
02:18:58.610 --> 02:18:59.443
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these activists that are </v>

2770
02:19:00.291 --> 02:19:05.291
<v Speaker 3>trying to attack Google that only if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't fit this summer.</v>

2771
02:19:05.550 --> 02:19:08.030
<v Speaker 4>Are there a lot of activists that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacking Google in that regard?</v>

2772
02:19:08.130 --> 02:19:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2773
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.863
<v Speaker 3>we even see that there's now a potential</v>
<v Speaker 3>class action lawsuit against Google </v>

2774
02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:16.013
<v Speaker 3>about war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gender pay disparity and so like they </v>

2775
02:19:19.921 --> 02:19:20.754
<v Speaker 3>just are looking for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if we say that if there's only </v>

2776
02:19:25.201 --> 02:19:26.034
<v Speaker 3>incentive coming from one side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then only going to push farther and </v>

2777
02:19:28.221 --> 02:19:29.054
<v Speaker 3>farther to that side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this gender pay disparity is just </v>

2778
02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:37.900
<v Speaker 3>involving similar jobs yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they claim that it's the same job.</v>

2779
02:19:38.391 --> 02:19:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Although at least when Google was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own internal analysis,</v>

2780
02:19:42.681 --> 02:19:47.330
<v Speaker 3>which they've been doing for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they show that there's no disparity once</v>

2781
02:19:47.331 --> 02:19:52.331
<v Speaker 3>you control for pay for performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's really unclear and,</v>

2782
02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:59.260
<v Speaker 4>but you control for performance </v>
<v Speaker 4>performance tends to favor</v>

2783
02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:01.290
<v Speaker 3>males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I if,</v>

2784
02:20:01.530 --> 02:20:02.363
<v Speaker 3>if that's what they're showing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is some sort of gender </v>

2785
02:20:04.351 --> 02:20:05.790
<v Speaker 3>disparity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just look at aggregate,</v>

2786
02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:08.880
<v Speaker 4>look at this one in $100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million chance,</v>

2787
02:20:08.881 --> 02:20:12.270
<v Speaker 4>alleged gender pay gap at Google is </v>
<v Speaker 4>random.</v>

2788
02:20:12.450 --> 02:20:13.283
<v Speaker 4>Says class action lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus class action lawyer says that </v>

2789
02:20:16.981 --> 02:20:21.450
<v Speaker 4>in the article is written by a chick </v>
<v Speaker 4>fake fake news.</v>

2790
02:20:21.451 --> 02:20:22.920
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fucks.</v>

2791
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:26.710
<v Speaker 3>I think one thing is I don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they really have Google's internal data,</v>

2792
02:20:26.711 --> 02:20:30.880
<v Speaker 3>so there's no way for them to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's based on performance</v>

2793
02:20:31.450 --> 02:20:32.950
<v Speaker 3>liquid there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're saying here,</v>

2794
02:20:33.250 --> 02:20:34.083
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2795
02:20:36.010 --> 02:20:41.010
<v Speaker 4>notices seeking women currently or </v>
<v Speaker 4>formerly employed at Google for possible</v>

2796
02:20:41.351 --> 02:20:44.460
<v Speaker 4>inclusion in a planned class action </v>
<v Speaker 4>lawsuit.</v>

2797
02:20:44.500 --> 02:20:46.660
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people hear that and they're like,</v>

2798
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:48.560
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2799
02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:50.710
<v Speaker 4>go Sizzla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2800
02:20:51.340 --> 02:20:52.173
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just.</v>

2801
02:20:52.390 --> 02:20:53.223
<v Speaker 4>You're playing on human instincts when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you seek out people that may have been </v>

2802
02:20:57.341 --> 02:21:00.910
<v Speaker 4>employed for a possible inclusion in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>class action lawsuit.</v>

2803
02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:03.670
<v Speaker 4>That's not saying that they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>wronged because I don't obviously,</v>

2804
02:21:03.671 --> 02:21:04.504
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>several dozen came forward in a matter </v>

2805
02:21:06.641 --> 02:21:07.474
<v Speaker 4>of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty high level of </v>

2806
02:21:08.501 --> 02:21:10.990
<v Speaker 4>dissatisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Says James Feinberg.</v>

2807
02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:11.980
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

2808
02:21:12.430 --> 02:21:13.263
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's fucking thousands of people </v>

2809
02:21:14.471 --> 02:21:16.990
<v Speaker 4>who've worked there and a couple dozen </v>
<v Speaker 4>came forward.</v>

2810
02:21:17.170 --> 02:21:18.003
<v Speaker 4>That's not a high level of satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many people have been employed at </v>

2811
02:21:20.291 --> 02:21:25.030
<v Speaker 4>Google that are no longer employed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably tens of thousands,</v>

2812
02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:25.770
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2813
02:21:25.770 --> 02:21:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's 70,000</v>

2814
02:21:27.331 --> 02:21:27.940
<v Speaker 3>people here.</v>

2815
02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:29.860
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so for this guy to say,</v>

2816
02:21:29.861 --> 02:21:34.660
<v Speaker 4>that's a pretty high level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dissatisfaction when several dozen,</v>

2817
02:21:34.690 --> 02:21:37.270
<v Speaker 4>let's say three dozen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go crazy.</v>

2818
02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:39.910
<v Speaker 4>Let's say it's 40 people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's get nuts.</v>

2819
02:21:40.270 --> 02:21:43.210
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking nobody man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2820
02:21:43.211 --> 02:21:45.820
<v Speaker 4>70 women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's biggest heard from.</v>

2821
02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:49.930
<v Speaker 4>But wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurt from it doesn't mean they might not</v>

2822
02:21:49.931 --> 02:21:54.931
<v Speaker 4>even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might not be a case for four people</v>

2823
02:21:57.520 --> 02:21:59.890
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a lot.</v>

2824
02:21:59.891 --> 02:22:03.250
<v Speaker 4>You fuck the class action.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's just.</v>

2825
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:04.383
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a fucking ambulance chaser </v>

2826
02:22:06.130 --> 02:22:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Chaser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2827
02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:08.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying he's wrong,</v>

2828
02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:12.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying there's not sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>discrimination,</v>

2829
02:22:12.101 --> 02:22:14.630
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these articles are sneaky as fuck shock</v>

2830
02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.400
<v Speaker 3>for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got four people and I don't know how</v>

2831
02:22:17.401 --> 02:22:18.234
<v Speaker 3>an individual would know whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're paid differently just based on </v>

2832
02:22:22.501 --> 02:22:23.281
<v Speaker 3>their sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2833
02:22:23.281 --> 02:22:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Because there's so many variables at </v>
<v Speaker 3>play,</v>

2834
02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:26.153
<v Speaker 3>so you really have to look at the system</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a whole because I mean there are </v>

2835
02:22:30.301 --> 02:22:31.134
<v Speaker 3>definitely some men that are paid less </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the women too for performance was </v>

2836
02:22:34.951 --> 02:22:35.550
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2837
02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:37.440
<v Speaker 4>The problem is when you control for </v>
<v Speaker 4>performance,</v>

2838
02:22:37.441 --> 02:22:38.274
<v Speaker 4>if it turns out that men are being paid </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than you have to figure out some </v>

2839
02:22:41.281 --> 02:22:44.000
<v Speaker 4>sort of a way to justify that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you know,</v>

2840
02:22:44.030 --> 02:22:48.570
<v Speaker 4>like if men are being paid more when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>control for performance,</v>

2841
02:22:49.140 --> 02:22:52.050
<v Speaker 4>what is it that's causing the men to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>paid more?</v>

2842
02:22:52.051 --> 02:22:52.884
<v Speaker 4>Why are they performing better because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the environment they feel more </v>

2843
02:22:55.171 --> 02:22:58.020
<v Speaker 4>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it lack of suppression that the women</v>

2844
02:22:58.021 --> 02:22:58.854
<v Speaker 4>experience like.</v>

2845
02:22:59.390 --> 02:23:00.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess when you look at the </v>

2846
02:23:02.011 --> 02:23:02.844
<v Speaker 3>nationwide gender gap in pay where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know even Obama has said seventy seven </v>

2847
02:23:07.020 --> 02:23:08.280
<v Speaker 3>cents per dollar is too little.</v>

2848
02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a silly person.</v>

2849
02:23:10.171 --> 02:23:11.840
<v Speaker 4>Like I shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he,</v>

2850
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:14.130
<v Speaker 4>he knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when Obama said that,</v>

2851
02:23:14.131 --> 02:23:14.964
<v Speaker 4>he knows that that's not being honest </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're talking about completely </v>

2852
02:23:18.091 --> 02:23:21.060
<v Speaker 4>different jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different choices for people don't know.</v>

2853
02:23:21.090 --> 02:23:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just break that down real quick.</v>

2854
02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:23.513
<v Speaker 4>This thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people repeated ad nauseum and </v>

2855
02:23:25.351 --> 02:23:26.184
<v Speaker 4>it's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The gender pay gap of seventy seven </v>

2856
02:23:29.610 --> 02:23:33.930
<v Speaker 4>cents to a dollar that a male makes is </v>
<v Speaker 4>based on the choices that people make as</v>

2857
02:23:33.931 --> 02:23:34.764
<v Speaker 4>far as like what they do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's based on the amount of hours that </v>

2858
02:23:37.921 --> 02:23:40.080
<v Speaker 4>they work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men tend to work longer hours.</v>

2859
02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:42.300
<v Speaker 4>Women tend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if they get pregnant.</v>

2860
02:23:42.570 --> 02:23:46.500
<v Speaker 4>All those things are factored in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where you get seventy seven cents</v>

2861
02:23:46.650 --> 02:23:49.200
<v Speaker 4>on average for the dollar that the male </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes.</v>

2862
02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:50.333
<v Speaker 4>What it implies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is where it's disingenuous </v>

2863
02:23:52.170 --> 02:23:53.003
<v Speaker 4>because it two people working side by </v>
<v Speaker 4>side doing the same job and the males </v>

2864
02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:59.760
<v Speaker 4>getting 77 more a dollar for the woman's</v>
<v Speaker 4>seventy seven cents.</v>

2865
02:23:59.850 --> 02:24:03.270
<v Speaker 4>That's not what the gender pay gap </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually means.</v>

2866
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:04.583
<v Speaker 4>And if Google is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone is saying if there's a </v>

2867
02:24:08.071 --> 02:24:08.904
<v Speaker 4>lawsuit that's saying that a man and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman are doing the exact same job with </v>

2868
02:24:12.601 --> 02:24:13.434
<v Speaker 4>the exact same performance and the woman</v>
<v Speaker 4>is only getting seventy seven cents on </v>

2869
02:24:17.041 --> 02:24:18.750
<v Speaker 4>the dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you got a real issue.</v>

2870
02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:19.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2871
02:24:19.170 --> 02:24:24.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's often or that you know,</v>

2872
02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:28.560
<v Speaker 3>there's different hours worked and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't even have to be that,</v>

2873
02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:29.553
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they work twice as many or 30 percent </v>

2874
02:24:31.651 --> 02:24:36.570
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sometimes if you just work 44 hours</v>

2875
02:24:36.571 --> 02:24:40.860
<v Speaker 3>a week versus 34 hours or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's a huge,</v>

2876
02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:42.410
<v Speaker 3>a pay disparity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2877
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:45.270
<v Speaker 3>And that's irrespective of what gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have.</v>

2878
02:24:45.330 --> 02:24:48.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially at Google,</v>

2879
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:51.560
<v Speaker 3>there was so much time that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2880
02:24:51.570 --> 02:24:54.900
<v Speaker 3>replying to email and doing some base </v>
<v Speaker 3>level stuff,</v>

2881
02:24:54.901 --> 02:24:55.734
<v Speaker 3>going to meetings and then you only had </v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit that was actually creative </v>

2882
02:24:58.921 --> 02:25:01.560
<v Speaker 3>and providing value to the company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

2883
02:25:01.890 --> 02:25:02.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was really inefficient in that </v>

2884
02:25:03.751 --> 02:25:04.584
<v Speaker 3>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2885
02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:08.670
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's similar in a lot of companies do so</v>

2886
02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:10.830
<v Speaker 3>and that creates some of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2887
02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:13.190
<v Speaker 3>nonlinear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2888
02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:18.200
<v Speaker 3>benefits of working just a little more </v>
<v Speaker 3>per week and you know,</v>

2889
02:25:18.290 --> 02:25:19.123
<v Speaker 3>we see this a lot in silicon valley </v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's a lot of people right out </v>

2890
02:25:22.081 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 3>of college and they're willing to work</v>

2891
02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:26.350
<v Speaker 5>a ton of time especially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2892
02:25:26.351 --> 02:25:29.660
<v Speaker 5>you can essentially live at Google.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's not,</v>

2893
02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:30.461
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2894
02:25:30.461 --> 02:25:32.560
<v Speaker 5>there's free food everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's showers,</v>

2895
02:25:32.561 --> 02:25:34.450
<v Speaker 5>there's a gem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The beds,</v>

2896
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:37.390
<v Speaker 5>there is nap pods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pods,</v>

2897
02:25:37.410 --> 02:25:38.650
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2898
02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:39.730
<v Speaker 5>Are they closed off?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She can,</v>

2899
02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:42.010
<v Speaker 5>can't hear anything out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But can you actually step in there?</v>

2900
02:25:42.011 --> 02:25:42.844
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't really sleep in there just </v>

2901
02:25:44.111 --> 02:25:46.570
<v Speaker 5>because I'm too tall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but most people,</v>

2902
02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:49.450
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can sleep in there because some they</v>

2903
02:25:49.451 --> 02:25:51.790
<v Speaker 5>like close it off and you could just lay</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2904
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.983
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there a term for a being being </v>

2905
02:25:55.751 --> 02:25:58.930
<v Speaker 5>discriminary discriminatory towards tall</v>
<v Speaker 5>people?</v>

2906
02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:01.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tallest.</v>

2907
02:26:01.810 --> 02:26:02.870
<v Speaker 5>Hightest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2908
02:26:02.871 --> 02:26:04.270
<v Speaker 5>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's able lists,</v>

2909
02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:05.253
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a few mock people that aren't </v>

2910
02:26:06.641 --> 02:26:08.440
<v Speaker 5>able to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You become an herbalist.</v>

2911
02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:11.830
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely a movement now of </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking into.</v>

2912
02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:12.753
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe tell people have some advantages </v>

2913
02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:15.153
<v Speaker 5>because we see that a lot of ceos are </v>
<v Speaker 5>over six feet tall and it's not clear </v>

2914
02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:20.260
<v Speaker 5>why exactly that is.</v>

2915
02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:21.483
<v Speaker 5>I knew you really have to control for </v>
<v Speaker 5>every aspect because there is no </v>

2916
02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:27.550
<v Speaker 5>correlation between height and </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligence,</v>

2917
02:26:27.970 --> 02:26:30.130
<v Speaker 5>but it's likely not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2918
02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:31.193
<v Speaker 5>but what I'm saying is like they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>discriminating against you with the </v>

2919
02:26:32.861 --> 02:26:34.850
<v Speaker 5>pots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hook your fucking seven,</v>

2920
02:26:35.130 --> 02:26:36.040
<v Speaker 5>like six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four,</v>

2921
02:26:36.130 --> 02:26:36.963
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three hook you up with a six for pod </v>

2922
02:26:38.951 --> 02:26:39.784
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can stretch your legs out and get a </v>

2923
02:26:41.291 --> 02:26:42.124
<v Speaker 5>good nap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it'd be more productive at a job </v>

2924
02:26:43.571 --> 02:26:44.404
<v Speaker 5>you don't work out anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess I just never really felt like </v>

2925
02:26:47.261 --> 02:26:49.240
<v Speaker 5>complaining too much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good for you.</v>

2926
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:50.740
<v Speaker 5>Except for that one thing.</v>

2927
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:55.060
<v Speaker 5>One thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2928
02:26:55.061 --> 02:26:55.894
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you trying to seek other employment </v>

2929
02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:00.970
<v Speaker 5>or are you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2930
02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:02.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm still looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2931
02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:06.040
<v Speaker 5>what exactly I want to do because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>never was,</v>

2932
02:27:06.690 --> 02:27:08.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coding wasn't the thing that I was doing</v>

2933
02:27:08.441 --> 02:27:10.600
<v Speaker 5>my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what your education is in?</v>

2934
02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:13.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I was doing physics and biology,</v>

2935
02:27:14.050 --> 02:27:14.883
<v Speaker 5>random mass stuff and I just picked up </v>
<v Speaker 5>some algorithm books and they seemed </v>

2936
02:27:20.221 --> 02:27:21.054
<v Speaker 5>really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I started doing some coding </v>

2937
02:27:22.481 --> 02:27:27.340
<v Speaker 5>competitions and I did well enough that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Google just like randomly contacted me.</v>

2938
02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:28.750
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How weird.</v>

2939
02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:31.210
<v Speaker 5>And especially since you're a white </v>
<v Speaker 5>male,</v>

2940
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:37.420
<v Speaker 5>back in the day before they figured out </v>
<v Speaker 5>discriminate here,</v>

2941
02:27:37.450 --> 02:27:40.810
<v Speaker 5>this was all online then I had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>username so maybe they didn't know.</v>

2942
02:27:41.370 --> 02:27:42.910
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>

2943
02:27:43.090 --> 02:27:46.960
<v Speaker 5>So they contacted you and offering you </v>
<v Speaker 5>employment based on your coding skills?</v>

2944
02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:48.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's weird.</v>

2945
02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:49.953
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's cool.</v>

2946
02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:50.973
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2947
02:27:51.310 --> 02:27:53.650
<v Speaker 5>so now you're just trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the next.</v>

2948
02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:55.060
<v Speaker 5>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty eight.</v>

2949
02:27:55.210 --> 02:27:56.043
<v Speaker 5>So he's telling you very young man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to figure out what the path is </v>

2950
02:27:58.530 --> 02:27:59.363
<v Speaker 5>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

2951
02:28:00.190 --> 02:28:02.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're leaning one way or another,</v>

2952
02:28:03.130 --> 02:28:05.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something that uses my brain,</v>

2953
02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:07.030
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that'd be nice.</v>

2954
02:28:09.130 --> 02:28:13.750
<v Speaker 5>Something outside of tech maybe or what </v>
<v Speaker 5>navy or I still feel like,</v>

2955
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:14.623
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tech in general is or the future and </v>

2956
02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:20.500
<v Speaker 5>will have huge impact on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So something related to tech,</v>

2957
02:28:20.501 --> 02:28:25.501
<v Speaker 5>but maybe not coding all day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I really don't know because,</v>

2958
02:28:25.710 --> 02:28:26.543
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of the major silicon valley jobs </v>

2959
02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:31.040
<v Speaker 5>probably a blacklisted me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2960
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:32.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2961
02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:35.370
<v Speaker 5>That's unfortunate man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2962
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:37.430
<v Speaker 5>because like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've read your memo.</v>

2963
02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:41.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you did anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you did.</v>

2964
02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:42.193
<v Speaker 5>You took a bold choice and a bold stance</v>
<v Speaker 5>to talk about something that's </v>

2965
02:28:47.271 --> 02:28:49.670
<v Speaker 5>essentially taboo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you did it with science,</v>

2966
02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:51.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you did it.</v>

2967
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:54.170
<v Speaker 5>It didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't a very reasonable manner.</v>

2968
02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:54.921
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm,</v>

2969
02:28:54.921 --> 02:28:58.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm shocked at the reaction has been as </v>
<v Speaker 5>extreme as it's been,</v>

2970
02:28:59.450 --> 02:29:01.270
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not shocked at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2971
02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:03.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's predictable almost.</v>

2972
02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:06.050
<v Speaker 5>And the people calling you a massage </v>
<v Speaker 5>nest.</v>

2973
02:29:06.150 --> 02:29:11.150
<v Speaker 5>It was very weird and CEO of youtube </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying it hurt her to read that,</v>

2974
02:29:11.350 --> 02:29:16.250
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have a real life yet.</v>

2975
02:29:16.390 --> 02:29:17.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought that,</v>

2976
02:29:17.780 --> 02:29:18.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first,</v>

2977
02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:19.753
<v Speaker 5>the intro which talked about all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>political biases and how our culture </v>

2978
02:29:23.331 --> 02:29:25.730
<v Speaker 5>shames people that give a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>view.</v>

2979
02:29:25.731 --> 02:29:28.250
<v Speaker 5>I thought that might have shown that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2980
02:29:28.251 --> 02:29:31.300
<v Speaker 5>maybe we shouldn't be doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2981
02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:34.820
<v Speaker 5>predicted exactly what happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think very few people actually read it</v>

2982
02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:36.140
<v Speaker 5>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2983
02:29:36.140 --> 02:29:38.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially like globally,</v>

2984
02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:40.520
<v Speaker 5>very few people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very bad.</v>

2985
02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:41.480
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2986
02:29:41.570 --> 02:29:42.403
<v Speaker 5>the responses to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a very click baity and people go with </v>

2987
02:29:44.721 --> 02:29:49.721
<v Speaker 5>whatever the titles of the articles that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are criticizing you and just accept that</v>

2988
02:29:49.941 --> 02:29:51.120
<v Speaker 5>as Gospel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2989
02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:53.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've gotten a lot of responses that were</v>

2990
02:29:53.961 --> 02:29:54.920
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2991
02:29:54.921 --> 02:29:56.210
<v Speaker 5>I saw it on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2992
02:29:56.211 --> 02:29:57.470
<v Speaker 5>some sexist memo.</v>

2993
02:29:58.250 --> 02:30:02.720
<v Speaker 5>And it was only after they saw that so </v>
<v Speaker 5>many times and they decided to read it,</v>

2994
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:05.330
<v Speaker 5>but they finally were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>

2995
02:30:05.331 --> 02:30:06.860
<v Speaker 5>it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2996
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:08.990
<v Speaker 5>I urge people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have the time,</v>

2997
02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:10.693
<v Speaker 5>just please just read it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just go over it and try to figure out </v>

2998
02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:18.560
<v Speaker 5>where it all went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad you did it though,</v>

2999
02:30:18.561 --> 02:30:19.071
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3000
02:30:19.071 --> 02:30:23.000
<v Speaker 5>it's a really interesting point of </v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion and I hope this lawsuit works</v>

3001
02:30:23.001 --> 02:30:23.834
<v Speaker 5>out well for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I helped Google just come to their </v>

3002
02:30:25.641 --> 02:30:27.590
<v Speaker 5>senses and I don't think that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>happen,</v>

3003
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:30.110
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you predict?</v>

3004
02:30:30.111 --> 02:30:30.980
<v Speaker 5>What do you think's going to happen?</v>

3005
02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:33.993
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that people now are aware of </v>

3006
02:30:37.611 --> 02:30:38.444
<v Speaker 5>this a lot more and there may be </v>
<v Speaker 5>platforms that emerge that are sort of </v>

3007
02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:44.293
<v Speaker 5>all tech is what they're calling it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just alternative technology that's more </v>

3008
02:30:48.021 --> 02:30:52.930
<v Speaker 5>open to just free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But unfortunately they're currently just</v>

3009
02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:56.560
<v Speaker 5>being labeled as white supremacist sites</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

3010
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:58.670
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3011
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:59.623
<v Speaker 5>hopefully people can see through that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they have the time to </v>

3012
02:31:03.741 --> 02:31:05.540
<v Speaker 5>even look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>

3013
02:31:05.541 --> 02:31:06.374
<v Speaker 5>It's just like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're taking everyone's word for </v>

3014
02:31:08.511 --> 02:31:11.630
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very odd time,</v>

3015
02:31:11.780 --> 02:31:14.960
<v Speaker 5>but there's enough people discussing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3016
02:31:14.961 --> 02:31:16.700
<v Speaker 5>and I think your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3017
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.863
<v Speaker 5>the response to your memo has been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been very enlightening for some </v>

3018
02:31:22.171 --> 02:31:23.004
<v Speaker 5>people from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a sort of a psychological </v>

3019
02:31:25.741 --> 02:31:26.960
<v Speaker 5>standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>

3020
02:31:26.961 --> 02:31:30.630
<v Speaker 5>what are the reactions that people have </v>
<v Speaker 5>and why do they have these reactions and</v>

3021
02:31:30.631 --> 02:31:31.464
<v Speaker 5>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does it say about us as human </v>

3022
02:31:32.641 --> 02:31:37.641
<v Speaker 5>beings at this is such a taboo subject </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we can't even address the very real</v>

3023
02:31:38.221 --> 02:31:41.040
<v Speaker 5>differences that we have as unique </v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals.</v>

3024
02:31:41.130 --> 02:31:45.600
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm at least happy that it didn't happen</v>

3025
02:31:45.601 --> 02:31:46.434
<v Speaker 5>during a college season is then there'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>be like protests and people burning my </v>

3026
02:31:51.091 --> 02:31:51.924
<v Speaker 5>fig years and things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think it would have been a much </v>

3027
02:31:54.331 --> 02:31:57.240
<v Speaker 5>more negative if it was during the </v>
<v Speaker 5>school year.</v>

3028
02:31:57.330 --> 02:32:00.960
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they would demand that their school,</v>

3029
02:32:01.410 --> 02:32:05.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>double down on diversity and just all of</v>

3030
02:32:05.490 --> 02:32:06.900
<v Speaker 5>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

3031
02:32:06.901 --> 02:32:07.734
<v Speaker 5>a lot of virtue signaling going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's at least it's nice to see some of </v>

3032
02:32:14.131 --> 02:32:19.131
<v Speaker 5>the colleges have been standing up for </v>
<v Speaker 5>it or against it and you know,</v>

3033
02:32:19.410 --> 02:32:20.243
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3034
02:32:20.280 --> 02:32:22.260
<v Speaker 5>you can't really just tell us what to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

3035
02:32:22.261 --> 02:32:25.280
<v Speaker 5>And we believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3036
02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:30.500
<v Speaker 5>knowledge and actually seeking the truth</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not just criticizing people based on</v>

3037
02:32:30.841 --> 02:32:33.900
<v Speaker 5>their political ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3038
02:32:34.540 --> 02:32:36.300
<v Speaker 5>it's a long slog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My friend.</v>

3039
02:32:36.610 --> 02:32:37.443
<v Speaker 5>It was a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of walking and talking and going </v>

3040
02:32:38.671 --> 02:32:39.720
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

3041
02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:41.153
<v Speaker 5>I think it will be fun.</v>

3042
02:32:41.250 --> 02:32:42.083
<v Speaker 5>I hope I hope will be fine if we don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>go to war with North Korea and get </v>

3043
02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.160
<v Speaker 5>smashed by 100 fucking hurricanes in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>row.</v>

3044
02:32:47.860 --> 02:32:48.693
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think we should just got to tweak </v>

3045
02:32:54.421 --> 02:32:55.770
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a bad ass in chess.</v>

3046
02:32:57.060 --> 02:32:58.560
<v Speaker 5>Chess master.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3047
02:32:58.561 --> 02:33:00.330
<v Speaker 5>I played a lot of just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3048
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:03.990
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was my life for a few years.</v>

3049
02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:06.450
<v Speaker 5>Can you play chess in your head?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3050
02:33:06.800 --> 02:33:07.920
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fascinating.</v>

3051
02:33:07.921 --> 02:33:11.670
<v Speaker 5>I used to play chess in my head against </v>
<v Speaker 5>like for different people.</v>

3052
02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:14.970
<v Speaker 5>So like blindfolded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

3053
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.863
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew this kid who was a chess master </v>

3054
02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:22.830
<v Speaker 5>and a pool hall that he used to go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he used to play with this ex con and</v>

3055
02:33:22.831 --> 02:33:25.290
<v Speaker 5>the ex con learned how to do chest and </v>
<v Speaker 5>prison,</v>

3056
02:33:25.570 --> 02:33:26.403
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in his head with no pieces and him and </v>

3057
02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:31.800
<v Speaker 5>this kid would just sit there and play </v>
<v Speaker 5>chess back and forth with each other.</v>

3058
02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:36.030
<v Speaker 5>Now what are you guys doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you know where the board is?</v>

3059
02:33:36.450 --> 02:33:39.750
<v Speaker 5>You could play it blindfolded with four </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in your head.</v>

3060
02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:40.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3061
02:33:40.831 --> 02:33:43.560
<v Speaker 5>That's intense man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How'd you learn how to do that?</v>

3062
02:33:43.710 --> 02:33:46.160
<v Speaker 5>Just repetition over time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3063
02:33:46.180 --> 02:33:48.810
<v Speaker 5>doing it a lot and just obsessing over </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3064
02:33:49.050 --> 02:33:49.883
<v Speaker 5>And this is actually one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>differences on average between men and </v>

3065
02:33:53.581 --> 02:33:54.414
<v Speaker 5>women is there are more men that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>just become obsessed with these systems </v>

3066
02:33:58.260 --> 02:33:59.010
<v Speaker 5>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3067
02:33:59.010 --> 02:34:00.000
<v Speaker 5>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The gathering,</v>

3068
02:34:00.001 --> 02:34:03.300
<v Speaker 5>the card game was also something that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>became super obsessed with.</v>

3069
02:34:03.870 --> 02:34:04.703
<v Speaker 5>And so the way that people approach </v>
<v Speaker 5>computers too is different where you </v>

3070
02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:11.250
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some are a lot of boys just approach the</v>

3071
02:34:11.251 --> 02:34:12.084
<v Speaker 5>computer as a toy and they become </v>
<v Speaker 5>obsessed with tinkering with the </v>

3072
02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:18.250
<v Speaker 5>computer while a lot girls see it as</v>

3073
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:19.383
<v Speaker 3>a tool for improving the world and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they may not be interested in the </v>

3074
02:34:23.921 --> 02:34:24.754
<v Speaker 3>computer as an end to itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of the education programs </v>

3075
02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:33.400
<v Speaker 3>to get more women into tech are actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>addressing that.</v>

3076
02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:39.180
<v Speaker 3>But it's unclear because so much of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>coding is just,</v>

3077
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:40.743
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing server code and this server is </v>

3078
02:34:43.361 --> 02:34:44.194
<v Speaker 3>going to go talk to this server which is</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to that server and it's totally </v>

3079
02:34:47.081 --> 02:34:50.920
<v Speaker 3>unconnected to actual people and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3080
02:34:50.921 --> 02:34:55.921
<v Speaker 3>that's why we actually see more women in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front end and use your experience,</v>

3081
02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:56.823
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineering positions because it's more </v>

3082
02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:00.573
<v Speaker 3>interactive with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the numbers with women in </v>

3083
02:35:02.291 --> 02:35:03.910
<v Speaker 3>chess?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3084
02:35:03.911 --> 02:35:06.130
<v Speaker 3>there aren't that many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's unfortunate.</v>

3085
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it unfortunate because it's just,</v>

3086
02:35:10.780 --> 02:35:11.850
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3087
02:35:11.851 --> 02:35:12.684
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't play chess is that </v>

3088
02:35:13.271 --> 02:35:14.104
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is it unfortunate that women are </v>

3089
02:35:17.621 --> 02:35:18.640
<v Speaker 1>underrepresented?</v>

3090
02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:19.993
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just for the cases of maybe they feel </v>

3091
02:35:22.551 --> 02:35:23.384
<v Speaker 3>like a minority and you a right and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of the mistreatment of women is not </v>

3092
02:35:31.790 --> 02:35:34.730
<v Speaker 3>ill intentioned men that want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist against men.</v>

3093
02:35:34.731 --> 02:35:37.340
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I and I felt this a lot and you know,</v>

3094
02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:42.110
<v Speaker 3>everyone wants a girl to play chess or </v>
<v Speaker 3>play magic.</v>

3095
02:35:42.111 --> 02:35:42.944
<v Speaker 3>The gathering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that that's their ideal </v>

3096
02:35:45.051 --> 02:35:48.020
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3097
02:35:48.830 --> 02:35:51.470
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're all nerdy guys are generally</v>

3098
02:35:51.471 --> 02:35:54.860
<v Speaker 3>and they don't have as good social </v>
<v Speaker 3>skills as the average population.</v>

3099
02:35:54.861 --> 02:35:55.694
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty similar to the people </v>

3100
02:35:56.871 --> 02:36:01.871
<v Speaker 3>playing or a writing code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a similar situation so they just</v>

3101
02:36:02.421 --> 02:36:06.500
<v Speaker 3>don't know how to interact with women </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that causes some problems.</v>

3102
02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:08.873
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not the just overt sexism </v>

3103
02:36:13.491 --> 02:36:14.324
<v Speaker 3>against women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more just we don't really know how </v>

3104
02:36:17.151 --> 02:36:19.370
<v Speaker 3>to interact with women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just,</v>

3105
02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:22.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're obsessed with jazz or whatever and</v>

3106
02:36:22.820 --> 02:36:23.653
<v Speaker 3>we just like talking about chess and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of women that just </v>

3107
02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:30.920
<v Speaker 3>aren't as obsessed with these sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>

3108
02:36:32.300 --> 02:36:36.080
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean that's not a bad thing,</v>

3109
02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:37.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just is what it is.</v>

3110
02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3111
02:36:39.270 --> 02:36:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a bunch of fashion </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and aesthetics thing,</v>

3112
02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:44.313
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic things and design things that </v>

3113
02:36:46.411 --> 02:36:49.380
<v Speaker 1>women are really into that a lot of men </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give a fuck about.</v>

3114
02:36:49.530 --> 02:36:50.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a terrible thing that men </v>

3115
02:36:51.781 --> 02:36:55.620
<v Speaker 1>aren't into design does not more men </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in interior design.</v>

3116
02:36:55.621 --> 02:36:56.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not a terrible thing.</v>

3117
02:36:57.300 --> 02:36:59.670
<v Speaker 3>And that's sort of one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunate thing is too,</v>

3118
02:36:59.671 --> 02:37:03.660
<v Speaker 3>is that there's so much fighting to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>more women into tech,</v>

3119
02:37:03.661 --> 02:37:07.950
<v Speaker 3>but there's no fighting to get more men </v>
<v Speaker 3>into nursing.</v>

3120
02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:11.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any of these more female dominated.</v>

3121
02:37:11.930 --> 02:37:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's also because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial rewards of tech are so extreme</v>

3122
02:37:16.161 --> 02:37:19.190
<v Speaker 1>in comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nursing is pretty kept salary.</v>

3123
02:37:19.490 --> 02:37:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you can climb the corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder as a,</v>

3124
02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:25.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ceo of some sort of a tech company,</v>

3125
02:37:25.371 --> 02:37:27.170
<v Speaker 1>the rewards are substantial.</v>

3126
02:37:27.790 --> 02:37:28.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think inevitably there will be more </v>

3127
02:37:31.330 --> 02:37:32.163
<v Speaker 3>men attracted to high paying jobs simply</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they fight for status and money </v>

3128
02:37:36.821 --> 02:37:37.654
<v Speaker 3>is how you gain status often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's partly why they see tech as a </v>

3129
02:37:42.430 --> 02:37:43.263
<v Speaker 3>target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not as if nursing is a bad job </v>

3130
02:37:46.390 --> 02:37:49.030
<v Speaker 3>that gets paid well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are many people that,</v>

3131
02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:52.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to college for premed and dropout,</v>

3132
02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:55.780
<v Speaker 3>like 90 percent of people that started </v>
<v Speaker 3>as premed dropout.</v>

3133
02:37:56.290 --> 02:38:01.060
<v Speaker 3>And the men feel like they can't enter </v>
<v Speaker 3>nursing because that's too feminine.</v>

3134
02:38:01.570 --> 02:38:04.720
<v Speaker 3>And there's huge biases against men </v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming feminine.</v>

3135
02:38:04.900 --> 02:38:05.740
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3136
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:10.360
<v Speaker 3>man can't wear dresses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but girls can be openly tomboyish.</v>

3137
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3138
02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:13.553
<v Speaker 3>So there's unfortunately some </v>
<v Speaker 3>asymmetries in our culture and there's </v>

3139
02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:20.520
<v Speaker 3>reasons for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3140
02:38:20.521 --> 02:38:21.354
<v Speaker 3>if a guy is too feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he can't necessarily fulfill his </v>

3141
02:38:25.410 --> 02:38:28.290
<v Speaker 3>gender role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is being a provider and protector.</v>

3142
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.941
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3143
02:38:29.941 --> 02:38:30.774
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be aggressive to be a good </v>

3144
02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:36.420
<v Speaker 3>protector and provider for your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3145
02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:39.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the females gender role being a nurturer</v>

3146
02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:41.040
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3147
02:38:41.041 --> 02:38:41.874
<v Speaker 3>it's fine to be feminine and so a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gender disparities that we see and </v>

3148
02:38:50.670 --> 02:38:55.440
<v Speaker 3>gender norms are just a but behind those</v>
<v Speaker 3>two gender roles.</v>

3149
02:38:56.740 --> 02:38:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3150
02:38:57.601 --> 02:38:58.434
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of evidence to support </v>

3151
02:38:59.261 --> 02:39:00.520
<v Speaker 1>that and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3152
02:39:00.580 --> 02:39:01.413
<v Speaker 1>that was essentially a big part of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about in your memo and </v>

3153
02:39:04.530 --> 02:39:05.363
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're a bad guy dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you've been unfairly </v>

3154
02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:11.050
<v Speaker 1>maligned and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad we had a chance to sit down and</v>

3155
02:39:11.051 --> 02:39:12.680
<v Speaker 1>talk and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3156
02:39:12.681 --> 02:39:13.514
<v Speaker 1>I wish you well man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it all works out and keep us </v>

3157
02:39:15.401 --> 02:39:17.140
<v Speaker 1>posted and we'll let everybody else know</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3158
02:39:17.141 --> 02:39:17.901
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3159
02:39:17.901 --> 02:39:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3160

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Almost three hours.</v>
