1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit,</v>

2
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey fellow.</v>

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>What's going on dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>

4
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:06.730
<v Speaker 1>And thanks for doing this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

5
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>We both came in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a meal together unprepared.</v>

6
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>We both were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both were a little bit late.</v>

7
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>We both had food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a little food,</v>

8
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>talked a little shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxed,</v>

9
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>settled in a little nervous like I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

10
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I was in the right area for the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I rolled up I was like,</v>

11
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't look anything like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

12
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>And I was nervous that you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be like,</v>

13
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we will.</v>

14
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:32.601
<v Speaker 1>The next place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's going to be even less like </v>

15
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:32.601
<v Speaker 1>this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>

16
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:32.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

17
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Try to make it as discreet as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

18
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hide it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

19
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pretend to preschool.</v>

20
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put like a preschool sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the outside.</v>

21
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>So that just starts like young single </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes.</v>

22
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Just avoid preschools at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it keeps dockers away.</v>

23
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push this sucker right up to your face </v>

24
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 1>and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so learning a little bit.</v>

25
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>So Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a guy who's done a </v>

26
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.121
<v Speaker 1>lot of fucking cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were on one of my favorite shows </v>

27
00:00:59.121 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>last up until the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to be honest.</v>

28
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end it was.</v>

29
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.020
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about fucking Jack your </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone or then that guy just driving me </v>

30
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>crazy standard around that fucking pawn </v>
<v Speaker 1>that brings people back to life.</v>

31
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Like he's waiting for his line to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and then you know you,</v>

32
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>you were part of the Lord of the rings </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

33
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

34
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Those are two amazing historical things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're a part of when you,</v>

35
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>when you do it as an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a jobbing actor,</v>

36
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stoked.</v>

37
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was super stoked to do those shows.</v>

38
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:32.391
<v Speaker 1>You don't realize at the time the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity of what you do and until years </v>

39
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

40
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>me and Orlando and Elijah and billy went</v>
<v Speaker 1>out for dinner a couple of weeks ago and</v>

41
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>we've sat around saying the further away</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get from Lord of the rings,</v>

42
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>the more important it feels in our life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when my grandfathers and stuff,</v>

43
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

44
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>we were involved in a piece of movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

45
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>but at the time you just like great job </v>
<v Speaker 1>having fun and that was kind of the same</v>

46
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>at last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although to be fair we'd lost,</v>

47
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>cause we were isolated on an island in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

48
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>but also in person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>we're all on together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't suddenly,</v>

50
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't as exposed to the size of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show as much as when I went on hiatus </v>

51
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>and then people will follow me around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and causing hassle and stuff.</v>

52
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>But when you're in Hawaii there's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>three restaurants to go to.</v>

53
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I avoid those three restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anyone follows me,</v>

54
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to the library and then sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for a couple of hours.</v>

55
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>So I wasn't really aware that it became </v>
<v Speaker 1>this pop culture phenomenon,</v>

56
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the end,</v>

57
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>the end is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:30.711
<v Speaker 1>I'm on twitter and stuff and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on twitter ask me how'd you feel </v>

59
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>about the end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in all honesty,</v>

60
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch it and I've not watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

61
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left at the end of season three,</v>

62
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>came back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peppered in season four,</v>

63
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>five and six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't in the show when it ended.</v>

64
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was in the finale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

65
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.940
<v Speaker 1>at that point I had injected myself from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that world and I was doing a movie in,</v>

66
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lower east side,</v>

67
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>playing a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

68
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:57.291
<v Speaker 1>grave robber that was working at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to expose myself to this </v>

69
00:02:57.291 --> 00:03:00.711
<v Speaker 1>charlie character who I played because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like I was to bring the Charlie </v>

70
00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:00.711
<v Speaker 1>character</v>

71
00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 2>onto set the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people are always very,</v>

72
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 2>very jazzed to talk to him about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ending.</v>

73
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 2>How did you feel about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did it make you feel?</v>

74
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Were you disappointed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you love it?</v>

75
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.670
<v Speaker 2>And I'm always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always really fucking piss people off </v>

76
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.670
<v Speaker 2>by going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

77
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't see,</v>

78
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't see it because it felt </v>

79
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 2>like I was getting fucked towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

80
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing this.</v>

81
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 2>And I walked away and I actually had an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument about my wife.</v>

82
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta watch the last episode.</v>

83
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not watching it.</v>

84
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not watching it.</v>

85
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

86
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with Dexter.</v>

87
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:35.581
<v Speaker 2>I walked away with Dex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was completely committed in the </v>

88
00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:35.581
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>

89
00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:39.841
<v Speaker 2>you walked away or your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your character died during the golden </v>

90
00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 2>time of the show.</v>

91
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.920
<v Speaker 2>The show was flawless at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so god damn good.</v>

92
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 2>It was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

93
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:50.341
<v Speaker 2>I like to end the season three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really felt like it was kind of </v>

94
00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:53.810
<v Speaker 2>peaking at that point was it was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show that every late night talk show </v>

95
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 2>hosts was talking about or daytime and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in magazines and you know,</v>

96
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 2>buzzfeed loved it and all that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

97
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>And then it Kinda felt like it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>cresting,</v>

98
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.450
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think the real bonus for the </v>

99
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 2>fens was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the six years that it was on tv,</v>

100
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 2>the creators that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not what you think it is,</v>

101
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 2>it's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately it kind of was.</v>

102
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people thought,</v>

103
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

104
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I think they say that they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck they're doing when they </v>

105
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.621
<v Speaker 2>have a giant storyboard and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving pieces around and they did a </v>

106
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:25.621
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal job though.</v>

107
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean given the constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all of network television,</v>

108
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.470
<v Speaker 2>of knowing that you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial breaks and knowing that you </v>

109
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 2>can have certain language and certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

110
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be able to show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a fantastic job.</v>

111
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just one of the all time </v>
<v Speaker 2>great shows for sure.</v>

112
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Totally a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loved it,</v>

113
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.720
<v Speaker 2>loved being involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it will be,</v>

114
00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:49.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that people will talk about </v>

115
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:49.721
<v Speaker 2>with me for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times.</v>

116
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:53.911
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you experienced this as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the things that you up </v>

117
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 2>personally close to that you're working </v>
<v Speaker 2>in is a huge part of your life.</v>

118
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 2>It takes on a different aspect than just</v>
<v Speaker 2>these simple look from a fan's point of </v>

119
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for me last was,</v>

120
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 2>it was Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was surfing,</v>

121
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 2>it was being in love.</v>

122
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 2>It was chameleons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was having a shitty day at work.</v>

123
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 2>It was having a great day at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was being hung over.</v>

124
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 2>It was making new friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was everything.</v>

125
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 2>It was my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

127
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.330
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the TV show that I watched </v>

128
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday night at eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was always my friend,</v>

129
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 2>but lost for me was sometimes not my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

130
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes my enemy sometimes he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible sometimes,</v>

131
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.590
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people come up to me and say,</v>

132
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.160
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about the show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I make sense that it's,</v>

133
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 2>it's so much of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

134
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your point of view is completely </v>

135
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.680
<v Speaker 2>singular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

136
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 2>no one is going to have that point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>view other than the actors on the show </v>

137
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 2>and even their point of view is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be kind of different than yours.</v>

138
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People watching and they watched the </v>

139
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.481
<v Speaker 2>finished product and so their </v>
<v Speaker 2>association with is totally different </v>

140
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:54.481
<v Speaker 2>than yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Polished,</v>

141
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no agenda.</v>

142
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>They just wanting to be entertained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

143
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

144
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 2>no politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of politics on.</v>

145
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fuck,</v>

146
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 2>I got in trouble for saying this when </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost was on tv,</v>

147
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 2>but fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about that shit.</v>

148
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched certain cast members go from </v>

149
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.811
<v Speaker 2>making the pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a six week pilot where </v>

150
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:16.811
<v Speaker 2>everyone was hanging out with each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>real pie in at night.</v>

151
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 2>We were all spending time with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

152
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I watched her and act as be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the greatest job I have ever </v>

153

<v Speaker 2>I'm in Hawaii.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the first season and hearing people </v>

157
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.531
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm not unless </v>

158
00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:38.531
<v Speaker 2>Letterman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I not on Letterman?</v>

159
00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two months ago it was the greatest thing</v>

160
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 2>you've ever done and now you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't fly to New York?</v>

161
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Why can't I be on a 12:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>flight to New York?</v>

162
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Why do I have to be on a 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM flight to New York?</v>

163
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're missing it.</v>

164
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 2>You're missing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

165
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 2>That's so common though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very common with actors.</v>

166
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Actors are strange breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was on news radio,</v>

167
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 2>we once had this discussion about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thursday night,</v>

168
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 2>Thursday night lineup on NBC was where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to be.</v>

169
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 2>That was Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was friends.</v>

170
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 2>That was the spot and it was fucking sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the city and the single guy.</v>

171
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 2>And he's what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Simms,</v>

172
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 2>the creator of a news radio called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit sandwich spot.</v>

173
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.550
<v Speaker 2>So like you have your two good shows and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in between your show you would put dog </v>

174
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 2>shit and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was complaining,</v>

175
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 2>why can't we be on Thursday?</v>

176
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

177
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:29.531
<v Speaker 2>last time I checked we're on television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're on a sitcom on actual </v>

178
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny,</v>

179
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 2>like these are the golden years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to look back when we're</v>

180
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:37.970
<v Speaker 2>old and we're going to say fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were so lucky.</v>

181
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 2>But while it's happening and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

182
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 2>why am I not in the Hollywood reporter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I not getting a development deal?</v>

183
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Why can't I start my own movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>

184
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did he get it?</v>

185
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.290
<v Speaker 2>And I did that in my teens and early </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties.</v>

186
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.740
<v Speaker 2>But how come he's got it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my agent knew,</v>

187
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

188
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:55.580
<v Speaker 2>my English agent knew I'm not with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

189
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.010
<v Speaker 2>At one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 2>we lived in and he sent me down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

191
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
<v Speaker 2>the reason why he's getting it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll know it's because you are not </v>

192
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.310
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a completely different journey in</v>

193
00:08:05.311 --> 00:08:05.630
<v Speaker 2>his life.</v>

194
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 2>He looks different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yanks different.</v>

195
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 2>You're not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won't get the roles that you're going</v>

196
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:14.711
<v Speaker 2>to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won't get the opportunities that </v>

197
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 2>you'll get and you won't get his book </v>
<v Speaker 2>quit that bullshit because that's not to</v>

198
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>get you anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A great perspective.</v>

199
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 2>So true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find someone to lay it down</v>

200
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:22.650
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My agent was not only.</v>

201
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.080
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a good guy.</v>

202
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was really good.</v>

203
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to absorb it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

204
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:32.470
<v Speaker 2>You have to take it in and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate it from your ego and all your </v>

205
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.370
<v Speaker 2>preconceived notions and assumptions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually absorb it.</v>

206
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also swallow that very bitter pill </v>

207
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.790
<v Speaker 2>of regardless health of however unfair </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it is and how it should change</v>

208
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:45.560
<v Speaker 2>and be justified in one day it will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

209
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really,</v>

210
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're talking about one very </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific endeavor,</v>

211
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:55.391
<v Speaker 2>but it's analogous to life itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people will look at people that </v>

212
00:08:55.391 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>are doing other things life and there'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>be</v>

213
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.040
<v Speaker 3>upset that they're not doing those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things even though they've taken very </v>

214
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 3>little or no effort to try to do any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

215
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

216
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:05.540
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they become haters know.</v>

217
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.610
<v Speaker 3>And it's crazy that even a successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>person like honestly a huge show like </v>

218
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 3>loss can become a hater.</v>

219
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

220
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Totally adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

221
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

222
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a human characteristic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

223
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>We're always going to compare ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>to other people.</v>

224
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I went for a walk yesterday around </v>
<v Speaker 1>Griffith Park and I was talking with my </v>

225
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>friend about the whole comparison thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was saying like,</v>

226
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>you know that Bill Gates gets up some </v>
<v Speaker 1>days and he's like,</v>

227
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.240
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

228
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't fucking catch a break,</v>

229
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just having a shit day,</v>

230
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.380
<v Speaker 1>all your problems or relative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 1>and it's okay to have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to have them.</v>

232
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:48.621
<v Speaker 1>It's just you got to navigate your way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through them with a little bit of grace </v>

233
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:48.621
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like those</v>

234
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:53.230
<v Speaker 3>pitfalls in life or just a part of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>a human being in this weird world </v>

235
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.170
<v Speaker 3>because this world is not like any world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was ever that ever existed.</v>

236
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.380
<v Speaker 3>There was never a million different </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you could compare yourself </v>

237
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.790
<v Speaker 3>to that were on television or singing </v>
<v Speaker 3>songs or on the internet or like there's</v>

238
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:09.791
<v Speaker 3>all these different people that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at and then you look at yourself </v>

239
00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:12.461
<v Speaker 3>and make these comparisons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to just be the people that were </v>

240
00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:14.651
<v Speaker 3>around you and that's what it used to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the entire history of the human </v>

241
00:10:14.651 --> 00:10:19.181
<v Speaker 3>race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was only the people you could see </v>

242
00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:19.181
<v Speaker 3>with your eyes and come in contact with </v>
<v Speaker 3>other that you didn't have.</v>

243
00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:24.011
<v Speaker 3>This weird perspective and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of what a human being is.</v>

244
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 3>We we're constantly striving to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a why we stay alive.</v>

245
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:35.210
<v Speaker 3>It's why we build homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's why we try to get good at a career.</v>

246
00:10:35.211 --> 00:10:38.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this desire to get better at things also</v>

247
00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:43.871
<v Speaker 3>leads you to compare your own progress </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the progress of others and </v>

248
00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:44.390
<v Speaker 3>that's where the pitfall comes in.</v>

249
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously a lot of people in in this</v>

250
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.640
<v Speaker 1>new society that we've created with </v>
<v Speaker 1>social media and instant information,</v>

251
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:56.670
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those people that have become </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and famous are in those </v>

252
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.880
<v Speaker 1>places because they are the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite.</v>

253
00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So now we're comparing ourselves to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite.</v>

254
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Like you could be a great basketball </v>
<v Speaker 1>player.</v>

255
00:11:01.451 --> 00:11:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I have an amazing game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come home,</v>

256
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.280
<v Speaker 1>stop watching youtube feeds of Dwayne </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wade,</v>

257
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.750
<v Speaker 1>you know Lebron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

258
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking terrible.</v>

259
00:11:08.621 --> 00:11:09.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not terrible.</v>

260
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.700
<v Speaker 1>These are the exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're exposing ourselves to the </v>

261
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.610
<v Speaker 1>exception almost all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now everyone on twitter is brilliant.</v>

262
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in that sense,</v>

263
00:11:16.961 --> 00:11:21.040
<v Speaker 1>those comparisons are great and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial because they force you to try</v>

264
00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:26.041
<v Speaker 1>to achieve a higher standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you can keep yourself from </v>

265
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:26.041
<v Speaker 1>going mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

266
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:27.850
<v Speaker 1>what about the fact that you'll never </v>
<v Speaker 1>get there?</v>

267
00:11:27.851 --> 00:11:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to slam dunk.</v>

268
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the athletic body ability </v>

269
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.390
<v Speaker 1>to slam dunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if my whole ambition was like,</v>

270
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I want us London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Boykins can slam dunk.</v>

271
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:38.200
<v Speaker 1>He smaller than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it,</v>

272
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know I've tried.</v>

273
00:11:39.821 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm don't get anywhere near.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the ability to do is now.</v>

274
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.950
<v Speaker 1>How much have you tried?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

275
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Like if you went to a strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning coach,</v>

276
00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:47.860
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

277
00:11:47.861 --> 00:11:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dominic Monaghan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of fucking money.</v>

278
00:11:49.631 --> 00:11:54.631
<v Speaker 1>Come on bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get me in fucking top </v>

279
00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:54.631
<v Speaker 1>notch shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to do dead</v>

280
00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:59.040
<v Speaker 2>lifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get me pumped up with </v>

281
00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.040
<v Speaker 2>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Duncan,</v>

282
00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.040
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking done.</v>

283
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.680
<v Speaker 2>What is it that the vertical leap leap </v>
<v Speaker 2>down?</v>

284
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm not trying to the extent that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

285
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 2>some people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

286
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:09.871
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something potentially </v>

287
00:12:09.871 --> 00:12:09.871
<v Speaker 2>harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

288
00:12:09.871 --> 00:12:09.871
<v Speaker 2>it's like the whole thing with beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

289
00:12:09.871 --> 00:12:10.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>

290
00:12:10.691 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ladies and maybe men feel that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure to be that perfect thing,</v>

291
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 2>but that perfect thing isn't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>real well.</v>

292
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:22.801
<v Speaker 2>You know what's really frustrating when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you meet a girl who doesn't like her </v>

293
00:12:22.801 --> 00:12:26.671
<v Speaker 2>body and you love her body and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparing herself to stick figures that </v>

294
00:12:26.671 --> 00:12:31.261
<v Speaker 2>are like in models that are wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>these weird outfits that way 18 pounds </v>

295
00:12:31.261 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 2>on your body is a woman's body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fat,</v>

296
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:35.770
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weed like that.</v>

297
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Like a fat ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

298
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:39.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a part of being sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

299
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

300
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:45.630
<v Speaker 2>it's actually attractive to men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but women are comparing to the way </v>

301
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.750
<v Speaker 2>fashion models look and the way other </v>
<v Speaker 2>women perceive.</v>

302
00:12:47.751 --> 00:12:52.751
<v Speaker 2>Like there's certain women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I know this lady who she doesn't </v>

303
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 2>think that women look good unless they </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like sticks.</v>

304
00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she has this weird thing in her </v>

305
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 2>head and like her friends would try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to her about it.</v>

306
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

307
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.030
<v Speaker 2>but after awhile you just get tired of </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about crazy.</v>

308
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look great.</v>

309
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Really Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like don't this,</v>

310
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 2>this ain't about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be born in Ethiopia with no </v>

311
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

312
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have been fucked.</v>

313
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.971
<v Speaker 2>You could have been one of those kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's born in Iraq that has to deal </v>

314
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:19.120
<v Speaker 2>with the aftermath of all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hazardous waste.</v>

315
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.360
<v Speaker 2>It's in that area that's causing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids to be born with massive </v>

316
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.820
<v Speaker 2>deformities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're lucky shit.</v>

317
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.300
<v Speaker 2>You can't go on about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not skinny enough.</v>

318
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously a lot of that is the,</v>

319
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:34.981
<v Speaker 2>is the societal thing may not make a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction between like a girl's body </v>

320
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:35.920
<v Speaker 2>and a woman's buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

321
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 2>There is a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the fashion lines,</v>

322
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 2>one to put that models in the clothes </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they have a gills buddy,</v>

323
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.340
<v Speaker 2>because there they were calling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

324
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.400
<v Speaker 2>a coat hanger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to look at it because </v>

325
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:50.400
<v Speaker 2>that's what they really are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clothes hangers,</v>

326
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.271
<v Speaker 2>like your clothes look best when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being stuffed into like Jennifer </v>

327
00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Lopez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His body was fucked.</v>

328
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:59.970
<v Speaker 2>But to a man like that's what men like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see that fucking ass waist.</v>

329
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fiance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

330
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:04.150
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking woman,</v>

331
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.500
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

332
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those women we were talking about this </v>

333
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:10.990
<v Speaker 2>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that didn't used to be hot,</v>

334
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.220
<v Speaker 2>like just a few.</v>

335
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go back and look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>playboys when like the seventies and the</v>

336
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:20.131
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even concentrate on assets </v>

337
00:14:20.131 --> 00:14:22.500
<v Speaker 2>like it wasn't for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't a focus on what happened or </v>

338
00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:25.120
<v Speaker 2>do we think it's the hip hop community?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we think it's.</v>

339
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:27.040
<v Speaker 2>The wrapper is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

340
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:32.041
<v Speaker 2>I remember being 12 and seeing a cover </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an ice tea album that had like one </v>

341
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.970
<v Speaker 2>onesy bikinis with big assets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Damn,</v>

342
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.990
<v Speaker 2>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

343
00:14:37.991 --> 00:14:42.991
<v Speaker 2>That one where ice had a machine gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind his back and the girl was in a </v>

344
00:14:42.991 --> 00:14:43.600
<v Speaker 2>bikini and she had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

345
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:46.260
<v Speaker 2>she had a thong on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He may have ended up marrying a man.</v>

346
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was his wife for awhile </v>

347
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.280
<v Speaker 2>before he got rid of her and got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocoa right.</v>

348
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 2>And that was the first time I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to that,</v>

349
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for me it was like Princess Leia</v>

350
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 1>growing up was my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my jam.</v>

351
00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.660
<v Speaker 4>We didn't even know what her body looked</v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

352
00:14:58.661 --> 00:15:01.170
<v Speaker 4>We had no idea there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even then,</v>

353
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.270
<v Speaker 4>harass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

354
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.990
<v Speaker 4>in comparison to today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not quite that,</v>

355
00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:06.670
<v Speaker 4>but at the time that was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>revolutionary.</v>

356
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm not hating it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not terrible,</v>

357
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.070
<v Speaker 4>but that's nothing compared to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

358
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:17.190
<v Speaker 4>what is her name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fucking Nicky Manila to go right </v>

359
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:17.590
<v Speaker 4>here on power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Similar just to the right.</v>

360
00:15:17.591 --> 00:15:22.530
<v Speaker 4>Then that goes click on that one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I bought that.</v>

361
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.840
<v Speaker 4>That's much more wrapper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's what's interesting is it seems </v>

362
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.580
<v Speaker 4>the attraction to that seems </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental.</v>

363
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.240
<v Speaker 4>So why wasn't it there in the seventies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the eighties?</v>

364
00:15:34.241 --> 00:15:35.770
<v Speaker 4>It seems genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

365
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Was it seemed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

366
00:15:38.321 --> 00:15:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Obscene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

367
00:15:40.031 --> 00:15:41.250
<v Speaker 1>This folk hero.</v>

368
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.620
<v Speaker 4>Her ass is retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nicki Minaj.</v>

369
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.540
<v Speaker 4>Anaconda picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is that?</v>

370
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.680
<v Speaker 4>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

371
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.490
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

372
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.550
<v Speaker 4>A little extra brush and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

373
00:15:50.551 --> 00:15:52.380
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But whatever.</v>

374
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.280
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's phenomenal what genetics,</v>

375
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Andale obviously it's a lot of it </v>

376
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.371
<v Speaker 4>is girls doing squats and girls </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrating on that area and </v>

377
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:04.620
<v Speaker 4>developing their butt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just.</v>

378
00:16:04.621 --> 00:16:09.621
<v Speaker 4>It's weird to me that that wasn't a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal in the seventies and the eighties </v>

379
00:16:09.621 --> 00:16:14.271
<v Speaker 4>and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then somewhere along the line the </v>

380
00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:16.491
<v Speaker 4>hip hop community sort of ignited what </v>
<v Speaker 4>seems to be a fundamental attraction </v>

381
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:17.000
<v Speaker 4>that men have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

382
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.880
<v Speaker 1>when I started to get interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls and being able to actually make </v>

384
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.080
<v Speaker 1>out with girls and spend time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>

385
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.380
<v Speaker 1>those girls were girls that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.300
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

387
00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:34.301
<v Speaker 1>13 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no concept of any of those </v>

388
00:16:34.301 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 1>girls having a Ba donk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>donk like that.</v>

389
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:38.480
<v Speaker 1>So maybe for me it was the thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was reaching for.</v>

390
00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm never gonna get them never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get this womanly thing.</v>

391
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be with these little </v>
<v Speaker 1>waifish girls because I was a little kid</v>

392
00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:46.190
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then later on,</v>

393
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

394
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a fantasy element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

395
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:52.630
<v Speaker 4>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

396
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.640
<v Speaker 4>for girls though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the look of a man being like a big </v>

397
00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.850
<v Speaker 4>muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the rock or something like that,</v>

398
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.640
<v Speaker 4>that's always existed like Conan the </v>
<v Speaker 4>barbarian and you know,</v>

399
00:17:01.641 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 4>that's always been around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go back to the Robert e Dot Howard,</v>

400
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:10.350
<v Speaker 4>illustrations that Frank Frazetta did </v>
<v Speaker 4>like way back in the seventies is </v>

401
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.850
<v Speaker 4>fucking yolked out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>giant barren.</v>

402
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.880
<v Speaker 4>It's universal Roman Greek gods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sculptures that have been around </v>

403
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.910
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all cut and ripped and stuff,</v>

404
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.220
<v Speaker 4>but the women back then were all fat and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rubin ask,</v>

405
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have those bodies.</v>

406
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 4>The bodies have today is like a weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>change and it doesn't exist in the mail.</v>

407
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:29.100
<v Speaker 4>So it exists in women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

408
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.720
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

409
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is interesting.</v>

410
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:17:31.871 --> 00:17:36.871
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the lady that kind of takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>care of itself simply because I feel as </v>

412
00:17:38.741 --> 00:17:40.330
<v Speaker 1>if I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the biggest dude in the world,</v>

414
00:17:42.881 --> 00:17:47.881
<v Speaker 1>but I go to the gym when I'm free </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it gets me out of the house and </v>

415
00:17:47.881 --> 00:17:50.640
<v Speaker 1>also I like to try and go to the gym </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monday to Friday so that my Saturday,</v>

416
00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:55.641
<v Speaker 1>Sunday I can do whatever at one and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat relatively correctly so that on the </v>

417
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.720
<v Speaker 1>weekend if I want to chow down some </v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

418
00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:59.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a little noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to make a huge difference</v>

419
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.820
<v Speaker 1>if I'm doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to be with someone who has </v>

420
00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.391
<v Speaker 1>the same common sense about the body and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that they look like it's a,</v>

421
00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit of an issue,</v>

422
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:18.171
<v Speaker 1>but for me because like I love pizza and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like buffalo wings and I could easily </v>

423
00:18:18.171 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Speaker 1>eat all that stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get much bigger,</v>

424
00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:21.450
<v Speaker 1>but I'm aware of the fact that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy for you.</v>

425
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.180
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't necessarily be doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your body putting you under that much</v>

426
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:29.181
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also I want to feel and look and </v>

427
00:18:29.181 --> 00:18:32.361
<v Speaker 1>present myself good because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel good about myself and the issue </v>

428
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:35.850
<v Speaker 1>with people just kind of abuse in </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in that way.</v>

429
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says something a little sinister about </v>

430
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 1>how they personally feel about </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

431
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Self Abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

432
00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:47.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know the food is making you more </v>

433
00:18:47.721 --> 00:18:47.880
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy and you're eating on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>

434
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.430
<v Speaker 1>that is a form of self abuse and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily feel attracted to people who</v>

435
00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:54.630
<v Speaker 1>are abusing themselves on a consistent </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

436
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's natural,</v>

437
00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.180
<v Speaker 3>but it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also weirdly natural for people to </v>

438
00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.151
<v Speaker 3>abuse themselves to get caught in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle of overeating and then feeling </v>

439
00:19:04.151 --> 00:19:08.801
<v Speaker 3>shitty because you're overeating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very common cycle for people </v>

440
00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:12.760
<v Speaker 3>get trapped in and I really wonder what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mechanism of that is like what's </v>

441
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.841
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the evolutionary advantage to </v>

442
00:19:16.841 --> 00:19:18.230
<v Speaker 3>having that in the human species?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's so common.</v>

443
00:19:18.231 --> 00:19:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere you look,</v>

444
00:19:19.251 --> 00:19:24.251
<v Speaker 3>especially in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just see overweight people </v>

445
00:19:24.251 --> 00:19:24.251
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know.</v>

446
00:19:24.251 --> 00:19:26.210
<v Speaker 3>They have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like this is some secret that's</v>

447
00:19:26.211 --> 00:19:29.060
<v Speaker 3>locked up in the fucking vaults in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Qumran.</v>

448
00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:32.330
<v Speaker 3>You have to crack the code to find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you shouldn't eat pizza at 3:00</v>

449
00:19:32.331 --> 00:19:32.780
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>

450
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't suddenly wake up and go,</v>

451
00:19:34.541 --> 00:19:35.660
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

452
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.790
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've seen it occur.</v>

453
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the evolution of us</v>

454
00:19:40.511 --> 00:19:44.380
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's those moments where we do</v>

455
00:19:44.381 --> 00:19:46.210
<v Speaker 1>want to abuse herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do want to feel badly.</v>

456
00:19:46.211 --> 00:19:48.400
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't extend us as a species.</v>

457
00:19:48.401 --> 00:19:49.300
<v Speaker 1>To me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.940
<v Speaker 1>it's the way that we feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but light you,</v>

459
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.610
<v Speaker 1>you eat relatively healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work out and stuff.</v>

460
00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Like what's your food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kryptonite?</v>

461
00:19:57.281 --> 00:19:58.990
<v Speaker 1>What is the thing where you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

462
00:19:58.991 --> 00:20:00.170
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta have it.</v>

463
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do love pizza.</v>

464
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.450
<v Speaker 3>I do love Shitty pastas and pizzas and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I know that I shouldn't eat.</v>

465
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.760
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty much it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty good because I,</v>

466
00:20:08.761 --> 00:20:11.130
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy healthy food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had,</v>

467
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:14.340
<v Speaker 3>I was eating Vegan food when he came in </v>
<v Speaker 3>here because I want to,</v>

468
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I just did yoga and I'm like,</v>

469
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:18.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing to eat.</v>

470
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:19.700
<v Speaker 3>So it feels good.</v>

471
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you give yourself like a free pass?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like every Sunday I can have a </v>

472
00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:26.290
<v Speaker 1>slice of pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

473
00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.640
<v Speaker 3>don't though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>

474
00:20:27.641 --> 00:20:31.330
<v Speaker 3>but I kind of would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was more inclined to eat shitty,</v>

475
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:36.450
<v Speaker 3>like if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it was like more of a thing that I </v>

476
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:36.790
<v Speaker 3>had to separate myself from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that hard for me.</v>

477
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.910
<v Speaker 3>I eat relatively clean because I like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat relatively clean.</v>

478
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I honestly relatively clean,</v>

479
00:20:41.831 --> 00:20:46.831
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say overwhelmingly clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the food I eat is really </v>

480
00:20:46.831 --> 00:20:46.831
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

481
00:20:46.831 --> 00:20:46.960
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know too,</v>

482
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this point in time I'd be upset at </v>

483
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.241
<v Speaker 3>myself if I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know too much about the actual </v>

484
00:20:54.241 --> 00:20:56.761
<v Speaker 3>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the mornings generally in the </v>

485
00:20:56.761 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 3>mornings I either eat fruit or I eat a </v>
<v Speaker 3>drink,</v>

486
00:20:57.431 --> 00:20:58.370
<v Speaker 3>a Kale shake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

487
00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.720
<v Speaker 3>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a blended up shakes with Kale and celery</v>

488
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:03.430
<v Speaker 3>and cucumber and garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that jazz.</v>

489
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then in the afternoon it depends.</v>

490
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:08.440
<v Speaker 3>But if I feel like having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheeseburger,</v>

491
00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll have a fucking cheeseburgers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

492
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

493
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:15.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this stuff that </v>

494
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:15.610
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

495
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.780
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky enough to travel nine months </v>

496
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:19.780
<v Speaker 1>of my year pretty intensively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

497
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.800
<v Speaker 1>a week in a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 days in a place,</v>

498
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.240
<v Speaker 1>a week in a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 days in the place.</v>

499
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of long distance flying.</v>

500
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I have no semblance of a schedule in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of food.</v>

501
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:35.830
<v Speaker 1>So I lose weight based on those factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the fact that my metabolism </v>

502
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 1>metabolism is very high running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need very little sleep to function if </v>

503
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:41.840
<v Speaker 1>this my mommy's tummy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all the time.</v>

504
00:21:41.841 --> 00:21:46.841
<v Speaker 1>And I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was something more interesting </v>

505
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:46.970
<v Speaker 1>for me to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would forego eating.</v>

506
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.590
<v Speaker 1>So she'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner's on the table.</v>

507
00:21:48.591 --> 00:21:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

508
00:21:49.371 --> 00:21:50.960
<v Speaker 1>can I just finish this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

509
00:21:50.961 --> 00:21:51.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

510
00:21:51.441 --> 00:21:55.220
<v Speaker 1>And she said you would just not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner and then she would have to remind</v>

511
00:21:55.221 --> 00:21:55.970
<v Speaker 1>me you didn't eat dinner.</v>

512
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:56.600
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

513
00:21:56.601 --> 00:21:57.890
<v Speaker 1>let me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll go back to that thing.</v>

514
00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:02.660
<v Speaker 1>So you would eat just like NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a necessity pleasurable thing.</v>

515
00:22:02.661 --> 00:22:07.661
<v Speaker 1>I just got to get into your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get it down because my mom and dad </v>

516
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:07.661
<v Speaker 1>told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would,</v>

517
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I was obsessed by football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer when I was a kid.</v>

518
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.200
<v Speaker 1>I would get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run out my house when I was going to </v>

519
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.200
<v Speaker 1>school right at my house before </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast,</v>

520
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.650
<v Speaker 1>no breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to school,</v>

521
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.010
<v Speaker 1>play football for an hour before 9:00.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from eight til nine and play football</v>

522
00:22:19.011 --> 00:22:20.810
<v Speaker 1>with my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Break time was 10,</v>

523
00:22:20.811 --> 00:22:23.990
<v Speaker 1>15 to 1115.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people ate at that point.</v>

524
00:22:23.991 --> 00:22:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Most people had a snack chips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit sandwich.</v>

525
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I would play football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lunchtime was an ally.</v>

526
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.690
<v Speaker 1>All my friends would eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would play football first thing that I</v>

527
00:22:32.691 --> 00:22:35.150
<v Speaker 1>would put in my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much all.</v>

528
00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.400
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly more than average in </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

529
00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I would say 65 percent of the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be candy on the way home.</v>

530
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.810
<v Speaker 1>So I'd walk into the convenience store </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

531
00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.830
<v Speaker 1>by one lbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a candy.</v>

532
00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Must have been starving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

533
00:22:47.061 --> 00:22:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I was amazed when I was a kid and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning what I dunno,</v>

534
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.470
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>calories a day and just putting sugar in</v>

535
00:22:54.471 --> 00:22:54.860
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

536
00:22:54.861 --> 00:22:59.180
<v Speaker 1>so I was super skinny and that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>transferred over into my adult life.</v>

537
00:22:59.181 --> 00:23:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Where my trainer has always said to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>is consistency.</v>

538
00:23:02.181 --> 00:23:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Dom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you need to be in the gym five days</v>

539
00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:05.120
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

540
00:23:05.121 --> 00:23:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for a month,</v>

541
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.460
<v Speaker 1>let's do five days a week and get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>poppin.</v>

542
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.160
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

543
00:23:10.161 --> 00:23:12.440
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like three weeks in,</v>

544
00:23:12.441 --> 00:23:14.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like I put on a little bit,</v>

545
00:23:14.151 --> 00:23:14.870
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not feeling it.</v>

546
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:15.680
<v Speaker 1>And he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

547
00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.750
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about what you're reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

548
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.120
<v Speaker 1>couple of mouthfuls of oatmeal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast,</v>

549
00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.120
<v Speaker 1>some pine and pool and some grapes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch.</v>

550
00:23:24.121 --> 00:23:24.530
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

551
00:23:24.531 --> 00:23:24.740
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

552
00:23:24.741 --> 00:23:25.910
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need tuna steak.</v>

553
00:23:25.911 --> 00:23:27.290
<v Speaker 1>You need salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need chicken,</v>

554
00:23:27.291 --> 00:23:28.670
<v Speaker 1>you need Tofu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need fat.</v>

555
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.530
<v Speaker 1>You need to own the genie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Avocados.</v>

556
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.330
<v Speaker 1>And he would show me what I'm supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

557
00:23:32.331 --> 00:23:34.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not connie either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get it in my system.</v>

558
00:23:34.671 --> 00:23:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Puke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

559
00:23:36.951 --> 00:23:39.490
<v Speaker 1>everyone's got their own thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dealing with,</v>

560
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.890
<v Speaker 1>but I'm never going to be as big as you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your frame is bigger and you're just,</v>

561
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.810
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're naturally big guy.</v>

562
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 1>What my train said is like you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught,</v>

563
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:53.170
<v Speaker 1>you can get Bruce Lee ish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're never going to get John </v>

564
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Claude van damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the way to do that is to still eat </v>

565
00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:57.040
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

566
00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.660
<v Speaker 3>That fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if you did want to pack weight on,</v>

567
00:23:58.661 --> 00:24:02.940
<v Speaker 3>you would have to do these big compound </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercises like deadlifts.</v>

568
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:08.400
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to do squats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to do things where your body </v>

569
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.730
<v Speaker 3>literally has to change your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your bone structure has to change.</v>

570
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Your bone structure will change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

571
00:24:11.711 --> 00:24:13.850
<v Speaker 3>it will densify it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did.</v>

572
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.500
<v Speaker 3>The density of your bone structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely alters when you do heavy,</v>

573
00:24:17.501 --> 00:24:20.070
<v Speaker 3>heavy lifting because your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>realizes,</v>

574
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.200
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dumb mother fuckers going to pick </v>

575
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.200
<v Speaker 3>up big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy shit all day.</v>

576
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.280
<v Speaker 3>We have to get thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it makes you,</v>

577
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.640
<v Speaker 3>it literally will make your bones </v>
<v Speaker 3>thicker and denser.</v>

578
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I want the biggest I ever asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you pull up the.</v>

579
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Can you pull up the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

580
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.590
<v Speaker 1>the poster for the pilot of lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the first ever poster philosophies,</v>

581
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.730
<v Speaker 1>all of us on a beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest I ever was,</v>

582
00:24:38.731 --> 00:24:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I was probably like 158 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that,</v>

583
00:24:41.911 --> 00:24:43.800
<v Speaker 1>which is big on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put on like 12,</v>

584
00:24:43.801 --> 00:24:47.940
<v Speaker 1>14 pounds of muscle and my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>biceps like this.</v>

585
00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.300
<v Speaker 1>And I never got that big ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the time,</v>

586
00:24:51.301 --> 00:24:53.190
<v Speaker 1>what were you doing a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

587
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like a more of an iconic silhouette</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a beach.</v>

588
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

589
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

590
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.110
<v Speaker 1>what was I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

591
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I had food delivery and the food and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>food delivery was like,</v>

592
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me clean food,</v>

593
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:16.190
<v Speaker 1>give me lots of clean food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the gym once a day and then I </v>

594
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.860
<v Speaker 1>did a little bit of running around my </v>
<v Speaker 1>local area and it was consistency.</v>

595
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

596
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about getting a good groove gone,</v>

597
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:30.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about just getting a good habit </v>

598
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.511
<v Speaker 3>going or this is what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say that if you could do something </v>

599
00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:35.451
<v Speaker 3>every day for 90 days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it will become like a part of you </v>

600
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:39.070
<v Speaker 3>to become like they say that that's one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the best ways to quit smoking is if </v>

601
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:39.660
<v Speaker 3>you can get addicted to something else </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get,</v>

602
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.310
<v Speaker 3>get used to doing that every day.</v>

603
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

604
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.540
<v Speaker 1>But there's a slightly high res version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't really see it,</v>

605
00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:48.800
<v Speaker 1>but I am huge death of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't look cute because I'm not</v>

606
00:25:48.801 --> 00:25:50.690
<v Speaker 1>the biggest guy in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you can.</v>

607
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Well I can see at least let my fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see some muscle now.</v>

608
00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 1>My biceps are going off right there.</v>

609
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.340
<v Speaker 3>Was there any hesitation at all being </v>
<v Speaker 3>sequestered on this island like that and</v>

610
00:25:59.341 --> 00:26:03.270
<v Speaker 3>being a part of this crazy show where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to change your whole life?</v>

611
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to move.</v>

612
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met Jj Abrams and he just,</v>

613
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.970
<v Speaker 1>he just solved all of those conundrums </v>
<v Speaker 1>foaming how?</v>

614
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.350
<v Speaker 1>So He's just a brilliant guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

615
00:26:14.351 --> 00:26:19.351
<v Speaker 1>you meet brilliant guys every so often </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think anytime you're around </v>

616
00:26:19.351 --> 00:26:23.011
<v Speaker 1>someone who's brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sit up and take notes,</v>

617
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just was aware that I was around </v>

618
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.011
<v Speaker 1>someone with a very fast moving smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and I went in for a general </v>

619
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:38.660
<v Speaker 1>audition and sat down with Jj and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner Brian Burke and we just told </v>

620
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.530
<v Speaker 1>about English comedy for like 45 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

621
00:26:41.531 --> 00:26:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Talks about Monty Python,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Izzard and uh,</v>

622
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 1>the goons and the goodies and Derek and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clive and we did this whole thing.</v>

623
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:49.830
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing impressions for each other,</v>

624
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:55.250
<v Speaker 1>no audition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I left and I called my agent and he </v>

625
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.250
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did it go?</v>

626
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it went well,</v>

627
00:26:55.561 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't talk about the show.</v>

628
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 1>We just talked about comedy and goofed </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and stuff.</v>

629
00:26:59.371 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

630
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they got back in,</v>

631
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:03.570
<v Speaker 1>touch them and said we loved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

632
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:08.990
<v Speaker 1>they had this character of Charlie who </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time was this 55 year old rocker,</v>

633
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.020
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Robert Plant guy at the time that</v>

634
00:27:12.021 --> 00:27:17.021
<v Speaker 1>had been through all of it and was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tail end of his career and got stuck</v>

635
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:21.800
<v Speaker 1>on the island and they reworked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when Jj and I sat down,</v>

636
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is more frustrating for the artist </v>

637
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 1>to have the barest glimpse of fame?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got this one hit.</v>

638
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 1>And it all almost worked out his entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

639
00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:37.461
<v Speaker 1>It almost did it for him and it was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking island and he can't get </v>

640
00:27:37.461 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 1>back to the place where he could make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all happen.</v>

641
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:40.080
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

642
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jj love responded to that kind of </v>

643
00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:45.160
<v Speaker 1>frustration level.</v>

644
00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And I was just aware that it was gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a big deal.</v>

645
00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:49.830
<v Speaker 1>He directed the pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Co wrote the pilot,</v>

646
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.070
<v Speaker 1>it felt like something that was gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

647
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:56.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big and impressive and I trusted him.</v>

648
00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there wasn't a huge amount when,</v>

649
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.220
<v Speaker 1>when it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's a no brainer job like that,</v>

650
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

651
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:05.250
<v Speaker 1>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

652
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:10.251
<v Speaker 1>of course I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no living in Hawaii would be a </v>

653
00:28:10.251 --> 00:28:13.950
<v Speaker 1>really tough decision to make because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't mind one day living in Hawaii,</v>

654
00:28:13.951 --> 00:28:17.670
<v Speaker 1>but I would have to be really done with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>

655
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I could just done like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need something different in my life.</v>

656
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a job.</v>

657
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.440
<v Speaker 1>They want you to move to Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill.</v>

658
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Ooh Boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

659
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.860
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get island fever vault?</v>

660
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually didn't.</v>

661
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:33.060
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people in the cast did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm into jungles and forests and animals</v>

662
00:28:33.061 --> 00:28:38.061
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me I was kind of buzzed enough </v>

663
00:28:38.061 --> 00:28:39.270
<v Speaker 1>that I had said to them before I moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there because they were putting this</v>

664
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:40.080
<v Speaker 1>in houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

665
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:45.081
<v Speaker 1>can you put me in the jungle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you put me straight up in the </v>

666
00:28:45.081 --> 00:28:45.081
<v Speaker 1>jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a house,</v>

667
00:28:45.081 --> 00:28:46.890
<v Speaker 1>the surrounded by trees and animals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't know me,</v>

668
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.800
<v Speaker 1>the producers like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do that.</v>

669
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:53.810
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be on your own is going </v>

670
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.810
<v Speaker 1>to be nothing around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I wanted to do.</v>

671
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.670
<v Speaker 1>So I ended up moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in Kailua for a little bit.</v>

672
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Then moved to Atlanta guy for a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit with Atlanta.</v>

<v Speaker 1>very exclusive little part of the </v>

675

690
00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that I was just watching out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the window in my binoculars.</v>

691
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Fucking citing scope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

692
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 1>But Hawaii was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

693
00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:51.280
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was cool.</v>

694
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:52.630
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

695
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I learned to surf in New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a gnarly place to serve very </v>

696
00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.990
<v Speaker 1>cold waves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively dumb p waves.</v>

697
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no curl on that wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just picks you up and drops you.</v>

698
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Which if it's the first time you've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>served it,</v>

699
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:06.990
<v Speaker 1>you assume all waves of light that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be in a wetsuit.</v>

700
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Last time you had to be in buoys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

701
00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:10.430
<v Speaker 1>there were times where it was so cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

702
00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Come out of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd have to use two hands to unlock </v>

703
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.420
<v Speaker 1>my car door because I couldn't use one </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

704
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 1>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had frozen,</v>

705
00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:18.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'd have to go.</v>

706
00:30:18.251 --> 00:30:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

707
00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you moved to Hawaii boardshorts after </v>
<v Speaker 1>wear tee shirts,</v>

708
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:26.920
<v Speaker 1>water bottles everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

709
00:30:26.921 --> 00:30:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I was big on surfing and in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>month or so that I was in Hawaii,</v>

710
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I went to the apple store in Honolulu </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

711
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I met one of my favorite surfers of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

712
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I got called Kalani,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rob,</v>

713
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.400
<v Speaker 1>and when I was playing Kelly slater's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro surfer game,</v>

714
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I would always pick Kalani because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did the most radical moves,</v>

715
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:47.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm in the apple store,</v>

716
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.430
<v Speaker 1>he's there with his boys.</v>

717
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

718
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.640
<v Speaker 1>that's Kalani Romp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he comes up to me.</v>

719
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:52.210
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

720
00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:53.530
<v Speaker 1>you're that guy in load the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

721
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on now.</v>

722
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Kalani,</v>

723
00:30:57.581 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 1>rob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

724
00:30:58.121 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for like nine months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you help me out surfing?</v>

725
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:01.390
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

726
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:03.190
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go to the no show now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I came with him,</v>

727
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:05.430
<v Speaker 1>hung out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

728
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:09.360
<v Speaker 1>and we became really tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a huge story for a while.</v>

729
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:12.970
<v Speaker 1>For me it was getting to know Kalani.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he taught me into waves.</v>

730
00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:17.971
<v Speaker 1>I had no business being involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a place called goat island on </v>

731
00:31:17.971 --> 00:31:21.601
<v Speaker 1>the north shore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a heavy wave and you have to </v>

732
00:31:21.601 --> 00:31:24.631
<v Speaker 1>paddle out to an island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk across the island because then </v>

733
00:31:24.631 --> 00:31:25.270
<v Speaker 1>you're going to miss the break and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>paddle out past the break.</v>

734
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:30.270
<v Speaker 1>There's no concept of you're paddling </v>
<v Speaker 1>out through the break because it's so </v>

735
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.690
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as with Kalani and a few of his mates</v>

736
00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:33.490
<v Speaker 1>and we were all getting ready and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>came over to me,</v>

737
00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

738
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 1>this is the most hectic wave and ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take you into.</v>

739
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Stay close to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need help,</v>

740
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:44.340
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fuck around because it can kill </v>

741
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And don't go left.</v>

742
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Go right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

743
00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:46.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go right.</v>

744
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Go left because it's gonna appeal left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you go right,</v>

745
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.190
<v Speaker 1>you're in the braking zone and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

746
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

747
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:56.910
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sense of fucking terrible story </v>

748
00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:57.230
<v Speaker 1>coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we.</v>

749
00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:02.310
<v Speaker 1>So we paddle out and I'm having fun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching everyone in the lineup on </v>

750
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.420
<v Speaker 1>about 10 feet away from the drop zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm able to like sit down on the wave</v>

751
00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:06.700
<v Speaker 1>and watched people like get on the side.</v>

752
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright cool.</v>

753
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.310
<v Speaker 1>I got this fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

754
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I paddled,</v>

755
00:32:11.051 --> 00:32:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I battle a battle with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picks me up big like Oh shit,</v>

756
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.430
<v Speaker 1>super powerful drops me and I really try</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go left.</v>

757
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I like cut the board and then try and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

758
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:24.871
<v Speaker 1>But it's so powerful because breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>here on my left that it spits me to the </v>

759
00:32:24.871 --> 00:32:28.381
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fully aware that it sent me to the </v>

760
00:32:28.381 --> 00:32:28.381
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like okay shit,</v>

761
00:32:28.381 --> 00:32:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to wipe out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a big breath and paddle out.</v>

762
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.830
<v Speaker 1>So I wipe out are going to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as is usually the case with,</v>

763
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.140
<v Speaker 1>if you're surfing anything above </v>
<v Speaker 1>overhead,</v>

764
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>when you come up that wave's coming</v>

765
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.990
<v Speaker 5>for you against what you have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 5>take a huge breath,</v>

766
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.410
<v Speaker 5>go under and it's the next time you come</v>
<v Speaker 5>up do you can make progress because your</v>

767
00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:46.610
<v Speaker 5>out breath,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you disoriented.</v>

768
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.610
<v Speaker 5>I do that and Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just can't.</v>

769
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.330
<v Speaker 5>I can never catch a break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I go under,</v>

770
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 5>thrown around by the washing machine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come up the thing,</v>

771
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:55.340
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get on your board,</v>

772
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:56.840
<v Speaker 5>start paddling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look where's right there.</v>

773
00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>hold my breath,</v>

775
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:04.240
<v Speaker 5>come up again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm trying to time it so that I can </v>

776
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:04.240
<v Speaker 5>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just getting pounded,</v>

777
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:04.370
<v Speaker 5>pounded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pounded,</v>

778
00:33:04.371 --> 00:33:09.371
<v Speaker 5>pounded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And at one point I see Kalani paddling </v>

779
00:33:09.371 --> 00:33:09.371
<v Speaker 5>over to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

780
00:33:09.371 --> 00:33:09.371
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>

781
00:33:09.371 --> 00:33:13.391
<v Speaker 5>We're going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Kalani comes up to me and he's like </v>

782
00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:16.270
<v Speaker 5>mad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I've never really heard him you </v>

783
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:16.270
<v Speaker 5>metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

784
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:16.270
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get on your board and go that way.</v>

785
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:16.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

786
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 5>that's what I've been trying to do for </v>
<v Speaker 5>like 10 minutes.</v>

787
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.490
<v Speaker 5>But so now he's behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's paddling,</v>

788
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm paddling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's pushing me,</v>

789
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.100
<v Speaker 5>paddling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pushing me,</v>

790
00:33:25.101 --> 00:33:30.101
<v Speaker 5>paddling like fucking superman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we eventually get out past the </v>

791
00:33:30.101 --> 00:33:30.101
<v Speaker 5>break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's like,</v>

792
00:33:30.101 --> 00:33:30.950
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you going to sit here for 20 minutes and</v>

793
00:33:30.951 --> 00:33:33.740
<v Speaker 5>then when I'm done you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>paddle in with me safe.</v>

794
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:34.370
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

795
00:33:34.371 --> 00:33:35.030
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got it.</v>

796
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 5>So when we come in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

797
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:41.771
<v Speaker 5>the reason why I came in to get it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>not only were you in the drop zone but </v>

798
00:33:41.771 --> 00:33:44.180
<v Speaker 5>you were like completely lacking of any </v>
<v Speaker 5>color on your face.</v>

799
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.070
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in the lineup was saying,</v>

800
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:48.020
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go get your boy because he's in trouble.</v>

801
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.210
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was handling it.</v>

802
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.970
<v Speaker 5>I was definitely out of breath and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little fucked up,</v>

803
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.700
<v Speaker 5>but he's a wharton.</v>

804
00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:54.680
<v Speaker 5>Then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

921
00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:30.381
<v Speaker 2>little risky and dangerous and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're willing to get out the next </v>

922
00:38:30.381 --> 00:38:33.890
<v Speaker 2>day and do it again and get the next day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not get pounded down in the same way</v>

923
00:38:33.961 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 2>that other people might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

924
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.550
<v Speaker 4>That's their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

925
00:38:37.551 --> 00:38:39.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what Jimmy Kimmel is best at.</v>

926
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got,</v>

927
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:42.970
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a fantastic work ethic and he's</v>

928
00:38:42.971 --> 00:38:45.660
<v Speaker 4>obviously a brilliant guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what he wants to do.</v>

929
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.020
<v Speaker 4>His thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

930
00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 4>like it works for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a beautiful gig too because you can</v>

931
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:53.110
<v Speaker 4>never rest on your laurels because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't matter.</v>

932
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 4>Tomorrow there's another show that show </v>
<v Speaker 4>has to be good as well.</v>

933
00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Like can you need new jokes and you need</v>
<v Speaker 4>new sketches and you need new gags to </v>

934
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:05.101
<v Speaker 4>pull off and you have new guest to </v>
<v Speaker 4>review and to go over what they're </v>

935
00:39:05.101 --> 00:39:05.101
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

936
00:39:05.101 --> 00:39:08.340
<v Speaker 5>And he's done a lot of jumping up Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a way that I really respect.</v>

937
00:39:08.341 --> 00:39:13.341
<v Speaker 5>Like I did a show a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe 12 years ago and at that point,</v>

938
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.010
<v Speaker 5>you know it's has different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a little bigger than,</v>

939
00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:21.011
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quite gray suits to fit yet the whole </v>

940
00:39:21.011 --> 00:39:21.011
<v Speaker 5>facade of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

941
00:39:21.011 --> 00:39:23.550
<v Speaker 5>he was being worked on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Jimmy,</v>

942
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:28.940
<v Speaker 5>I think his drive and maybe the drive of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that he surrounds himself </v>

943
00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:28.940
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

944
00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.331
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he jumped up when he did the Matt Damon </v>

945
00:39:32.331 --> 00:39:32.331
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He jumped up when he interviewed Obama.</v>

946
00:39:32.331 --> 00:39:33.130
<v Speaker 5>He jumped up when he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

947
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:38.160
<v Speaker 5>so it always hair and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of dropped a few pounds and so it </v>

948
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.540
<v Speaker 5>dies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Suit like he has a drive.</v>

949
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:44.570
<v Speaker 5>There's no sense of complacency with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jimmy and I find that seems to be </v>

950
00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.400
<v Speaker 5>relatively concurrent with talk show </v>
<v Speaker 5>hosts,</v>

951
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:52.640
<v Speaker 5>Conan's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's always reaching to know what I </v>

952
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:52.640
<v Speaker 5>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's never like,</v>

953
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:52.640
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're done this the show.</v>

954
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.430
<v Speaker 5>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just dial in reaching.</v>

955
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:58.550
<v Speaker 5>I appreciate watching people reach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's why I'm a huge fan of athletes in </v>

956
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.550
<v Speaker 5>general,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

957
00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.400
<v Speaker 5>I always feel like athletes are always </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying for that next thing.</v>

958
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

959
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.640
<v Speaker 4>it's finding comfort and happiness in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that struggle,</v>

960
00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:11.560
<v Speaker 4>enjoying the process that's very </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult for people and for some people</v>

961
00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:16.561
<v Speaker 4>that the monotony of showing up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it all over again that wears on </v>

962
00:40:16.561 --> 00:40:20.431
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really just about finding whatever </v>

963
00:40:20.431 --> 00:40:22.531
<v Speaker 4>the fuck it is for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For some people it's not that for some </v>

964
00:40:22.531 --> 00:40:25.621
<v Speaker 4>people it's they kind of go to an </v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Bourdain is an interesting cat </v>

965
00:40:25.621 --> 00:40:26.260
<v Speaker 4>and he had him on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

966
00:40:26.261 --> 00:40:27.280
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a while ago,</v>

967
00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:32.281
<v Speaker 4>but I've talked to him a gang of times </v>
<v Speaker 4>that UFC is a huge UFC as a firearm </v>

968
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 4>while his wife trains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think she's,</v>

969
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.720
<v Speaker 4>she's competed in Jujitsu tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

970
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.430
<v Speaker 4>she's a mad man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mad woman rather.</v>

971
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:42.610
<v Speaker 4>And he's doing it now as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's doing Jujitsu now,</v>

972
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:47.210
<v Speaker 4>but the point being that he's a guy that</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't feel like he,</v>

973
00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.760
<v Speaker 4>if he's home for a week or two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

974
00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:49.660
<v Speaker 4>I gotta get the fuck out of here.</v>

975
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:55.020
<v Speaker 4>He's just constantly wants to go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Libya or Africa or China just want,</v>

976
00:40:56.170 --> 00:41:01.170
<v Speaker 4>he just wants to experience it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his work is going to places and </v>

977
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.210
<v Speaker 4>experiencing these completely different </v>
<v Speaker 4>worlds.</v>

978
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.760
<v Speaker 4>That's where it's where it's at for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So He's,</v>

979
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:11.761
<v Speaker 4>he got a totally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a totally unique way of being </v>

980
00:41:11.761 --> 00:41:15.631
<v Speaker 4>ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very different than like a talk show </v>

981
00:41:15.631 --> 00:41:18.511
<v Speaker 4>host would show up and the same writers </v>
<v Speaker 4>room and drink the coffee and bang up </v>

982
00:41:18.511 --> 00:41:22.951
<v Speaker 4>the jokes and he's just as ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But his ambition is to go to Moscow to </v>

983
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.840
<v Speaker 4>try their food and talk to their people.</v>

984
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he also,</v>

985
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't know him at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's fantastic.</v>

986
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.440
<v Speaker 5>I read kitchen confidential years ago </v>
<v Speaker 5>when it first came out and I thought,</v>

987
00:41:31.441 --> 00:41:32.640
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy's insane.</v>

988
00:41:32.641 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 5>And then obviously you blow up on TV.</v>

989
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.970
<v Speaker 1>He also has a through line of an addict </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his work.</v>

990
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:43.510
<v Speaker 1>He was an ex addict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He holds his hands up and says that I </v>

991
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.380
<v Speaker 1>think when you meet a lot of ex addicts </v>
<v Speaker 1>or even addicts,</v>

992
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:50.470
<v Speaker 1>they have that thing that they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>which completely takes hold of their </v>

993
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:54.371
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is stopping them from doing the </v>

994
00:41:54.371 --> 00:41:54.371
<v Speaker 1>drug that they're addicted to and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

995
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:59.830
<v Speaker 1>If they chill and relaxed then that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Damon's going to come in and hang </v>

996
00:41:59.830 --> 00:41:59.830
<v Speaker 1>out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think baudins light,</v>

997
00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:03.560
<v Speaker 1>well if I spend 10 days at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that month is going to come out.</v>

998
00:42:03.561 --> 00:42:04.950
<v Speaker 1>So he has to keep me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

999
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him well enough to know if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true or not,</v>

1000
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:12.560
<v Speaker 1>but I know enough addicts that say I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be on the new thing.</v>

1001
00:42:12.561 --> 00:42:14.030
<v Speaker 1>I have to be moving to the new place.</v>

1002
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Your character was an addict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1003
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Did you have to do a lot of research </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that?</v>

1004
00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 1>They didn't ask me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I've had my own,</v>

1005
00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun,</v>

1006
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.990
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great Jenny with drugs in my life,</v>

1007
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that Gray Bill Hicks joke </v>

1008
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:32.360
<v Speaker 1>where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great time on drugs.</v>

1009
00:42:32.361 --> 00:42:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1010
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.100
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to tell people to do drugs.</v>

1011
00:42:37.101 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very personal thing.</v>

1012
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky enough to come from a family</v>
<v Speaker 1>background that was very consistent and </v>

1013
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.050
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1014
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.490
<v Speaker 1>my parents have been married for 42 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1015
00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I always came back to a household where </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner was on the table regardless with </v>

1016
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:55.580
<v Speaker 1>that eight or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1017
00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:01.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a foundation of something that I think </v>

1018
00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.930
<v Speaker 1>made me feel secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1019
00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.300
<v Speaker 1>got interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was always interested in music,</v>

1020
00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:07.850
<v Speaker 1>got interested in the Beatles when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 12,</v>

1021
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.410
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>

1022
00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I started reading up about them and read</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rubber sole and sergeant peppers and</v>

1023
00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 1>the white album were very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by drugs and thought,</v>

1024
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:23.440
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because I feel </v>

1025
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.181
<v Speaker 1>autistic and I'd like to see if I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make that artistic flower bloom a little</v>

1026
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:27.530
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that point,</v>

1027
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:32.560
<v Speaker 1>me and three other bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fans at my school site side started to </v>

1028
00:43:32.781 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 1>seek out marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we ended up getting hold of.</v>

1029
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 1>And he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a typical thing when your kids were,</v>

1030
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will smoke a joint in two and half </v>

1031
00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.741
<v Speaker 1>minutes and everyone feels lightheaded </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them puked and then you get </v>

1032
00:43:47.741 --> 00:43:50.441
<v Speaker 1>nervous and paranoid and you run off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're never going to do it </v>

1033
00:43:50.441 --> 00:43:50.441
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1034
00:43:50.441 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 1>and then you do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd do it again.</v>

1035
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.410
<v Speaker 1>And then at one point you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1036
00:43:52.411 --> 00:43:53.780
<v Speaker 1>it hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1037
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1038
00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.220
<v Speaker 1>So I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1039
00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:03.340
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember as I'm a very dedicated </v>

1040
00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:03.340
<v Speaker 1>worker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1041
00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I never do drugs when I'm </v>

1042
00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:11.051
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my downtime on my weekends I </v>

1043
00:44:11.051 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 1>might do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I flew my brother out to New Zealand</v>

1044
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:15.620
<v Speaker 1>to come check us all out making Lord of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rings.</v>

1045
00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.320
<v Speaker 1>And at the time I was heavily into </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

1046
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:23.350
<v Speaker 1>probably the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was into it in my life and I would </v>

1047
00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:24.740
<v Speaker 1>roll like 20 joints and put them in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarette box.</v>

1048
00:44:24.741 --> 00:44:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I never smoked cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in a cigarette box that someone</v>

1049
00:44:26.531 --> 00:44:28.790
<v Speaker 1>had given to me and I would just walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the house,</v>

1050
00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:33.791
<v Speaker 1>just smoking joints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm smoking cigarettes and my </v>

1051
00:44:33.791 --> 00:44:33.791
<v Speaker 1>brother who is only 16 months older than</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1052
00:44:33.791 --> 00:44:35.340
<v Speaker 1>he sat me down at one point in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape and he was like,</v>

1053
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anyone smoke as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed as you and how are you functioning </v>

1054
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you should consider not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1055
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.900
<v Speaker 1>And I was a highly functioning stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1056
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:43.800
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

1057
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:45.300
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1058
00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:50.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gone in different journeys in my </v>

1059
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:50.610
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think when I met Jj,</v>

1060
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:56.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd spent 18 months in la having not </v>

1061
00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:03.510
<v Speaker 1>worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposing myself to La for the first time</v>

1062
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and not necessarily on the biggest part </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen,</v>

1063
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:10.650
<v Speaker 1>but certainly on a bit of a party scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with the wrong people,</v>

1064
00:45:10.651 --> 00:45:15.651
<v Speaker 1>the wrong women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think Jay Jay's perceptive enough </v>

1065
00:45:15.651 --> 00:45:16.770
<v Speaker 1>to probably see when I came into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting,</v>

1066
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.400
<v Speaker 1>like I was a bit rough around the edges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't shave.</v>

1067
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:21.930
<v Speaker 1>He knows what it means to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hangover.</v>

1068
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.070
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1069
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:25.140
<v Speaker 1>he knows what it means when we say </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain buzzwords,</v>

1070
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:28.470
<v Speaker 1>so he could have danced in these arenas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1071
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1072
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:36.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a cautionary tale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think drugs and I'm really careful </v>

1073
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.290
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1074
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1075
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware that there are young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who might follow me on twitter or follow</v>

1076
00:45:42.451 --> 00:45:45.600
<v Speaker 1>me on instagram that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would think,</v>

1077
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if he's done it,</v>

1078
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:47.760
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>

1079
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't subscribe to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you have to have your own </v>

1080
00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:52.940
<v Speaker 1>journey and you have to have your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

1081
00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:57.150
<v Speaker 1>But the abuse of drugs has never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's been in my life.</v>

1082
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:01.320
<v Speaker 1>The usage of drugs has been something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've done more often than not.</v>

1083
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.910
<v Speaker 1>If I'm partaking in some sort of drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a notebook and a pen close enough</v>

1084
00:46:05.911 --> 00:46:10.911
<v Speaker 1>by me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I feel like I'm inventing the </v>

1085
00:46:10.911 --> 00:46:10.911
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can write it down and then the morning</v>

1086
00:46:10.911 --> 00:46:11.370
<v Speaker 1>when I wake up I can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1087
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a positive element of that thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took,</v>

1088
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like searching for stuff.</v>

1089
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:22.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think searching for stuff in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>world can be quite significant.</v>

1090
00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very honest interpretation or </v>

1091
00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:29.420
<v Speaker 3>very honest expression of what drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1092
00:46:29.421 --> 00:46:34.421
<v Speaker 3>Some drugs can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the problems with </v>

1093
00:46:34.421 --> 00:46:37.190
<v Speaker 3>someone seeing you on social media or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some young kid saying,</v>

1094
00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.270
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he takes him,</v>

1095
00:46:38.271 --> 00:46:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could take them there.</v>

1096
00:46:39.471 --> 00:46:44.471
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only reason why they would have </v>

1097
00:46:44.471 --> 00:46:44.600
<v Speaker 3>that thought at all is because they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been lied to so much.</v>

1098
00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:49.601
<v Speaker 3>There's so much bullshit on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much nancy grace and </v>

1099
00:46:49.601 --> 00:46:53.021
<v Speaker 3>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And marijuana is more dangerous today </v>

1100
00:46:53.021 --> 00:46:55.010
<v Speaker 3>than at anytime in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still Marijuana.</v>

1101
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:56.210
<v Speaker 3>The end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just pot.</v>

1102
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:58.250
<v Speaker 3>He has nobody's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing happens.</v>

1103
00:46:58.580 --> 00:46:59.960
<v Speaker 3>You get paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wake up,</v>

1104
00:46:59.961 --> 00:47:01.450
<v Speaker 3>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No hangover.</v>

1105
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.890
<v Speaker 3>Your bones don't ache.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're really okay.</v>

1106
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.590
<v Speaker 3>No one died on an overdose of marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 3>and history of the planet.</v>

1107
00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.800
<v Speaker 3>You're saying that you will use to abuse</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1108
00:47:09.801 --> 00:47:11.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like even your abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1109
00:47:11.871 --> 00:47:15.290
<v Speaker 3>you're functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not throwing up in your own bed.</v>

1110
00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:16.510
<v Speaker 3>And No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1111
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had,</v>

1112
00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several moments in my life where I've </v>

1113
00:47:23.231 --> 00:47:24.790
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1114
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.040
<v Speaker 1>go flush that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you did it last night,</v>

1115
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to do it tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to do it tomorrow.</v>

1116
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1117
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.800
<v Speaker 5>It's Thursday night in moving into </v>
<v Speaker 5>Friday night.</v>

1118
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:34.180
<v Speaker 5>You're not doing anything tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1119
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:36.790
<v Speaker 5>that little monster is going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that drawer,</v>

1120
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.560
<v Speaker 5>flush it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's only been pot.</v>

1121
00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:39.380
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1122
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Been everything that's been everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1123
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:45.340
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird one to taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1124
00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:47.370
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't usually taunt people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1125
00:47:47.371 --> 00:47:50.220
<v Speaker 3>I find the friends that I have that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

1126
00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:55.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would classify as addicted to </v>

1127
00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:55.310
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1128
00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:56.580
<v Speaker 3>they do it because that's what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>think they do.</v>

1129
00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:58.710
<v Speaker 3>They get up and they do it because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like,</v>

1130
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:04.100
<v Speaker 3>it certainly can be an escape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also a comfort and a lot of </v>

1131
00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.820
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that thing that you do,</v>

1132
00:48:05.821 --> 00:48:08.250
<v Speaker 3>like coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that can't get coffee,</v>

1133
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:09.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1134
00:48:09.061 --> 00:48:10.140
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get up in the morning,</v>

1135
00:48:10.141 --> 00:48:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I need that cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a ritualistic,</v>

1136
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.690
<v Speaker 3>comforting sort of a thing that they do.</v>

1137
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean another way to describe it would </v>
<v Speaker 5>be a crutch.</v>

1138
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:20.050
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that is a negative connotation.</v>

1139
00:48:20.051 --> 00:48:22.240
<v Speaker 5>You don't necessarily want something in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your life that as a crutch,</v>

1140
00:48:22.241 --> 00:48:27.241
<v Speaker 5>whether that is marijuana or cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or having to call your mom every day or </v>

1141
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.230
<v Speaker 5>needing to have the new Levi's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever that is.</v>

1142
00:48:29.231 --> 00:48:31.360
<v Speaker 5>If it's a crutch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not good the best.</v>

1143
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:36.480
<v Speaker 5>If we're just talking about wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the best times for me on we'd have been </v>

1144
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.750
<v Speaker 5>ingesting it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't tend to smoke anymore.</v>

1145
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:42.751
<v Speaker 5>I put it in brownies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ingesting it in a way that makes the </v>

1146
00:48:42.751 --> 00:48:43.690
<v Speaker 5>next experience that I'm going to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>much more colorful.</v>

<v Speaker 5>heaven that playing Sigur Ros is the </v>

<v Speaker 3>I can just order that shit up on my </v>

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't even have to do it now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>download it.</v>

1172
00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.810
<v Speaker 3>I could sit in my car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it on the itunes,</v>

1173
00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.850
<v Speaker 3>plugging into the dash and then it'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>start playing.</v>

1174
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:03.110
<v Speaker 5>That's very cool to society that we live</v>
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>

1176
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:06.320
<v Speaker 5>So wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I have an issue with the cloud.</v>

1177
00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't like this clown</v>

1178
00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 3>thing is a lot of weirdness is </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely out of weirdness in the whole</v>

1179
00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 3>idea of the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that from happening,</v>

1180
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.800
<v Speaker 3>that happened and all these poor folks </v>
<v Speaker 3>that had their porn up there got </v>

1181
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.680
<v Speaker 3>exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a,</v>

1182
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:25.710
<v Speaker 3>that's a tiny tremor that will lead to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate earthquake that evades or a</v>

1183
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 3>privacy rather.</v>

1184
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:33.340
<v Speaker 2>It killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It killed the cloud in a lot of </v>

1185
00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:33.340
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happening thing.</v>

1186
00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.120
<v Speaker 2>But also like not for the dudes who </v>
<v Speaker 2>jerked off like wild monkeys.</v>

1187
00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:37.190
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1188
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:39.930
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At Jamie,</v>

1189
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's got fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard drive filled with fat burning </v>

1190
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.941
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like if I really liked the film and </v>

1191
00:50:48.941 --> 00:50:53.201
<v Speaker 2>I watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's streaming from watching it on </v>

1192
00:50:53.201 --> 00:50:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I really found guaranteed I'm going </v>

1193
00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.461
<v Speaker 2>to buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go buy it on DVD because I want the </v>

1194
00:50:57.461 --> 00:50:59.501
<v Speaker 2>actual article wanting in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the same with music.</v>

1195
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:04.750
<v Speaker 2>If I like an album,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go buy that CD and I don't </v>

1196
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.750
<v Speaker 2>want that medium to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1197
00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1198
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I was at the bookstore the other day </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my mother in law and she was </v>

1199
00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.260
<v Speaker 2>talking about a Zepplin how so the holy </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there and they,</v>

1200
00:51:14.261 --> 00:51:19.261
<v Speaker 2>they're selling these new vinyl versions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of houses of the holy and like Barnes </v>

1201
00:51:20.271 --> 00:51:21.740
<v Speaker 2>and noble in thousand oaks.</v>

1202
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:25.430
<v Speaker 2>They filed these fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these albums and it's wild.</v>

1203
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:30.431
<v Speaker 2>Like these are 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 seventies albums and people are </v>

1204
00:51:30.431 --> 00:51:33.440
<v Speaker 2>buying records and turntables and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting into the actual physical</v>

1205
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:37.490
<v Speaker 2>medium again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opening it up and it's cool.</v>

1206
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think the vinyl culture is </v>

1207
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.291
<v Speaker 2>really fantastic and that is great that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the vinyl thing Kinda came back around </v>

1208
00:51:44.291 --> 00:51:47.831
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that those select artists </v>

1209
00:51:47.831 --> 00:51:49.550
<v Speaker 2>that make their way onto vinyl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1210
00:51:49.551 --> 00:51:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Jimi Hendrix is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elvis's you'd led Zeppelin's,</v>

1211
00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 2>you'd deals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll always be around,</v>

1212
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:55.310
<v Speaker 2>but the smaller ones they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1213
00:51:55.311 --> 00:51:56.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not big enough to go on vinyl,</v>

1214
00:51:56.961 --> 00:51:58.970
<v Speaker 2>so let's just put them on digital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to want him.</v>

1215
00:51:58.971 --> 00:52:03.971
<v Speaker 2>We'll put him on digital in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me sad that there are albums </v>

1216
00:52:03.971 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 2>that I own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I break that CD,</v>

1217
00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:09.380
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be very difficult for me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get it unless I pay $69 99 on Ebay in</v>

1218
00:52:09.381 --> 00:52:09.730
<v Speaker 2>the night.</v>

1219
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Get a copy of that's been previously </v>
<v Speaker 2>used.</v>

1220
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some comic Belper released a Carnegie </v>

1221
00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Hall special that he did on the album as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a vinyl thing where I think that's Kinda</v>

1222
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:21.320
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was a kid that was a big thing</v>

1223
00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:26.321
<v Speaker 2>was listening to like cheech and Chong </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bill cosby unfortunately arrested </v>

1224
00:52:26.321 --> 00:52:30.720
<v Speaker 2>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still friendly recipes because they're </v>

1225
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:30.720
<v Speaker 2>the real bill cosby's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1226
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.990
<v Speaker 2>It's still funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still fun.</v>

1227
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very funny.</v>

1228
00:52:33.171 --> 00:52:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean that to me is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>

1229
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:40.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say you could say scandals.</v>

1230
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Tragedies are horrific crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

1231
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.890
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1232
00:52:45.891 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 2>that guy turned out to be a rapist and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just a,</v>

1233
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:54.970
<v Speaker 2>a just a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a guy who drug people and fuck them </v>

1234
00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:56.690
<v Speaker 2>while they're unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy was that right?</v>

1235
00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.760
<v Speaker 2>That's still bends my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1236
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.340
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a profound fall from grace.</v>

1237
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a fall from grace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1238
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:06.110
<v Speaker 2>it's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it like twists the world.</v>

1241
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.120

<v Speaker 2>Bill cosby's a rapist.</v>

1242

<v Speaker 2>everybody to not swear.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1249
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:31.430
<v Speaker 4>Family Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the guy that you want to pick you </v>

1250
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.430
<v Speaker 4>up and sit on your knee and give you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>life lesson.</v>

1251
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:35.750
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want him to sit on his knee </v>

1252

<v Speaker 4>when I was here or if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucking don't drink anything.</v>

<v Speaker 4>When I was a kid,</v>

1254
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.190
<v Speaker 4>we used to listen to that album where he</v>
<v Speaker 4>would talk about Noah and the Ark.</v>

1255
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 4>Noah having that conversation with God </v>
<v Speaker 4>where God was.</v>

1256
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.340
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1257
00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.540
<v Speaker 4>it's God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1258
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:49.260
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1259
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.670

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1260
00:53:50.671 --> 00:53:55.671
<v Speaker 4>It was a great bit with no and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>believing that God really wanted him to </v>

1261
00:53:55.671 --> 00:53:56.490
<v Speaker 4>go out and build this ark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1262
00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

1263
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:00.780
<v Speaker 4>that was how we listened to comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would all sit around and we'd put the</v>

1264
00:54:00.781 --> 00:54:04.650
<v Speaker 4>headphones on and we would all sit </v>
<v Speaker 4>around and listen to this,</v>

1265
00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:10.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's cheech and Chong or we got </v>

1266
00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.410
<v Speaker 4>a hold of some oral old George Carlin </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack.</v>

1267
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:13.590
<v Speaker 4>Then so dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so edgy,</v>

1268
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 4>so brave guy and wasn't in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning,</v>

1269
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:21.290
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's an interesting lesson </v>

1270
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.290
<v Speaker 4>if you go see George Carlin's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the early,</v>

1271
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.290
<v Speaker 4>early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early stuff,</v>

1272
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:24.780
<v Speaker 4>it was like straight up tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Show TV friendly comedy.</v>

1273
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:29.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And somewhere along the line he just </v>

1274
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:29.800
<v Speaker 4>cut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinda twisted.</v>

1275
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never knew him,</v>

1276
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:35.661
<v Speaker 4>never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get the feeling that he got angry </v>

1277
00:54:35.661 --> 00:54:37.600
<v Speaker 4>about something and stop giving a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what his real voice came from</v>

1278
00:54:37.601 --> 00:54:38.190
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just like,</v>

1279
00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:40.710
<v Speaker 4>fuck this man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to get famous.</v>

1280
00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:42.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at my own late night talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

1281
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:43.110
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1282
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:46.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's what his goal was</v>
<v Speaker 4>or who knows,</v>

1283
00:54:46.261 --> 00:54:48.180
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was like Bill Hicks was </v>
<v Speaker 4>living like that,</v>

1284
00:54:48.181 --> 00:54:48.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1285
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:51.150

<v Speaker 4>His material was fantastic,</v>

1286
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:53.130
<v Speaker 4>but there was a point where he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this.</v>

1287
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 4>Like I see the fucking rip in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe,</v>

<v Speaker 4>out to all you guys.</v>

1289
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:02.090

<v Speaker 4>I met.</v>

<v Speaker 4>room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was maybe 200 5,300</v>

1301
00:55:33.481 --> 00:55:34.620
<v Speaker 4>people in the room when he started.</v>

1302
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:39.330
<v Speaker 4>By the time he was done there was 50 and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were all screaming in the mood.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd been,</v>

1305
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:45.870

<v Speaker 4>but the comics were laughing hard.</v>

1306
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.850
<v Speaker 4>We were laughing hard and a few people </v>
<v Speaker 4>were laughing hard,</v>

1307
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:53.870
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a few people in the </v>

1308
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:55.191
<v Speaker 4>audience that was trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 4>what everybody was laughing at that </v>

1309
00:55:55.191 --> 00:55:55.530
<v Speaker 4>stuck around and try to save like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I missing out on something cool here?</v>

1310
00:55:55.531 --> 00:55:56.190
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes you are.</v>

1311
00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1312
00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:02.360
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went on after a guy who was like </v>

1313
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:02.360
<v Speaker 4>really hacky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy went on before was like,</v>

1314
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:05.520
<v Speaker 4>he was doing impressions of cartoon </v>
<v Speaker 4>characters if they smoke marijuana,</v>

1315
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a real standard,</v>

1316
00:56:07.711 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 4>like I mean like straight across the </v>
<v Speaker 4>board,</v>

1317
00:56:09.421 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 4>like cop donut jokes and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>flown on an airplane and they,</v>

1318
00:56:13.411 --> 00:56:18.411
<v Speaker 4>the audience was fairly dimwitted and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were enjoying this really stupid </v>

1319
00:56:18.411 --> 00:56:23.130
<v Speaker 4>comedy and then Hicks came out and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>did all this really radical,</v>

1320
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 4>crazy shit</v>

1321
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.220
<v Speaker 2>that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just weren't hearing it and they </v>

1322
00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:29.220
<v Speaker 2>just got up and sometimes it's difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in the presence of genius.</v>

1323
00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it tends to be standup.</v>

1324
00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.890
<v Speaker 2>I think of his genius is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal.</v>

1325
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Rolling Stone interview with a John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lennon with the guy who invented </v>

1326
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:38.440
<v Speaker 2>rollingstone yen went to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1327
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:44.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had the edited versions about 40 </v>

1328
00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.961
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got about three hours of it and </v>

1329
00:56:45.961 --> 00:56:48.661
<v Speaker 2>landon gets angry about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a genius and he's having to perform</v>

1330
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:51.820
<v Speaker 2>like a clown in front of these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>retards that don't get it,</v>

1331
00:56:51.821 --> 00:56:56.821
<v Speaker 2>and he resents like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I resent the fact that they're not </v>

1332
00:56:56.821 --> 00:56:58.150
<v Speaker 2>receiving it and they're also telling me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Maya is x,</v>

1333
00:56:58.151 --> 00:56:58.750
<v Speaker 2>y,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and zed.</v>

1334
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.730
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to fucking tell me what my</v>
<v Speaker 2>art is.</v>

1335
00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm the iced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just sit there and fucking listen to</v>

1336
00:57:03.971 --> 00:57:04.780
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1337
00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1338
00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.000
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to get it.</v>

1339
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:08.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Hicks thing,</v>

1340
00:57:08.411 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 2>what was going on was that he hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>found those people yet.</v>

1341
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:14.830
<v Speaker 2>This was all pre internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so no one had.</v>

1342
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:19.860
<v Speaker 2>No one knew what he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they were going to go see a guy who </v>

1343
00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:23.431
<v Speaker 2>was a funny comedian and they had seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>him on the Rodney dangerfield comic </v>

1344
00:57:23.431 --> 00:57:28.141
<v Speaker 2>special on Hbo and he only did like </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven minutes on that or whatever the </v>

1345
00:57:28.141 --> 00:57:28.141
<v Speaker 2>hell it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever they do.</v>

1346
00:57:28.141 --> 00:57:29.980
<v Speaker 2>It was a very small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>short,</v>

1347
00:57:29.981 --> 00:57:31.720
<v Speaker 2>funny set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was funny,</v>

1348
00:57:31.721 --> 00:57:36.721
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of jokes and so people went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see him a lot based on that and they </v>

1349
00:57:36.721 --> 00:57:37.180
<v Speaker 2>went to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1350
00:57:37.181 --> 00:57:39.300
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is all this anger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1351
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:42.430
<v Speaker 2>he hadn't really found that audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

1352
00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he died huge biggest standup </v>

1353
00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.110
<v Speaker 2>comedian in England for probably four </v>
<v Speaker 2>years earlier when he wouldn't a ward,</v>

1354
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.340
<v Speaker 2>which is at the Edinburgh fringe </v>
<v Speaker 2>festival.</v>

1355
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:53.110
<v Speaker 2>And he was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1356
00:57:53.111 --> 00:57:58.111
<v Speaker 2>by the time he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the Jim Morrison of standup </v>

1357
00:57:58.111 --> 00:57:58.111
<v Speaker 2>comedy for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1358
00:57:58.111 --> 00:58:00.670
<v Speaker 2>he did relentless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He filmed it live in England,</v>

1359
00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:03.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you wrote a very risky thing to do.</v>

1360
00:58:03.341 --> 00:58:06.790
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't his best special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very tight and one of the reasons</v>

1361
00:58:06.791 --> 00:58:09.910
<v Speaker 2>is because it was all one take was one </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

1362
00:58:09.911 --> 00:58:13.180
<v Speaker 2>one take and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an hbo special,</v>

1363
00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:16.300
<v Speaker 2>so it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1364
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:19.000
<v Speaker 2>he was a guy that if he found his </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

1365
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.580
<v Speaker 2>if they knew where to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1366
00:58:21.581 --> 00:58:23.230
<v Speaker 2>like today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he was alive today,</v>

1367
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:28.410
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would have been so fucking monster </v>

1368
00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:28.690
<v Speaker 2>following be the king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the king or one of the Kings,</v>

1369
00:58:28.691 --> 00:58:33.040
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a finding.</v>

1370
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Then we'd find out that he's drugging </v>
<v Speaker 2>jerks.</v>

1371
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1372
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:39.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>

1373
00:58:39.401 --> 00:58:41.560
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love what Louis Ck is doing right now.</v>

1374
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1439
01:01:17.771 --> 01:01:22.390
<v Speaker 4>with a microphone and if anyone did know</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people will shut the fuck up and </v>

1440
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:26.270
<v Speaker 4>laugh or just politely leave because </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the disrespect shown by hecklers to</v>

1446
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.910

<v Speaker 4>It's too easy to speak up.</v>

1448
01:01:41.151 --> 01:01:46.151
<v Speaker 4>It's too easy to take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too easy to just have an opinion </v>

1449
01:01:46.151 --> 01:01:49.040
<v Speaker 4>that's not nuanced and not objective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's to easy shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just so many of them and they're</v>

1456
01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.461
<v Speaker 4>just dim witted dumb people that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't have that ability to speak to </v>

<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they do.</v>

1458
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.690
<v Speaker 4>So they are just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are not smart.</v>

1459
01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:14.030
<v Speaker 4>They're not sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not thinking,</v>

1460
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.900
<v Speaker 4>but they look forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you deal with hecklers?</v>

1466
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.080

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:23.340
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't encourage it.</v>

1489
01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:27.240
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but occasionally it works and that's not</v>

1490
01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:28.780
<v Speaker 4>a mean spirited thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1491
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:33.420
<v Speaker 4>it's like sometimes people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just want to be a part of it.</v>

1492
01:03:33.421 --> 01:03:38.421
<v Speaker 4>They want to get a little drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to say something and it's all </v>

1493
01:03:38.421 --> 01:03:39.490
<v Speaker 4>different and then sometimes you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>get more on.</v>

1494
01:03:39.491 --> 01:03:44.040
<v Speaker 4>So sometimes you could just get people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that just really don't.</v>

1495
01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:46.230
<v Speaker 4>They don't deserve to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>

1496
01:03:46.231 --> 01:03:47.760
<v Speaker 4>they can't handle the experience.</v>

1497
01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:52.810
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that as an audience member,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that where people are yelling </v>

1498
01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:53.550
<v Speaker 4>out and you just want to grab them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>drag them out of there.</v>

1499
01:03:53.551 --> 01:03:54.840
<v Speaker 4>Like that guy on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just,</v>

1500
01:03:54.841 --> 01:03:58.320
<v Speaker 4>you should not be talking to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking it up for the other 300,</v>

1501
01:03:58.321 --> 01:04:00.460
<v Speaker 4>99 people in this fucking room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1502
01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:05.540
<v Speaker 4>You're so egocentric that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrating on yourself and your own </v>

1503
01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.270
<v Speaker 4>what you like and don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a couple too many drinks at the</v>

1504
01:04:06.271 --> 01:04:11.271
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got talked into coming to the </v>

1505
01:04:11.271 --> 01:04:11.271
<v Speaker 4>comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't.</v>

1506
01:04:11.271 --> 01:04:11.710
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what it is and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1507
01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:13.120
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark room,</v>

1508
01:04:13.121 --> 01:04:15.030
<v Speaker 4>but I'm supposed to show up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in the middle of token.</v>

1509
01:04:15.031 --> 01:04:20.031
<v Speaker 4>It didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to keep talking this that </v>

1510
01:04:20.031 --> 01:04:20.031
<v Speaker 4>there's alcohol which really fucks with </v>
<v Speaker 4>judgment and this also.</v>

1511
01:04:20.031 --> 01:04:24.980
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people have this really bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 4>and titled Thing where they're entitled </v>

1512
01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:29.571
<v Speaker 4>to their opinions and they feel like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something that they're allowed </v>

1513
01:04:29.571 --> 01:04:29.571
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1514
01:04:29.571 --> 01:04:34.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're allowed to voice their </v>

1515
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.021
<v Speaker 4>disapproval about and you should stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to give a woman yell out next </v>

1516
01:04:36.021 --> 01:04:38.130
<v Speaker 4>subject wants to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is hilarious.</v>

1517
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:43.150
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm holding the microphone where there </v>

1518
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.150
<v Speaker 4>was this bit I was doing for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 4>about a,</v>

1519
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:45.300
<v Speaker 4>there was a thing called the second </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming project was before,</v>

1520
01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:47.100
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genetics,</v>

1521
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:47.730
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1522
01:04:47.731 --> 01:04:50.100
<v Speaker 4>when they first starting mapping out the</v>
<v Speaker 4>human genome,</v>

1523
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:55.130
<v Speaker 4>there's just people that wanted to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to get DNA from the shroud </v>

1524
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:57.570
<v Speaker 4>of Turin and they wanted to try to clone</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus and he thought that if they cloned</v>

1525
01:04:57.571 --> 01:05:02.460
<v Speaker 4>Jesus would bring him back and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be how Jesus Return.</v>

1526
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:06.580
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so my,</v>

1527
01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.330
<v Speaker 4>my take on it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what have they brought Jesus back and he</v>

1528
01:05:09.331 --> 01:05:11.100
<v Speaker 4>was retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what if it goes you,</v>

1529
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:14.280
<v Speaker 4>Connie doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you have to do it a lot of times in</v>

1530
01:05:14.281 --> 01:05:15.570
<v Speaker 4>order to find an effective clung.</v>

1531
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.310
<v Speaker 4>So the first one that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1532
01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.850
<v Speaker 4>what if it comes out wacky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like would have,</v>

1533
01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:19.960
<v Speaker 4>he has down syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

1534
01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:24.220
<v Speaker 4>do you kill him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's like next subject,</v>

1535
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:29.370
<v Speaker 4>next.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she was sitting in the front row </v>

1536
01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:29.370
<v Speaker 4>looking at like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it,</v>

1537
01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:31.951
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're just going to say that and </v>

1538
01:05:31.951 --> 01:05:31.951
<v Speaker 4>that just ends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1539
01:05:31.951 --> 01:05:32.290
<v Speaker 4>Now you're this objects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>

1540
01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:36.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm of magical fictional Jewish Zombie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't come back retarded.</v>

1541
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:38.560
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck off.</v>

1542
01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:41.560
<v Speaker 4>She's in the God squad she couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>handle it allows people in the God squad</v>

1543
01:05:41.561 --> 01:05:44.530
<v Speaker 4>cut in and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it might not even be the God squad.</v>

1544
01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:49.531
<v Speaker 4>It might just be in her very narrow view</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world down syndrome.</v>

1545
01:05:50.201 --> 01:05:52.470
<v Speaker 4>Is that unacceptable subject or </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious?</v>

1546
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:54.520
<v Speaker 4>Anything religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've had people say,</v>

1547
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.300
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

1548
01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Speaker 4>as long as you don't talk about politics</v>
<v Speaker 4>or religion,</v>

1549
01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.990
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's ridiculous.</v>

1550
01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:03.990
<v Speaker 4>Those are two things you should </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely fucking talk about it every </v>

1551
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.990
<v Speaker 4>chance you get because the one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons why both of those dumb,</v>

1552
01:06:04.991 --> 01:06:09.991
<v Speaker 4>retarded fucking things are still around</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the same state they've always been </v>

1553
01:06:09.991 --> 01:06:13.381
<v Speaker 4>around is because dummies like you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about it because you've locked it </v>

1554
01:06:13.381 --> 01:06:17.101
<v Speaker 4>in this ideology box and tucked it away </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere where you just talk about the </v>

1555
01:06:17.101 --> 01:06:19.390
<v Speaker 4>Lakers and the fucking lawn and how long</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think this drought's going to last.</v>

1556
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:24.900
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to talk about the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're getting fucked and then </v>

1557
01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:25.480
<v Speaker 4>you're being surrounded by children who </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe in magic.</v>

1558
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Surface stuff,</v>

1559
01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:29.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are a little scared about that.</v>

1560
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:32.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like in comedy,</v>

1561
01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:34.540
<v Speaker 4>nothing's off the table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing's off the table.</v>

1562
01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:36.820
<v Speaker 4>It's only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might not be right.</v>

1563
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:39.820
<v Speaker 4>It might not be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even like patrice o'neal,</v>

1564
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:44.850
<v Speaker 4>the late great patrice o'neil had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good point once where he was </v>

1565
01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:47.871
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone goes on stage and offends </v>

1566
01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:47.871
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say something to offend you.</v>

1567
01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:50.410
<v Speaker 4>Or if someone goes on stage and and </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you laugh.</v>

1568
01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Both of those things come from the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

1569
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:57.100
<v Speaker 4>They're both trying to make you laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't always work.</v>

1570
01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:02.430
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the ideas that eventually become </v>

1571
01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:03.490
<v Speaker 4>great bits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's been nights I had,</v>

1572
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:07.720
<v Speaker 4>I had some bits that they eventually </v>
<v Speaker 4>became like closing bits,</v>

1573
01:07:07.721 --> 01:07:09.760
<v Speaker 4>like bits that I had to close on because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't follow them.</v>

1574
01:07:09.761 --> 01:07:11.530
<v Speaker 4>They were just too good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

1575
01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.080
<v Speaker 4>all my other bits weren't as strong as </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1576
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:19.320
<v Speaker 4>but at one point in time they would bomb</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that like when they were first </v>

1577
01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.461
<v Speaker 4>developing almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck am I going to get this to </v>

1578
01:07:23.461 --> 01:07:23.461
<v Speaker 4>work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just too weird.</v>

1579
01:07:23.461 --> 01:07:25.270
<v Speaker 4>It's too fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too controversial.</v>

1580
01:07:25.271 --> 01:07:25.900
<v Speaker 4>It's too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>

1581
01:07:25.901 --> 01:07:29.800
<v Speaker 4>It's not connecting with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever the reason was and almost every</v>

1582
01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:33.220
<v Speaker 4>bit sort of starts out in an embryonic </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>

1583
01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:37.010
<v Speaker 4>What it eventually becomes when it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>finished product and if that is an.</v>

1584
01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 4>If it's a bit that's controversial and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts out in its embryonic stage,</v>

1585
01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:41.310
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nick,</v>

1586
01:07:41.311 --> 01:07:46.311
<v Speaker 4>sap jacked stop dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're missing the whole entire </v>

1587
01:07:46.311 --> 01:07:48.910
<v Speaker 4>point of stand up and you can't be here </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're a part.</v>

1588
01:07:48.911 --> 01:07:52.280
<v Speaker 4>As an audience member,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every audience member is not just there.</v>

1589
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.490
<v Speaker 4>You're not just seeing a show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you stand up,</v>

1590
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:59.670
<v Speaker 4>you're in part of the creative process </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the bits come alive in front of </v>

1591
01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:04.021
<v Speaker 4>the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They evolve and change in front of the </v>

1592
01:08:04.021 --> 01:08:06.241
<v Speaker 4>crowd and that's how they become </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that eventually gets on </v>

1593
01:08:06.241 --> 01:08:09.040
<v Speaker 4>television becomes a special until that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>until it happens,</v>

1594
01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:12.080
<v Speaker 4>you're in as much as the comic is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1595
01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:13.660
<v Speaker 4>you're in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need you.</v>

1596
01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 4>I give it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it for the audience,</v>

1597
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.110
<v Speaker 3>no jokes would ever come out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1598
01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:23.440
<v Speaker 3>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't really exactly know the </v>

1599
01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:23.870
<v Speaker 3>best way to do any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to do them in front of people.</v>

1600
01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel that Seinfeld,</v>

1601
01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Seinfeld's up.</v>

1602
01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:31.070
<v Speaker 3>He's a very funny standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a very good comic.</v>

1603
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:33.560
<v Speaker 3>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not my kind of stand up,</v>

1604
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:36.040
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I prefer standups.</v>

1605
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:40.580
<v Speaker 3>We don't have any restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like standups that only.</v>

1606
01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:44.000
<v Speaker 3>You don't use any swear words and don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about sex.</v>

1607
01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:48.710
<v Speaker 3>They don't talk about anything profound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is like real simple.</v>

1608
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Straight across like losing socks in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dryer type shit.</v>

1609
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:57.130
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just not how I prefer like a bill </v>

1610
01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:59.450
<v Speaker 3>burr or a Louis ck or jody is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my.</v>

1611
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:02.170
<v Speaker 3>Because I go see Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd see it.</v>

1612
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.150
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that's off the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing chaos,</v>

1613
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:10.470
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of this show you're </v>

1614
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.470
<v Speaker 3>fucking holding your body laughing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1615
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:14.171
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe he doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does his bit about eating and girls </v>

1616
01:09:14.171 --> 01:09:16.340
<v Speaker 3>eating the girl's pussy from behind a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticking your nose in her ass.</v>

1617
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Like a pigeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who?</v>

1618
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to do the pigeon and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>does this.</v>

1619
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not doing it any justice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally fucking up though.</v>

1620
01:09:25.570 --> 01:09:26.660
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not even funny.</v>

1621
01:09:26.661 --> 01:09:28.790
<v Speaker 3>This is the funniest guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got to see it,</v>

1622
01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:32.080
<v Speaker 3>but you need his body and with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice,</v>

1623
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:34.140
<v Speaker 3>everything and it has to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1624
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 3>what was set up before that and where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're got to.</v>

1625
01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:42.660
<v Speaker 3>He has this bit about the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>Liberace Hbo movie with Matt Damon and </v>

1626
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:47.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm Kirk Douglas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Douglas is one of the funniest </v>

1627
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:52.091
<v Speaker 3>bits I've ever seen in my life to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where I'm holding my body to keep </v>

1628
01:09:52.091 --> 01:09:54.020
<v Speaker 3>everything from breaking from laughing </v>
<v Speaker 3>too hard.</v>

1629
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I like so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1630
01:09:55.721 --> 01:10:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I like old strains of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing I totally hear you in terms of</v>

1631
01:10:00.401 --> 01:10:02.620
<v Speaker 1>the limitations that that Seinfeld gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

1632
01:10:02.621 --> 01:10:07.621
<v Speaker 1>There's no profanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A doesn't necessarily tell you a huge </v>

1633
01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:08.710
<v Speaker 1>amount about himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of abstract stuff.</v>

1634
01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I love words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of words.</v>

1635
01:10:11.831 --> 01:10:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I love etymology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like studying woods,</v>

1636
01:10:13.931 --> 01:10:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the origin of words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that kind of stuff.</v>

1637
01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:19.750
<v Speaker 1>He is a fantastic wordsmith and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very,</v>

1638
01:10:19.751 --> 01:10:22.210
<v Speaker 1>very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he will,</v>

1639
01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:27.570
<v Speaker 1>he will omit the wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the if he doesn't need it because he </v>

1640
01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:30.670
<v Speaker 1>examines the entire sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the dedication to that.</v>

1641
01:10:30.671 --> 01:10:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I also love the free form element of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1642
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.100
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just anger coming at you or Eddie Izzard</v>

1643
01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:38.830
<v Speaker 1>is very kind of like just school of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought went all over the place.</v>

1644
01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:44.190
<v Speaker 1>The thing that I love about Seinfeld </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be the limitations that he gives </v>

1645
01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:47.731
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that idea of the choices that </v>

1646
01:10:47.891 --> 01:10:52.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made specifically for this joke to </v>

1647
01:10:52.901 --> 01:10:55.390
<v Speaker 1>work as correctly as I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's a,</v>

1648
01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:57.010
<v Speaker 1>he's a professor of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1649
01:10:57.011 --> 01:10:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows comedy,</v>

1650
01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.980
<v Speaker 1>knows the history of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what's funny.</v>

1651
01:10:59.981 --> 01:11:04.981
<v Speaker 1>He knows what's not funny and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something very safe about him </v>

1652
01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.500
<v Speaker 1>and I could bring my parents to see him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he is old school.</v>

1653
01:11:08.501 --> 01:11:13.501
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that Seinfeld lives in this </v>

1654
01:11:13.501 --> 01:11:13.700
<v Speaker 1>world of Joey Diaz is and</v>

1655
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 2>bill burrs and Louis ck makes him almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the last of a dying breed,</v>

1656
01:11:18.961 --> 01:11:20.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do have a lot of respect.</v>

1657
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gap again is very clean,</v>

1658
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:24.820
<v Speaker 2>although he's not the kind of wordsmith </v>
<v Speaker 2>that does.</v>

1659
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Seinfeld is A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian Regan is also very clean and very,</v>

1660
01:11:32.101 --> 01:11:33.390
<v Speaker 2>very funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:38.690
<v Speaker 2>but I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a master at economy of </v>

1662
01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:38.690
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1663
01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:38.880
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1664
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:43.160
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely a rhythm to learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you know,</v>

1665
01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.830
<v Speaker 2>when to leave words in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when to add more words,</v>

1666
01:11:45.831 --> 01:11:49.470
<v Speaker 2>when to have a pause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when to have no pause and there's an art</v>

1667
01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:54.471
<v Speaker 2>to that sort of creation of the bits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely a master at that moment </v>

1668
01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1669
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 2>she knows woods too short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very specific words and you know,</v>

1670
01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:01.980
<v Speaker 2>she can be a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little frisky it a little noisy,</v>

1671
01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:06.981
<v Speaker 2>but obviously that's very disarming when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're kind of an attractive </v>

1672
01:12:06.981 --> 01:12:06.981
<v Speaker 2>lady to get up and do that stuff.</v>

1673
01:12:06.981 --> 01:12:11.690
<v Speaker 2>I think she's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's brilliant and </v>

1674
01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:13.791
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately it is a very male as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>society is a very male dominated job in </v>

1675
01:12:16.381 --> 01:12:20.490
<v Speaker 2>the sense that I feel like if Sarah was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy,</v>

1676
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:23.620
<v Speaker 2>there's a chance she could be a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger than most.</v>

1677
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.830
<v Speaker 2>She is nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some would argue the opposite.</v>

1678
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Some would argue that female comics are </v>
<v Speaker 2>judged on a curve and that the best </v>

1679
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:34.611
<v Speaker 2>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at like the best female </v>

1680
01:12:34.611 --> 01:12:37.941
<v Speaker 2>comics that are alive today and compare </v>
<v Speaker 2>them just bit for bit for the best male </v>

1681
01:12:37.941 --> 01:12:42.321
<v Speaker 2>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't really have them in the </v>

1682
01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:44.561
<v Speaker 2>same category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think she can throw down with Louis </v>

1683
01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:44.561
<v Speaker 2>Ck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like Sarah Sarah was brilliant.</v>

1684
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:45.180
<v Speaker 2>She.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1685
01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird like I don't like seeing,</v>

1686
01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I said Joey Diaz is the best</v>

1687
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
<v Speaker 2>in the world because I think he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes me laugh the hardest because </v>

1688
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:56.000
<v Speaker 2>that's like my style of comedy.</v>

1689
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I love that crazy chaotic style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't take he out of the equation.</v>

1690
01:12:59.461 --> 01:13:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've seen Sarah.</v>

1691
01:13:02.071 --> 01:13:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Sarah was at the store two weeks ago and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was fucking fantastic.</v>

1692
01:13:06.631 --> 01:13:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Just smashing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fantastic.</v>

1693
01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.520
<v Speaker 2>But I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen birds without.</v>

1694
01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you know Duncan Trussell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1695
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Duncan drops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even Duncan trussell just stand up and </v>

1696
01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:19.740
<v Speaker 2>doug stanhope destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about,</v>

1697
01:13:19.741 --> 01:13:21.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're in their groove,</v>

1698
01:13:21.691 --> 01:13:22.400
<v Speaker 2>if there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1699
01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:26.370
<v Speaker 2>and there were always recycling material</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you catch them two years from now,</v>

1700
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.080
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 2>set,</v>

1701
01:13:28.081 --> 01:13:30.690
<v Speaker 2>a totally different point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally different place in their life.</v>

1702
01:13:30.691 --> 01:13:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Totally different perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1703
01:13:32.731 --> 01:13:34.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as personal taste,</v>

1704
01:13:34.981 --> 01:13:39.981
<v Speaker 2>it kind of ebbs and flows depending on </v>
<v Speaker 2>where that person is at any point in </v>

1705
01:13:39.981 --> 01:13:39.981
<v Speaker 2>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1706
01:13:39.981 --> 01:13:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw doug stanhope well and so the,</v>

1707
01:13:41.351 --> 01:13:43.140
<v Speaker 2>the cody stood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking bent over.</v>

1708
01:13:43.141 --> 01:13:48.141
<v Speaker 2>Double laughing so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I him and then there's a guy I've only </v>

1709
01:13:48.141 --> 01:13:51.531
<v Speaker 2>seen once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know if he's on the silk </v>

1710
01:13:51.531 --> 01:13:51.531
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's called Dove Davidoff.</v>

1711
01:13:51.531 --> 01:13:51.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

1712

<v Speaker 2>That guy killed me one night and he's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fucked up leather jacket,</v>

1714
01:13:56.821 --> 01:14:01.821

<v Speaker 2>look Kinda like a little bit of a g and </v>

1715
01:14:01.821 --> 01:14:02.020
<v Speaker 2>his material was just excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1716
01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:04.980
<v Speaker 2>it's light status on any given night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1717
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I think also coming from England and </v>
<v Speaker 2>having,</v>

1718
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:11.830
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having that backdrop of Monte python and</v>

1719
01:14:11.831 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Derek</v>

1720
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:17.070
<v Speaker 1>and clive and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the playfulness of words is something </v>

1721
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:21.271
<v Speaker 1>that I appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you know money pythen came out </v>

1722
01:14:21.271 --> 01:14:23.080
<v Speaker 1>with a vinyl record as a double groove </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it for the stones.</v>

1723
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:25.000
<v Speaker 1>So you put on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say side B,</v>

1724
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:29.980
<v Speaker 1>but it hits on the second groove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you hit the exact same record,</v>

1725
01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 1>but then the last sketch is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you're like,</v>

1726
01:14:34.031 --> 01:14:34.990
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that sketch.</v>

1727
01:14:34.991 --> 01:14:39.991
<v Speaker 1>Not heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must have been too stoned or too </v>

1728
01:14:39.991 --> 01:14:39.991
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put it on again,</v>

1729
01:14:39.991 --> 01:14:40.870
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't hit the second group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hits the first group.</v>

1730
01:14:40.871 --> 01:14:43.000
<v Speaker 1>So you get to the end of the record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sketch has gone.</v>

1731
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:44.670
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1732
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:48.370
<v Speaker 1>if I smoke then you put it on again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's back.</v>

1733
01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:53.260
<v Speaker 1>And monty python put that in for the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties audience.</v>

1734
01:14:53.261 --> 01:14:56.190
<v Speaker 1>They're listening like that Shit I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>love that stuff.</v>

1736
01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monty Python,</v>

1737
01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.190
<v Speaker 1>they were definitely groundbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insane,</v>

1738
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.550
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did some pretty,</v>

1739
01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:05.350
<v Speaker 1>pretty incredible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:08.080
<v Speaker 1>And it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it still holds up,</v>

1741
01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:08.860
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

1742
01:15:08.861 --> 01:15:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1743
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:11.860
<v Speaker 1>everyone talks about the parrot sketch </v>
<v Speaker 1>periscope just fine.</v>

1744
01:15:11.861 --> 01:15:13.840
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the argument sketches,</v>

1745
01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:16.330
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one called travel agent,</v>

1746
01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:17.620
<v Speaker 1>which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1747
01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:19.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fish dance,</v>

1749
01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.230

<v Speaker 1>I think it's definitely Michael Pailin.</v>

1750
01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Could be Graham Chapman stood on the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a pretty high canal.</v>

1751
01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:33.900
<v Speaker 1>One guy has one guy has two little fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kinda big sardines are about that </v>

1752
01:15:34.871 --> 01:15:37.330
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he skips over to the,</v>

1753
01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skips over to Michael Pailin,</v>

1754
01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.960
<v Speaker 1>slaps me in the face a couple times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skips back,</v>

1755
01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:46.290
<v Speaker 1>skips over to Michael Baden and slaps me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the face a couple times with these </v>

1756
01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:48.511
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's skips back and then the other guy </v>

1757
01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:48.511
<v Speaker 1>and then he finished and he stands stale</v>
<v Speaker 1>near the guy,</v>

1758
01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:52.381
<v Speaker 1>pulls out a fucking huge trout and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes them out and throws him in the </v>

1759
01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:52.381
<v Speaker 1>canal.</v>

1760
01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:54.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like completely silenced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done to music.</v>

1761
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:58.690
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen so a Naca can stupid,</v>

1762
01:15:58.691 --> 01:16:03.691
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long have you been living in </v>

1763
01:16:03.691 --> 01:16:03.691
<v Speaker 1>America?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1764
01:16:03.691 --> 01:16:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I moved to La in 2003,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a while,</v>

1765
01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:13.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first moved to the back of my managers,</v>

1766
01:16:13.451 --> 01:16:15.310
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had like a granny flat,</v>

1767
01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:19.450
<v Speaker 1>not were there any more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was no toilet in,</v>

1768
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:22.870
<v Speaker 1>there was no TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no toilet,</v>

1769
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:24.430
<v Speaker 1>no toilets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did you go to the toilet?</v>

1770
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.160
<v Speaker 1>So what she would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she worked over at her house,</v>

1771
01:16:27.161 --> 01:16:30.970
<v Speaker 1>which was also her office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would leave the back door open,</v>

1772
01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.700
<v Speaker 1>but she would lock the bathroom from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

1773
01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:37.000
<v Speaker 1>So at nighttime I could go open the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>

1774
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:42.270
<v Speaker 1>go use the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't enter the house because </v>

1775
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:42.460
<v Speaker 1>it'd been locked from the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1776
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I had no phone and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1777
01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:49.180
<v Speaker 1>so the first 18 months in La was just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking joke to we just trapped.</v>

1778
01:16:49.410 --> 01:16:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she would come and knock on my door </v>

1779
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:54.410
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1780
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:54.410
<v Speaker 1>I have an audition at 1115 and it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10.</v>

1781
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:54.410
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1782
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:56.200
<v Speaker 1>someone gave me a ride to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1783
01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1784
01:16:56.771 --> 01:17:01.771
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to cancel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't have a car and I </v>

1785
01:17:01.771 --> 01:17:04.771
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get to Santa Monica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that went on for awhile and then </v>

1786
01:17:04.771 --> 01:17:07.270
<v Speaker 1>eventually she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe buy a car and I get a phone.</v>

1787
01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1788
01:17:07.931 --> 01:17:08.620

<v Speaker 1>I'll do that.</v>

1789
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:11.300

01:18:57.410 --> 01:19:01.421
<v Speaker 1>it for edges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called Barlow in the show and it's </v>

1827
01:19:01.421 --> 01:19:02.120
<v Speaker 1>a very boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very pedestrian,</v>

1828
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:06.110
<v Speaker 1>a slice of northern life and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

1829
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:09.130
<v Speaker 1>the way that they combat that in England</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to have a show called east enders,</v>

1830
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:14.290
<v Speaker 1>which is about London life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eastenders is like drugs and crack </v>

1831
01:19:14.511 --> 01:19:19.511
<v Speaker 1>confide in markets and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets their hands dirty and </v>

1832
01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:24.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like snatch serialized snatch and then </v>

1833
01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.820
<v Speaker 1>carnation street is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1834
01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:29.790
<v Speaker 1>obviously we brought Ge have lost me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought you or what's a budget,</v>

1835
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:32.560
<v Speaker 1>like a budgerigar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a canary or you know,</v>

1836
01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.970
<v Speaker 1>the casket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open tray and can't get a cat down.</v>

1837
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And then they call the fire brigade and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fire brigade turned up.</v>

1838
01:19:37.081 --> 01:19:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the people who's in the fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>brigade,</v>

1839
01:19:38.901 --> 01:19:43.901
<v Speaker 1>happens to be the ex lover of the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got the cat and they get together </v>

1840
01:19:43.901 --> 01:19:45.170
<v Speaker 1>and they go have a pint together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very just like a low hum.</v>

1841
01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Very northern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little,</v>

1842
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:52.390
<v Speaker 1>I think derogatory towards London people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it paints them to be two </v>

1843
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.730
<v Speaker 1>dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1844
01:19:52.731 --> 01:19:55.310
<v Speaker 1>they all were flat caps and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>football.</v>

1845
01:19:55.311 --> 01:19:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Me and bit simple and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know.</v>

1846
01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newspaper was a bit scary or what news,</v>

1847
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was always a little offended by a </v>

1848
01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:06.700
<v Speaker 1>carnation street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1849
01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:07.560
<v Speaker 1>but that was the option when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manchester,</v>

1850
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're an actor,</v>

1851
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:10.200
<v Speaker 5>be incarnations to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't really my vibe.</v>

1852
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:15.860
<v Speaker 5>So I came to La and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was still am really good friends with </v>

1853
01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:20.451
<v Speaker 5>larger would so hung out with logic for </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably a month or so just hanging out </v>

1854
01:20:20.451 --> 01:20:21.780
<v Speaker 5>and go to Disneyland and Magic Mountain </v>
<v Speaker 5>and do nothing.</v>

1855
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.300
<v Speaker 5>Mann's Chinese theater.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huge deal for me.</v>

1856
01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:27.000
<v Speaker 5>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when I was growing up the whole put</v>

1857
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:31.020
<v Speaker 5>your hands in the Clark Gable hand thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>or see how small bay gribbles feet where</v>

1858
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:32.370
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a huge deal for me.</v>

1859
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:37.390
<v Speaker 5>That's old school Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I did all that and then moved to my </v>

1860
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.550
<v Speaker 5>manager's place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1861
01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:42.740
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just kind of fucked up for a year and </v>

1862
01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:48.291
<v Speaker 5>then got my shit together and start </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to the gym and started feeling a </v>

1863
01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:51.610
<v Speaker 5>bit better about stuff and had a couple </v>
<v Speaker 5>of auditions that I got clothes on and </v>

1864
01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:51.810
<v Speaker 5>then ended up getting an audition for </v>
<v Speaker 5>last and then,</v>

1865
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:53.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of that's all she wrote.</v>

1866
01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:59.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you kind of have to think about </v>

1867
01:20:59.320 --> 01:20:59.320
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1868
01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:02.230
<v Speaker 5>the enormity of rings was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was such a big job to do and coming </v>

1869
01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 5>down the other side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to have a little bit of time to</v>

1870
01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:12.770
<v Speaker 5>kind of take a breath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that was different for a </v>

1871
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.770
<v Speaker 5>love of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1872
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:14.840
<v Speaker 5>Vigo went off and rode horses for a year</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1873
01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:17.850
<v Speaker 5>Orlando stayed working very quickly and </v>
<v Speaker 5>billy got enrolled.</v>

1874
01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:19.560
<v Speaker 5>The rode horses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like no acting,</v>

1875
01:21:19.561 --> 01:21:21.500
<v Speaker 5>just rode horses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think for the light.</v>

1876
01:21:21.501 --> 01:21:22.670
<v Speaker 5>The first year after law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rings,</v>

1877
01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:25.530
<v Speaker 5>he was very much into just being on his </v>
<v Speaker 5>own riding horses.</v>

1878
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.470
<v Speaker 5>He's like one of those Daniel Day Lewis </v>
<v Speaker 5>characters isn't a totally.</v>

1879
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:32.730
<v Speaker 5>He was so good in the fucking the </v>
<v Speaker 5>apocalypse movie.</v>

1880
01:21:32.731 --> 01:21:33.770
<v Speaker 5>What does that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the road?</v>

1881
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.280
<v Speaker 5>The road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't even watch it.</v>

1882
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:40.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to the point where he's teaching </v>

1883
01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:40.330
<v Speaker 5>his son how to shoot himself in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mouth.</v>

1884
01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:40.330
<v Speaker 5>I was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're good.</v>

1885
01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:44.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's active and have you seen and </v>

1886
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.450
<v Speaker 5>promises,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he plays the Russian guy with 10:11.</v>

1887
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:45.450
<v Speaker 5>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has the naked fight in the steam room.</v>

1888
01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:50.630
<v Speaker 5>He's ballsy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a very ballsy act and he's a great </v>

1889
01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:52.821
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you guys live in New Zealand when </v>

1890
01:21:52.821 --> 01:21:52.821
<v Speaker 5>you were doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1891
01:21:52.821 --> 01:21:52.821
<v Speaker 5>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For two years.</v>

1892
01:21:52.821 --> 01:21:54.120
<v Speaker 5>Just under two years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that,</v>

1893
01:21:54.121 --> 01:21:56.220
<v Speaker 5>what is that like New Zealand?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1894
01:21:56.221 --> 01:22:01.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was dumb enough to assume that New </v>

1895
01:22:01.221 --> 01:22:03.320
<v Speaker 5>Zealand would have the weather the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Australia has because it's close to it </v>

1896
01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:06.231
<v Speaker 5>on the map,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's actually not close to a </v>

1897
01:22:06.231 --> 01:22:07.721
<v Speaker 5>geographically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a long way away and certainly much </v>

1898
01:22:07.721 --> 01:22:07.721
<v Speaker 5>more southern geographically then </v>
<v Speaker 5>Australia,</v>

1899
01:22:07.721 --> 01:22:10.290
<v Speaker 5>so he kind of has an English weather </v>
<v Speaker 5>sunny days,</v>

1900
01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:11.390
<v Speaker 5>but generally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1901
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:13.860
<v Speaker 5>showers and when they call it Windy </v>
<v Speaker 5>Wellington,</v>

1902
01:22:13.861 --> 01:22:14.570
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1903
01:22:14.610 --> 01:22:17.310
<v Speaker 5>every year some old woman will get blown</v>
<v Speaker 5>down on the street and you know,</v>

1904
01:22:17.311 --> 01:22:18.900
<v Speaker 5>it'd be a huge issue there.</v>

1905
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:22.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a very safe country in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 5>going out and doing your thing.</v>

1906
01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.230
<v Speaker 5>They have a great respect for our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1907
01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.790
<v Speaker 5>everyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's inked,</v>

1908
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.060
<v Speaker 5>everyone's called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It ain't.</v>

1909
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:30.240
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen so many tattoos on young</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in my life,</v>

1910
01:22:30.241 --> 01:22:33.210
<v Speaker 5>which they go over that more of a tribal</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

1911
01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:36.930
<v Speaker 5>but certainly it's a rite of passage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you reach 18 or 20 or 21,</v>

1912
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.530
<v Speaker 5>you'll get a tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They love our.</v>

1913
01:22:39.730 --> 01:22:41.360
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's a sculptor.</v>

1914
01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.300
<v Speaker 5>Big Surfing community goes acute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1915
01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:50.330
<v Speaker 5>they like to drink like English people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which didn't necessarily do me any </v>

1916
01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:52.040
<v Speaker 5>favors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had countryside is so beautiful.</v>

1917
01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:53.700
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they filmed it there,</v>

1918
01:22:53.701 --> 01:22:54.300
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1919
01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.570
<v Speaker 5>PDX also also Kiwi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's from,</v>

1920
01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.930
<v Speaker 5>he's from there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he wants to keep all of his movies on</v>

1921
01:23:00.931 --> 01:23:03.690
<v Speaker 5>the island of New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On the islands of New Zealand,</v>

1922
01:23:03.691 --> 01:23:08.691
<v Speaker 5>because it brings a lot industry in the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he would've done it if he </v>

1923
01:23:08.691 --> 01:23:09.370
<v Speaker 5>knew it was outside of his wheel house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can.</v>

1924
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.530
<v Speaker 5>There's nowhere else to make the Lord of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rings.</v>

1925
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 5>Fucking sceneries so spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The shy exists.</v>

1926
01:23:15.971 --> 01:23:19.030
<v Speaker 5>You can go to the shy green rolling </v>
<v Speaker 5>hills sheep everywhere.</v>

1927
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:20.270
<v Speaker 5>Cows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful.</v>

1928
01:23:20.610 --> 01:23:22.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange place New Zealand because</v>

1929
01:23:22.381 --> 01:23:27.381
<v Speaker 4>it's covered with all these animals to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many wild animals that were </v>

1930
01:23:27.381 --> 01:23:29.040
<v Speaker 4>brought in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like apparently there was no mammals.</v>

1931
01:23:29.041 --> 01:23:34.041
<v Speaker 4>They're like in the 16 hundreds or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it was when people </v>

1932
01:23:34.041 --> 01:23:34.041
<v Speaker 4>started arriving.</v>

1933
01:23:34.041 --> 01:23:34.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they have a huge issue with that.</v>

1934
01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:36.220
<v Speaker 5>They have a huge issue with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1935
01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:41.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals being brought into the very </v>

1936
01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:41.280
<v Speaker 5>strict and customs also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1937
01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.920
<v Speaker 5>millions of years ago you had birds </v>
<v Speaker 5>flying over New Zealand going,</v>

1938
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:44.390
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that place looks rad.</v>

1939
01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:45.980
<v Speaker 5>Locust trees everywhere and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 5>humans.</v>

1940
01:23:45.981 --> 01:23:47.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which they did.</v>

1941
01:23:47.770 --> 01:23:52.770
<v Speaker 5>And then over the course of a few more </v>
<v Speaker 5>million years and they then lost the </v>

1942
01:23:52.770 --> 01:23:55.511
<v Speaker 5>ability to fly because they didn't need </v>
<v Speaker 5>it because no natural predators to hold </v>

1943
01:23:55.511 --> 01:23:57.410
<v Speaker 5>these flightless birds walking around </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing their thing.</v>

1944
01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:00.980
<v Speaker 5>Then they accidentally bring in things </v>
<v Speaker 5>like possums and rats and stuff and cats</v>

1945
01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.570
<v Speaker 5>and these animals can't believe their </v>
<v Speaker 5>luck.</v>

1946
01:24:02.571 --> 01:24:03.830
<v Speaker 5>But like there's all these flightless </v>
<v Speaker 5>bird,</v>

1947
01:24:03.831 --> 01:24:07.600
<v Speaker 5>the carbon climate tree and one of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>birds Kakapo's Kias,</v>

1948
01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:10.460
<v Speaker 5>Kiwis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'll flightless they'll.</v>

1949
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:13.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean the Kakapo is a parrot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the largest parents in the world.</v>

1950
01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:18.820
<v Speaker 5>The mail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll build a little depression in a u </v>

1951
01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.360
<v Speaker 5>shaped valley.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he'll build 11 amplify,</v>

1952
01:24:20.361 --> 01:24:22.670
<v Speaker 5>which will be a u shape valley in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>valley.</v>

1953
01:24:22.671 --> 01:24:26.270
<v Speaker 5>He'll build a depression and he'll sit </v>
<v Speaker 5>in that depression and make a deep,</v>

1954
01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:31.360
<v Speaker 5>guttural base like noise for his female </v>
<v Speaker 5>to hear him and the female will walk </v>

1955
01:24:31.941 --> 01:24:36.941
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it takes place over the course of a </v>

1956
01:24:36.941 --> 01:24:39.250
<v Speaker 5>few days and any animal can hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the rats and the caps and the possums</v>

1957
01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.380
<v Speaker 5>would just follow the sound and the male</v>
<v Speaker 5>won't move.</v>

1958
01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:43.910
<v Speaker 5>It'll just sit there and they just kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1959
01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:48.970
<v Speaker 5>They just kill them and eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so then now being present now being </v>

1960
01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:50.550
<v Speaker 5>protected in certain parts of New </v>
<v Speaker 5>Zealand because these polar animals have</v>

1961
01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.550
<v Speaker 5>been fucked over by with one</v>

1962
01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:57.740
<v Speaker 4>Australia's had similar issues and one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the things that Australians had an </v>

1963
01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:58.950
<v Speaker 4>issue with was the proliferation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>rabbits.</v>

1964
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:05.290
<v Speaker 4>Rabbits had gotten to Australia and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>just bread like a motherfucker and </v>

1965
01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:08.580
<v Speaker 4>spread across the entire country and </v>
<v Speaker 4>along the way they had to figure out how</v>

1966
01:25:08.581 --> 01:25:11.640
<v Speaker 4>to mitigate the issue of these rabbits </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the overpopulation.</v>

1967
01:25:11.641 --> 01:25:16.350
<v Speaker 4>So they brought in foxes and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Fox has got out of control and then they</v>

1968
01:25:16.351 --> 01:25:19.680
<v Speaker 4>brought in feral cats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Feral cats and foxes are like one of the</v>

1969
01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:24.681
<v Speaker 4>biggest issues in all of Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just have an overwhelming amount of</v>

1970
01:25:24.961 --> 01:25:27.840
<v Speaker 4>them and they still haven't put a dent </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the rabbit population.</v>

1971
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:28.270
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1972
01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:33.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean anytime human beings try and get </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved with the nature of things,</v>

1973
01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:36.290
<v Speaker 5>they make a huge mess of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's A.</v>

1974
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:39.580
<v Speaker 5>There's a classic story in Hawaii where </v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember what the animal was.</v>

1975
01:25:39.581 --> 01:25:44.581
<v Speaker 5>I used to know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they brill in an animal to bring </v>

1976
01:25:44.581 --> 01:25:47.740
<v Speaker 5>down the populations of another animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the animal is Diane.</v>

1977
01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:50.260
<v Speaker 5>All the other animals nocturnal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they never meet each other.</v>

1978
01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.700
<v Speaker 5>They just smell each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I know he's a rat.</v>

1979
01:25:52.701 --> 01:25:54.760
<v Speaker 5>Is Subway is borrow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1980
01:25:54.761 --> 01:25:56.800
<v Speaker 5>So that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's scary.</v>

1981
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:57.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1982
01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:01.210
<v Speaker 5>I think humans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1983
01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't think humans are easily my least</v>
<v Speaker 5>favorite animal on the planet.</v>

1984
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a huge amount of hope for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as a species.</v>

1985
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty ashamed to retailers and Oh </v>
<v Speaker 1>kimmy would dong dude.</v>

1986
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:17.290
<v Speaker 1>But you're nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm nice when we're talking about the </v>

1987
01:26:17.290 --> 01:26:18.440
<v Speaker 1>individual that's tangential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as a species,</v>

1988
01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.480
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1989
01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:22.070
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1990
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:27.250
<v Speaker 1>a mess and we're breeding out of control</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for some reason we,</v>

1991
01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:32.320
<v Speaker 1>we place a huge amount of importance on </v>
<v Speaker 1>human life because our brains are </v>

1992
01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.460
<v Speaker 1>developed to the point where we think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're special.</v>

1993
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:39.461
<v Speaker 1>But if you were to take humans off this </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet and have a look at it in 200 </v>

1994
01:26:39.461 --> 01:26:43.241
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a vibrantly green blue </v>

1995
01:26:43.241 --> 01:26:45.050
<v Speaker 1>planet living in balance with itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to take right,</v>

1996
01:26:45.051 --> 01:26:47.120
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't want to live there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>

1997
01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:52.300
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't be able to tell anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be no restaurants and they know </v>

1998
01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:52.300
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

1999
01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Get Mad.</v>

2000
01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:53.990
<v Speaker 1>You would have never worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never worked,</v>

2001
01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:56.660
<v Speaker 1>but I know computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would live in the plains live,</v>

2002
01:26:56.850 --> 01:27:01.850
<v Speaker 1>get you get it and you'd eaten within an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour they'd find you and they'd fucking </v>

2003
01:27:02.121 --> 01:27:03.590
<v Speaker 1>cut you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still live in.</v>

2004
01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:06.110
<v Speaker 1>But you live in balance with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that will,</v>

2005
01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:10.070
<v Speaker 1>you know if you'd state worms or an all </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiders,</v>

2006
01:27:10.071 --> 01:27:13.340
<v Speaker 1>old Beatles off the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would be dead in a hundred years.</v>

2007
01:27:13.341 --> 01:27:18.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky enough to do this show and </v>

2008
01:27:18.341 --> 01:27:19.700
<v Speaker 1>every so often we find ourselves in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real wilderness way.</v>

2009
01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:24.701
<v Speaker 1>You've taken a car to a river and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>river to a boat and then walk to someone</v>

2010
01:27:24.981 --> 01:27:29.981
<v Speaker 1>else and then taking another boat for </v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours down river and you're </v>

2011
01:27:29.981 --> 01:27:32.591
<v Speaker 1>heading to this forest jungle light </v>
<v Speaker 1>location and I'll see humans on the </v>

2012
01:27:33.411 --> 01:27:37.160
<v Speaker 1>river's edge fishing or playing kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little six,</v>

2013
01:27:37.161 --> 01:27:38.060
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight year old kids.</v>

2014
01:27:38.061 --> 01:27:42.050
<v Speaker 1>And I think those fuckers know so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we'll never know.</v>

2015
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:45.050
<v Speaker 1>They know when the rains come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know when the Predator is nearby.</v>

2016
01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:50.260
<v Speaker 1>They have incredible night vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have hearing that we can only </v>

2017
01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:50.330
<v Speaker 1>imagine they have the ability to climb a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>

2018
01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:53.780
<v Speaker 1>like we can't all heal themselves with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit or with a plan.</v>

2019
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:57.570
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admire that much more than whoever the</v>

2020
01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:01.490
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck Kanye does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone like not just county.</v>

2021
01:28:01.491 --> 01:28:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not picking on county,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I know the bronze.</v>

2022
01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an incredible athlete.</v>

2023
01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:10.031
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of respect for him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steph curry isn't an amazing basketball </v>

2024
01:28:10.031 --> 01:28:11.030
<v Speaker 1>player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't contend with the ability that</v>

2025
01:28:11.031 --> 01:28:13.430
<v Speaker 1>these children have these light indigo </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

2026
01:28:13.431 --> 01:28:18.431
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But much like your agent told you back </v>

2027
01:28:18.431 --> 01:28:18.440
<v Speaker 1>in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lived different lives.</v>

2028
01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:24.000
<v Speaker 1>You can't compare Lebron to them and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you put coby Brian on that island making</v>

2029
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:26.540
<v Speaker 1>some snap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy put coby Brian on that island,</v>

2030
01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:27.530
<v Speaker 1>he would probably starve to death.</v>

2031
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:30.770
<v Speaker 1>He put them on the court with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't score a single point.</v>

2032
01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're.</v>

2033
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:33.590
<v Speaker 1>We're all in these different paths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2034
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Hosts for courses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>

2035
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:37.520
<v Speaker 1>my retort to that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2036
01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:42.640
<v Speaker 1>the the correct way to live on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet would be the way that they're </v>

2037
01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.370
<v Speaker 1>doing it and all the way coby is doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2038
01:28:43.371 --> 01:28:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how coby lives his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is an extraordinary athlete,</v>

2039
01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.850
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of excess and unpolished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the excess of,</v>

2040
01:28:49.851 --> 01:28:52.400
<v Speaker 1>let's say Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waste,</v>

2041
01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.950
<v Speaker 1>the portion size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pollution,</v>

2042
01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:57.560
<v Speaker 1>the traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not getting it right.</v>

2043
01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:58.760
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got it wrong.</v>

2044
01:28:58.970 --> 01:29:01.710
<v Speaker 1>We don't seem inclined necessarily to it</v>

2045
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.800
<v Speaker 5>in the western world because we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2046
01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:06.120
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we can all eat.</v>

2047
01:29:06.121 --> 01:29:08.190
<v Speaker 5>We live in warm houses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We get DIRECTV.</v>

2048
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:13.280
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm just chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like intuit really hits the fan and the </v>

2049
01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 5>tsunami comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're good.</v>

2050
01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.390
<v Speaker 5>The other people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those Africans,</v>

2051
01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:17.910
<v Speaker 5>they've kind of fucked it up and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in Southeast Asia,</v>

2052
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:19.470
<v Speaker 5>they fucked it up in South America is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>mess.</v>

2053
01:29:19.710 --> 01:29:21.930
<v Speaker 5>But in la you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>same way we did it.</v>

2054
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:27.050
<v Speaker 5>We succeeded or not succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not living in balance with our </v>

2055
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:27.150
<v Speaker 5>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are killing our planet.</v>

2056
01:29:27.490 --> 01:29:32.490
<v Speaker 5>It is on its way and it might not happen</v>
<v Speaker 5>in our lifetime and I know certain </v>

2057
01:29:32.490 --> 01:29:36.501
<v Speaker 5>people have said this for generations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have all these scientists saying it </v>

2058
01:29:36.501 --> 01:29:39.411
<v Speaker 5>might not happen in my lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was certainly happened in the </v>

2059
01:29:39.411 --> 01:29:41.421
<v Speaker 5>next and I'm part of that was that those</v>
<v Speaker 5>people representing that comment as </v>

2060
01:29:41.421 --> 01:29:45.141
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do believe that we're at that </v>

2061
01:29:45.141 --> 01:29:45.450
<v Speaker 5>tipping point of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are we?</v>

2062
01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:46.930
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why are we here?</v>

2063
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.540
<v Speaker 5>We're not here to make cash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can't be because I mean it's.</v>

2064
01:29:50.630 --> 01:29:55.630
<v Speaker 5>It's about moving from being a human </v>
<v Speaker 5>species that made some mistakes and </v>

2065
01:29:56.851 --> 01:30:01.851
<v Speaker 5>realize the limitations of our planet to</v>
<v Speaker 5>living as a human species that has the </v>

2066
01:30:01.851 --> 01:30:04.740
<v Speaker 5>potential to go forward into our future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the moment,</v>

2067
01:30:04.741 --> 01:30:07.110
<v Speaker 5>there is no future for human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a.</v>

2068
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.440
<v Speaker 5>it's a ticking clock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need to take that clock out of the </v>

2069
01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.800
<v Speaker 5>scenario to be a successful species </v>
<v Speaker 5>because Andy did it.</v>

2070
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.840
<v Speaker 5>These did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wounds did it,</v>

2071
01:30:16.530 --> 01:30:18.240
<v Speaker 5>and which are my favorite animal by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

2072
01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:22.560
<v Speaker 5>live in extremely condensed societies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no murder,</v>

2073
01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:24.420
<v Speaker 5>there's no rape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They look after their kids.</v>

2074
01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.600
<v Speaker 5>They made their forest healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They leave no carbon footprint.</v>

2075
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:30.120
<v Speaker 5>They make the planet bear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't talk.</v>

2076
01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:32.560
<v Speaker 3>They don't make movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Music is bullshit.</v>

2077
01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:34.480
<v Speaker 3>They may make me have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

2078
01:30:34.481 --> 01:30:36.070
<v Speaker 3>You want to beat your head up against a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rock.</v>

2079
01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:38.560
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to fuck one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be something wrong with you.</v>

2080
01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:44.250
<v Speaker 3>People are way better than ads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what we're doing is </v>

2081
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:47.581
<v Speaker 3>definitely tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the consequences that </v>

2082
01:30:47.581 --> 01:30:47.920
<v Speaker 3>human society has on the environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>

2083
01:30:48.130 --> 01:30:53.130
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at the potential that </v>
<v Speaker 3>human minds and human creativity and </v>

2084
01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:57.151
<v Speaker 3>ingenuity half and you look at what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been able to accomplish with raw </v>

2085
01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:59.980
<v Speaker 3>materials and what we've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build in this incredible world.</v>

2086
01:31:00.130 --> 01:31:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Just the ability to do this kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>show where you're broadcasting something</v>

2087
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:08.790
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's flying through the air into </v>

2088
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:10.930
<v Speaker 3>people's phones because people in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>car that are listening to this in real </v>

2089
01:31:10.930 --> 01:31:14.491
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that what we need to do is </v>

2090
01:31:14.491 --> 01:31:18.721
<v Speaker 3>put some of that ingenuity on figuring </v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to be more renewable and figure </v>

2091
01:31:19.001 --> 01:31:24.001
<v Speaker 3>out how to way to be more sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that's outside of the </v>

2092
01:31:24.001 --> 01:31:24.250
<v Speaker 3>realm of possibility by any stretch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the imagination.</v>

2093
01:31:24.490 --> 01:31:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's hard because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>live in the moment and they don't feel </v>

2094
01:31:29.771 --> 01:31:34.771
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of their actions until </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're too late and I think that's an </v>

2095
01:31:34.771 --> 01:31:38.521
<v Speaker 3>issue that people have to recognize the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences globally of the human race </v>

2096
01:31:39.221 --> 01:31:42.940
<v Speaker 3>and what this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thirst for innovation and expansion</v>

2097
01:31:42.941 --> 01:31:45.730
<v Speaker 3>and overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what what is the impact on it.</v>

2098
01:31:45.731 --> 01:31:50.731
<v Speaker 3>But there's been a lot of talk and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a lot of thought and a lot of </v>

2099
01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:56.020
<v Speaker 3>planning and preparing for an eventual </v>
<v Speaker 3>world where we don't have waste.</v>

2100
01:31:56.110 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 3>I think just even the concept of waste </v>
<v Speaker 3>is just about not</v>

2101
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:05.190
<v Speaker 2>thinking things all the way through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of what is waste is really </v>

2102
01:32:05.190 --> 01:32:10.021
<v Speaker 2>just an alternate source of energy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to figure out how to be used or we</v>

2103
01:32:10.811 --> 01:32:13.990
<v Speaker 2>need to figure out how to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm a huge fan of people.</v>

2104
01:32:13.991 --> 01:32:18.991
<v Speaker 2>They're my favorite animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you at least favorite animal on </v>

2105
01:32:18.991 --> 01:32:22.231
<v Speaker 2>the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to have your opinion and </v>

2106
01:32:22.231 --> 01:32:22.870
<v Speaker 2>then you have seen people totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>entitled to that.</v>

2107
01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:24.880
<v Speaker 2>People are all my favorite people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2108
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2109
01:32:26.650 --> 01:32:29.380
<v Speaker 2>there are some very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart minds out there and obviously</v>

2110
01:32:29.381 --> 01:32:34.381
<v Speaker 2>the most impressive thing would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather hang out with them or a panda I </v>

2111
01:32:34.381 --> 01:32:37.870
<v Speaker 2>would rather go with can really the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hottest chick in the world who's super </v>

2112
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.870
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you rather hang out with her?</v>

2113
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:38.980
<v Speaker 2>A squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2114
01:32:38.981 --> 01:32:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I've hung out with hot chicks before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've got.</v>

2115
01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:46.230
<v Speaker 2>You've got it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know the squirrel and you </v>

2116
01:32:46.230 --> 01:32:48.531
<v Speaker 2>only need to get to know that I've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>feed him and nut and figure out what is </v>

2117
01:32:48.531 --> 01:32:48.531
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you shit.</v>

2118
01:32:48.531 --> 01:32:50.140
<v Speaker 2>You eat nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else do you ponder the universe?</v>

2119
01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you realize they were alone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>infinity?</v>

2120
01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:55.010
<v Speaker 2>There is a mystery about those animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I don't,</v>

2121
01:32:55.011 --> 01:32:55.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't</v>

2122
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:57.610
<v Speaker 5>field of mystery as much with human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings.</v>

2123
01:32:58.230 --> 01:32:58.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2124
01:32:59.060 --> 01:32:59.950
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2125
01:32:59.951 --> 01:33:02.230
<v Speaker 5>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there have been some incredibly profound</v>

2126
01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:07.231
<v Speaker 5>leaps in technology with some very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very smart people on this planet and we </v>

2127
01:33:07.231 --> 01:33:11.371
<v Speaker 5>are doing the best that we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would argue that all of those </v>

2128
01:33:11.371 --> 01:33:15.000
<v Speaker 5>technological breakthroughs and all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those concepts that we have and all of </v>

2129
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.241
<v Speaker 5>those ways that we can talk about being </v>
<v Speaker 5>impressive as a species because we </v>

2130
01:33:18.241 --> 01:33:21.430
<v Speaker 5>cannot avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It comes from a very human angle.</v>

2131
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:25.060
<v Speaker 5>We're looking at it in a human conundrum</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're in our brain was saying,</v>

2132
01:33:25.810 --> 01:33:26.650
<v Speaker 5>well that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2133
01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:28.990
<v Speaker 5>humans can be Dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but think about what we've done.</v>

2134
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.980
<v Speaker 5>We went to the fucking moon and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2135
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:36.030
<v Speaker 5>we know what the dark side of Mars looks</v>
<v Speaker 5>like and we put robots on Mars and we </v>

2136
01:33:36.041 --> 01:33:40.270
<v Speaker 5>can create music that was made in an </v>
<v Speaker 5>orchestra based on scratches in a record</v>

2137
01:33:40.271 --> 01:33:42.850
<v Speaker 5>group like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shit is insane.</v>

2138
01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:44.970
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None of that stuff match.</v>

2139
01:33:45.130 --> 01:33:50.130
<v Speaker 5>It's not why we're here and it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't do anything for the larger </v>

2140
01:33:51.071 --> 01:33:54.370
<v Speaker 5>concept of this universe and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>planet.</v>

2141
01:33:54.371 --> 01:33:57.370
<v Speaker 5>It does something for us as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Selfishly,</v>

2142
01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.520
<v Speaker 5>we're amazing what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We created this thing and you know we </v>

2143
01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.520
<v Speaker 5>went to the moon ends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't care that you went to the moon.</v>

2144
01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe doesn't care of ants exist.</v>

2145
01:34:06.331 --> 01:34:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the universe doesn't have any feeling</v>

2146
01:34:09.391 --> 01:34:11.700
<v Speaker 3>for this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this planet will disappear.</v>

2147
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:14.460
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this star will eventually run out of gas</v>

2148
01:34:14.461 --> 01:34:19.461
<v Speaker 3>and burn out and Supernova and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planets in orbit will be unsustainable </v>

2149
01:34:19.461 --> 01:34:22.290
<v Speaker 3>for any kind of life that we understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the universe won't give a fuck.</v>

2150
01:34:22.291 --> 01:34:27.291
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's infinite and somewhere out </v>

2151
01:34:27.291 --> 01:34:29.601
<v Speaker 3>there there's a billion fucking earths </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a billion solar systems that are </v>

2152
01:34:29.601 --> 01:34:33.660
<v Speaker 3>absolutely exactly the same as ours and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't care,</v>

2153
01:34:33.661 --> 01:34:35.700
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't matter whether you're an </v>
<v Speaker 3>aunt or a person,</v>

2154
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:41.030
<v Speaker 3>but to say that it doesn't matter that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's someone put those grooves after </v>

2155
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:42.890
<v Speaker 3>spending all this time talking about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>great monty Python r that's,</v>

2156
01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for all the people that experienced</v>

2157
01:34:46.471 --> 01:34:51.471
<v Speaker 3>that and the what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What humans can do that these animals </v>

2158
01:34:51.471 --> 01:34:51.960
<v Speaker 3>can't do is spread these experiences as </v>
<v Speaker 3>art.</v>

2159
01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's Louis Ck standup or Sarah </v>
<v Speaker 3>Silvermans,</v>

2160
01:34:54.891 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 3>standup or Monty Python's jokes or Janis</v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

2161
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:03.460
<v Speaker 3>what he can't say that that's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what that has done is elevate </v>

2162
01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:07.870
<v Speaker 3>the emotions of every single human being</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's experienced that and you could </v>

2163
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:11.621
<v Speaker 3>say that human beings aren't important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then in that case and nothing is </v>

2164
01:35:11.621 --> 01:35:11.621
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is not important.</v>

2165
01:35:11.621 --> 01:35:16.601
<v Speaker 3>The ocean is not important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really in a greater spectrum of the </v>

2166
01:35:16.601 --> 01:35:17.660
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This infinite thing that we exist in,</v>

2167
01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.320
<v Speaker 3>none of that is statistically important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to us for an entity that is </v>

2168
01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:27.710
<v Speaker 3>experiences that you're way more </v>
<v Speaker 3>important to me than a squirrel.</v>

2169
01:35:28.330 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 3>I'll just tell you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way more than aunt.</v>

2170
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:33.110
<v Speaker 3>If I had an anime and if I crushed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aunt,</v>

2171
01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.780
<v Speaker 3>if I could get a giggle out of you at </v>
<v Speaker 3>smash that animal,</v>

2172
01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:36.680
<v Speaker 3>you weren't getting gigs.</v>

2173
01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.870
<v Speaker 5>Cry For the would cry for an aunt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2174
01:35:40.871 --> 01:35:45.871
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't necessarily cry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you had an end on you and you </v>

2175
01:35:45.871 --> 01:35:45.871
<v Speaker 5>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to crush this.</v>

2176
01:35:45.871 --> 01:35:46.090
<v Speaker 5>How do you feel about it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would go into,</v>

2177
01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:49.280
<v Speaker 5>go into a long chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were eating chicken.</v>

2178
01:35:49.281 --> 01:35:50.290
<v Speaker 5>He.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was eating chicken.</v>

2179
01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:51.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it happens,</v>

2180
01:35:51.941 --> 01:35:52.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't happen.</v>

2181
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:54.220
<v Speaker 5>I go out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't happen.</v>

2182
01:35:54.221 --> 01:35:56.440
<v Speaker 5>I killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

2183
01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:01.920
<v Speaker 5>I go out my way to try and live in </v>
<v Speaker 5>balance and be nice to the university as</v>

2184
01:36:02.771 --> 01:36:06.250
<v Speaker 5>best as I can because it makes me feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>

2185
01:36:06.251 --> 01:36:08.420
<v Speaker 5>It makes me feel that my life is in more</v>
<v Speaker 5>balance.</v>

2186
01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:10.030
<v Speaker 5>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I do that,</v>

2187
01:36:10.031 --> 01:36:15.031
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm actually working in flow with the </v>

2188
01:36:15.031 --> 01:36:18.811
<v Speaker 5>universe and I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't necessarily think that the </v>

2189
01:36:18.811 --> 01:36:18.811
<v Speaker 5>universe has a bias one way or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

2190
01:36:18.811 --> 01:36:23.070
<v Speaker 5>If we were to play around with the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the universe sitting down with a pad </v>

2191
01:36:23.891 --> 01:36:27.500
<v Speaker 5>and a piece of paper and they drew a </v>
<v Speaker 5>line in it and they went in on one side,</v>

2192
01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:28.880
<v Speaker 5>humans on the other side and they.</v>

2193
01:36:29.170 --> 01:36:32.110
<v Speaker 5>They weighed up the pros and cons and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's with every time they win,</v>

2194
01:36:32.111 --> 01:36:32.770
<v Speaker 5>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

2195
01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.470
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean by the pros and cons to</v>
<v Speaker 5>that too?</v>

2196
01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:40.500
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the universe is having a conversation </v>

2197
01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:40.900
<v Speaker 5>with Jimmy Hendrix and Jimmy Hendrix </v>
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>

2198
01:36:40.901 --> 01:36:42.850
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you tell me,</v>

2199
01:36:43.450 --> 01:36:45.910
<v Speaker 5>which is the most impressive animal to </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2200
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:51.030
<v Speaker 5>If you were to compare humans with ants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe that the universe of say </v>

2201
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:54.880
<v Speaker 5>there's no contest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These animals live in complete balance </v>

2202
01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.950
<v Speaker 5>with the planet and they do all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right things.</v>

2203
01:36:56.951 --> 01:37:01.951
<v Speaker 5>They take care of their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't fuck with other animals </v>

2204
01:37:01.951 --> 01:37:02.200
<v Speaker 5>unless they need to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The the right amount of food,</v>

2205
01:37:02.201 --> 01:37:03.640
<v Speaker 5>they create almost no waste.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>

2206
01:37:03.641 --> 01:37:07.420
<v Speaker 5>you've got this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blow it over intelligent.</v>

2207
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:11.530
<v Speaker 5>Eight days running around going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we invented the world.</v>

2208
01:37:11.531 --> 01:37:16.531
<v Speaker 5>We can do whatever we want with it were </v>
<v Speaker 5>abusive towards the planet that we live </v>

2209
01:37:16.531 --> 01:37:16.531
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the universe would slap</v>

2210
01:37:16.531 --> 01:37:17.910
<v Speaker 3>around a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2211
01:37:17.911 --> 01:37:22.911
<v Speaker 3>I mean ultimately I don't know if the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe is an entity that really </v>

2212
01:37:22.911 --> 01:37:23.670
<v Speaker 3>contemplates these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it was,</v>

2213
01:37:23.690 --> 01:37:28.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you really were examining the </v>
<v Speaker 3>life of human beings in comparison to </v>

2214
01:37:28.690 --> 01:37:30.120
<v Speaker 3>the life of everything else on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>

2215
01:37:30.121 --> 01:37:35.121
<v Speaker 3>you would have to assume first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's just so much inspiring </v>

2216
01:37:35.281 --> 01:37:40.281
<v Speaker 3>potential for creativity that comes out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this one weird monkey that makes </v>

2217
01:37:40.281 --> 01:37:43.820
<v Speaker 3>mouth noises and expresses itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>through facial expressions and and,</v>

2218
01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:47.130
<v Speaker 3>and written language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's is a very,</v>

2219
01:37:47.131 --> 01:37:50.310
<v Speaker 3>very bizarre creature that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

2220
01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:55.580
<v Speaker 3>and I would say if I was completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective and had no connection </v>

2221
01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:59.451
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever to human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that fucking thing is way </v>

2222
01:37:59.451 --> 01:38:01.020
<v Speaker 3>more impressive than ants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing is flying through the air and</v>

2223
01:38:01.021 --> 01:38:04.680
<v Speaker 3>metal tubes on a daily basis all across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

2224
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:09.750
<v Speaker 3>That thing is sending video through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky into a fucking phone that slips into</v>

2225
01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:10.620
<v Speaker 3>his pockets.</v>

2226
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:15.950
<v Speaker 3>That thing is driving on this hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface that it's laid out all over the </v>

2227
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:20.661
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These internal combustion engines are </v>

2228
01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:23.631
<v Speaker 3>powering these metal boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pulled the metal out of the ground </v>

2229
01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 3>and forged it into the form of metal </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxes.</v>

2230
01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Then they've covered these wheels with </v>
<v Speaker 3>rubber and a fucking explosion,</v>

2231
01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:34.460
<v Speaker 3>a controlled explosion inside this iron </v>
<v Speaker 3>cast iron block is forcing this car </v>

2232
01:38:35.881 --> 01:38:40.881
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stop in these places where they </v>

2233
01:38:40.881 --> 01:38:43.180
<v Speaker 3>pull out this fueled that they've taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>fossil fuel from around the world and </v>

2234
01:38:44.071 --> 01:38:47.040
<v Speaker 3>tankers and pipelines and they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>

2235
01:38:47.110 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 3>they've processed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is gasoline that they can then pump </v>

2236
01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:53.700
<v Speaker 3>into this car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They paid for it with a credit card.</v>

2237
01:38:53.701 --> 01:38:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Money is numbers that are on a computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

2238
01:38:57.090 --> 01:38:58.980
<v Speaker 3>They have paper that represents this </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2239
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.190
<v Speaker 3>No one understands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking insanely complex world.</v>

2240
01:39:02.630 --> 01:39:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Insanely complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

2241
01:39:04.411 --> 01:39:07.190
<v Speaker 3>If you're looking at the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turned me.</v>

2242
01:39:07.191 --> 01:39:08.530
<v Speaker 3>If the universe is looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2243
01:39:08.630 --> 01:39:12.210
<v Speaker 3>at at life on earth in terms of what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>more impressive,</v>

2244
01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

2245
01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:19.240
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing more impressive than </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that disagree and also that also </v>

2246
01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.520
<v Speaker 2>that fueled by the ways is killing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet and the universe.</v>

2247
01:39:22.521 --> 01:39:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Potentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might.</v>

2248
01:39:23.210 --> 01:39:28.210
<v Speaker 2>My concept of the university universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's the gas having to cough up some of</v>

2249
01:39:28.251 --> 01:39:29.870
<v Speaker 2>that shit that is being created on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

2250
01:39:29.871 --> 01:39:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2251
01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:33.080
<v Speaker 2>don't get too close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2252
01:39:33.081 --> 01:39:36.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not good for us and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually,</v>

2253
01:39:36.261 --> 01:39:41.261
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you look at it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of like how long human </v>

2254
01:39:41.261 --> 01:39:41.261
<v Speaker 2>beings have been here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2255
01:39:41.261 --> 01:39:43.130
<v Speaker 2>we've met a massive things like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly,</v>

2256
01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:48.400
<v Speaker 2>but also the amount of innovation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has occurred in our lifetimes in the </v>

2257
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:52.730
<v Speaker 2>industrialized world lifetime over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>course of x amount of hundreds of years.</v>

2258
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:56.360
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no wonder they haven't caught up to</v>

2259
01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:01.420
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing and figured out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to mitigate all the issues that they've </v>

2260
01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.860
<v Speaker 2>created by making internal combustion </v>
<v Speaker 2>engines and airplanes and pollution.</v>

2261
01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>airplanes can only create so much </v>

2262
01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:09.160
<v Speaker 2>pollution and that's the real</v>

2263
01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:12.290
<v Speaker 3>global warming is fucking airplanes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world actually is it changes the </v>

2264
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:15.330
<v Speaker 3>temperature of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When when September 11th rolled around,</v>

2265
01:40:15.331 --> 01:40:16.950
<v Speaker 3>they stopped flying over the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

2266
01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:22.130
<v Speaker 3>It altered the temperature of the earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a significant statistically </v>

2267
01:40:22.130 --> 01:40:22.130
<v Speaker 3>measurable.</v>

2268
01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:26.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean cows farting causes a huge house </v>
<v Speaker 2>gases,</v>

2269
01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:31.320
<v Speaker 2>but in my mind as an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my idea of the universe is probably a </v>

2270
01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:35.341
<v Speaker 2>little closer to a little a statute that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have something living in complete </v>

2271
01:40:35.341 --> 01:40:38.440
<v Speaker 2>balance with the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think the universe would respect</v>

2272
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:41.470
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more in an end than they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would in a human,</v>

2273
01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:43.240
<v Speaker 2>but if you tell him about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>impressive,</v>

2274
01:40:43.241 --> 01:40:48.241
<v Speaker 2>which all those things are impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly comes from a human </v>

2275
01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:48.820
<v Speaker 2>bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we equate things that impresses,</v>

2276
01:40:48.850 --> 01:40:53.850
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we can drive cars that is </v>

2277
01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:55.381
<v Speaker 2>impressive for humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elephants watches go by and they think </v>

2278
01:40:55.381 --> 01:40:55.381
<v Speaker 2>that's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Jaguar,</v>

2279
01:40:55.381 --> 01:40:59.970
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can hunt completely silently in the </v>

2280
01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:03.961
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make not one noise and catch the </v>

2281
01:41:03.961 --> 01:41:07.861
<v Speaker 2>creature that is looking for with </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete and utter economy and sit down,</v>

2282
01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.360
<v Speaker 2>eat that creature and then sleep for two</v>
<v Speaker 2>or three days.</v>

2283
01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:15.540
<v Speaker 2>That for me is more impressive than </v>
<v Speaker 2>hawkings mind or then some theory that </v>

2284
01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:20.431
<v Speaker 2>Einstein came up with their living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance and flow with the universe and </v>

2285
01:41:20.431 --> 01:41:22.210
<v Speaker 2>the doing it in such a way that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature right here,</v>

2286
01:41:22.211 --> 01:41:25.090
<v Speaker 2>the is also about balancing flow goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking radical.</v>

2287
01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if Buddha says you're </v>

2288
01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.311
<v Speaker 2>fucking radical to a Jaguar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think Jaguars are obviously </v>

2289
01:41:32.311 --> 01:41:35.050
<v Speaker 2>incredibly impressive and spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not arguing against Jaguars,</v>

2290
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:40.350
<v Speaker 2>but someone was arguing against vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goggle can lead some food out for that </v>

2291
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:44.131
<v Speaker 2>stupid Jaguar and shoot it in the head </v>
<v Speaker 2>and turn it into a jockstrap if they </v>

2292
01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:44.860
<v Speaker 2>wanted to live in flow with that planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2293
01:41:44.861 --> 01:41:48.280
<v Speaker 2>what's in flow with this poor little </v>
<v Speaker 2>antelope getting killed by this Jaguar,</v>

2294
01:41:48.281 --> 01:41:50.890
<v Speaker 2>which jumps around it well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you decide.</v>

2295
01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.980
<v Speaker 2>So you decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decide to some.</v>

2296
01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Some gallon of Jaguar Thong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now she's sitting out there on her </v>

2297
01:41:58.190 --> 01:42:03.190
<v Speaker 2>pores where their headphones on so she </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't blow her here off while she </v>

2298
01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:04.990
<v Speaker 2>shoots at 300 win mag a Jaguar was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>after a piece of meat.</v>

2299
01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.940
<v Speaker 2>It bums me out so hard when you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>these beautiful women on twitter,</v>

2300
01:42:07.941 --> 01:42:11.170
<v Speaker 2>the opposing with deadlines and dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhinos and elephants just like,</v>

2301
01:42:11.210 --> 01:42:13.480
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you doing this is a very weird thing.</v>

2302
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:18.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a very weird thing that people want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fly over and shoot like giraffes and </v>

2303
01:42:19.481 --> 01:42:24.481
<v Speaker 2>all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when you get into the </v>

2304
01:42:24.481 --> 01:42:24.760
<v Speaker 2>conservation aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets very cloudy.</v>

2305
01:42:25.930 --> 01:42:27.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not as simple as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2306
01:42:27.821 --> 01:42:31.060
<v Speaker 2>people are doing cruel things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing these animals.</v>

2307
01:42:31.061 --> 01:42:36.061
<v Speaker 2>Then posing them and taking pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of money that's generated by </v>

2308
01:42:36.061 --> 01:42:39.031
<v Speaker 2>these people doing that is substantially</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than any other conservation effort </v>

2309
01:42:39.031 --> 01:42:43.770
<v Speaker 2>that's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets real weird because like this </v>

2310
01:42:43.770 --> 01:42:46.381
<v Speaker 2>rhino thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the guy on Corey Knowlton that </v>

2311
01:42:46.381 --> 01:42:47.590
<v Speaker 2>killed that black rhino and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to find out like what?</v>

2312
01:42:47.710 --> 01:42:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Why did he do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where?</v>

2313
01:42:48.761 --> 01:42:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Where's his head at?</v>

2314
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:51.400
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2315
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:52.910
<v Speaker 2>that Rhino Fed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2316
01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.880
<v Speaker 2>who knows how many villagers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

2317
01:42:54.881 --> 01:42:59.881
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had all the images of them cutting </v>

2318
01:42:59.881 --> 01:42:59.881
<v Speaker 2>up that Ryan on feeding all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>villagers that Rhino was also,</v>

2319
01:42:59.881 --> 01:43:04.860
<v Speaker 2>they needed to kill that rhino because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the population is very small of the </v>

2320
01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:05.980
<v Speaker 2>rhinos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Net Rhino is killing other male rhinos.</v>

2321
01:43:05.981 --> 01:43:09.880
<v Speaker 2>It was a non breeding older male and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a very aggressive and killed females</v>

2322
01:43:09.881 --> 01:43:12.400
<v Speaker 2>killed males and in order to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population healthy,</v>

2323
01:43:12.401 --> 01:43:14.680
<v Speaker 2>they had to eliminate that rhino.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to figure out how to do</v>

2324
01:43:14.681 --> 01:43:19.681
<v Speaker 2>it and this guy paying all that money to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fly over there and kill that Rhino is </v>

2325
01:43:19.681 --> 01:43:24.001
<v Speaker 2>actually better counterintuitively </v>
<v Speaker 2>better for the overall population of </v>

2326
01:43:24.161 --> 01:43:25.240
<v Speaker 2>those rhinos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

2327
01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:27.940
<v Speaker 2>the $350,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>pays for Rangers.</v>

2328
01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.050
<v Speaker 2>It stops poaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2329
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:35.070
<v Speaker 2>one of the interesting things they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing now to stop poaching is they've </v>

2330
01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:35.410
<v Speaker 2>come out with three d printing of rhino </v>
<v Speaker 2>horns.</v>

2331
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:39.850
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make artificial rhino </v>
<v Speaker 2>horns and flood the market and Asia.</v>

2332
01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Apparently these are virtually </v>
<v Speaker 2>indistinguishable from wild rhino horns.</v>

2333
01:43:43.991 --> 01:43:48.991
<v Speaker 2>They actually share Rhino Dna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make them a Keratin and they're </v>

2334
01:43:48.991 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>going to three d print these rhino horns</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just follow the in Asia.</v>

2335
01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:53.870
<v Speaker 2>It is brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

2336
01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:57.070
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that they need to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>mate.</v>

2337
01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Poaching is way more of an issue for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhino death and in in any of these </v>

2338
01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:05.480
<v Speaker 2>exotic animals than hunting is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>places that we go.</v>

2339
01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:10.560
<v Speaker 2>They discolor the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't cause any grief to the </v>

2340
01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.411
<v Speaker 2>rhino itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll color the on orange or red or </v>

2341
01:44:14.411 --> 01:44:17.330
<v Speaker 2>yellow so that it loses the value ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the medicinal market.</v>

2342
01:44:17.331 --> 01:44:22.331
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's made a character is the same </v>

2343
01:44:22.331 --> 01:44:22.331
<v Speaker 2>material that makes up fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fingernails,</v>

2344
01:44:22.331 --> 01:44:22.400
<v Speaker 2>and heres the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bite your fingernails.</v>

2345
01:44:22.401 --> 01:44:23.450
<v Speaker 2>If you think you're going to kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>

2346
01:44:23.451 --> 01:44:24.020
<v Speaker 2>bite your fingers.</v>

2347
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:29.290
<v Speaker 2>You're speaking logically about things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are just totally based in </v>

2348
01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:29.290
<v Speaker 2>superstitious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2349
01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:29.960
<v Speaker 2>they get Viagra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Fuck,</v>

2350
01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:31.970
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to eat a Rhino Horn to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get your dick hard.</v>

2351
01:44:31.971 --> 01:44:34.010
<v Speaker 2>This is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work either.</v>

2352
01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.800
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean it's not like you eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>red meat.</v>

2353
01:44:35.801 --> 01:44:40.801
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that these things are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>extinct because if it would be one </v>

2354
01:44:40.801 --> 01:44:41.240
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ate rhino horns and it really did</v>

2355
01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:44.450
<v Speaker 2>make your Dick hard as a rock and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could fuck all night for days,</v>

2356
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:46.010
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2357
01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:51.040
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet people are still killing them </v>

2358
01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.920
<v Speaker 2>for that very reason and I've had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with people a lot where </v>

2359
01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:53.920
<v Speaker 2>where I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say like let you were just saying,</v>

2360
01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:56.360
<v Speaker 2>let's say for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does work.</v>

2361
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 2>It does work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That does not give us the right to kill </v>

2362
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 2>the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the point of extinction,</v>

2363
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2364
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense because </v>

2365
01:45:06.690 --> 01:45:06.690
<v Speaker 2>there's other things that it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing that if you.</v>

2366
01:45:06.690 --> 01:45:09.380
<v Speaker 2>If Rhino Horns made people super </v>
<v Speaker 2>geniuses and cured cancer,</v>

2367
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:10.850
<v Speaker 2>then you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2368
01:45:11.150 --> 01:45:16.150
<v Speaker 2>we have to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to figure out a way to breed </v>

2369
01:45:16.150 --> 01:45:19.031
<v Speaker 2>more rhinos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to make rhinos going </v>

2370
01:45:19.031 --> 01:45:19.670
<v Speaker 2>extinct because they're essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fountain of of of Wisdom.</v>

2371
01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:25.900
<v Speaker 2>If you kill them off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you lose this one opportunity to </v>

2372
01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:28.820
<v Speaker 2>figure out how this one animal developed</v>
<v Speaker 2>as property that is so greatly aids.</v>

2373
01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:33.590
<v Speaker 2>It'd be pretty ironic if if rhino horns </v>
<v Speaker 2>made people the ultimate human being,</v>

2374
01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:38.800
<v Speaker 2>but yet we're killing them off to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become the ultimate human being and </v>

2375
01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:39.530
<v Speaker 2>robbing ourselves of this one source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

2376
01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:41.270
<v Speaker 2>you know that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very,</v>

2377
01:45:41.271 --> 01:45:43.810
<v Speaker 2>very strong human angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

2378
01:45:43.811 --> 01:45:47.330
<v Speaker 2>the Rhino Ollie animals that exist on </v>
<v Speaker 2>our planet,</v>

2379
01:45:47.410 --> 01:45:51.560
<v Speaker 2>a fair game to be explored and had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at to see how they benefit us,</v>

2380
01:45:51.561 --> 01:45:53.000
<v Speaker 2>but how about how they benefit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

2381
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.000
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The The majesty of an elephant's hole </v>

2382
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.601
<v Speaker 2>and is based around the fact that an </v>
<v Speaker 2>elephant's Tusk is based on the fact </v>

2383
01:46:00.601 --> 01:46:01.610
<v Speaker 2>that it's attached to an elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the fact that you can cut it off and</v>

2384
01:46:01.611 --> 01:46:06.611
<v Speaker 2>put it on your mental peace rosal value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we look at things from this human </v>

2385
01:46:06.611 --> 01:46:09.980
<v Speaker 2>angle as opposed to this planetary </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe type angle,</v>

2386
01:46:09.981 --> 01:46:12.230
<v Speaker 2>which some of us do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

2387
01:46:12.231 --> 01:46:17.231
<v Speaker 2>with the rhino thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conservationists that are trying to </v>

2388
01:46:17.231 --> 01:46:17.990
<v Speaker 2>protect the rhinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all agree that you have to kill the</v>

2389
01:46:17.991 --> 01:46:21.620
<v Speaker 2>aggressive non breeding older males in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to keep the population healthy.</v>

2390
01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like this guy going over there and </v>

2391
01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:26.680
<v Speaker 2>killing this rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very.</v>

2392
01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:28.040
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is very cloudy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very counterintuitive.</v>

2393
01:46:28.110 --> 01:46:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen Louis Thoreau's </v>

2394
01:46:33.110 --> 01:46:33.110
<v Speaker 2>documentary on African Safaris?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2395
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because all of these animals that he.</v>

2396
01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:39.170
<v Speaker 2>When he went to those South African </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting camps,</v>

2397
01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:44.500
<v Speaker 2>all those animals were on the verge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>extinction just 20 years ago and now </v>

2398
01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:47.141
<v Speaker 2>they're flourishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're flourishing and these camps </v>

2399
01:46:47.141 --> 01:46:47.141
<v Speaker 2>where you can hunt them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2400
01:46:47.141 --> 01:46:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Ken Hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird.</v>

2401
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:54.110
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of places that he's not </v>

2402
01:46:54.110 --> 01:46:55.971
<v Speaker 2>allowed to go because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of a few things that louise </v>

2403
01:46:55.971 --> 01:46:55.971
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's,</v>

2404
01:46:55.971 --> 01:46:55.971
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2405
01:46:55.971 --> 01:46:58.860
<v Speaker 2>he's obviously quite a controversial </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary and it shouldn't be.</v>

2406
01:46:58.861 --> 01:47:00.180
<v Speaker 2>He's up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's amazing.</v>

2407
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:02.670
<v Speaker 2>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing controversial about what he does</v>

2408
01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:05.380
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just honest and thorough and,</v>

2409
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:06.690
<v Speaker 2>and brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2410
01:47:06.691 --> 01:47:08.850
<v Speaker 2>I think what he did with that hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>

2411
01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.150
<v Speaker 2>it really exposed how bizarre that whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>world is.</v>

2412
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:15.030
<v Speaker 2>This show called the bizarro world or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2413
01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Louis Ck is bizarre adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So bizarre.</v>

2414
01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:19.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not lucy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kate's luther,</v>

2415
01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.060
<v Speaker 2>luther,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2416
01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:22.690
<v Speaker 2>I forgot what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the name of.</v>

2417
01:47:22.690 --> 01:47:27.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he can go to South Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment because of upsetting some </v>

2418
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:30.240
<v Speaker 2>people in South Africa about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2419
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Was it because of that or were there </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

2420
01:47:32.190 --> 01:47:33.910
<v Speaker 2>different thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super.</v>

2421
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a scientology is doing a </v>

2422
01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:39.900
<v Speaker 2>documentary on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2423
01:47:39.901 --> 01:47:44.901
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's doing a documentary on </v>

2424
01:47:44.901 --> 01:47:47.121
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they decided to do a documentary on </v>

2425
01:47:47.121 --> 01:47:47.121
<v Speaker 2>him and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

2426
01:47:47.121 --> 01:47:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I want to watch both of them </v>

2427
01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:52.380
<v Speaker 2>actually want to watch what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit they have to say about him.</v>

2428
01:47:52.381 --> 01:47:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Like what they do nutty thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have they concocted,</v>

2429
01:47:55.021 --> 01:48:00.021
<v Speaker 2>they do free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's free brunch or free lunch </v>

2430
01:48:00.021 --> 01:48:04.160
<v Speaker 2>on a Saturday near where I live and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see people going in there full,</v>

2431
01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:06.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a personality test.</v>

2432
01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Eleven 30 to 1:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people would come up and be like,</v>

2433
01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:10.560
<v Speaker 2>are you enjoying the chicken?</v>

2434
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:15.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to come into this little tiny </v>

2435
01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:15.560
<v Speaker 2>room with me and answer a few questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2436
01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:18.951
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope all the homeless people go and </v>

2437
01:48:18.951 --> 01:48:20.160
<v Speaker 2>get free food often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but shit like that gives me the willies.</v>

2438
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Organized religion in general gives me </v>
<v Speaker 2>the willies.</v>

2439
01:48:22.890 --> 01:48:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're one of the most bizarre ones </v>

2440
01:48:27.890 --> 01:48:29.841
<v Speaker 2>because they were founded by the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>prolific science fiction author the </v>

2441
01:48:29.841 --> 01:48:31.200
<v Speaker 2>world has ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the idea that,</v>

2442
01:48:31.230 --> 01:48:36.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lied and made up a bunch of shit </v>

2443
01:48:36.230 --> 01:48:36.230
<v Speaker 2>except this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all trip.</v>

2444
01:48:36.230 --> 01:48:36.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the statements where you said,</v>

2445
01:48:36.601 --> 01:48:41.601
<v Speaker 2>my next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my next mission was to try and come up </v>

2446
01:48:41.601 --> 01:48:41.601
<v Speaker 2>with a religion to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did it.</v>

2447
01:48:41.601 --> 01:48:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2448
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.000
<v Speaker 2>not just statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His ex wife spoke in great detail about </v>

2449
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.900
<v Speaker 2>his plans in order to create some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of religion,</v>

2450
01:48:48.901 --> 01:48:50.520
<v Speaker 2>really profit off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2451
01:48:50.521 --> 01:48:53.460
<v Speaker 2>he spent a good deal of his life living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a boat,</v>

2452
01:48:53.461 --> 01:48:55.860
<v Speaker 2>hiding from the irs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2453
01:48:55.890 --> 01:49:00.890
<v Speaker 2>because before they were tax exempt or </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax free status before they had that </v>

2454
01:49:01.651 --> 01:49:02.520
<v Speaker 2>status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

2455
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:03.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2456
01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:03.600
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

2457
01:49:03.930 --> 01:49:08.930
<v Speaker 2>He owed money because they were a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they were taking money from their </v>

2458
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:09.000
<v Speaker 2>members and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2459
01:49:09.001 --> 01:49:10.320
<v Speaker 2>thanks fucking madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2460
01:49:10.321 --> 01:49:13.890
<v Speaker 2>it is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the Louis Theroux thing is a.</v>

2461
01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:19.160
<v Speaker 2>for anybody who has like a hard line </v>
<v Speaker 2>stance on this whole African hunting </v>

2462
01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:23.631
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take a look at that and you'll </v>

2463
01:49:23.631 --> 01:49:23.631
<v Speaker 2>probably not going to change your </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion,</v>

2464
01:49:23.631 --> 01:49:26.210
<v Speaker 2>but it'll give you an idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexities and the,</v>

2465
01:49:26.230 --> 01:49:26.750
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2466
01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.180
<v Speaker 2>the weirdness involved in this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing of these animals.</v>

2467
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Literally we're on the verge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>extinction with the one you've seen the </v>

2468
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:38.541
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The old guy at the end when louise like </v>

2469
01:49:38.541 --> 01:49:38.640
<v Speaker 2>badgering him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets asked him and he goes,</v>

2470
01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:41.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa is fucked.</v>

2471
01:49:41.490 --> 01:49:46.490
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way these fucking animals are </v>

2472
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:46.490
<v Speaker 2>going to survive is if you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give them value.</v>

2473
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 2>You've got to make them more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

2474
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:53.010
<v Speaker 5>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gave them a monetary value to protect </v>

2475
01:49:53.010 --> 01:49:53.010
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2476
01:49:53.010 --> 01:49:53.620
<v Speaker 5>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your show.</v>

2477
01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:57.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm a is wild things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wild things with Dominic Monaghan.</v>

2478
01:49:57.310 --> 01:49:58.510
<v Speaker 5>What do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you do in the show?</v>

2479
01:49:58.511 --> 01:50:01.350
<v Speaker 5>There's a BBC show and it was at BBC </v>
<v Speaker 5>America for a while.</v>

2480
01:50:01.351 --> 01:50:04.120
<v Speaker 5>It's now travel channel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go around the world,</v>

2481
01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:09.220
<v Speaker 5>try to change people's ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals that most people are scared of </v>

2482
01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:12.390
<v Speaker 5>and try and evoke a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>curiosity and kill fear in whether we'll</v>

2483
01:50:14.710 --> 01:50:17.340
<v Speaker 5>ever scares you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether you scared of little.</v>

2484
01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:22.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All we had food you've never eaten or </v>

2485
01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:26.640
<v Speaker 5>animals or people of different color or </v>
<v Speaker 5>people of different ideas about life.</v>

2486
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:28.090
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2487
01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:31.720
<v Speaker 5>I get a lot of travel and I love </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>

2488
01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:36.900
<v Speaker 5>So what had happened with me was </v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever I had like two or three weeks </v>

2489
01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:37.610
<v Speaker 5>off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2490
01:50:37.690 --> 01:50:42.690
<v Speaker 5>I would always take a trip on my own </v>
<v Speaker 5>unless it was hanging out with my girl </v>

2491
01:50:42.690 --> 01:50:47.070
<v Speaker 5>and the trip on my own would usually be </v>
<v Speaker 5>pick an animal around the world and go </v>

2492
01:50:47.351 --> 01:50:48.130
<v Speaker 5>and find the animal.</v>

2493
01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:51.430
<v Speaker 5>But to make the two or three weeks </v>
<v Speaker 5>spread out a little bit,</v>

2494
01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:56.640
<v Speaker 5>instead of going directly to the source,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would land in the capital city and </v>

2495
01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:57.430
<v Speaker 5>spend two or three days in the capital </v>
<v Speaker 5>c,</v>

2496
01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.110
<v Speaker 5>go into restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hanging out,</v>

2497
01:50:59.710 --> 01:51:02.980
<v Speaker 5>hanging out in human communities and </v>
<v Speaker 5>just asking them like,</v>

2498
01:51:02.981 --> 01:51:04.570
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where would I go and see a weld shop?</v>

2499
01:51:04.571 --> 01:51:06.220
<v Speaker 5>Do you guys know about the wheelchair?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it around here,</v>

2500
01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:08.080
<v Speaker 5>where would it go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How would I take transport,</v>

2501
01:51:08.081 --> 01:51:09.280
<v Speaker 5>do I take a train?</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that kind of stuff.</v>

2502
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:11.950
<v Speaker 5>And then gradually made my way down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then for the last week,</v>

2503
01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:16.980
<v Speaker 5>try and do that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my agents knew about this and they </v>

2504
01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:20.780
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were constantly seen photos of my </v>

2505
01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:20.780
<v Speaker 5>adventures and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And My um,</v>

2506
01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:22.900
<v Speaker 5>non acting agent kind of said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2507
01:51:23.590 --> 01:51:24.760
<v Speaker 5>this is a show dom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2508
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:28.180
<v Speaker 5>this is a show what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one does that thing that you do,</v>

2509
01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:29.890
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should meet some producers.</v>

2510
01:51:29.890 --> 01:51:30.790
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>alright,</v>

2511
01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:34.150
<v Speaker 5>I'll meet some producers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I sat down with different people,</v>

2512
01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.550
<v Speaker 5>ended up sitting down with a guy from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Canada,</v>

2513
01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:39.520
<v Speaker 5>runs a production company called cream </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

2514
01:51:39.521 --> 01:51:44.521
<v Speaker 5>what's the show?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I pitched him a trip that I took to </v>

2515
01:51:44.521 --> 01:51:47.161
<v Speaker 5>find orangutans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that trip that I took to find the whale </v>

2516
01:51:47.161 --> 01:51:47.161
<v Speaker 5>shark trip that I took to find the King </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cobra.</v>

2517
01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.010
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cool,</v>

2518
01:51:48.011 --> 01:51:49.870
<v Speaker 5>do you have a ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2519
01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:52.280
<v Speaker 5>I have 808 ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he went,</v>

2520
01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:57.300
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come up with eight ideas and we'll come </v>

2521
01:51:57.300 --> 01:51:57.300
<v Speaker 5>back in two weeks time and write the </v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

2522
01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:00.400
<v Speaker 5>And came down first episodes about ants </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's my favorite animal.</v>

2523
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:06.510
<v Speaker 5>And we went to Ecuador to find the army.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And my plan was to lie down in a carpet </v>

2524
01:52:06.510 --> 01:52:07.430
<v Speaker 5>of Armenians and what they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2525
01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:08.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drove varmints and,</v>

2526
01:52:09.130 --> 01:52:11.110
<v Speaker 5>and know what it feels like to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2527
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:16.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>$20 million ends walking around on top </v>

2528
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:16.510
<v Speaker 5>of you.</v>

2529
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:20.070
<v Speaker 5>And will they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will they go into your ears and your </v>

2530
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:23.011
<v Speaker 5>eyes and your mouth and your nostrils </v>
<v Speaker 5>and canicula grown human being and all </v>

2531
01:52:23.011 --> 01:52:23.011
<v Speaker 5>that they can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they can be.</v>

2532
01:52:23.011 --> 01:52:24.750
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to be tempted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to be tethered you as a,</v>

2533
01:52:24.751 --> 01:52:26.490
<v Speaker 5>as an able bodied human being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2534
01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:27.640
<v Speaker 5>you just run away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2535
01:52:27.641 --> 01:52:30.850
<v Speaker 5>it depends on the type of and not really</v>
<v Speaker 5>dance can kill you.</v>

2536
01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:34.550
<v Speaker 5>Now know you get a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the authority and NS.</v>

2537
01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:36.940
<v Speaker 5>You'd have a bunch of them climb on top </v>
<v Speaker 5>of you.</v>

2538
01:52:36.941 --> 01:52:38.380
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2539
01:52:38.650 --> 01:52:41.950
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about hundred of them are</v>
<v Speaker 5>very difficult.</v>

2540
01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:45.010
<v Speaker 5>Bullet answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Extremely taut bulletins.</v>

2541
01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:48.830
<v Speaker 5>Have the highest pain threshold of any </v>
<v Speaker 5>insect sting in the world.</v>

2542
01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:50.840
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's right at number six.</v>

2543
01:52:50.841 --> 01:52:55.841
<v Speaker 5>Number one is go to sweat bee,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the equivalent of a tasting </v>

2544
01:52:55.841 --> 01:53:00.491
<v Speaker 5>white wine vinegar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bulletin is described as walking on </v>

2545
01:53:00.491 --> 01:53:01.940
<v Speaker 5>hot coals with a nail in your foot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's extremely painful.</v>

2546
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:06.040
<v Speaker 5>Blends living relatively small </v>
<v Speaker 5>communities for since maybe 24.</v>

2547
01:53:06.041 --> 01:53:08.090
<v Speaker 5>Ebola ends in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a huge group.</v>

2548
01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:11.090
<v Speaker 5>If you were to piss off a community of </v>
<v Speaker 5>bulletins,</v>

2549
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:13.940
<v Speaker 5>the most amount that would be on you </v>
<v Speaker 5>would probably be,</v>

2550
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:19.510
<v Speaker 5>let's say for the sake of argument 50,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is outside the realms of </v>

2551
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.510
<v Speaker 5>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's say 50,</v>

2552
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:22.040
<v Speaker 5>51 and kill you physically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be painful,</v>

2553
01:53:22.041 --> 01:53:25.550
<v Speaker 5>but it's not like debilitatingly </v>
<v Speaker 5>painful.</v>

2554
01:53:25.551 --> 01:53:30.551
<v Speaker 5>You would probably want to go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>hospital to have them give you morphine </v>

2555
01:53:30.551 --> 01:53:31.580
<v Speaker 5>so that you could go over the next three</v>
<v Speaker 5>days,</v>

2556
01:53:31.581 --> 01:53:34.040
<v Speaker 5>but it's not like 50 rattlesnakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Buyer's not going to kill you.</v>

2557
01:53:34.190 --> 01:53:35.540
<v Speaker 5>It's not an acute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2558
01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:37.130
<v Speaker 5>so we did the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we did the,</v>

2559
01:53:37.131 --> 01:53:39.410
<v Speaker 5>an episode in Ecuador.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2560
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:44.530
<v Speaker 5>they ended up not allowing me to lie </v>
<v Speaker 5>down in a carpet events because they </v>

2561
01:53:44.530 --> 01:53:45.850
<v Speaker 5>said it was too dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I ended up putting my naked handouts</v>

2562
01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:47.090
<v Speaker 5>too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How so?</v>

2563
01:53:47.091 --> 01:53:47.870
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just said,</v>

2564
01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:53.380
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are we going to get them all off </v>

2565
01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:54.671
<v Speaker 5>here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How are we going to get home with the </v>

2566
01:53:54.671 --> 01:53:54.671
<v Speaker 5>rest of the day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have 300,000</v>

2567
01:53:54.671 --> 01:53:58.121
<v Speaker 5>ants on your light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're never going to be able to get the </v>

2568
01:53:58.121 --> 01:53:58.121
<v Speaker 5>stings out of you for you to be on TV.</v>

2569
01:53:58.121 --> 01:54:01.170
<v Speaker 4>My friend Brian Cowen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he stayed in Bolivia for awhile.</v>

2570
01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:06.180
<v Speaker 4>He was going to be some sort of a bug </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientist.</v>

2571
01:54:06.730 --> 01:54:09.760
<v Speaker 4>Whatever the fuck you would call that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the entomologist entomologists?</v>

2572
01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:15.180
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was studying for it and was staying </v>

2573
01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:15.180
<v Speaker 4>in these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2574
01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:18.340
<v Speaker 4>they had these huts where they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>elevated off the floor of the jungle and</v>

2575
01:54:18.341 --> 01:54:23.341
<v Speaker 4>they would put Turpentine on the posts </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the huts to keep the ants from </v>

2576
01:54:23.341 --> 01:54:25.210
<v Speaker 4>crawling up into your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because once they find you,</v>

2577
01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:27.810
<v Speaker 4>once they decide that you're a target,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're fucked.</v>

2578
01:54:27.811 --> 01:54:28.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2579
01:54:28.710 --> 01:54:29.440
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2580
01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:30.630
<v Speaker 5>If you can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

2581
01:54:30.631 --> 01:54:32.130
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you had two broken legs,</v>

2582
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:34.610
<v Speaker 5>you're in trouble with bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The great thing about blends,</v>

2583
01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.880
<v Speaker 5>and you'll see this in these </v>
<v Speaker 5>communities,</v>

2584
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:41.510
<v Speaker 5>in the local indigenous communities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the aunts moved through that </v>

2585
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:44.391
<v Speaker 5>village,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll just go off for a day and they </v>

2586
01:54:44.391 --> 01:54:44.391
<v Speaker 5>just let the ants clear out all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scorpions.</v>

2587
01:54:44.391 --> 01:54:47.760
<v Speaker 5>Oldest bide his oldest son and bs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the bullshit spring,</v>

2588
01:54:47.761 --> 01:54:49.340
<v Speaker 5>clean my house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>follow me on Yoga.</v>

2589
01:54:49.341 --> 01:54:50.580
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>

2590
01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.360
<v Speaker 5>So that's a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2591
01:54:52.530 --> 01:54:54.600
<v Speaker 5>it's a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is pretty fascinating.</v>

2592
01:54:54.630 --> 01:54:57.330
<v Speaker 5>So I'm kind of interested in the concept</v>
<v Speaker 5>of fear,</v>

2593
01:54:57.770 --> 01:54:59.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just as a rule,</v>

2594
01:54:59.671 --> 01:55:04.671
<v Speaker 5>I think that word is divisive and </v>
<v Speaker 5>negative potentially and it doesn't do </v>

2595
01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:07.050
<v Speaker 5>us any favors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't move us forward as a,</v>

2596
01:55:07.051 --> 01:55:10.770
<v Speaker 5>as an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I kind of reject it as a concept.</v>

2597
01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:13.680
<v Speaker 5>I think things are dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the idea of fear makes you clumsy.</v>

2598
01:55:13.681 --> 01:55:16.380
<v Speaker 5>May she made the wrong decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes you do things incorrectly.</v>

2599
01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:19.830
<v Speaker 5>So what are some of the more archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 5>fares on the planet?</v>

2600
01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:24.860
<v Speaker 5>Our heights and snakes and spiders and </v>
<v Speaker 5>planes and we try to show people those </v>

2601
01:55:26.731 --> 01:55:31.731
<v Speaker 5>things in a slightly more positive light</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that you can sit comfortably at home </v>

2602
01:55:31.731 --> 01:55:35.610
<v Speaker 5>and start to change the way your brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemistry works with those animals.</v>

2603
01:55:35.611 --> 01:55:37.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously you know that like,</v>

2604
01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.980
<v Speaker 5>let's say for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are scared of spiders,</v>

2605
01:55:40.981 --> 01:55:45.981
<v Speaker 5>if you hear the word spider,</v>
<v Speaker 5>spider will take you to negative things </v>

2606
01:55:45.981 --> 01:55:45.981
<v Speaker 5>that happened in your life associated </v>
<v Speaker 5>with spiders,</v>

2607
01:55:45.981 --> 01:55:49.440
<v Speaker 5>inner circle that you can go off and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's feeding that negativity.</v>

2608
01:55:49.441 --> 01:55:54.441
<v Speaker 5>But if you now put a positive story in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there where you saw a spider with a </v>

2609
01:55:54.441 --> 01:55:58.701
<v Speaker 5>friend that you were in love with and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you went off and had food that you </v>

2610
01:55:58.701 --> 01:55:58.800
<v Speaker 5>really liked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your starting to change that pathway.</v>

2611
01:55:58.830 --> 01:56:01.740
<v Speaker 5>And if you just replace the negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the positive,</v>

2612
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:06.950
<v Speaker 5>you will then feel differently about </v>
<v Speaker 5>spiders and that's what I'm attempting </v>

2613
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:09.561
<v Speaker 5>to do with the show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So your motivation is not to celebrate </v>

2614
01:56:09.561 --> 01:56:09.561
<v Speaker 5>these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's rather than mitigate fear.</v>

2615
01:56:09.561 --> 01:56:10.650
<v Speaker 5>But it's a bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2616
01:56:10.651 --> 01:56:15.090
<v Speaker 5>obviously we show the animals in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the light that I like to show them,</v>

2617
01:56:15.091 --> 01:56:16.980
<v Speaker 5>which is positive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful,</v>

2618
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:19.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinated and profoundly.</v>

2619
01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:21.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fascinating.</v>

2620
01:56:22.110 --> 01:56:24.220
<v Speaker 5>What's the word I was looking for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2621
01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:28.120
<v Speaker 5>where they're able to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll find the witness I can,</v>

2622
01:56:28.121 --> 01:56:33.121
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like I feel like certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals are able to actually move out of</v>

2623
01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:36.000
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a description.</v>

2624
01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:41.090
<v Speaker 5>You can't define them there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the other worldly that magical in some </v>

2625
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.700
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2626
01:56:41.701 --> 01:56:44.520
<v Speaker 5>so we do do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

2627
01:56:44.610 --> 01:56:49.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to show people that at first a </v>

2628
01:56:49.610 --> 01:56:49.610
<v Speaker 5>wild animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first thing of wild animals going to</v>

2629
01:56:49.610 --> 01:56:50.970
<v Speaker 5>do is going to try and get away from you</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then not initially going bite you.</v>

2630
01:56:51.450 --> 01:56:53.340
<v Speaker 5>The vast majority of wild animals out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2631
01:56:53.341 --> 01:56:58.341
<v Speaker 5>As soon as they a human bounce.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then you or I have to then juggle the</v>

2632
01:56:59.881 --> 01:57:01.860
<v Speaker 5>idea of a wild animal saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not into this.</v>

2633
01:57:01.861 --> 01:57:04.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And me trying to impose on them,</v>

2634
01:57:04.890 --> 01:57:09.890
<v Speaker 5>if you hang out for a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not going to hurt you and I'm going to </v>

2635
01:57:09.890 --> 01:57:09.890
<v Speaker 5>do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just give me two minutes of your time.</v>

2636
01:57:10.290 --> 01:57:15.290
<v Speaker 5>I can achieve what I want to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can be on your way and you can see </v>

2637
01:57:15.290 --> 01:57:19.170
<v Speaker 5>that palpably with a change in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal's body language.</v>

2638
01:57:19.171 --> 01:57:21.900
<v Speaker 5>You can see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can see when a spider is okay with it.</v>

2639
01:57:21.930 --> 01:57:25.530
<v Speaker 5>I can see when his sculpins okay with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this snake any animal down with.</v>

2640
01:57:25.531 --> 01:57:26.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2641
01:57:26.011 --> 01:57:26.520
<v Speaker 5>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2642
01:57:26.730 --> 01:57:28.020
<v Speaker 5>you can come closer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can sit down.</v>

2643
01:57:28.021 --> 01:57:29.910
<v Speaker 5>You can chill because it's animal gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>it now,</v>

2644
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.220
<v Speaker 5>but at first the wild animals like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm wild.</v>

2645
01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you saying?</v>

2646
01:57:33.661 --> 01:57:38.661
<v Speaker 5>Like a wild animal gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they see they say work out the day </v>

2647
01:57:38.661 --> 01:57:39.420
<v Speaker 5>they pick up on its energy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2648
01:57:39.421 --> 01:57:44.421
<v Speaker 5>They pick up on the change in energy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say we just did an episode in Sri </v>

2649
01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:47.420
<v Speaker 5>Lanka with the Indian Cobra,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Monica called Cobra.</v>

2650
01:57:47.421 --> 01:57:52.421
<v Speaker 5>What are the most iconic cobras or if no</v>
<v Speaker 5>snakes in the world with those two </v>

2651
01:57:52.421 --> 01:57:55.581
<v Speaker 5>little glasses on the back of his head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one that the snake charmers work </v>

2652
01:57:55.581 --> 01:57:59.421
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I pull like a six foot Indian Cobra,</v>

2653
01:57:59.521 --> 01:58:02.970
<v Speaker 5>have a stack of wood in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's house and the first thing that</v>

2654
01:58:02.971 --> 01:58:07.971
<v Speaker 5>God wants to do is get away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm holding onto it by its tail and </v>

2655
01:58:07.971 --> 01:58:10.761
<v Speaker 5>it's trying to get wet and it's trying </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get away and is trying to get away </v>

2656
01:58:10.761 --> 01:58:10.761
<v Speaker 5>and intellectualize is in its snaky </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain.</v>

2657
01:58:10.770 --> 01:58:11.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't get away.</v>

2658
01:58:11.670 --> 01:58:13.890
<v Speaker 5>Why can't I get away?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it turns around and looks at my hand.</v>

2659
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:15.810
<v Speaker 5>Other reason why I can't get ways this </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy's hand,</v>

2660
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:18.170
<v Speaker 5>so now I'm going to deal with his hands </v>
<v Speaker 5>so it tries to bite me,</v>

2661
01:58:18.210 --> 01:58:19.290
<v Speaker 5>tries to bite me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tries to bite me,</v>

2662
01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:23.290
<v Speaker 5>bite me because I know how to hold onto </v>
<v Speaker 5>his neck and low.</v>

2663
01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:26.190
<v Speaker 5>Let it bite me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I ride out that storm,</v>

2664
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:28.530
<v Speaker 5>which usually takes about two to three </v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes,</v>

2665
01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:33.860
<v Speaker 5>the snake again and it snaky brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinks this isn't working or the normal </v>

2666
01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:35.670
<v Speaker 5>ways that this works for me and animals </v>
<v Speaker 5>got hold of me.</v>

2667
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:36.780
<v Speaker 5>I try and buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's go.</v>

2668
01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not working,</v>

2669
01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:41.500
<v Speaker 5>and now I'm getting exhausted because </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm buying a nugget and anything for it.</v>

2670
01:58:41.770 --> 01:58:44.470
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'll just relax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as the animal relaxes,</v>

2671
01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:49.940
<v Speaker 5>I then chill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I then release a little bit of tension </v>

2672
01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:50.410
<v Speaker 5>on his tail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>move a little closer to sit down with it</v>

2673
01:58:50.650 --> 01:58:52.600
<v Speaker 5>again and it snaky brain is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2674
01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:54.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm being fed something positive.</v>

2675
01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:56.200
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there's no tension on my tail,</v>

2676
01:58:56.470 --> 01:59:00.490
<v Speaker 5>I can move a little freer and there's an</v>
<v Speaker 5>exchange of energy with a snake now.</v>

2677
01:59:00.491 --> 01:59:01.120
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

2678
01:59:01.150 --> 01:59:03.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to be aggressive because </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not working for me.</v>

2679
01:59:03.670 --> 01:59:06.430
<v Speaker 5>All this animal that's in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we chill for a little bit and talk about</v>

2680
01:59:06.431 --> 01:59:11.431
<v Speaker 5>how beautiful it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Talked about all the amazing things </v>

2681
01:59:11.431 --> 01:59:11.860
<v Speaker 5>about it and then let it go and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>snake won't remember that.</v>

2682
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:14.830
<v Speaker 5>The snakes not going to name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then see a human a few days later and go</v>

2683
01:59:15.010 --> 01:59:17.380
<v Speaker 5>positive experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is cool because their brain doesn't</v>

2684
01:59:17.381 --> 01:59:19.810
<v Speaker 5>work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just doesn't benefit snake to have those</v>

2685
01:59:19.811 --> 01:59:23.050
<v Speaker 5>memories to hang onto because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>generally run into humans.</v>

2686
01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:25.900
<v Speaker 5>Our member and maybe the audience will </v>
<v Speaker 5>remember it.</v>

2687
01:59:25.930 --> 01:59:27.330
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they'll feel differently about </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>

2688
01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:32.720
<v Speaker 3>So this show really kind of came out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] came about and sort of an </v>

2689
01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:36.120
<v Speaker 3>organic manner like this is something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you were doing anyway for no reason</v>

2690
01:59:36.210 --> 01:59:41.210
<v Speaker 3>other than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you enjoy being around these </v>

2691
01:59:41.210 --> 01:59:43.251
<v Speaker 3>animals and you have the freedom to </v>
<v Speaker 3>travel and see things that intrigued </v>

2692
01:59:43.251 --> 01:59:43.251
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2693
01:59:43.251 --> 01:59:44.220
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty fucking cool.</v>

2694
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:45.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2695
01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:46.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm obsessed.</v>

2696
01:59:46.750 --> 01:59:48.880
<v Speaker 5>It could have been a show about a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>different things.</v>

2697
01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:50.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm obsessed by a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

2698
01:59:50.741 --> 01:59:55.741
<v Speaker 5>I love Manchester United.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This could have very easily been a show </v>

2699
01:59:55.741 --> 01:59:57.970
<v Speaker 5>about me going around the world watching</v>
<v Speaker 5>major soccer rivalries around the world,</v>

2700
01:59:57.971 --> 02:00:01.240
<v Speaker 5>Andy in street food and meeting people </v>
<v Speaker 5>and every so often seen animals.</v>

2701
02:00:01.241 --> 02:00:03.100
<v Speaker 5>I could have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could have been about street food.</v>

2702
02:00:03.101 --> 02:00:05.830
<v Speaker 5>I Love Street food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We could have done a whole episode about</v>

2703
02:00:05.831 --> 02:00:07.870
<v Speaker 5>street food with a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>football and a little bit of animals.</v>

2704
02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:11.290
<v Speaker 5>It just so happens that you know with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you create a TV show,</v>

2705
02:00:11.291 --> 02:00:14.350
<v Speaker 5>the backdrop of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an evergreen show,</v>

2706
02:00:14.351 --> 02:00:14.950
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2707
02:00:15.010 --> 02:00:18.970
<v Speaker 5>people want to watch shows about animals</v>
<v Speaker 5>in 10 years time this,</v>

2708
02:00:18.971 --> 02:00:21.250
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna want to watch an episode </v>
<v Speaker 5>about Vietnam.</v>

2709
02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:24.400
<v Speaker 5>Those animals are still gonna exist and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're still going to be like,</v>

2710
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:25.690
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I'll watch this.</v>

2711
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:30.750
<v Speaker 5>It's 10 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's still doing all the universal </v>

2712
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:30.750
<v Speaker 5>things that were do and he's interested </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>

2713
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:33.360
<v Speaker 5>He's interested in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes to see the capital city,</v>

2714
02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:38.400
<v Speaker 5>hangs out with animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it was the easiest sale to build it </v>

2715
02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.130
<v Speaker 5>around animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But ultimately it's,</v>

2716
02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:40.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2717
02:00:40.811 --> 02:00:42.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting paid to go on holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

2718
02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:43.760
<v Speaker 3>That sounds amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cool,</v>

2719
02:00:43.761 --> 02:00:44.650
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really cool.</v>

2720
02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:49.810
<v Speaker 3>You love animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You obviously have this deep affection </v>

2721
02:00:49.810 --> 02:00:49.810
<v Speaker 3>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet you eat them.</v>

2722
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:55.350
<v Speaker 5>I do eat some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been vegetarian for the most part </v>

2723
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.350
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this year.</v>

2724
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:59.370
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and every so often I'll eat a piece of </v>

2725
02:00:59.370 --> 02:01:01.531
<v Speaker 5>fish and when I was in South Africa I </v>
<v Speaker 5>felt kind of weak with needing proteins.</v>

2726
02:01:01.671 --> 02:01:06.671
<v Speaker 5>So a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ate this big hunk chicken today </v>

2727
02:01:06.671 --> 02:01:10.300
<v Speaker 5>because I felt like I was kinda low on </v>
<v Speaker 5>energy and they want to come in here and</v>

2728
02:01:10.301 --> 02:01:11.010
<v Speaker 5>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2729
02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:16.080
<v Speaker 5>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I ate something to give me a little </v>

2730
02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:16.080
<v Speaker 5>bit of fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

2731
02:01:16.330 --> 02:01:17.760
<v Speaker 5>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2732
02:01:18.190 --> 02:01:23.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably meet once every two or three </v>

2733
02:01:23.190 --> 02:01:26.581
<v Speaker 5>months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like I'm not the biggest dude </v>

2734
02:01:26.581 --> 02:01:26.581
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for me to,</v>

2735
02:01:26.650 --> 02:01:31.650
<v Speaker 5>for me to get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for me to feel full on vegetables and </v>

2736
02:01:31.650 --> 02:01:35.020
<v Speaker 5>fruit is fine for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but every so often my system is like,</v>

2737
02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:37.990
<v Speaker 5>I need flesh and today I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need flush,</v>

2738
02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 3>but you like animals as much if</v>

2739
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.590
<v Speaker 2>not more than you liked people </v>
<v Speaker 2>undoubtedly.</v>

2740
02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:45.230
<v Speaker 2>But imagine if you talk to someone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

2741
02:01:45.231 --> 02:01:47.420
<v Speaker 2>well I only kill people like once every </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple weeks,</v>

2742
02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:50.390
<v Speaker 2>every couple of weeks I feel like I need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to murder.</v>

2743
02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:51.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear you.</v>

2744
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:52.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a valid point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2745
02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I am working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a new year's resolution at the </v>

2746
02:01:58.060 --> 02:01:59.240
<v Speaker 2>end of last year where I said to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

2747
02:01:59.241 --> 02:02:01.070
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to go vegetarian.</v>

2748
02:02:01.071 --> 02:02:02.540
<v Speaker 2>And they all laughed at me because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

2749
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:07.570
<v Speaker 2>you eat meat and fish and you like duck </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you eat goose and all this kind of </v>

2750
02:02:07.570 --> 02:02:08.840
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2751
02:02:08.841 --> 02:02:10.370
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'll be okay.</v>

2752
02:02:10.371 --> 02:02:15.371
<v Speaker 2>And I've struggled a little bad times </v>
<v Speaker 2>this year with not eating meat because I</v>

2753
02:02:16.191 --> 02:02:21.191
<v Speaker 2>need the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the show that I do is very sapping </v>

2754
02:02:21.191 --> 02:02:23.741
<v Speaker 2>of your energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in very hot countries were up at </v>

2755
02:02:23.741 --> 02:02:23.741
<v Speaker 2>sunrise.</v>

2756
02:02:23.741 --> 02:02:24.200
<v Speaker 2>We finished at sunset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing after animals,</v>

2757
02:02:24.201 --> 02:02:26.480
<v Speaker 2>putting myself in harm's way with </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous animals,</v>

2758
02:02:26.930 --> 02:02:31.930
<v Speaker 2>and just every so often I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta I feel it to feel like I need </v>

2759
02:02:31.930 --> 02:02:33.140
<v Speaker 2>some vegetarians will call bullshit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2760
02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:33.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say like,</v>

2761
02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:38.960
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just not doing a good job of </v>

2762
02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:38.960
<v Speaker 2>monitoring the amount of protein that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2763
02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:42.470
<v Speaker 2>your diet takes in Keenwah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hemp seeds,</v>

2764
02:02:42.471 --> 02:02:45.380
<v Speaker 2>whatever you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2765
02:02:45.381 --> 02:02:47.870
<v Speaker 2>I believe is Tofu is tricky because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>processed,</v>

2766
02:02:48.210 --> 02:02:48.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro.</v>

2767
02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Were you dealing with Tofu?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with very much a human </v>

2768
02:02:53.980 --> 02:02:53.980
<v Speaker 2>created thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2769
02:02:53.980 --> 02:02:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe as animals,</v>

2770
02:02:54.621 --> 02:02:55.550
<v Speaker 2>we're omnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2771
02:02:55.551 --> 02:02:57.800
<v Speaker 2>What grazes certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2772
02:02:57.870 --> 02:03:02.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's times where your body </v>

2773
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.870
<v Speaker 2>might need a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

2774
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:07.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm open to the idea of someone saying I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can organize you a diet that has no meat</v>

2775
02:03:08.181 --> 02:03:09.230
<v Speaker 2>and you can maintain your weight.</v>

2776
02:03:09.230 --> 02:03:10.490
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about this before we </v>
<v Speaker 2>started the show.</v>

2777
02:03:10.491 --> 02:03:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Like I use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually coast around about 1:50.</v>

2778
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:18.150
<v Speaker 2>If I drop five pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look like I'm.</v>

2779
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm suffering from some disease where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have very unique darter </v>

2780
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.960
<v Speaker 2>requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like because of your metabolism</v>

2781
02:03:23.961 --> 02:03:24.860
<v Speaker 2>scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her Nana's.</v>

2782
02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to know your history of doing </v>

2783
02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:29.920
<v Speaker 2>this from time you were a child or just </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what the warrior diet is.</v>

2784
02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:30.470
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2785
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:34.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a the idea that you have one huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>meal a day because that's how you know,</v>

2786
02:03:34.710 --> 02:03:39.710
<v Speaker 2>people ate a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would try to find food that would </v>

2787
02:03:39.710 --> 02:03:43.601
<v Speaker 2>get it and then when they would feast at</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and so there's a lot of people </v>

2788
02:03:43.601 --> 02:03:44.960
<v Speaker 2>that believe that that's a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to manage your weight,</v>

2789
02:03:44.961 --> 02:03:48.080
<v Speaker 2>to not eat anything at all during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day and then you eat at night.</v>

2790
02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I tried it for a little while just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

2791
02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:52.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean I didn't try because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious about it.</v>

2792
02:03:52.570 --> 02:03:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Just like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even something that makes sense and you </v>

2793
02:03:57.570 --> 02:03:58.400
<v Speaker 2>can get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get used to not eating all day,</v>

2794
02:03:58.401 --> 02:04:01.190
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think you have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of energy you have it,</v>

2795
02:04:01.610 --> 02:04:06.610
<v Speaker 2>but that was the other thing they used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that breakfast is the most </v>

2796
02:04:06.610 --> 02:04:06.890
<v Speaker 2>important meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've totally abandoned that.</v>

2797
02:04:07.190 --> 02:04:09.560
<v Speaker 2>What is the most important?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no meals,</v>

2798
02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:11.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no most important meal.</v>

2799
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:14.590
<v Speaker 2>The idea was that if you don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy breakfast,</v>

2800
02:04:14.591 --> 02:04:15.460
<v Speaker 2>he won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2801
02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:19.260
<v Speaker 2>you won't feel good throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I oftentimes don't have breakfast.</v>

2802
02:04:19.261 --> 02:04:20.960
<v Speaker 2>So I oftentimes do what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2803
02:04:21.130 --> 02:04:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I call earning my breakfast while I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't eat until I work out and then,</v>

2804
02:04:25.150 --> 02:04:30.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also because I like to put my body </v>

2805
02:04:30.150 --> 02:04:30.150
<v Speaker 2>in situations where it has to work hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it doesn't,</v>

2806
02:04:30.150 --> 02:04:31.480
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2807
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:33.680
<v Speaker 2>like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't have food in my body,</v>

2808
02:04:33.681 --> 02:04:34.430
<v Speaker 2>like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

2809
02:04:34.431 --> 02:04:37.230
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's harder to push as much energy out.</v>

2810
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 2>It's harder to,</v>

2811
02:04:38.110 --> 02:04:39.420
<v Speaker 3>to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of.</v>

2812
02:04:39.450 --> 02:04:42.450
<v Speaker 3>But then you have to focus more and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to force yourself into it.</v>

2813
02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:44.390
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I put myself in,</v>

2814
02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:47.640
<v Speaker 3>I put myself in weird situations like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that just to make my body function.</v>

2815
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:49.980
<v Speaker 5>You liked that battle a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lost that battle too.</v>

2816
02:04:49.981 --> 02:04:54.981
<v Speaker 5>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why is why every year or so I stopped </v>

2817
02:04:54.981 --> 02:04:57.861
<v Speaker 5>myself from having certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My New Year's resolution is usually </v>

2818
02:04:57.861 --> 02:04:57.861
<v Speaker 5>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It never stopped.</v>

2819
02:04:58.340 --> 02:05:00.300
<v Speaker 5>You kind of have added sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can have that.</v>

2820
02:05:00.301 --> 02:05:02.220
<v Speaker 5>It's so you can have bread,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can have alcohol,</v>

2821
02:05:02.221 --> 02:05:03.590
<v Speaker 5>you can have meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This year though,</v>

2822
02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:05.070
<v Speaker 5>I've been cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2823
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:06.840
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2824
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:09.230
<v Speaker 5>you obviously don't suffer from the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that I saw from my.</v>

2825
02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:11.970
<v Speaker 5>My thing is putting on muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2826
02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:15.870
<v Speaker 5>like I'll go to the gym and train as </v>
<v Speaker 5>hard as I can for,</v>

2827
02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:18.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the size down that uh,</v>

2828
02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:20.800
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2829
02:05:20.850 --> 02:05:25.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't get as big as I would like </v>
<v Speaker 5>unless I'm pounding food and that's </v>

2830
02:05:26.281 --> 02:05:28.860
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty stressful on my system,</v>

2831
02:05:28.861 --> 02:05:29.190
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2832
02:05:29.330 --> 02:05:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds you're,</v>

2833
02:05:30.251 --> 02:05:32.450
<v Speaker 3>you're a very unique situation when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to that.</v>

2834
02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:37.840
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have eggs and eggs if you get </v>

2835
02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:38.960
<v Speaker 3>them free range from healthy chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no negative impact.</v>

2836
02:05:38.961 --> 02:05:42.320
<v Speaker 3>They make an egg every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have 22 chickens at home,</v>

2837
02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:46.250
<v Speaker 3>so I eat a lot of eggs are shit and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>chickens are like my pets.</v>

2838
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:49.490
<v Speaker 3>So like I'm having food that's created </v>
<v Speaker 3>by pets,</v>

2839
02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:54.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I feed them healthy food and the </v>

2840
02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:57.191
<v Speaker 3>eggs are dark orange and they're filled </v>
<v Speaker 3>with coleen and all sorts of healthy </v>

2841
02:05:57.591 --> 02:06:00.080
<v Speaker 3>protein and they're really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2842
02:06:00.081 --> 02:06:02.900
<v Speaker 3>you can get around killing an animal to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat them.</v>

2843
02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about being a vegetarian </v>

2844
02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:10.760
<v Speaker 3>or being a Vegan is animals don't play </v>
<v Speaker 3>by that rule themselves.</v>

2845
02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:13.700
<v Speaker 3>They're constantly killing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you were talking about the,</v>

2846
02:06:13.701 --> 02:06:16.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jaguar killing the antelope and that</v>

2847
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:17.810
<v Speaker 3>that's natural.</v>

2848
02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why human beings are here is </v>

2849
02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:22.960
<v Speaker 3>100 percent because of hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we weren't,</v>

2850
02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:27.070
<v Speaker 3>if we'd never figured out hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've never figured out killing how to </v>

2851
02:06:27.070 --> 02:06:27.070
<v Speaker 3>eat animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2852
02:06:27.070 --> 02:06:30.710
<v Speaker 3>we probably doubled our brain size of </v>
<v Speaker 3>never doubled over a period of 2 million</v>

2853
02:06:30.711 --> 02:06:33.350
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've never figured out agriculture,</v>

2854
02:06:33.351 --> 02:06:38.351
<v Speaker 3>we would never figured it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilizations and we wouldn't just </v>

2855
02:06:38.351 --> 02:06:40.250
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be in this position to debate </v>
<v Speaker 3>veganism if it wasn't for hunting in the</v>

2856
02:06:40.251 --> 02:06:42.420
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the more ironic things,</v>

2857
02:06:42.690 --> 02:06:47.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean we are omnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do eat meat and we always have a </v>

2858
02:06:47.690 --> 02:06:50.951
<v Speaker 3>meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did say it's a beautiful moral </v>

2859
02:06:50.951 --> 02:06:53.231
<v Speaker 3>choice to try to leave the smallest </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbon footprint to try to leave the </v>

2860
02:06:53.231 --> 02:06:54.900
<v Speaker 3>smallest footprint as far as animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering and.</v>

2861
02:06:55.510 --> 02:07:00.510
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is the wild itself is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking vicious and mean.</v>

2862
02:07:01.251 --> 02:07:03.770
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't give a fuck about each other.</v>

2863
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:08.830
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is fascinating that we are so hell </v>

2864
02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:10.730
<v Speaker 3>bent on saving animals that don't save </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

2865
02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:11.640
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2866
02:07:11.650 --> 02:07:12.110
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2867
02:07:12.150 --> 02:07:17.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm lucky enough to go into the jungle a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot and a lot of people that I tell it </v>

2868
02:07:17.150 --> 02:07:17.150
<v Speaker 5>to is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>

2869
02:07:17.150 --> 02:07:18.220
<v Speaker 5>you go into the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That must be incredible.</v>

2870
02:07:18.221 --> 02:07:21.330
<v Speaker 5>It's so blossoming with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with life and all these,</v>

2871
02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:23.690
<v Speaker 5>all these new things in eggs and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2872
02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:24.960
<v Speaker 5>creatures everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

2873
02:07:24.961 --> 02:07:27.000
<v Speaker 5>well there is an element of that to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>jungle.</v>

2874
02:07:27.001 --> 02:07:28.950
<v Speaker 5>But ultimately the jungle is a place of </v>
<v Speaker 5>death,</v>

2875
02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:33.060
<v Speaker 5>so it was a place of dark s,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a swollen water,</v>

2876
02:07:33.061 --> 02:07:34.560
<v Speaker 5>sudden death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2877
02:07:34.561 --> 02:07:35.740
<v Speaker 5>it's a cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2878
02:07:35.741 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

2879
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:39.100
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a constant continuing.</v>

2880
02:07:39.610 --> 02:07:44.610
<v Speaker 3>Continuing reviving cycle is like things</v>
<v Speaker 3>or reading things which are eating </v>

2881
02:07:44.610 --> 02:07:48.550
<v Speaker 3>things which are getting eaten by things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just constant swirling.</v>

2882
02:07:48.551 --> 02:07:53.551
<v Speaker 3>And one of my favorite documentaries is </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary on the Harpy Eagle and it's </v>

2883
02:07:53.551 --> 02:07:54.370
<v Speaker 3>sees heartbeat eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2884
02:07:54.371 --> 02:07:59.371
<v Speaker 3>they're fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These fucking flying dinosaurs that are </v>

2885
02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:01.180
<v Speaker 3>swooping sloss and monkeys off of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>trees.</v>

2886
02:08:01.220 --> 02:08:06.220
<v Speaker 3>It's just an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing documentary and I'm just the </v>

2887
02:08:06.220 --> 02:08:11.011
<v Speaker 3>idea that different things in different </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts of the world have evolved to find </v>

2888
02:08:11.201 --> 02:08:16.201
<v Speaker 3>their niche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have evolved to find the way that </v>

2889
02:08:16.201 --> 02:08:18.991
<v Speaker 3>they survive the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this giant crazy flying raptor that </v>

2890
02:08:19.141 --> 02:08:24.141
<v Speaker 3>just swoops in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's the biggest ego in the </v>

2891
02:08:24.141 --> 02:08:26.671
<v Speaker 3>world is yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they swooped down and just snatch </v>

2892
02:08:26.671 --> 02:08:28.030
<v Speaker 3>monkeys at a trees and kill them and eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2893
02:08:28.031 --> 02:08:33.031
<v Speaker 3>And just what a bizarre niche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what a bizarre specialty those </v>

2894
02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:36.700
<v Speaker 3>monkey communities think about ego and </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the kids to get in that light.</v>

2895
02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a monster that lives in this </v>

2896
02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:43.981
<v Speaker 3>guy and this thing will end use if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see something like a big shadow that </v>

2897
02:08:43.981 --> 02:08:44.890
<v Speaker 3>comes to log,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the dragon,</v>

2898
02:08:44.891 --> 02:08:47.860
<v Speaker 3>that is the gateway to don't have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>as much in our world.</v>

2899
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:51.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean we watch game of thrones so we </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that dragons exist and stuff.</v>

2900
02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:54.550
<v Speaker 3>But in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the other animal communities,</v>

2901
02:08:54.551 --> 02:08:59.551
<v Speaker 3>like the insect world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insects and my favorite animal that is </v>

2902
02:08:59.551 --> 02:09:02.101
<v Speaker 3>fucking brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gladiatorial daily life with these </v>

2903
02:09:02.101 --> 02:09:04.570
<v Speaker 3>creatures really fucking heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2904
02:09:04.810 --> 02:09:07.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The life of the wild is very heavy.</v>

2905
02:09:08.170 --> 02:09:13.170
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a moose hunting in British </v>

2906
02:09:13.170 --> 02:09:17.131
<v Speaker 3>Columbia this last fall and when we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>up there we came across a calf that had </v>

2907
02:09:17.131 --> 02:09:21.631
<v Speaker 3>been recently killed by wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took some pictures of it and put it on </v>

2908
02:09:21.631 --> 02:09:25.411
<v Speaker 3>my instagram feed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was a because it was just </v>

2909
02:09:25.411 --> 02:09:25.411
<v Speaker 3>stripped down to the bump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

2910
02:09:25.411 --> 02:09:25.940
<v Speaker 3>was bizarre.</v>

2911
02:09:25.970 --> 02:09:29.530
<v Speaker 3>Was like if you have never seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that before,</v>

2912
02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:33.400
<v Speaker 3>it's like being there like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what this just happened.</v>

2913
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Like this happened two hours ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was blood and there was hair </v>

2914
02:09:38.430 --> 02:09:42.451
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most of the main had been eaten and </v>

2915
02:09:42.451 --> 02:09:44.080
<v Speaker 3>were like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the real world that these things</v>

2916
02:09:44.081 --> 02:09:45.730
<v Speaker 3>live in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is it's baby.</v>

2917
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.000
<v Speaker 3>The Moose that were out there hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it's babies got captured by a </v>

2918
02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.540
<v Speaker 3>pack of wolves and they tore it apart </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're,</v>

2919
02:09:53.610 --> 02:09:54.930
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2920
02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:00.160
<v Speaker 3>it's contradictory that you would find </v>
<v Speaker 3>something appalling and beautiful at the</v>

2921
02:10:00.161 --> 02:10:01.390
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is both.</v>

2922
02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:02.800
<v Speaker 3>It's both of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2923
02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Because we're so conditioned by streets </v>
<v Speaker 3>and phones and electricity and houses </v>

2924
02:10:10.361 --> 02:10:15.361
<v Speaker 3>and buildings that when you were exposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this totally different lifestyle,</v>

2925
02:10:15.550 --> 02:10:18.100
<v Speaker 3>this totally different environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the wild,</v>

2926
02:10:18.101 --> 02:10:21.640
<v Speaker 3>the actual real wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this jolt of,</v>

2927
02:10:21.710 --> 02:10:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this jolt of wow.</v>

2928
02:10:24.551 --> 02:10:26.370
<v Speaker 3>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just a toe.</v>

2929
02:10:26.410 --> 02:10:31.410
<v Speaker 3>This is a completely different variable </v>
<v Speaker 3>series of variables that you're dealing </v>

2930
02:10:31.871 --> 02:10:33.350
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So simplistically,</v>

2931
02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:34.080
<v Speaker 3>beautiful night.</v>

2932
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:39.280
<v Speaker 5>I was in Kenya probably eight or nine </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago and I saw as Zebra Fall Cbre </v>

2933
02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:43.810
<v Speaker 5>Fall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2934
02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:46.940
<v Speaker 5>that was being hounded by two </v>
<v Speaker 5>hygienists.</v>

2935
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.870
<v Speaker 5>The mum had gone and they saw it like it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

2936
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:53.030
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was trying to navigate his way around</v>

2937
02:10:53.031 --> 02:10:58.031
<v Speaker 5>a big tree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While these hyenas would just fucking </v>

2938
02:10:58.031 --> 02:11:00.761
<v Speaker 5>minute and they had broken or it had </v>
<v Speaker 5>broken one of his back legs compound </v>

2939
02:11:00.761 --> 02:11:05.351
<v Speaker 5>fracture like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it was hopping around on three legs </v>

2940
02:11:05.351 --> 02:11:08.590
<v Speaker 5>and there was two heinous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it would go to the left Hyena,</v>

2941
02:11:08.590 --> 02:11:09.890
<v Speaker 5>Hyena,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the hyenas,</v>

2942
02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:12.680
<v Speaker 5>which knew at some point that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to chow down on this thing.</v>

2943
02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:17.920
<v Speaker 5>We're really just fucking me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That it would come over and they would </v>

2944
02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:17.920
<v Speaker 5>buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would fall over,</v>

2945
02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:18.350
<v Speaker 5>it would get up again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That chase it.</v>

2946
02:11:18.351 --> 02:11:20.900
<v Speaker 5>They'd hit it so the leg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they try and bite the broken leg off.</v>

2947
02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:24.230
<v Speaker 5>They will like fucking with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They weren't trying to eat it for a good</v>

2948
02:11:24.231 --> 02:11:26.080
<v Speaker 5>half an hour or so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was really.</v>

2949
02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:31.220
<v Speaker 5>I was in mixed company and I was taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of pitches to this thing thinking </v>

2950
02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:31.220
<v Speaker 5>this is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is how,</v>

2951
02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:36.161
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last few moments of this creature's </v>

2952
02:11:36.161 --> 02:11:36.161
<v Speaker 5>life is going to be the car that I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>

2953
02:11:36.161 --> 02:11:36.320
<v Speaker 5>The people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2954
02:11:36.321 --> 02:11:38.630
<v Speaker 5>can we go now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we don't want to see that.</v>

2955
02:11:39.170 --> 02:11:41.960
<v Speaker 5>And we left and I was talking that night</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the people that,</v>

2956
02:11:42.110 --> 02:11:44.270
<v Speaker 5>that I was with and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2957
02:11:44.271 --> 02:11:46.400
<v Speaker 5>that's disgusting that we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we see this.</v>

2958
02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:48.410
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what's real.</v>

2959
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:51.410
<v Speaker 5>This is nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is life.</v>

2960
02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:52.220
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2961
02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:57.360
<v Speaker 5>a few weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me and my friends in the middle of the </v>

2962
02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:00.430
<v Speaker 5>night when we're walking around Griffith</v>
<v Speaker 5>Park and we've seen fucking owl.</v>

2963
02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:02.600
<v Speaker 5>And we saw some coyotes run along the </v>
<v Speaker 5>track and stuff.</v>

2964
02:12:02.601 --> 02:12:07.601
<v Speaker 5>And then I went home and I have a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>snakes at home and I started passing </v>

2965
02:12:07.601 --> 02:12:07.601
<v Speaker 5>around snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When people check this,</v>

2966
02:12:07.890 --> 02:12:09.960
<v Speaker 5>check this one out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got my scoping out and torrential,</v>

2967
02:12:09.961 --> 02:12:11.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of my friends was like,</v>

2968
02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:13.730
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a normal Saturday night with say</v>

2969
02:12:13.731 --> 02:12:16.880
<v Speaker 5>with old dms creatures and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I stopped her and I was like,</v>

2970
02:12:16.881 --> 02:12:19.310
<v Speaker 5>fleur,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is actually normal.</v>

2971
02:12:19.370 --> 02:12:24.370
<v Speaker 5>This shit that we were doing earlier on </v>
<v Speaker 5>where we're all showing each other </v>

2972
02:12:24.370 --> 02:12:27.200
<v Speaker 5>photos on our iphone and watching TV and</v>
<v Speaker 5>put in a DVD on and playing fee for an a</v>

2973
02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:30.080
<v Speaker 5>playstation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a construct that has been created</v>

2974
02:12:30.081 --> 02:12:35.081
<v Speaker 5>to make us feel okay about life and keep</v>
<v Speaker 5>a stupid so that the bosses can do what </v>

2975
02:12:35.081 --> 02:12:35.540
<v Speaker 5>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is real.</v>

2976
02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:40.600
<v Speaker 5>We're supposed to know the name of every</v>
<v Speaker 5>snake was supposedly in the name of </v>

2977
02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:40.600
<v Speaker 5>every tree in the forest.</v>

2978
02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:43.040
<v Speaker 5>We've lost that ability and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to get back to.</v>

2979
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:44.540
<v Speaker 5>Is it normal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2980
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:48.230
<v Speaker 5>I think that playstations or about as </v>
<v Speaker 5>normal as beehives.</v>

2981
02:12:48.650 --> 02:12:53.650
<v Speaker 5>It's something really procreate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People create things and they create </v>

2982
02:12:53.650 --> 02:12:54.440
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Construction,</v>

2983
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:55.550
<v Speaker 5>buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cars.</v>

2984
02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:59.300
<v Speaker 5>They create things all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think all behaviors natural.</v>

2985
02:12:59.330 --> 02:13:01.580
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think even the most bizarre fucked</v>

2986
02:13:01.581 --> 02:13:04.670
<v Speaker 5>up human behavior is natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are as we're natural.</v>

2987
02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:05.090
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2988
02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:07.610
<v Speaker 5>we of course were natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're part of the animal kingdom.</v>

2989
02:13:07.611 --> 02:13:10.210
<v Speaker 5>We are as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a creature and natural create,</v>

2990
02:13:10.211 --> 02:13:15.211
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the natural thing created by bees would </v>

2991
02:13:15.211 --> 02:13:15.950
<v Speaker 5>be a wild hive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And honey,</v>

2992
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:19.280
<v Speaker 5>the natural thing created by humans </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be a child.</v>

2993
02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:23.240
<v Speaker 5>A painting is a slightly abstract </v>
<v Speaker 5>version of creation style creation,</v>

2994
02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:27.110
<v Speaker 5>but it's much more abstract than awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beehive and a baby.</v>

2995
02:13:27.170 --> 02:13:29.360
<v Speaker 5>So there's nothing natural about </v>
<v Speaker 5>buildings,</v>

2996
02:13:29.361 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 5>but yet human beings construct</v>

2997
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:37.010
<v Speaker 2>them without any interaction with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other all over the world and they'd be </v>

2998
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:38.640
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shelter to keep the rain off,</v>

2999
02:13:38.650 --> 02:13:41.250
<v Speaker 2>use natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like that's where it starts to trade</v>

3000
02:13:41.251 --> 02:13:46.251
<v Speaker 2>center and then they figured out solar </v>
<v Speaker 2>power and then they figured out </v>

3001
02:13:46.251 --> 02:13:46.251
<v Speaker 2>electricity and then they figured out </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wifi.</v>

3002
02:13:46.251 --> 02:13:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Then they figured out that it seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural to me.</v>

3003
02:13:48.590 --> 02:13:53.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like it should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not wild because </v>

3004
02:13:53.590 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 2>independent of human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't exist,</v>

3005
02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:57.300
<v Speaker 2>but independent of bees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bee Hives don't exist.</v>

3006
02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:02.100
<v Speaker 2>I think he is as bizarre as our antics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and our creations are.</v>

3007
02:14:02.101 --> 02:14:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I think ultimately everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens is,</v>

3008
02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:06.060
<v Speaker 2>is natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3009
02:14:06.150 --> 02:14:11.150
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with differences in being </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can debate whether or not we </v>

3010
02:14:11.150 --> 02:14:14.091
<v Speaker 2>should be doing it or whether in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences are worth the effort that </v>

3011
02:14:14.091 --> 02:14:14.340
<v Speaker 2>the toxifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oceans,</v>

3012
02:14:14.341 --> 02:14:18.090
<v Speaker 2>the sky's the pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That picture that I showed you of Mexico</v>

3013
02:14:18.090 --> 02:14:18.900
<v Speaker 2>City have fucked up.</v>

3014
02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:23.900
<v Speaker 2>The pollution is in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are creatures out there that </v>

3015
02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:23.900
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3016
02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:24.660
<v Speaker 2>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just.</v>

3017
02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:29.550
<v Speaker 2>We're not tuned into that vibration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are creatures that as far as we're</v>

3018
02:14:29.551 --> 02:14:34.551
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we watch them silently communicate </v>

3019
02:14:34.551 --> 02:14:34.551
<v Speaker 2>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not silent for them.</v>

3020
02:14:34.551 --> 02:14:39.200
<v Speaker 2>There is something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's old double or something </v>

3021
02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:41.871
<v Speaker 2>that they sent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so something that they understand that </v>

3022
02:14:41.871 --> 02:14:41.970
<v Speaker 2>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just not in tune with the idea,</v>

3023
02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:47.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and these things that we create </v>

3024
02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:47.060
<v Speaker 2>naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say for the sake of argument,</v>

3025
02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:50.130
<v Speaker 2>a skyscraper or a jumbo jet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3026
02:14:50.250 --> 02:14:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is natural because we exist and we </v>

3027
02:14:55.250 --> 02:14:55.250
<v Speaker 2>create it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>

3028
02:14:55.250 --> 02:14:57.750
<v Speaker 2>that's a natural process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those things that we're now creating</v>

3029
02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:02.610
<v Speaker 2>a large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expanded huge versions of boys natural.</v>

3030
02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.640
<v Speaker 2>The trade senate isn't a natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>building and natural building might </v>

3031
02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:08.150
<v Speaker 2>house 10 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many people housed,</v>

3032
02:15:08.490 --> 02:15:10.350
<v Speaker 2>lived in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked in the trade center.</v>

3033
02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to enough thousand.</v>

3034
02:15:12.211 --> 02:15:13.150
<v Speaker 2>3,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were.</v>

3035
02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me feels slightly unnatural.</v>

3036
02:15:15.601 --> 02:15:20.601
<v Speaker 2>A jumbo jet that can take 500 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>from one place to the other feels a </v>

3037
02:15:20.601 --> 02:15:23.250
<v Speaker 2>little unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a plane that can take eight people</v>

3038
02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:26.270
<v Speaker 2>feels a little bit more natural agent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3039
02:15:26.610 --> 02:15:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swollen.</v>

3040
02:15:27.781 --> 02:15:29.820
<v Speaker 2>We've everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's natural.</v>

3041
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.020
<v Speaker 2>That's what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3042
02:15:31.021 --> 02:15:34.860
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why Mexico City exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the same time that Los Angeles exists</v>

3043
02:15:34.861 --> 02:15:39.861
<v Speaker 2>at the same time that New York City </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists is because if you leave people </v>

3044
02:15:39.861 --> 02:15:39.861
<v Speaker 2>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't kill them off.</v>

3045
02:15:39.861 --> 02:15:40.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't kill them off with disease or </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

3046
02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:44.790
<v Speaker 2>They overpopulate and they develop these</v>
<v Speaker 2>nationally intrusive cities.</v>

3047
02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's natural for us.</v>

3048
02:15:46.321 --> 02:15:48.600
<v Speaker 2>It's natural for us as a species to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and go,</v>

3049
02:15:48.810 --> 02:15:51.960
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deli is completely swollen with people,</v>

3050
02:15:51.961 --> 02:15:53.820
<v Speaker 2>but that's the natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3051
02:15:53.821 --> 02:15:55.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>journey that the,</v>

3052
02:15:55.710 --> 02:15:57.930
<v Speaker 2>that the country of India is going to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and create this.</v>

3053
02:15:57.930 --> 02:16:02.930
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think if you take </v>

3054
02:16:02.930 --> 02:16:04.200
<v Speaker 2>out this human bias that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is natural for a species to,</v>

3055
02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:07.290
<v Speaker 2>that we're not supposed to read </v>
<v Speaker 2>rampantly out of control.</v>

3056
02:16:07.291 --> 02:16:12.291
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to take care of the air </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the planet and the food and do that </v>

3057
02:16:12.301 --> 02:16:14.760
<v Speaker 2>in balance and naturally with a species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3058
02:16:14.761 --> 02:16:18.420
<v Speaker 2>the reason why human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 2>overpopulating is because we figured out</v>

3059
02:16:18.421 --> 02:16:21.510
<v Speaker 2>how to get the fuck away from predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No reason why we wanted to fuck and make</v>

3060
02:16:21.511 --> 02:16:26.511
<v Speaker 2>as many people as possible as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because naturally we got eaten mean the </v>

3061
02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:30.861
<v Speaker 2>Jaguar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The key kills the antelope also kills </v>

3062
02:16:30.861 --> 02:16:30.861
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True</v>

3063
02:16:30.861 --> 02:16:33.790
<v Speaker 4>that that was a big part of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a grass hut.</v>

3064
02:16:33.791 --> 02:16:35.380
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard to fight those fuckers </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

3065
02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:37.450
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the reason why we left the forest.</v>

3066
02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:39.660
<v Speaker 4>We're not in that window in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenario anymore,</v>

3067
02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:44.840
<v Speaker 4>so we're developing this new style of </v>
<v Speaker 4>living and we have to figure out a way </v>

3068
02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:49.351
<v Speaker 4>to deal with the consequences of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this waste that we produce and also deal</v>

3069
02:16:49.541 --> 02:16:54.541
<v Speaker 4>with the fact that people have this very</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre diffusion of responsibility </v>

3070
02:16:54.541 --> 02:16:56.650
<v Speaker 4>thing going on when there's a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are doing something and that</v>

3071
02:16:56.651 --> 02:16:59.710
<v Speaker 4>something is fucking everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels different than if one person is</v>

3072
02:16:59.711 --> 02:17:01.750
<v Speaker 4>doing something and something is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>things up,</v>

3073
02:17:01.930 --> 02:17:06.930
<v Speaker 4>then you feel responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're a part of a city that's </v>

3074
02:17:06.930 --> 02:17:07.840
<v Speaker 4>polluting the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem like it's your fault.</v>

3075
02:17:07.841 --> 02:17:09.300
<v Speaker 4>It seems like somebody else out there</v>

3076
02:17:09.570 --> 02:17:10.660
<v Speaker 5>be fixing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3077
02:17:10.670 --> 02:17:11.600
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the very.</v>

3078
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:16.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think empathy's one of the most </v>

3079
02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:17.430
<v Speaker 5>dangerous words on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they very apathetic idea of,</v>

3080
02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:22.780
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what difference can I make a plastic </v>

3081
02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:22.780
<v Speaker 5>bowl and just forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

3082
02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:27.141
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously if everyone flood that way it </v>

3083
02:17:27.141 --> 02:17:27.141
<v Speaker 5>would be a major issue.</v>

3084
02:17:27.141 --> 02:17:29.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of friends who smoke </v>

3085
02:17:29.430 --> 02:17:29.430
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately because I know a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedians and I cigarettes.</v>

3086
02:17:29.430 --> 02:17:34.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I see them throw them on the ground </v>

3087
02:17:34.050 --> 02:17:34.050
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They throw them in the ground,</v>

3088
02:17:34.050 --> 02:17:34.210
<v Speaker 4>step on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My two,</v>

3089
02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:35.670
<v Speaker 4>two of my friends the other day did it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

3090
02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:37.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to just be that guy,</v>

3091
02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:40.750
<v Speaker 4>correct people every time that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I just avoid it.</v>

3092
02:17:40.810 --> 02:17:45.810
<v Speaker 4>But fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so depressing the fact that people </v>

3093
02:17:45.810 --> 02:17:46.120
<v Speaker 4>are just so comfortable with throwing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarette on the ground,</v>

3094
02:17:46.121 --> 02:17:48.070
<v Speaker 4>stepping on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it's out of their mind.</v>

3095
02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:53.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to step away from the mic for </v>

3096
02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:53.100
<v Speaker 4>a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's trash.</v>

3097
02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:53.100
<v Speaker 4>It's trash.</v>

3098
02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:53.960
<v Speaker 5>Like that's what I want to say when that</v>
<v Speaker 5>happens,</v>

3099
02:17:54.390 --> 02:17:57.290
<v Speaker 5>there's a complete disconnect and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think it comes.</v>

3100
02:17:57.920 --> 02:17:59.210
<v Speaker 5>And this is another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3101
02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:00.720
<v Speaker 5>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3102
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:05.950
<v Speaker 5>comment on cigarette smokers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it comes from the fat that they </v>

3103
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:05.950
<v Speaker 5>smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they smoke,</v>

3104
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:10.260
<v Speaker 5>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get to the end of it and they're </v>

3105
02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:10.260
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

3106
02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:10.260
<v Speaker 5>that's a day habits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking disgusting.</v>

3107
02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:11.960
<v Speaker 5>They throw it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had done with it.</v>

3108
02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:13.090
<v Speaker 5>So it's not that problem.</v>

3109
02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:15.180
<v Speaker 4>ISO,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're abusing their own bodies so they</v>

3110
02:18:15.181 --> 02:18:17.550
<v Speaker 4>don't mind abusing the environment.</v>

3111
02:18:17.590 --> 02:18:18.250
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

3112
02:18:18.251 --> 02:18:22.180
<v Speaker 5>So you say a lot of times people driving</v>
<v Speaker 5>on roads or freeways and the idea behind</v>

3113
02:18:22.181 --> 02:18:24.160
<v Speaker 5>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know this is bad for me.</v>

3114
02:18:24.161 --> 02:18:26.530
<v Speaker 5>I know it's dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to step it out and leave it</v>

3115
02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:31.531
<v Speaker 5>in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to throw it into the </v>

3116
02:18:31.531 --> 02:18:31.531
<v Speaker 5>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

3117
02:18:31.531 --> 02:18:31.531
<v Speaker 5>I've seen</v>

3118
02:18:31.531 --> 02:18:34.910
<v Speaker 4>different Prius's throw cigarettes out </v>
<v Speaker 4>the window of my favorite things.</v>

3119
02:18:35.470 --> 02:18:37.910
<v Speaker 4>Trying to keep up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep a running tab of Prius's,</v>

3120
02:18:37.911 --> 02:18:39.100
<v Speaker 4>throwing cigarettes out the window.</v>

3121
02:18:39.670 --> 02:18:40.790
<v Speaker 5>Anything it feels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do anything.</v>

3122
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:43.240
<v Speaker 5>It looks bizarre now when people smoked </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes,</v>

3123
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:48.270
<v Speaker 5>like I was born in [inaudible] 76 until </v>
<v Speaker 5>the probably early two thousands.</v>

3124
02:18:49.180 --> 02:18:52.510
<v Speaker 5>Seeing people smoking cigarettes didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>really matter to me.</v>

3125
02:18:52.540 --> 02:18:54.700
<v Speaker 5>I'd been so exposed to it that I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>just.</v>

3126
02:18:54.730 --> 02:18:56.140
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even have a comment about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just like,</v>

3127
02:18:56.170 --> 02:18:57.240
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there it is now,</v>

3128
02:18:57.241 --> 02:18:59.510
<v Speaker 5>and I see someone pull out a box,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull out a cigarette,</v>

3129
02:18:59.530 --> 02:19:01.380
<v Speaker 5>put it in the mouth in light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like watching like,</v>

3130
02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:03.430
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>

3131
02:19:03.431 --> 02:19:08.431
<v Speaker 5>Do you not know what's happening with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing that you're just about to </v>

3132
02:19:08.431 --> 02:19:08.431
<v Speaker 5>inhale it?</v>

3133
02:19:08.431 --> 02:19:11.510
<v Speaker 4>This is going to slowly poison you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thrill of it or the fun of it or</v>

3134
02:19:11.511 --> 02:19:14.070
<v Speaker 4>the James Dean thing where they just </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be cool.</v>

3135
02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:15.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The danger of.</v>

3136
02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:17.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I grew up thinking about all that stuff.</v>

3137
02:19:17.891 --> 02:19:22.891
<v Speaker 5>It looks cool for James Deane to smoke </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and the Beatles grew up smoking and </v>

3138
02:19:22.891 --> 02:19:27.211
<v Speaker 5>then in the Second World War they gave </v>
<v Speaker 5>them out as part of your rations so you </v>

3139
02:19:27.211 --> 02:19:30.211
<v Speaker 5>can understand how soldiers came back </v>
<v Speaker 5>being addicted to cigarettes because </v>

3140
02:19:30.211 --> 02:19:31.550
<v Speaker 5>they're scared of death that are around </v>
<v Speaker 5>death that bought out their mind.</v>

3141
02:19:31.970 --> 02:19:34.400
<v Speaker 5>They get 10 cigarettes a week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all gonna smoke cigarettes,</v>

3142
02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:36.170
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3143
02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:40.970
<v Speaker 5>the level of education certainly in most</v>
<v Speaker 5>of western Europe and in this country is</v>

3144
02:19:40.971 --> 02:19:43.250
<v Speaker 5>to such an extent that when I see a </v>
<v Speaker 5>smoke I'm just like,</v>

3145
02:19:43.251 --> 02:19:44.470
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3146
02:19:44.710 --> 02:19:47.840
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those weird contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I know,</v>

3147
02:19:47.930 --> 02:19:49.820
<v Speaker 5>I know very intelligent people smoke </v>
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>

3148
02:19:49.821 --> 02:19:54.821
<v Speaker 5>which is very shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you know someone and they're </v>

3149
02:19:54.821 --> 02:19:55.220
<v Speaker 5>brilliant and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't stop smoking cigarettes.</v>

3150
02:19:55.220 --> 02:20:00.220
<v Speaker 5>So like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you could figure out a way to </v>

3151
02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:02.831
<v Speaker 5>balance this whole thing out better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd be so much healthier but they </v>

3152
02:20:02.831 --> 02:20:06.170
<v Speaker 5>don't self self abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows the self abuse things.</v>

3153
02:20:06.171 --> 02:20:11.171
<v Speaker 5>An interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean everyone's on their own </v>

3154
02:20:11.171 --> 02:20:11.171
<v Speaker 5>journey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you just kinda gotta let them.</v>

3155
02:20:11.171 --> 02:20:12.320
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think everyone has advice,</v>

3156
02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:14.060
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes you just say that to </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone,</v>

3157
02:20:14.061 --> 02:20:15.800
<v Speaker 5>just let them know how you feel about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3158
02:20:15.801 --> 02:20:20.801
<v Speaker 5>It'll maybe shift their perspective and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll have this new found way of </v>

3159
02:20:20.801 --> 02:20:20.801
<v Speaker 5>living whole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3160
02:20:20.801 --> 02:20:21.790
<v Speaker 5>Dom's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3161
02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:24.230
<v Speaker 5>I think it was fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I just do it.</v>

3162
02:20:24.231 --> 02:20:25.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't think about doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3163
02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:28.460
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a lot more fucking,</v>

3164
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:31.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>opinion a,</v>

3165
02:20:31.001 --> 02:20:32.780
<v Speaker 5>it's not that I don't have strong </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinions now,</v>

3166
02:20:32.781 --> 02:20:34.430
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kind of keep them a little bit more to</v>

3167
02:20:34.431 --> 02:20:39.431
<v Speaker 5>myself in my twenties I thought that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was just a human thing to be able to </v>

3168
02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:43.700
<v Speaker 5>kind of spit venom at people when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>felt like doing that.</v>

3169
02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:45.260
<v Speaker 5>Now I kind of like grown up a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>

3170
02:20:45.261 --> 02:20:50.261
<v Speaker 5>I don't do as much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but unless I was dating someone who I </v>

3171
02:20:50.261 --> 02:20:50.750
<v Speaker 5>was in love with and they were smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I would never do,</v>

3172
02:20:50.751 --> 02:20:53.810
<v Speaker 5>I found that really attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I feel like I'm in a position or my</v>

3173
02:20:53.811 --> 02:20:55.370
<v Speaker 5>family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like a friend,</v>

3174
02:20:55.850 --> 02:20:57.290
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like they'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't.</v>

3179
02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:08.030
<v Speaker 5>To kill all day every day and think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about those cigarette smokers is man,</v>

3180
02:21:08.031 --> 02:21:10.520
<v Speaker 5>they wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a cup of coffee and a cigarette.</v>

3181
02:21:10.521 --> 02:21:12.620
<v Speaker 5>They liked that fucker and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything gets started.</v>

3182
02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:16.700
<v Speaker 5>That eight hours of downtime with no </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarette is fucking with them when they</v>

3183
02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:17.830
<v Speaker 5>wake up in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3184
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:20.430
<v Speaker 5>Which is a whole system throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 5>night going,</v>

3185
02:21:20.431 --> 02:21:22.090
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's get this toxin out.</v>

3186
02:21:22.090 --> 02:21:27.090
<v Speaker 5>Let's send all these messages to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain that this is bad and we'll deal </v>

3187
02:21:27.090 --> 02:21:27.090
<v Speaker 5>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they wake up in the morning.</v>

3188
02:21:27.090 --> 02:21:27.090
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3189
02:21:27.090 --> 02:21:27.500
<v Speaker 5>I feel so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need a cigarette.</v>

3190
02:21:27.501 --> 02:21:29.160
<v Speaker 5>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read this booklet,</v>

3191
02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:34.180
<v Speaker 5>said the craving for a cigarette is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily the craving for a cigarette.</v>

3192
02:21:34.641 --> 02:21:39.641
<v Speaker 5>It's the craving to stop the bad feeling</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the cigarette by replacing it with </v>

3193
02:21:41.151 --> 02:21:46.151
<v Speaker 5>the adrenaline that your body creates by</v>
<v Speaker 5>putting the poison inside you again so </v>

3194
02:21:46.151 --> 02:21:48.950
<v Speaker 5>you feel shitty because you smoked the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarette and what you need to make that</v>

3195
02:21:48.951 --> 02:21:52.790
<v Speaker 5>shitty feeling go away is to expose </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself to another jolt of the poison.</v>

3196
02:21:52.791 --> 02:21:53.930
<v Speaker 5>So your system goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3197
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:57.290
<v Speaker 5>let's deal with this adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Throw all those painkillers in there and</v>

3198
02:21:57.291 --> 02:22:02.291
<v Speaker 5>then 20 minutes later you get it again </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then 20 minutes later did you read </v>

3199
02:22:02.291 --> 02:22:05.600
<v Speaker 5>that book called something like how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>quit smoking or five steps to quit </v>

3200
02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:05.600
<v Speaker 5>smoking.</v>

3201
02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:09.320
<v Speaker 5>My trainer played around with smoking </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes while and I was like,</v>

3202
02:22:09.321 --> 02:22:10.890
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might train econ smoke,</v>

3203
02:22:12.340 --> 02:22:13.460
<v Speaker 5>and he called him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had him.</v>

3204
02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:16.580
<v Speaker 5>I didn't change his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his language as to how we refer to them.</v>

3205
02:22:16.581 --> 02:22:19.070
<v Speaker 5>He called them smoky treats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3206
02:22:19.140 --> 02:22:23.800
<v Speaker 5>Yukon call cigarette smells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like something you give a dog and</v>

3207
02:22:23.810 --> 02:22:24.770
<v Speaker 5>you know he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

3208
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:27.500
<v Speaker 5>he's little positive affirmation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just gonna.</v>

3209
02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:29.510
<v Speaker 5>Have a little smoky treat and to give </v>
<v Speaker 5>myself a smoker tree.</v>

3210
02:22:29.530 --> 02:22:30.000
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3211
02:22:30.001 --> 02:22:35.001
<v Speaker 5>you're killing yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he read this book and it was </v>

3212
02:22:35.001 --> 02:22:35.001
<v Speaker 5>the reason why he quit and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me read it.</v>

3213
02:22:35.001 --> 02:22:39.561
<v Speaker 5>I don't smoke but I want to read it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that was the thing that I took home </v>

3214
02:22:39.561 --> 02:22:42.070
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was this idea that it's not the fact </v>

3215
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:44.691
<v Speaker 5>that the cigarette makes you feel good </v>
<v Speaker 5>or you love the feeling or it's five </v>

3216
02:22:44.691 --> 02:22:48.411
<v Speaker 5>minutes of downtime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the fact that that concentrated </v>

3217
02:22:48.411 --> 02:22:52.050
<v Speaker 5>inhalation of poison is taking away from</v>
<v Speaker 5>the shit you feeling that you're getting</v>

3218
02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:53.960
<v Speaker 5>from the longterm effects of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>poison.</v>

3219
02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about all that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly the way it's been </v>

3220
02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:01.540
<v Speaker 3>explained to me by addiction experts are</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you have an addiction,</v>

3221
02:23:01.970 --> 02:23:06.970
<v Speaker 3>like everyone talks about the cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 3>calmed them down and the way it was </v>

3222
02:23:06.970 --> 02:23:06.970
<v Speaker 3>explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

3223
02:23:06.970 --> 02:23:09.880
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes don't calm you down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they do is they feed your addiction</v>

3224
02:23:10.210 --> 02:23:13.000
<v Speaker 3>so you have this addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're stressed out because your body is</v>

3225
02:23:13.001 --> 02:23:15.340
<v Speaker 3>craving this thing that it's attached </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

3226
02:23:15.690 --> 02:23:17.740
<v Speaker 3>You have some sort of at a molecular </v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

3227
02:23:17.741 --> 02:23:22.741
<v Speaker 3>you have this bizarre attachment to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>substance that you've been pumping into </v>

3228
02:23:22.741 --> 02:23:24.490
<v Speaker 3>your body so that your anxiety ramps up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body needs it,</v>

3229
02:23:24.491 --> 02:23:26.800
<v Speaker 3>and then when you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh see,</v>

3230
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:28.530
<v Speaker 3>like cigarettes relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

3231
02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:28.810
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3232
02:23:28.820 --> 02:23:30.640
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're addicted to cigarettes.</v>

3233
02:23:30.641 --> 02:23:35.000
<v Speaker 3>And that feeding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that addiction calms the craving.</v>

3234
02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Calms the screaming of the addiction for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a brief amount of time,</v>

3235
02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:42.400
<v Speaker 3>and then it asks for it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that cigarettes calm,</v>

3236
02:23:42.401 --> 02:23:43.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't really,</v>

3237
02:23:43.870 --> 02:23:48.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're your extra amped up because of </v>

3238
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.870
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you're addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes.</v>

3239
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:49.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was very lucky.</v>

3240
02:23:49.591 --> 02:23:51.540
<v Speaker 5>I grew up with a with a mom who's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>nurse,</v>

3241
02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:55.110
<v Speaker 5>so my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my mom exposed me to two things which,</v>

3242
02:23:55.170 --> 02:23:57.510
<v Speaker 5>which stopped me from smoking </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes.</v>

3243
02:23:57.511 --> 02:23:59.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not to say that when I was 17,</v>

3244
02:23:59.551 --> 02:24:01.920
<v Speaker 5>18 and one of my best friends walked </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside to smoke a cigarette,</v>

3245
02:24:01.921 --> 02:24:02.400
<v Speaker 5>I didn't go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3246
02:24:02.401 --> 02:24:05.010
<v Speaker 5>let me try it and cut it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And was like,</v>

3247
02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:05.550
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3248
02:24:05.551 --> 02:24:06.540
<v Speaker 5>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3249
02:24:06.541 --> 02:24:09.690
<v Speaker 5>I've danced with that devil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my mum did two things for me.</v>

3250
02:24:09.691 --> 02:24:14.691
<v Speaker 5>The first one was she told me about </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in the hospitals that she was </v>

3251
02:24:14.691 --> 02:24:16.560
<v Speaker 5>working out there had to have legs </v>
<v Speaker 5>amputated,</v>

3252
02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:19.470
<v Speaker 5>hands amputated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>arms amputated due to complications with</v>

3253
02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:20.700
<v Speaker 5>smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>

3254
02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:22.260
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking heavy.</v>

3255
02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:27.680
<v Speaker 5>And then the other one was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she printed out a list of which we've </v>

3256
02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:31.170
<v Speaker 5>all seen by now the ingredients of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>process of cigarette,</v>

3257
02:24:31.171 --> 02:24:32.060
<v Speaker 5>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3258
02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:37.100
<v Speaker 5>fucking cyanide and whole foods and </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3259
02:24:37.950 --> 02:24:40.100
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3260
02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:40.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you said,</v>

3261
02:24:40.831 --> 02:24:45.831
<v Speaker 5>hundreds if not thousands of things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are a direct fight against health and </v>

3262
02:24:45.961 --> 02:24:47.040
<v Speaker 5>your system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3263
02:24:47.070 --> 02:24:48.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do this.</v>

3264
02:24:48.220 --> 02:24:48.500
<v Speaker 5>Did you see</v>

3265
02:24:48.610 --> 02:24:51.150
<v Speaker 3>either Russell Crowe movie the insider?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3266
02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:56.540
<v Speaker 3>The one that was all about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists that worked with the tobacco </v>

3267
02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:57.600
<v Speaker 3>companies to make cigarettes more toxic </v>
<v Speaker 3>or more addictive rather.</v>

3268
02:24:57.630 --> 02:24:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating.</v>

3269
02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Apparently based on reality too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3270
02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3271
02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:04.230
<v Speaker 5>I watched a inside out over the weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3272
02:25:04.231 --> 02:25:06.840
<v Speaker 5>this new great watch it with my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch it yesterday.</v>

3273
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:10.560
<v Speaker 5>So I did a review.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do this thing on twitter called at the</v>

3274
02:25:10.561 --> 02:25:11.760
<v Speaker 5>flicks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like if I,</v>

3275
02:25:11.761 --> 02:25:14.730
<v Speaker 5>if I watch a film that has had an effect</v>
<v Speaker 5>on me,</v>

3276
02:25:14.731 --> 02:25:17.390
<v Speaker 5>I do a little blurb about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about what I like about it on a,</v>

3277
02:25:17.430 --> 02:25:22.430
<v Speaker 5>on a word press word press account.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I thought it was a really interested</v>

3278
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:28.670
<v Speaker 5>in movie for a lot of different reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the major ones is that the way </v>

3279
02:25:28.670 --> 02:25:33.181
<v Speaker 5>that it's being touted and sold in La is</v>
<v Speaker 5>to deal with these very cartoony light </v>

3280
02:25:35.171 --> 02:25:36.970
<v Speaker 5>characters that live in this girl's </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain.</v>

3281
02:25:36.971 --> 02:25:37.840
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lewis Black,</v>

3282
02:25:37.841 --> 02:25:39.270
<v Speaker 5>his anger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's all red.</v>

3283
02:25:39.900 --> 02:25:42.970
<v Speaker 5>And then amy poehler is joy and she's </v>
<v Speaker 5>sweet.</v>

3284
02:25:42.971 --> 02:25:46.000
<v Speaker 5>And then sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's like overweight and has,</v>

3285
02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:48.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blue heron needs her adenoids taken out,</v>

3286
02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:54.270
<v Speaker 5>but it's from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from where I was saying it is a common </v>

3287
02:25:54.270 --> 02:25:59.040
<v Speaker 5>on the first time a human being has </v>
<v Speaker 5>exposed themselves to depression and </v>

3288
02:25:59.471 --> 02:26:04.471
<v Speaker 5>what it can do at a molecular level to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that person and the journey you have to </v>

3289
02:26:04.471 --> 02:26:04.471
<v Speaker 5>go on.</v>

3290
02:26:04.471 --> 02:26:09.450
<v Speaker 5>So like the beast or all their little </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships with these emotions and </v>

3291
02:26:09.450 --> 02:26:14.011
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the a story was this really dark </v>

3292
02:26:14.011 --> 02:26:15.940
<v Speaker 5>story of a girl moving from where she </v>
<v Speaker 5>moved from Minnesota,</v>

3293
02:26:15.941 --> 02:26:18.910
<v Speaker 5>Minnesota to San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She lost a friend.</v>

3294
02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:23.920
<v Speaker 5>She wasn't in the hockey team anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She had a slightly different </v>

3295
02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:27.031
<v Speaker 5>relationship with their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>School wasn't going where she ended up </v>

3296
02:26:27.031 --> 02:26:29.941
<v Speaker 5>trying to be a runaway and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was brilliant at first and </v>

3297
02:26:29.941 --> 02:26:31.990
<v Speaker 5>foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if it did not feel like a kids movie</v>

3298
02:26:31.991 --> 02:26:36.991
<v Speaker 5>to me and if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a bitter pill to swallow because </v>

3299
02:26:36.991 --> 02:26:39.310
<v Speaker 5>when I was a kid up until the age of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to the edge of 15.</v>

3300
02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:43.390
<v Speaker 5>I really had no concept of depression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know I existed.</v>

3301
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:47.800
<v Speaker 5>I was just a happy go lucky kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was sad when I got less sweets than</v>

3302
02:26:47.801 --> 02:26:52.801
<v Speaker 5>my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but happier when I did and for the most </v>

3303
02:26:52.801 --> 02:26:52.801
<v Speaker 5>part I was just coasting on the second</v>

3304
02:26:52.801 --> 02:26:56.490
<v Speaker 2>till you started dating church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone just slamming a lot of what </v>

3305
02:26:56.490 --> 02:26:57.760
<v Speaker 2>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean you want a kiss?</v>

3306
02:26:57.761 --> 02:26:59.770
<v Speaker 2>My best mate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

3307
02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

3308
02:27:02.711 --> 02:27:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize it could wear it like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cloak,</v>

3309
02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:09.340
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My whole thing was sadness was just like</v>

3310
02:27:09.341 --> 02:27:10.240
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt the stairs.</v>

3311
02:27:10.241 --> 02:27:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I scraped my knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sad.</v>

3312
02:27:11.380 --> 02:27:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad.</v>

3313
02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:13.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up in the morning.</v>

3314
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:16.990
<v Speaker 2>My default setting was happiness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then girls and stuff.</v>

3315
02:27:16.991 --> 02:27:18.130
<v Speaker 2>It became like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man.</v>

3316
02:27:18.131 --> 02:27:23.131
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been sad for a week and it was </v>

3317
02:27:23.131 --> 02:27:23.620
<v Speaker 2>depression and that thing in that inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>out movie.</v>

3318
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:29.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean I cried like a fucking baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the short film before </v>

3319
02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:33.961
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lava with the two volcanoes was in bits </v>

3320
02:27:33.961 --> 02:27:33.961
<v Speaker 2>where you really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was crying.</v>

3321
02:27:33.961 --> 02:27:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I went on a date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a day.</v>

3322
02:27:34.661 --> 02:27:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so embarrassed.</v>

3323
02:27:36.130 --> 02:27:38.710
<v Speaker 2>You're crying on Jesus Christ and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>

3324
02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:40.040
<v Speaker 2>She didn't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's.</v>

3325
02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't know.</v>

3326
02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:42.790
<v Speaker 2>She knew your crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't weeping.</v>

3327
02:27:42.970 --> 02:27:46.060
<v Speaker 2>How long had you been dating her living?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dating for a few weeks.</v>

3328
02:27:46.300 --> 02:27:51.300
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she's facing probably ready to </v>

3329
02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:51.300
<v Speaker 2>bail.</v>

3330
02:27:51.610 --> 02:27:53.260
<v Speaker 2>She was crying and she's a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

3331
02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:56.050
<v Speaker 2>She was crying at the lava thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're both broken,</v>

3332
02:27:57.430 --> 02:28:01.420
<v Speaker 2>broken and fucked up and like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you think?</v>

3333
02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Did you see was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did your kids respond to the stuff in </v>

3334
02:28:06.780 --> 02:28:07.840
<v Speaker 2>her head and did they respond to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other stuff?</v>

3335
02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They respond to the whole thing.</v>

3336
02:28:10.330 --> 02:28:11.280
<v Speaker 2>They loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are.</v>

3337
02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:16.300
<v Speaker 2>We even went to the bookstore afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we bought some books on it because </v>

3338
02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:20.581
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have books inside out books or </v>

3339
02:28:20.581 --> 02:28:22.580
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of like into depth about </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different things and the impacts</v>

3340
02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:27.580
<v Speaker 3>of emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you need the sadness and how the </v>

3341
02:28:27.580 --> 02:28:28.340
<v Speaker 3>sadness can help you change your mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>and make decisions.</v>

3342
02:28:28.380 --> 02:28:29.420
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was.</v>

3343
02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:34.980
<v Speaker 5>There was one thing which they changed </v>
<v Speaker 5>the very less that they put into the </v>

3344
02:28:34.980 --> 02:28:35.370
<v Speaker 5>script.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not put into the Strip that last minute,</v>

3345
02:28:35.371 --> 02:28:37.590
<v Speaker 5>but but involved in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The last minute that I was,</v>

3346
02:28:37.710 --> 02:28:42.710
<v Speaker 5>I was gonna write a scathing review </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that particular thing because you </v>

3347
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:43.230
<v Speaker 5>know the whole thing about coal </v>
<v Speaker 5>memories.</v>

3348
02:28:43.710 --> 02:28:48.710
<v Speaker 5>All the core memories were happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My thing was going to be not all your </v>

3349
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:49.430
<v Speaker 5>coal memories happy some of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>memories,</v>

3350
02:28:49.550 --> 02:28:53.820
<v Speaker 5>a dark and heavy and they define who you</v>
<v Speaker 5>are as a person to the positive,</v>

3351
02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:59.120
<v Speaker 5>but they did that at the end cause </v>
<v Speaker 5>sadness Takota those coal Mary's and </v>

3352
02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:00.270
<v Speaker 5>they kind of found the balance of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some are good,</v>

3353
02:29:00.330 --> 02:29:05.330
<v Speaker 5>some are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the only things that I wasn't </v>

3354
02:29:05.330 --> 02:29:05.330
<v Speaker 5>crazy about and I thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>potentially a little darkness,</v>

3355
02:29:05.370 --> 02:29:10.370
<v Speaker 5>a little dark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that when the emotions were </v>

3356
02:29:10.370 --> 02:29:11.130
<v Speaker 5>navigating their way back to the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>brain area,</v>

3357
02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:16.460
<v Speaker 5>they walked through the subconscious and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the subconscious was scary and dark and </v>

3358
02:29:16.460 --> 02:29:19.410
<v Speaker 5>mysterious and black and potentially </v>
<v Speaker 5>things would jump out at you.</v>

3359
02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:24.920
<v Speaker 5>And my subconscious isn't all like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of my subconscious is a tiger's </v>

3360
02:29:24.991 --> 02:29:29.991
<v Speaker 5>drinking cups of tea with sources and </v>
<v Speaker 5>asking me how I am and I'm in different </v>

3361
02:29:29.991 --> 02:29:31.320
<v Speaker 5>galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Spinning around having fun,</v>

3362
02:29:31.321 --> 02:29:33.780
<v Speaker 5>so I do have doc elements to my </v>
<v Speaker 5>subconscious,</v>

3363
02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:39.080
<v Speaker 5>but I thought it was a little dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>to tell little kids anything that lives </v>

3364
02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:42.660
<v Speaker 5>in the catechumens of your mind is </v>
<v Speaker 5>potentially dangerous.</v>

3365
02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:43.290
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3366
02:29:43.540 --> 02:29:45.360
<v Speaker 5>some of that could be a poem that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

3367
02:29:45.361 --> 02:29:48.060
<v Speaker 5>Or a song that you wrote or painting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is beautiful.</v>

3368
02:29:48.061 --> 02:29:49.620
<v Speaker 5>Like that was my only issue.</v>

3369
02:29:49.890 --> 02:29:52.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought the three d abstract thing was</v>

3370
02:29:52.891 --> 02:29:54.360
<v Speaker 3>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

3371
02:29:54.361 --> 02:29:56.860
<v Speaker 3>When they there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of lost their shape.</v>

3372
02:29:57.610 --> 02:30:00.590
<v Speaker 5>That was really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just ended up becoming shapes.</v>

3373
02:30:00.591 --> 02:30:02.420
<v Speaker 5>One was like a big star rolling around</v>

3374
02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:07.860
<v Speaker 3>so well done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such a well done movie and really like </v>

3375
02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:10.591
<v Speaker 3>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a movie that even though it was a </v>

3376
02:30:10.591 --> 02:30:10.780
<v Speaker 3>child's movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really adults could appreciate it.</v>

3377
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:15.870
<v Speaker 5>I felt like it was more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt like it will work on a love adult</v>

3378
02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:21.380
<v Speaker 5>levels that I wrote in this review.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like say thank you for the fact </v>

3379
02:30:22.231 --> 02:30:27.231
<v Speaker 5>that your kids under the age of 10 might</v>
<v Speaker 5>not necessarily pick up on some of the </v>

3380
02:30:27.231 --> 02:30:30.951
<v Speaker 5>heavier themes of this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You will at some point reach a point in </v>

3381
02:30:30.951 --> 02:30:34.221
<v Speaker 5>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wet sadness will smack you in the mouth </v>

3382
02:30:34.221 --> 02:30:34.500
<v Speaker 5>and you have to deal with it like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>a 10 year old isn't ready for that yet,</v>

3383
02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:39.680
<v Speaker 5>but your 12 year old might be okay with </v>
<v Speaker 5>it because they're going through some </v>

3384
02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:39.680
<v Speaker 5>changes too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was brilliant.</v>

3385
02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:44.420
<v Speaker 3>I've spent a lot of time wondering what </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things are there for like is there</v>

3386
02:30:44.761 --> 02:30:49.761
<v Speaker 3>a reason why depression exists?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a reason why sadness or joy </v>

3387
02:30:49.761 --> 02:30:54.471
<v Speaker 3>euphoria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they serve some sort of evolutionary </v>

3388
02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:56.430
<v Speaker 3>re?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>

3389
02:30:56.440 --> 02:31:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Is there some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a reason why they exist that we</v>

3390
02:31:00.571 --> 02:31:05.571
<v Speaker 3>just have to sort of manage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean is it really the reason why </v>

3391
02:31:05.571 --> 02:31:07.860
<v Speaker 3>people have gotten so far because we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not just totally content with everything</v>

3392
02:31:07.861 --> 02:31:11.430
<v Speaker 3>the way it is and there's always going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be jealousy.</v>

3393
02:31:11.431 --> 02:31:16.431
<v Speaker 3>There's always going to be like we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the actors looking at </v>

3394
02:31:16.431 --> 02:31:16.431
<v Speaker 3>other people going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is this?</v>

3395
02:31:16.431 --> 02:31:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Because they've reached some point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>success and it's never enough and </v>

3396
02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:23.390
<v Speaker 3>there's some new thing that eludes them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some new thing that they wish they could</v>

3397
02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:28.400
<v Speaker 3>have that then thing would be better and</v>
<v Speaker 3>by his thing fucked up and I don't do </v>

3398
02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:28.400
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3399
02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:33.080
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like these are motivating </v>

3400
02:31:33.080 --> 02:31:33.360
<v Speaker 3>energies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are motivating elements.</v>

3401
02:31:33.630 --> 02:31:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean and the depression thing when you</v>

3402
02:31:36.811 --> 02:31:38.280
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you first start dating,</v>

3403
02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:42.870
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's almost like burning your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand on a hot stove,</v>

3404
02:31:42.871 --> 02:31:47.871
<v Speaker 3>like letting you know like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with something really fucking </v>

3405
02:31:47.871 --> 02:31:50.481
<v Speaker 3>powerful here and this horrible feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have right now when it's not </v>

3406
02:31:50.481 --> 02:31:54.381
<v Speaker 3>working out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Understand this and understand the </v>

3407
02:31:54.381 --> 02:31:56.871
<v Speaker 3>consequences of getting involved in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship now because it's not so </v>

3408
02:31:56.871 --> 02:32:01.041
<v Speaker 3>easy to just jumping in with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not so easy and you learn so much </v>

3409
02:32:01.041 --> 02:32:03.170
<v Speaker 3>from those fucking early relationships </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was the pain.</v>

3410
02:32:03.390 --> 02:32:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Like I had a manipulative girlfriend in </v>
<v Speaker 3>high school.</v>

3411
02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Not Her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a nice girl.</v>

3412
02:32:07.250 --> 02:32:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she is lovely.</v>

3413
02:32:08.101 --> 02:32:09.570
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was very nice girl,</v>

3414
02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:14.600
<v Speaker 3>but she had a single single parent or </v>
<v Speaker 3>mom was quite large and didn't like men </v>

3415
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:19.790
<v Speaker 3>and there was a lot of lot of education </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on that was probably not so </v>

3416
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:21.330
<v Speaker 3>beneficial in trying to get into </v>
<v Speaker 3>pennies.</v>

3417
02:32:21.330 --> 02:32:22.320
<v Speaker 3>So she didn't live there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3418
02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:26.020
<v Speaker 3>I got in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she got in mind to girls.</v>

3419
02:32:26.500 --> 02:32:31.500
<v Speaker 3>She's dirty little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But point being was that that </v>

3420
02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:33.810
<v Speaker 3>manipulation that I experienced from her</v>
<v Speaker 3>very on very early on,</v>

3421
02:32:34.290 --> 02:32:36.870
<v Speaker 3>it made me realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3422
02:32:36.871 --> 02:32:41.871
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this can happen to like shit that </v>

3423
02:32:41.871 --> 02:32:44.211
<v Speaker 3>doesn't happen with my friends can </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen with a girl and then all of a </v>

3424
02:32:44.211 --> 02:32:48.381
<v Speaker 3>sudden we'll take your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had developed this intense zero </v>

3425
02:32:48.381 --> 02:32:50.850
<v Speaker 3>bullshit policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I got older and I became a man,</v>

3426
02:32:50.900 --> 02:32:55.900
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a woman would try to manipulate me </v>

3427
02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:55.900
<v Speaker 3>in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would start laughing.</v>

3428
02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:55.900
<v Speaker 3>I'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's adorable.</v>

3429
02:32:56.190 --> 02:32:59.760
<v Speaker 3>But that's not going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately I have other options and so,</v>

3430
02:32:59.761 --> 02:33:01.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not going to work out anymore.</v>

3431
02:33:01.081 --> 02:33:03.720
<v Speaker 3>So take care of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I hadn't gone through that,</v>

3432
02:33:03.721 --> 02:33:08.721
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have friends that are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>perpetual victims and they get </v>

3433
02:33:08.721 --> 02:33:12.620
<v Speaker 3>manipulated by women over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again because they're weak and I </v>

3434
02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:16.971
<v Speaker 3>think there's a certain amount of women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they appreciate it or whether </v>

3435
02:33:16.971 --> 02:33:20.361
<v Speaker 3>they rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they honest about or not almost </v>

3436
02:33:20.361 --> 02:33:21.420
<v Speaker 3>can't help manipulating men who are easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>to manipulate.</v>

3437
02:33:21.730 --> 02:33:24.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can play them like,</v>

3438
02:33:24.121 --> 02:33:25.320
<v Speaker 3>fucking let me play up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ding,</v>

3439
02:33:25.321 --> 02:33:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Ding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ding.</v>

3440
02:33:26.210 --> 02:33:27.650
<v Speaker 3>You just want to hit the tunes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3441
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:29.460
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's something,</v>

3442
02:33:29.610 --> 02:33:31.920
<v Speaker 3>there's something natural in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

3443
02:33:31.980 --> 02:33:36.270
<v Speaker 3>a natural predatory response to weakness</v>
<v Speaker 3>in certain ways.</v>

3444
02:33:36.271 --> 02:33:39.690
<v Speaker 3>And I kind of feel like that's all mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that Shit's in place like that.</v>

3445
02:33:39.691 --> 02:33:42.900
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like to ensure momentum,</v>

3446
02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:47.130
<v Speaker 3>to ensure entropy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to ensure that energy keeps moving.</v>

3447
02:33:47.131 --> 02:33:50.280
<v Speaker 3>And there's no stagnant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean if you stay stagnant,</v>

3448
02:33:50.281 --> 02:33:51.570
<v Speaker 3>you will get depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

3449
02:33:51.810 --> 02:33:55.380
<v Speaker 3>if you don't evolve and don't succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will feel like shit.</v>

3450
02:33:55.710 --> 02:33:57.330
<v Speaker 3>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get dumped,</v>

3451
02:33:57.570 --> 02:34:02.570
<v Speaker 3>you know you're going to feel horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better figure out how to not get </v>

3452
02:34:02.570 --> 02:34:02.570
<v Speaker 3>dumped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3453
02:34:02.570 --> 02:34:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Just just handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3454
02:34:03.241 --> 02:34:06.270
<v Speaker 3>if it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grown up with a mom who she admires,</v>

3455
02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:11.300
<v Speaker 3>who is also manipulative to her dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she also then she may potentially fall </v>

3456
02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:14.950
<v Speaker 3>into that pit bull trap of doing that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>other guys.</v>

3457
02:34:14.951 --> 02:34:15.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3458
02:34:15.810 --> 02:34:16.710
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a creature,</v>

3459
02:34:16.711 --> 02:34:18.250
<v Speaker 3>as a by allegedly,</v>

3460
02:34:18.670 --> 02:34:23.670
<v Speaker 5>like you said earlier on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have taken ourselves out of the </v>

3461
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:24.850
<v Speaker 5>equation of how do we solve the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conundrum of staying warm at night,</v>

3462
02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:27.160
<v Speaker 5>being protected from predators where we </v>
<v Speaker 5>get our food from.</v>

3463
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:32.190
<v Speaker 5>We've sold all that as a creature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So our brain is now giving yourself the </v>

3464
02:34:32.190 --> 02:34:32.740
<v Speaker 5>opportunity to expand mold than the </v>
<v Speaker 5>physical.</v>

3465
02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:37.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people don't necessarily go to the </v>

3466
02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:37.920
<v Speaker 5>gym and hit the ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people,</v>

3467
02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:38.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>read and get an education stuff.</v>

3468
02:34:38.681 --> 02:34:43.681
<v Speaker 5>So from an evolutionary point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing that is expanding more than </v>

3469
02:34:43.681 --> 02:34:46.510
<v Speaker 5>anything else is our brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that's positive and to a detriment I</v>

3470
02:34:46.511 --> 02:34:50.380
<v Speaker 5>feel because we do overthink things and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we do guys have into a situation,</v>

3471
02:34:50.381 --> 02:34:51.850
<v Speaker 5>is this right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should this be happening?</v>

3472
02:34:51.851 --> 02:34:54.820
<v Speaker 5>To me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that in this you have to look at</v>

3473
02:34:54.821 --> 02:34:58.540
<v Speaker 5>it as the same coin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just flipped over in a different way.</v>

3474
02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:03.600
<v Speaker 5>If you have a great birthday and you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the gifts that you want and you got </v>

3475
02:35:03.831 --> 02:35:06.100
<v Speaker 5>a great piece of birthday cake and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>your friends showed up,</v>

3476
02:35:06.670 --> 02:35:11.670
<v Speaker 5>that's beautiful and you experienced it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you loved it and you told her your </v>

3477
02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:15.181
<v Speaker 5>friends about it and you relive it with </v>
<v Speaker 5>your friends and it was one of those </v>

3478
02:35:15.181 --> 02:35:15.181
<v Speaker 5>days that you always think about when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you go to sleep at night because it will</v>

3479
02:35:15.181 --> 02:35:18.670
<v Speaker 5>help you go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to understand that the day when</v>

3480
02:35:18.671 --> 02:35:23.671
<v Speaker 5>none of your friends showed up for your </v>
<v Speaker 5>birthday pie and you and your parents </v>

3481
02:35:23.671 --> 02:35:23.671
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your gift that you didn't really want.</v>

3482
02:35:23.671 --> 02:35:28.350
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just viewing it in a different </v>

3483
02:35:28.350 --> 02:35:29.080
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're viewing that thing is like,</v>

3484
02:35:29.350 --> 02:35:30.520
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing is bad.</v>

3485
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:32.410
<v Speaker 5>This thing is good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just your life.</v>

3486
02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:33.940
<v Speaker 5>There's those things just happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3487
02:35:34.090 --> 02:35:36.310
<v Speaker 5>and you have to have the balance of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those two things.</v>

3488
02:35:36.310 --> 02:35:39.040
<v Speaker 5>So what I tried to do when I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>younger,</v>

3489
02:35:39.041 --> 02:35:42.370
<v Speaker 5>I would suffer from her lot and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am prone to depression.</v>

3490
02:35:42.371 --> 02:35:45.980
<v Speaker 5>So I try and keep myself in a positive </v>
<v Speaker 5>headspace,</v>

3491
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.000
<v Speaker 5>but a great way for me to attack </v>
<v Speaker 5>depression when I see it comment is to </v>

3492
02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:51.490
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is natural,</v>

3493
02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:56.520
<v Speaker 5>this is normal peaks and troughs are a </v>
<v Speaker 5>way for you to understand the journey </v>

3494
02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:00.571
<v Speaker 5>that you're in and you can't if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're getting overly high about </v>

3495
02:36:00.761 --> 02:36:03.610
<v Speaker 5>something that's as dangerous as getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>overly low about something,</v>

3496
02:36:03.611 --> 02:36:06.130
<v Speaker 5>it's the bit in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is the balance.</v>

3497
02:36:06.131 --> 02:36:07.240
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>

3498
02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:12.380
<v Speaker 3>So if you get overly high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a price to pay at the end of </v>

3499
02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:12.380
<v Speaker 3>this ride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That has to be.</v>

3500
02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:14.100
<v Speaker 3>If you get too drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna get hangover,</v>

3501
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3502
02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:19.940
<v Speaker 3>That hung over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost worth it to experience the </v>

3503
02:36:19.940 --> 02:36:20.280
<v Speaker 3>great buzz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those great moments.</v>

3504
02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:23.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like those great moments that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have when you're drunk.</v>

3505
02:36:23.220 --> 02:36:28.220
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking pay for him for a couple of </v>

3506
02:36:28.220 --> 02:36:28.220
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're almost worth it.</v>

3507
02:36:28.220 --> 02:36:29.100
<v Speaker 3>That is almost at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is</v>

3508
02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:33.270
<v Speaker 5>the balance I've been in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been in situations in my life where</v>

3509
02:36:33.271 --> 02:36:36.780
<v Speaker 5>I've thought I've.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've sat around on my own and thought,</v>

3510
02:36:37.590 --> 02:36:42.590
<v Speaker 5>I think the worst is going to happen in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this situation that I'm in with this </v>

3511
02:36:42.590 --> 02:36:47.181
<v Speaker 5>girl or this business scenario or this </v>
<v Speaker 5>day that I'm going to have tomorrow.</v>

3512
02:36:47.940 --> 02:36:52.940
<v Speaker 5>I think the worst is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My ultimate nightmare that I can </v>

3513
02:36:52.940 --> 02:36:56.721
<v Speaker 5>envisage is going to happen and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened and I have to be okay with the </v>

3514
02:36:57.661 --> 02:37:02.661
<v Speaker 5>fact that it's happened and it's never </v>
<v Speaker 5>quite as crushingly bad as you make it </v>

3515
02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:04.080
<v Speaker 5>in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3516
02:37:04.081 --> 02:37:05.640
<v Speaker 5>I've been in like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been in a city,</v>

3517
02:37:05.700 --> 02:37:07.410
<v Speaker 5>I've been in situations where to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>where I'm like,</v>

3518
02:37:07.470 --> 02:37:12.470
<v Speaker 5>I know we'll break it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't want it to fuck that guy </v>

3519
02:37:12.470 --> 02:37:12.990
<v Speaker 5>and she fucks that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3520
02:37:13.530 --> 02:37:15.120
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it happened</v>

3521
02:37:16.850 --> 02:37:18.080
<v Speaker 2>and you survive it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3522
02:37:18.090 --> 02:37:18.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

3523
02:37:18.910 --> 02:37:20.720
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the lessons is like you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>get through it.</v>

3524
02:37:20.780 --> 02:37:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a real problem for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't ever get through that and they</v>

3525
02:37:24.051 --> 02:37:26.150
<v Speaker 2>don't realize that it's not gonna be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the world.</v>

3526
02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:29.750
<v Speaker 2>I got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the girl that I talked about,</v>

3527
02:37:29.751 --> 02:37:32.000
<v Speaker 2>but another girl that I did in high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school who was,</v>

3528
02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:36.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to say slut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no other word for.</v>

3529
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:38.410
<v Speaker 2>She would fuck anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just,</v>

3530
02:37:38.540 --> 02:37:40.980
<v Speaker 2>she was a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just poor girl.</v>

3531
02:37:40.981 --> 02:37:42.710
<v Speaker 2>She went to Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made her,</v>

3532
02:37:43.370 --> 02:37:45.410
<v Speaker 2>they fucked her head up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucked her head up.</v>

3533
02:37:45.411 --> 02:37:46.370
<v Speaker 2>They made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made her,</v>

3534
02:37:46.810 --> 02:37:49.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the forbidden fruit.</v>

3535
02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3536
02:37:49.730 --> 02:37:50.330
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3537
02:37:50.331 --> 02:37:52.490
<v Speaker 2>and also I think she was hormonally very</v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced.</v>

3538
02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:53.780
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3539
02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:57.050
<v Speaker 2>she was very woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like at the age of like 17.</v>

3540
02:37:57.170 --> 02:38:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was like cheezits mess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she fucked everybody I knew.</v>

3541
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:04.220
<v Speaker 2>So like when I was in love with her at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one point in time,</v>

3542
02:38:04.221 --> 02:38:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure whatever you would call in love</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

3543
02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:10.610
<v Speaker 2>So I got used to that at an early age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to disappointing disappointment.</v>

3544
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3545
02:38:12.471 --> 02:38:17.471
<v Speaker 2>it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's fascinating to me that you say </v>

3546
02:38:17.471 --> 02:38:17.600
<v Speaker 2>that you didn't experience any </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression at all into your 15,</v>

3547
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:22.430
<v Speaker 2>but then you say that depression is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you're prone to.</v>

3548
02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3549
02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:26.360
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I am prone to it.</v>

3550
02:38:26.361 --> 02:38:31.361
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you never experienced it until you </v>

3551
02:38:31.361 --> 02:38:31.490
<v Speaker 2>hit your till you started dating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what it was.</v>

3552
02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:33.830
<v Speaker 2>It didn't really know the concept of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

3553
02:38:33.831 --> 02:38:38.831
<v Speaker 2>sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me it was like scraping my and then </v>

3554
02:38:38.831 --> 02:38:38.831
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was very temporary.</v>

3555
02:38:38.831 --> 02:38:42.011
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like you had this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>existential angst that was dragging you </v>

3556
02:38:42.011 --> 02:38:42.320
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3557
02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:43.850
<v Speaker 2>What is the point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3558
02:38:44.090 --> 02:38:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because I didn't know that </v>

3559
02:38:49.090 --> 02:38:50.180
<v Speaker 2>existed when it hit me for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

3560
02:38:50.181 --> 02:38:53.480
<v Speaker 2>I had absolutely no defense against it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I never.</v>

3561
02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suddenly walked around call corner and</v>

3562
02:38:56.190 --> 02:38:57.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a saber tooth tiger in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

3563
02:38:57.820 --> 02:38:59.150
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

3564
02:38:59.151 --> 02:39:04.151
<v Speaker 2>that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just enveloped me and then my </v>

3565
02:39:04.151 --> 02:39:07.991
<v Speaker 2>defenses had not been built through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My formative child is to go through </v>

3566
02:39:07.991 --> 02:39:09.380
<v Speaker 2>elements of sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

3567
02:39:09.381 --> 02:39:11.330
<v Speaker 2>my foundation and my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents were together.</v>

3568
02:39:11.331 --> 02:39:12.740
<v Speaker 2>They never fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got on well.</v>

3569
02:39:12.741 --> 02:39:14.360
<v Speaker 2>I had a good relationship with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

3570
02:39:14.361 --> 02:39:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did okay at school.</v>

3571
02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:21.340
<v Speaker 2>I never had those real major challenges </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from the fact that I knew I was </v>

3572
02:39:21.340 --> 02:39:22.670
<v Speaker 2>enacted and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I doing in trying to be</v>

3573
02:39:22.671 --> 02:39:23.020
<v Speaker 2>an actuary?</v>

3574
02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Manchester is never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to be an actor.</v>

3575
02:39:25.281 --> 02:39:30.281
<v Speaker 2>I had banks but it wasn't like a painful</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical mental and so it was just </v>

3576
02:39:30.281 --> 02:39:34.091
<v Speaker 2>something that I was dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think I had the full issued </v>

3577
02:39:34.091 --> 02:39:37.090
<v Speaker 2>to deal with it the first time and I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge fan of women and I also probably </v>

3578
02:39:38.721 --> 02:39:43.721
<v Speaker 2>punched a little bit above my weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger because I was the </v>

3579
02:39:43.721 --> 02:39:47.441
<v Speaker 2>smallest kid at school about super </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouthy and no one could ever tell me to </v>

3580
02:39:47.441 --> 02:39:50.921
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was always trying to go for the </v>

3581
02:39:50.921 --> 02:39:51.950
<v Speaker 2>ultimate girl and every so often the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate bill gill to be like,</v>

3582
02:39:52.210 --> 02:39:53.990
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll entertain you for a week.</v>

3583
02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:55.310
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found it.</v>

3584
02:39:55.311 --> 02:39:56.180
<v Speaker 2>And then she'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

3585
02:39:56.181 --> 02:39:57.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to jog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3586
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:59.600
<v Speaker 2>ah fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even compete with the joke,</v>

3587
02:39:59.601 --> 02:39:59.840
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3588
02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:04.840
<v Speaker 2>So I think I didn't get myself pitfalls </v>
<v Speaker 2>until the point where my parents had </v>

3589
02:40:06.131 --> 02:40:07.790
<v Speaker 2>kind of said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

3590
02:40:07.791 --> 02:40:08.660
<v Speaker 2>you now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3591
02:40:08.661 --> 02:40:09.490
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16.</v>

3592
02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:10.280
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3593
02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:12.500
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go find out who you're going to be.</v>

3594
02:40:12.501 --> 02:40:15.180
<v Speaker 2>And at that point I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a little,</v>

3595
02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:17.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to some sadness and stuff.</v>

3596
02:40:17.701 --> 02:40:18.420
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3597
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's part of life,</v>

3598
02:40:20.791 --> 02:40:21.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this,</v>

3599
02:40:21.470 --> 02:40:22.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter,</v>

3600
02:40:22.231 --> 02:40:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not constantly,</v>

3601
02:40:23.911 --> 02:40:25.350
<v Speaker 2>but if anyone ever says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3602
02:40:25.351 --> 02:40:30.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been struggling with this or you </v>

3603
02:40:30.351 --> 02:40:30.351
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is getting me down,</v>

3604
02:40:30.351 --> 02:40:30.730
<v Speaker 2>or I had a rough day or I've had a rough</v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

3605
02:40:30.750 --> 02:40:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3606
02:40:31.471 --> 02:40:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick with this or whatever.</v>

3607
02:40:33.060 --> 02:40:38.060
<v Speaker 2>And the way that I respond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I always respond to it is </v>

3608
02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:38.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3609
02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:39.690
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will improve.</v>

3610
02:40:39.870 --> 02:40:42.810
<v Speaker 2>And you will get to a point where you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to look back and say,</v>

3611
02:40:43.050 --> 02:40:44.700
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a dark period in my life.</v>

3612
02:40:44.730 --> 02:40:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it's gonna all be dark and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to die.</v>

3613
02:40:48.421 --> 02:40:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Which is a horrible way to live your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3614
02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:54.030
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to be hopeful about it.</v>

3615
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3616
02:40:56.370 --> 02:40:57.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3617
02:40:57.180 --> 02:41:00.960
<v Speaker 2>the way that you make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said earlier on of your life,</v>

3618
02:41:01.050 --> 02:41:01.950
<v Speaker 2>is to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3619
02:41:01.951 --> 02:41:04.800
<v Speaker 2>here's a dark place is a light place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a dark place,</v>

3620
02:41:04.801 --> 02:41:07.740
<v Speaker 2>here's a light place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the sweet spot is in the middle.</v>

3621
02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:08.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3622
02:41:09.790 --> 02:41:11.940
<v Speaker 2>there's a great line in the office that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ricky Gervais' show.</v>

3623
02:41:11.941 --> 02:41:16.941
<v Speaker 2>I think he ends the entire show by </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying life is a series of peaks and </v>

3624
02:41:16.941 --> 02:41:21.831
<v Speaker 2>troughs and you don't know you're in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know you're in a trough until </v>

3625
02:41:21.831 --> 02:41:24.321
<v Speaker 2>you had enough to a peak and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know any peak until you're coming down </v>

3626
02:41:24.321 --> 02:41:24.321
<v Speaker 2>the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is true of life,</v>

3627
02:41:24.321 --> 02:41:24.321
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3628
02:41:24.321 --> 02:41:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want my life to be incredibly </v>

3629
02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:30.720
<v Speaker 2>hectically happy all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I would burn out.</v>

3630
02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:36.140
<v Speaker 2>And obviously you don't want your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be incredibly darkly heavily sad </v>

3631
02:41:36.511 --> 02:41:40.620
<v Speaker 2>because that's going to kill you too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to just be cruising.</v>

3632
02:41:40.770 --> 02:41:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I just want to cruise with balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Balance is a huge word for me.</v>

3633
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't usually appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't usually appreciate the sun </v>

3634
02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:53.781
<v Speaker 2>because I'm used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't usually appreciate civilization </v>

3635
02:41:53.781 --> 02:41:54.990
<v Speaker 2>traffic because I'm used to it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's become what it is,</v>

3636
02:41:55.410 --> 02:42:00.150
<v Speaker 2>but I spent a week on Prince of Wales </v>
<v Speaker 2>Island in Alaska and it rained every day</v>

3637
02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:05.180
<v Speaker 2>constantly all day and we're camping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were in these tents and we're </v>

3638
02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:05.940
<v Speaker 2>soaking wet and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had these,</v>

3639
02:42:05.941 --> 02:42:07.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helmets or a brother.</v>

3640
02:42:07.861 --> 02:42:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm a headlights on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3641
02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:14.540
<v Speaker 2>there's a strap on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you turn the light on so you can walk </v>

3642
02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:14.540
<v Speaker 2>around at night and not fall.</v>

3643
02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:16.620
<v Speaker 2>And I turned it on inside my tent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this,</v>

3644
02:42:17.050 --> 02:42:17.930
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

3645
02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:20.490
<v Speaker 2>it was raining inside the tent because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just missed.</v>

3646
02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:22.500
<v Speaker 2>It was water mist everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

3647
02:42:22.860 --> 02:42:25.170
<v Speaker 2>it was so wet and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just weird.</v>

3648
02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:27.330
<v Speaker 2>You're just constantly drenched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a great time.</v>

3649
02:42:27.450 --> 02:42:32.450
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a terrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is when I came back to La </v>

3650
02:42:32.450 --> 02:42:35.400
<v Speaker 2>and it was sunny and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and just driving around,</v>

3651
02:42:35.401 --> 02:42:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I called my friend and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3652
02:42:36.601 --> 02:42:40.590
<v Speaker 2>I fucking feel fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was nothing unusual going on.</v>

3653
02:42:40.591 --> 02:42:42.120
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was great stuff.</v>

3654
02:42:42.121 --> 02:42:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do standup at night.</v>

3655
02:42:44.431 --> 02:42:49.431
<v Speaker 2>Everything was normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the contrast to being in that </v>

3656
02:42:49.431 --> 02:42:52.140
<v Speaker 2>miserable fucking rain soaked island for</v>
<v Speaker 2>five days,</v>

3657
02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:55.140
<v Speaker 2>like all of a sudden now I appreciated </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I was like,</v>

3658
02:42:55.170 --> 02:42:56.130
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed that.</v>

3659
02:42:56.131 --> 02:43:01.131
<v Speaker 2>I needed that balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes you need to camp to </v>

3660
02:43:01.131 --> 02:43:01.860
<v Speaker 2>appreciate a house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show the perspective of the whole thing.</v>

3661
02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:04.660
<v Speaker 2>I have my own issues with that light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean festivals way.</v>

3662
02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Hoffman is way too hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean born in Germany,</v>

3663
02:43:08.010 --> 02:43:11.950
<v Speaker 2>brought up in Manchester until I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hot sunny day</v>

3664
02:43:12.190 --> 02:43:16.400
<v Speaker 1>in either one of those countries is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a e three e four,</v>

3665
02:43:16.410 --> 02:43:17.830
<v Speaker 1>so a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh dude,</v>

3666
02:43:17.831 --> 02:43:22.831
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a day when like people take days </v>

3667
02:43:22.831 --> 02:43:22.831
<v Speaker 1>off work and they go by and get drunk in</v>
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

3668
02:43:22.831 --> 02:43:23.610
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a day of work.</v>

3669
02:43:23.810 --> 02:43:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Was January here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you know,</v>

3670
02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:28.870
<v Speaker 1>91,</v>
<v Speaker 1>92 degrees.</v>

3671
02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't analyze it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like oh that's nothing.</v>

3672
02:43:30.851 --> 02:43:32.710
<v Speaker 1>That's 100 right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure at least,</v>

3673
02:43:32.711 --> 02:43:35.470
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably 100 to 110 on a bad day.</v>

3674
02:43:35.550 --> 02:43:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's nothing compared to Vegas.</v>

3675
02:43:38.650 --> 02:43:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Vegas is brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's that.</v>

3676
02:43:40.331 --> 02:43:42.940
<v Speaker 1>But also the the major issue that I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>in la,</v>

3677
02:43:43.690 --> 02:43:48.690
<v Speaker 1>which is something that I'm constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring with my friends is </v>

3678
02:43:48.690 --> 02:43:52.140
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately the culture for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>part is a little jaded.</v>

3679
02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:57.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people come into La Tech as </v>

3680
02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:00.601
<v Speaker 1>much money as they can out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then leave and it's been depleted </v>

3681
02:44:00.601 --> 02:44:01.060
<v Speaker 1>spiritually and of its soul.</v>

3682
02:44:01.090 --> 02:44:02.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's community,</v>

3683
02:44:02.141 --> 02:44:07.141
<v Speaker 1>you go to places like Barcelona or or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Berlin or Wellington or Sydney where </v>

3684
02:44:07.141 --> 02:44:07.780
<v Speaker 1>people are feeding that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3685
02:44:07.781 --> 02:44:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I get the impression that La for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most part,</v>

3686
02:44:09.671 --> 02:44:14.671
<v Speaker 1>has things been ripped out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken out of it like the foundations </v>

3687
02:44:14.671 --> 02:44:16.300
<v Speaker 1>have been taken out of it because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective issue though,</v>

3688
02:44:16.301 --> 02:44:18.460
<v Speaker 1>but the way you're viewing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could very well be,</v>

3689
02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypes or characters of La,</v>

3690
02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:29.220
<v Speaker 1>the the social walking down sunset </v>
<v Speaker 1>boulevard or the cool guy that wears a </v>

3691
02:44:29.591 --> 02:44:34.591
<v Speaker 1>white dress shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a white dress shirt and a cowboy hat on </v>

3692
02:44:34.591 --> 02:44:36.340
<v Speaker 1>a Friday night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their reaction to see as that archetype.</v>

3693
02:44:36.450 --> 02:44:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I know the guys that are in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard,</v>

3694
02:44:37.961 --> 02:44:42.961
<v Speaker 1>you know the guys in the rooftop bars </v>
<v Speaker 1>and standard.</v>

3695
02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:46.380
<v Speaker 1>We go there after the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Source of great.</v>

3696
02:44:46.510 --> 02:44:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3697
02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:50.050
<v Speaker 1>It's good food and I like the people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tanks and stuff.</v>

3698
02:44:50.050 --> 02:44:55.050
<v Speaker 1>That's where kids are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the standard explain that and </v>

3699
02:44:55.050 --> 02:44:55.930
<v Speaker 1>you go to check in at the reservations </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the desk.</v>

3700
02:44:56.290 --> 02:45:01.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a woman that is in her underwear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is in like a fish tank,</v>

3701
02:45:01.860 --> 02:45:06.860
<v Speaker 1>an aquarium that's essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's reading a book and she's not </v>

3702
02:45:06.860 --> 02:45:07.180
<v Speaker 1>allowed to interact with you so she </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't look at you.</v>

3703
02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:12.360
<v Speaker 1>She just lives around this aquarium and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like reads your book and is in her </v>

3704
02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:15.370
<v Speaker 1>underwear and it's so fucking variably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetically beautiful.</v>

3705
02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Invariably teaching the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking into the hotel.</v>

3706
02:45:18.371 --> 02:45:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Something very weird about hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

3707
02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:23.320
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those archetypes,</v>

3708
02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:27.160
<v Speaker 1>their reaction to seeing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely impressive,</v>

3709
02:45:27.490 --> 02:45:32.490
<v Speaker 1>let's say for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an animal that we've never seen </v>

3710
02:45:32.490 --> 02:45:36.841
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crossing sunset boulevard and when it </v>

3711
02:45:36.841 --> 02:45:40.531
<v Speaker 1>gets to the junction of traffic going </v>
<v Speaker 1>one way and traffic going in another </v>

3712
02:45:40.531 --> 02:45:43.201
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sits in a yoga position and creates </v>

3713
02:45:43.201 --> 02:45:44.110
<v Speaker 1>this fucking eclipse of bright hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>sunlight.</v>

3714
02:45:44.530 --> 02:45:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Their reaction to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing the cool la thing is to </v>

3715
02:45:49.530 --> 02:45:51.160
<v Speaker 1>go cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to be like,</v>

3716
02:45:51.460 --> 02:45:53.440
<v Speaker 1>holy fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life just ended.</v>

3717
02:45:53.441 --> 02:45:55.240
<v Speaker 1>That is the most awesome thing I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>

3718
02:45:55.570 --> 02:45:59.420
<v Speaker 1>The required reaction in La is to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

3719
02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Those people that are trying to fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

3720
02:46:02.831 --> 02:46:07.831
<v Speaker 1>I think that La has so many people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people that are trying to it and</v>

3721
02:46:09.531 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a part</v>

3722
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:15.040
<v Speaker 2>of the problem is it's so many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not doing what they want to do here </v>

3723
02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:16.970
<v Speaker 2>and they're trying to and they in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a,</v>

3724
02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:22.140
<v Speaker 2>a giant population of trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3725
02:46:22.690 --> 02:46:24.920
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a lot of great artists </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

3726
02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:28.550
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of great painters here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of great musicians here.</v>

3727
02:46:28.551 --> 02:46:31.580
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of great comics here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think as far as standup comedy goes,</v>

3728
02:46:31.581 --> 02:46:33.260
<v Speaker 2>is the greatest spot on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

3729
02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:34.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything even </v>
<v Speaker 2>close.</v>

3730
02:46:34.970 --> 02:46:38.210
<v Speaker 2>New York is probably second place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

3731
02:46:38.211 --> 02:46:43.211
<v Speaker 2>it's tough to fuck with La and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>like as far as architecture and as far </v>

3732
02:46:44.331 --> 02:46:49.331
<v Speaker 2>as our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a lot of contribution of </v>

3733
02:46:49.331 --> 02:46:51.610
<v Speaker 2>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of great shit in the </v>

3734
02:46:51.610 --> 02:46:53.890
<v Speaker 2>street in downtown and there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that want to be one of those </v>

3735
02:46:53.901 --> 02:46:58.901
<v Speaker 2>musicians that want to be one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists that want to be one of those </v>

3736
02:46:58.901 --> 02:46:58.901
<v Speaker 2>comedians.</v>

3737
02:46:58.901 --> 02:46:59.120
<v Speaker 2>I want to be one of those actors that </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be one of those,</v>

3738
02:46:59.390 --> 02:47:04.390
<v Speaker 2>anything that's important and so they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to be that person and you're </v>

3739
02:47:04.390 --> 02:47:05.600
<v Speaker 2>around them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones who are going to go.</v>

3740
02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3741
02:47:06.830 --> 02:47:11.830
<v Speaker 2>There's the fakers yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of fakers you also move </v>

3742
02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:12.170
<v Speaker 2>into in what I would assume to be for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3743
02:47:12.171 --> 02:47:15.920
<v Speaker 2>at least quite a healthy community of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comics that will know each other to have</v>

3744
02:47:15.921 --> 02:47:20.921
<v Speaker 2>known each other for 20 years that hang </v>
<v Speaker 2>out on illness clubs on sunset and you </v>

3745
02:47:20.921 --> 02:47:24.881
<v Speaker 2>have a nice little perculating community</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people traveling in Java now.</v>

3746
02:47:25.071 --> 02:47:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Everyone says hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that.</v>

3747
02:47:26.781 --> 02:47:27.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm the recluse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3748
02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:32.900
<v Speaker 2>so I don't hang out with actors buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any active friends.</v>

3749
02:47:33.470 --> 02:47:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm like I'm friends with people </v>

3750
02:47:38.470 --> 02:47:40.601
<v Speaker 2>that I've worked with full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of hanging out like Elijah </v>

3751
02:47:40.601 --> 02:47:40.601
<v Speaker 2>and I are super tight.</v>

3752
02:47:40.601 --> 02:47:41.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily hang out with him </v>
<v Speaker 2>that much apart from little gnomes,</v>

3753
02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Orlando and had to say in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

3754
02:47:43.790 --> 02:47:48.790
<v Speaker 2>but they have that kind of recluse too </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's me going out on sunset and </v>

3755
02:47:48.981 --> 02:47:53.981
<v Speaker 2>certainly certainly me going out on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunset with Elijah or Orlando Old Bailey</v>

3756
02:47:54.350 --> 02:47:55.810
<v Speaker 2>is a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's billy?</v>

3757
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Billy Boyd who I was in load the rings </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

3758
02:47:57.970 --> 02:47:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Played the other hub at the Scottish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3759
02:47:59.950 --> 02:48:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3760
02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:05.860
<v Speaker 2>That is a fucking zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no interest in is why those guys </v>

3761
02:48:05.860 --> 02:48:09.020
<v Speaker 2>are reclusive because when you get to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elijah Wood's status in life,</v>

3762
02:48:09.050 --> 02:48:11.390
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to be normal.</v>

3763
02:48:11.391 --> 02:48:16.391
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to go to a restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 2>without being this side show everywhere </v>

3764
02:48:16.391 --> 02:48:16.730
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people must stare at them,</v>

3765
02:48:17.090 --> 02:48:20.720
<v Speaker 2>so that's why I got like that becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>recluse in the animal in the zoo.</v>

3766
02:48:20.900 --> 02:48:24.230
<v Speaker 2>And what I love about being a home for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me is I can control the music.</v>

3767
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:25.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to listen to shit music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

3768
02:48:25.890 --> 02:48:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to pay for the alcohol upon</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that I bought into,</v>

3769
02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:30.200
<v Speaker 2>like start off to upscale the payment of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alcohol.</v>

3770
02:48:30.570 --> 02:48:32.090
<v Speaker 2>I can watch any movie that I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

3771
02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I can bring in anyone that I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I'm in a boss scenario,</v>

3772
02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:37.580
<v Speaker 2>as I'm sure you've experienced over </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

3773
02:48:38.570 --> 02:48:43.570
<v Speaker 2>people feel like they can come up to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit and then you add alcohol </v>

3774
02:48:43.570 --> 02:48:43.610
<v Speaker 2>into that equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3775
02:48:43.611 --> 02:48:46.130
<v Speaker 2>I've had people in Bob's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I'm with my buds,</v>

3776
02:48:46.250 --> 02:48:48.470
<v Speaker 2>someone will come over with a shot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3777
02:48:48.530 --> 02:48:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Let's say a shot of Jack Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come over and be like,</v>

3778
02:48:50.811 --> 02:48:52.930
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll play on me.</v>

3779
02:48:53.140 --> 02:48:54.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3780
02:48:54.070 --> 02:48:55.210
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got your shop.</v>

3781
02:48:55.430 --> 02:48:55.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3784
02:48:58.191 --> 02:48:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3786

<v Speaker 2>I don't drink Jack Daniels.</v>

3787
02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:04.770
<v Speaker 2>If you want to give me a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tequila,</v>

3788
02:49:04.780 --> 02:49:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I'll drink that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>each other and you're a complete </v>

3796

<v Speaker 1>stranger.</v>

02:49:35.061 --> 02:49:40.061
<v Speaker 3>They think they know and so they also </v>
<v Speaker 3>think in some weird way that you owe </v>

<v Speaker 3>I was in Vegas once and I had a mouthful</v>

<v Speaker 3>of food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm cutting this steak and I'm putting </v>

<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to come over to your </v>

3814
02:50:05.531 --> 02:50:05.531
<v Speaker 3>group of fucking friends and put on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>clown hair,</v>

3815
02:50:05.531 --> 02:50:10.170
<v Speaker 3>give you jasmine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when I said I'm eating right </v>

3816
02:50:10.170 --> 02:50:10.170
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3817
02:50:10.170 --> 02:50:10.850
<v Speaker 3>when I'm leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I leave and I've run into you guys,</v>

3818
02:50:10.851 --> 02:50:12.350
<v Speaker 3>I'd be happy to say hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but right now I'm,</v>

3819
02:50:12.410 --> 02:50:17.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm eating dinner with some friends and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she looked at me like I was the biggest </v>

3820
02:50:17.410 --> 02:50:17.410
<v Speaker 3>piece of shit.</v>

3821
02:50:17.410 --> 02:50:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't mean to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

3822
02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:24.100
<v Speaker 3>but it's that same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've also had great experiences in </v>

3823
02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:27.050
<v Speaker 3>bars where I've run into great people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like when you put yourself in</v>

3824
02:50:27.051 --> 02:50:32.051
<v Speaker 3>those positions where you could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable sometimes those </v>

3825
02:50:32.051 --> 02:50:35.590
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable positions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have fantastic conversations with </v>

3826
02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:37.010
<v Speaker 3>some random dude who makes cabinets or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit like that or some,</v>

3827
02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:38.390
<v Speaker 3>some guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3828
02:50:38.460 --> 02:50:40.130
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm making my own vodka,</v>

3829
02:50:40.131 --> 02:50:40.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to try it.</v>

3830
02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:41.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3831
02:50:41.421 --> 02:50:46.421
<v Speaker 3>How'd you get into that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have these conversations </v>

3832
02:50:46.421 --> 02:50:46.421
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as the people are cool,</v>

3833
02:50:46.421 --> 02:50:48.830
<v Speaker 3>but it's like you can't get cleared off </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>

3834
02:50:48.860 --> 02:50:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes again with that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement.</v>

3835
02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:52.520
<v Speaker 3>I keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where I got that from,</v>

3836
02:50:52.521 --> 02:50:57.521
<v Speaker 3>but it pop it in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have anything to do with </v>

3837
02:50:57.521 --> 02:50:57.521
<v Speaker 3>homosexual studies in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and please don't hate to get angry.</v>

3838
02:50:57.590 --> 02:50:59.870
<v Speaker 3>It's more the exact definition of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>

3839
02:50:59.871 --> 02:51:04.871
<v Speaker 3>which means Kuli Kuli enough when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get people put you off like that,</v>

3840
02:51:05.121 --> 02:51:10.121
<v Speaker 3>you can get put off to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to be that guy so I </v>

3841
02:51:10.121 --> 02:51:12.720
<v Speaker 3>don't hide a go out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to bars and I will occasionally run</v>

3842
02:51:12.721 --> 02:51:15.890
<v Speaker 3>into drunk retards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part I feel like if you</v>

3843
02:51:15.891 --> 02:51:19.070
<v Speaker 3>put that out there that you're just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal person.</v>

3844
02:51:19.071 --> 02:51:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Just how you might know who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm fucking.</v>

3845
02:51:21.950 --> 02:51:26.950
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God I'm normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time you run into people </v>

3846
02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:30.161
<v Speaker 3>kind of accept that vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you were talking about the Cobra </v>

3847
02:51:30.161 --> 02:51:32.000
<v Speaker 3>kind of recognizing exactly what you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>and figuring it out after awhile.</v>

3848
02:51:32.390 --> 02:51:35.510
<v Speaker 3>If you put out that vibe like you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be fucked with or you know,</v>

3849
02:51:35.511 --> 02:51:38.270
<v Speaker 3>everybody's annoying to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then people find you and,</v>

3850
02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:39.140
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3851
02:51:39.330 --> 02:51:40.000
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3852
02:51:40.020 --> 02:51:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3853
02:51:40.920 --> 02:51:45.920
<v Speaker 1>for me it's just the Boston area walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>around on the streets and stuff and not </v>

3854
02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:49.370
<v Speaker 1>90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say 90 percent of the </v>

3855
02:51:49.370 --> 02:51:51.321
<v Speaker 1>interactions that they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even 95 percent of the </v>

3856
02:51:51.321 --> 02:51:52.050
<v Speaker 1>interactions that I have a positive in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bar because it adds alcohol,</v>

3857
02:51:52.100 --> 02:51:53.940
<v Speaker 1>that a completely different scenario and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3858
02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't come into bonds with my,</v>

3859
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:58.110
<v Speaker 1>with my backup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually having fun with my friends.</v>

3860
02:51:58.530 --> 02:52:03.530
<v Speaker 1>One of the phrases that I use a lot in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of animals and humans is comment </v>

3861
02:52:03.530 --> 02:52:08.271
<v Speaker 1>me correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to come at me correctly if </v>

3862
02:52:08.271 --> 02:52:08.271
<v Speaker 1>you're coming</v>

3863
02:52:08.271 --> 02:52:08.271
<v Speaker 2>at me aggressively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3864
02:52:08.271 --> 02:52:09.370
<v Speaker 2>I bought your Tequila.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's go dude.</v>

3865
02:52:09.660 --> 02:52:12.040
<v Speaker 2>And it'd be like to go away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to run into that.</v>

3866
02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:17.080
<v Speaker 2>I just happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You must get insulated because you know </v>

3867
02:52:17.080 --> 02:52:19.680
<v Speaker 2>you're associated with cage fighting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a big deal sometimes the opposite</v>

3868
02:52:20.050 --> 02:52:20.890
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

3869
02:52:20.891 --> 02:52:24.220
<v Speaker 2>people want to fuck with me or people </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to talk to me weird or the,</v>

3870
02:52:24.221 --> 02:52:26.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to hold onto me.</v>

3871
02:52:26.151 --> 02:52:29.500
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to feel my body around </v>
<v Speaker 2>my neck that grabbed my shoulder.</v>

3872
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:31.360
<v Speaker 2>If you're a big dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a big dude.</v>

3873
02:52:31.361 --> 02:52:36.361
<v Speaker 2>People get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just a certain amount of weird </v>

3874
02:52:36.361 --> 02:52:39.241
<v Speaker 2>people you're going to run into and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably don't even know why they're </v>

3875
02:52:39.241 --> 02:52:39.241
<v Speaker 2>acting the way they're acting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they do,</v>

3876
02:52:39.241 --> 02:52:40.890
<v Speaker 2>they're probably feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>

3877
02:52:42.460 --> 02:52:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3878
02:52:43.481 --> 02:52:44.830
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like an out of body </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

3879
02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Floopy around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie shrink my boobs.</v>

3880
02:52:50.270 --> 02:52:51.370
<v Speaker 2>And they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

3881
02:52:51.970 --> 02:52:54.340
<v Speaker 2>they would do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say they met there and randomly.</v>

3882
02:52:54.341 --> 02:52:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh their uncle randomly on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would do stuff that would,</v>

3883
02:52:56.680 --> 02:53:01.540
<v Speaker 2>they would never do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had people scream and the Annapolis</v>

3884
02:53:01.540 --> 02:53:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Shit fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would never do that.</v>

3885
02:53:04.541 --> 02:53:07.900
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like you'd go over and say hello</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>

3886
02:53:07.901 --> 02:53:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

3887
02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:11.290
<v Speaker 2>But you find that with fires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

3888
02:53:11.291 --> 02:53:16.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many fires you know </v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3891
02:53:17.651 --> 02:53:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them get fucked with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous,</v>

3892
02:53:19.811 --> 02:53:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just some people are just drunk and they</v>

3893
02:53:22.631 --> 02:53:27.631
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like the idea that they feel </v>

3894
02:53:27.631 --> 02:53:30.331
<v Speaker 2>intimidated by this guy being around </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and they want to like put that guy </v>

3895
02:53:30.331 --> 02:53:30.331
<v Speaker 2>in his place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3896
02:53:30.331 --> 02:53:34.791
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's also people that are just </v>

3897
02:53:34.791 --> 02:53:34.791
<v Speaker 2>completely delusional.</v>

3898
02:53:34.791 --> 02:53:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Like I've run into so many guys who want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell me how if they fought in the </v>

3899
02:53:38.430 --> 02:53:38.720
<v Speaker 2>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would kill everybody.</v>

3900
02:53:38.721 --> 02:53:43.721
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they can't do it right now because </v>

3901
02:53:43.721 --> 02:53:44.950
<v Speaker 2>they're busy with some other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could take so many fucking people tell</v>

3902
02:53:44.951 --> 02:53:46.720
<v Speaker 2>me that bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mentality,</v>

3903
02:53:46.721 --> 02:53:46.990
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3904
02:53:47.010 --> 02:53:48.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all have the same thing.</v>

3905
02:53:48.371 --> 02:53:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't quit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd have to kill me.</v>

3906
02:53:51.300 --> 02:53:54.940
<v Speaker 2>And you're not gonna you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's so many dummies out there.</v>

3907
02:53:55.210 --> 02:54:00.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just there's a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people out there that have nine volt </v>

3908
02:54:00.210 --> 02:54:00.320
<v Speaker 2>brains and there's not a goddamn thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

3909
02:54:00.330 --> 02:54:01.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in the books.</v>

3910
02:54:01.301 --> 02:54:03.490
<v Speaker 2>They can read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not enough life experiences.</v>

3911
02:54:03.491 --> 02:54:05.160
<v Speaker 2>They just have shit genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3912
02:54:05.350 --> 02:54:06.130
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3913
02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:07.540
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>

3914
02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:12.750
<v Speaker 2>We've been taught that everyone is born </v>
<v Speaker 2>on an even playing field and it's about </v>

3915
02:54:12.750 --> 02:54:16.891
<v Speaker 2>you to find yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know there's some people that are ditch </v>

3916
02:54:16.891 --> 02:54:17.860
<v Speaker 2>diggers and there's not a goddamn thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do about it and it sucks.</v>

3917
02:54:18.130 --> 02:54:20.440
<v Speaker 2>It sucks if you're one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Survival of the fittest.</v>

3918
02:54:20.790 --> 02:54:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes ditch diggers have smart kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes they don't know.</v>

3919
02:54:25.150 --> 02:54:27.580
<v Speaker 2>My best friend who's a smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a firefighter in Manchester.</v>

3920
02:54:27.581 --> 02:54:32.581
<v Speaker 2>He and I went backwards and forwards for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time on the fact that he thought </v>

3921
02:54:32.581 --> 02:54:36.420
<v Speaker 2>that he could take Rhonda Rousey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She will break both big.</v>

3922
02:54:36.490 --> 02:54:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Is He?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3923
02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:37.950
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo.</v>

3924
02:54:37.951 --> 02:54:42.951
<v Speaker 2>Size because he know how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a tough guy at school and like </v>

3925
02:54:42.951 --> 02:54:44.080
<v Speaker 2>those dickheads that you see in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

3926
02:54:44.110 --> 02:54:44.560
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3927
02:54:44.561 --> 02:54:46.670
<v Speaker 2>but I'm gonna let gill punched me in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>face and it's old.</v>

3928
02:54:46.671 --> 02:54:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3929
02:54:47.081 --> 02:54:48.490
<v Speaker 2>run around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to punch you in the face.</v>

3930
02:54:48.491 --> 02:54:53.491
<v Speaker 2>She's going to put you in a choke hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>or she's going to put you into </v>

3931
02:54:53.491 --> 02:54:53.560
<v Speaker 2>submission where she breaks both in </v>
<v Speaker 2>rounds and then she stands on her face.</v>

3932
02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:56.710
<v Speaker 2>She can tap grown men who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional fighters.</v>

3933
02:54:56.711 --> 02:54:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3934
02:54:58.000 --> 02:54:59.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just eat,</v>

3935
02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:04.480
<v Speaker 2>you just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a level of talent and ability </v>

3936
02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:08.170
<v Speaker 2>that some people have that it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>supersedes the sexual.</v>

3937
02:55:08.990 --> 02:55:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3938
02:55:10.050 --> 02:55:11.570
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideas that we have,</v>

3939
02:55:11.571 --> 02:55:13.220
<v Speaker 2>the classifications of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3940
02:55:13.221 --> 02:55:15.800
<v Speaker 2>man can't beat up a woman or a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't be the man rather.</v>

3941
02:55:16.010 --> 02:55:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know they can.</v>

3942
02:55:17.270 --> 02:55:19.460
<v Speaker 2>There's just as other girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cris Cyborg.</v>

3943
02:55:19.490 --> 02:55:21.280
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd beat the fuck out of most man,</v>

3944
02:55:21.340 --> 02:55:21.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3945
02:55:21.961 --> 02:55:23.990
<v Speaker 2>and do it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very manly way.</v>

3946
02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:26.740
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Rousey's technique is so strong that</v>

3947
02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:31.760
<v Speaker 2>you can't fuck her judo spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And her arm bars are amongst the best </v>

3948
02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:33.110
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen in any weight class with </v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

3949
02:55:33.111 --> 02:55:34.040
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

3950
02:55:34.290 --> 02:55:35.270
<v Speaker 2>She has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's phenomenal.</v>

3951
02:55:35.340 --> 02:55:40.340
<v Speaker 2>One of the scariest dudes for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's been injured for a little </v>

3952
02:55:40.340 --> 02:55:40.340
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw him.</v>

3953
02:55:40.340 --> 02:55:41.480
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come and tell you on this fight,</v>

3954
02:55:41.481 --> 02:55:45.710
<v Speaker 2>and it was truly terrifying to watch was</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rory Macdonald.</v>

3955
02:55:46.220 --> 02:55:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rory.</v>

3956
02:55:47.270 --> 02:55:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Rory Macdonald owned some English guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he broke his cheek and broke his </v>

3957
02:55:52.270 --> 02:55:54.070
<v Speaker 2>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mills.</v>

3958
02:55:54.250 --> 02:55:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched it,</v>

3959
02:55:55.910 --> 02:56:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe what I was saying and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rewound it and the reason why he went </v>

3960
02:56:00.910 --> 02:56:03.230
<v Speaker 2>off like that is he got cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman Donald got caught by something and</v>

3961
02:56:03.231 --> 02:56:04.040
<v Speaker 2>you said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>

3962
02:56:04.100 --> 02:56:04.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got caught.</v>

3963
02:56:05.530 --> 02:56:07.150
<v Speaker 2>He got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tied the guy out,</v>

3964
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:12.190
<v Speaker 2>put it on the floor and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this nonsense and destroyed his </v>

3965
02:56:12.190 --> 02:56:14.350
<v Speaker 2>face and he's got like a terminator vibe</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on with man.</v>

3966
02:56:14.510 --> 02:56:15.800
<v Speaker 2>He's just like calling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows.</v>

3967
02:56:15.801 --> 02:56:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes dead.</v>

3968
02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:19.340
<v Speaker 2>You're dead because you want to judge </v>
<v Speaker 2>CNPS boys.</v>

3969
02:56:19.430 --> 02:56:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3970
02:56:20.211 --> 02:56:22.610
<v Speaker 2>he's trained on there for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hobby and Montreal.</v>

3971
02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:24.020
<v Speaker 2>He was phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

3972
02:56:24.020 --> 02:56:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Is he injured?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

3973
02:56:24.850 --> 02:56:26.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting for the title.</v>

3974
02:56:26.580 --> 02:56:28.550
<v Speaker 2>July 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Fan in Vegas.</v>

3975
02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Woohoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the undercard of the Joseph </v>

3976
02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Connor Mcgregor fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting Robbie lawler.</v>

3977
02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Who's the champion right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wild fight and good luck to him </v>

3978
02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:39.400
<v Speaker 2>and it's great fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about jsps?</v>

3979
02:56:39.430 --> 02:56:41.640
<v Speaker 2>He done hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3980
02:56:42.250 --> 02:56:47.250
<v Speaker 2>you know me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a different stance and the rest </v>

3981
02:56:47.250 --> 02:56:50.081
<v Speaker 2>of the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they'd want them to come back </v>

3982
02:56:50.081 --> 02:56:50.081
<v Speaker 2>because he's worth a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's had enough,</v>

3983
02:56:50.081 --> 02:56:52.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's in his thirties and he took</v>

3984
02:56:52.701 --> 02:56:57.701
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous amount of punishment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his career and did the greatest thing </v>

3985
02:56:57.701 --> 02:56:57.710
<v Speaker 2>you could ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won the title,</v>

3986
02:56:57.711 --> 02:57:00.950
<v Speaker 2>defended it a bunch of times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

3987
02:57:00.970 --> 02:57:05.970
<v Speaker 2>is the greatest welterweight and history</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not going to get any better </v>

3988
02:57:05.970 --> 02:57:05.970
<v Speaker 2>from here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3989
02:57:05.970 --> 02:57:09.170
<v Speaker 2>he's taken over 800 shots to the head in</v>
<v Speaker 2>competition in the UFC.</v>

3990
02:57:09.650 --> 02:57:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 880 something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>counted as one and that's just in </v>

3991
02:57:14.650 --> 02:57:15.470
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just in fighting,</v>

3992
02:57:15.471 --> 02:57:16.350
<v Speaker 2>not training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3993
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:21.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the saddest things I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen in UFC is when you spoke to I </v>

3994
02:57:22.511 --> 02:57:25.840
<v Speaker 2>think after his fight and he was like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little rattled and he was like,</v>

3995
02:57:25.850 --> 02:57:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take a break for a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

3996
02:57:27.291 --> 02:57:28.460
<v Speaker 2>And you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you retiring?</v>

3997
02:57:28.461 --> 02:57:29.360
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3998
02:57:29.361 --> 02:57:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I need to step back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at this guy that was caught</v>

3999
02:57:33.380 --> 02:57:37.040
<v Speaker 2>like a Greek God and I thought he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to cry right there,</v>

4000
02:57:37.041 --> 02:57:40.820
<v Speaker 2>like he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the pressure on him to come back,</v>

4001
02:57:40.821 --> 02:57:45.821
<v Speaker 2>I think he's really unfair because like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most precious thing for him to hang </v>

4002
02:57:46.041 --> 02:57:47.910
<v Speaker 2>onto now is his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

4003
02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:49.880
<v Speaker 2>he was just about to lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4004
02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:51.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's had some memory issues.</v>

4005
02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:52.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

4006
02:57:52.430 --> 02:57:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I had him on the podcast he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about he didn't know whether or not he's</v>

4007
02:57:56.241 --> 02:58:01.241
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had been abducted by aliens because </v>

4008
02:58:01.241 --> 02:58:02.040
<v Speaker 2>he would have these moments in his life </v>
<v Speaker 2>where all of a sudden</v>

4009
02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:04.350
<v Speaker 3>he was at home and he didn't know how he</v>
<v Speaker 3>got there.</v>

4010
02:58:04.410 --> 02:58:05.250
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

4011
02:58:05.550 --> 02:58:07.830
<v Speaker 3>that's not aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these are,</v>

4012
02:58:07.860 --> 02:58:11.430
<v Speaker 3>these are probably issues that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>developing from trauma.</v>

4013
02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:16.080
<v Speaker 3>But in his mind there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost alien.</v>

4014
02:58:16.081 --> 02:58:20.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know that when you start talking</v>

4015
02:58:20.521 --> 02:58:22.440
<v Speaker 3>like that and you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4016
02:58:22.441 --> 02:58:27.441
<v Speaker 3>it's not like he's talking like that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has no history whatsoever of being </v>

4017
02:58:27.441 --> 02:58:29.700
<v Speaker 3>hit and no history whatsoever of any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of brain injury.</v>

4018
02:58:30.290 --> 02:58:35.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a guy who's just </v>

4019
02:58:35.290 --> 02:58:35.290
<v Speaker 3>fucking job is to break people's brains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4020
02:58:35.290 --> 02:58:39.850
<v Speaker 3>and he's training with other trained </v>
<v Speaker 3>killers and they're hitting each other </v>

4021
02:58:39.850 --> 02:58:40.080
<v Speaker 3>on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

4022
02:58:40.110 --> 02:58:45.110
<v Speaker 3>there's a point of no return,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no return in fighting and you got to </v>

4023
02:58:45.110 --> 02:58:46.710
<v Speaker 3>realize where that point is and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very hard for fighters to recognize that</v>

4024
02:58:46.711 --> 02:58:49.020
<v Speaker 3>they need someone to help them and talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>to them about it.</v>

4025
02:58:49.021 --> 02:58:54.021
<v Speaker 3>But George is one of the rare few that </v>
<v Speaker 3>did it on his own terms while he was on </v>

4026
02:58:54.121 --> 02:58:57.780
<v Speaker 3>top as a champion retired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I applaud him for that.</v>

4027
02:58:57.781 --> 02:58:58.590
<v Speaker 3>I think he's amazing.</v>

4028
02:58:58.620 --> 02:59:03.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he's fantastic and he seems to </v>

4029
02:59:03.620 --> 02:59:05.361
<v Speaker 5>have come from a foundation of supple </v>
<v Speaker 5>and obviously it doesn't come from this </v>

4030
02:59:05.361 --> 02:59:07.170
<v Speaker 5>country and it feels like he has a nice </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of backbone.</v>

4031
02:59:07.171 --> 02:59:07.410
<v Speaker 5>But yes,</v>

4032
02:59:07.430 --> 02:59:09.310
<v Speaker 3>plenty of money to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made a lot.</v>

4033
02:59:09.311 --> 02:59:12.100
<v Speaker 3>I made millions and millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made more money than anybody,</v>

4034
02:59:12.101 --> 02:59:13.930
<v Speaker 3>so hopefully he'll be fine.</v>

4035
02:59:14.010 --> 02:59:19.010
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that happens in the </v>

4036
02:59:19.010 --> 02:59:21.470
<v Speaker 5>football community in the soccer </v>
<v Speaker 5>community in England is that these very </v>

4037
02:59:21.470 --> 02:59:26.061
<v Speaker 5>talented,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very elite sports stars that have no </v>

4038
02:59:26.061 --> 02:59:28.590
<v Speaker 5>idea how to do their own washing or do </v>
<v Speaker 5>their own groceries or write a check,</v>

4039
02:59:29.010 --> 02:59:34.010
<v Speaker 5>get taken care of for probably 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 5>and get spout the other side when </v>

4040
02:59:34.010 --> 02:59:38.601
<v Speaker 5>they're 35,</v>
<v Speaker 5>huge amount of depression in retired </v>

4041
02:59:38.601 --> 02:59:42.111
<v Speaker 5>football players because they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now they're in the scrappy at 35 and </v>

4042
02:59:42.111 --> 02:59:46.011
<v Speaker 5>they look around and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have this incredible talent which is </v>

4043
02:59:46.011 --> 02:59:48.951
<v Speaker 5>now no longer needed and I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>functioning society in a way that most </v>

4044
02:59:49.501 --> 02:59:51.780
<v Speaker 5>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're in no man's land and node.</v>

4045
02:59:51.840 --> 02:59:52.830
<v Speaker 5>Do you find that with.</v>

4046
02:59:53.390 --> 02:59:58.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even worse because they're brain </v>

4047
02:59:58.390 --> 02:59:58.390
<v Speaker 3>damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them.</v>

4048
02:59:58.390 --> 03:00:02.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a certain amount of brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>damage almost every fighter has by the </v>

4049
03:00:02.010 --> 03:00:02.560
<v Speaker 3>time they reach 35.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4050
03:00:02.561 --> 03:00:07.561
<v Speaker 3>I mean we get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we experienced that with all sorts of </v>

4051
03:00:07.561 --> 03:00:07.561
<v Speaker 3>athletes in America with its football </v>
<v Speaker 3>players,</v>

4052
03:00:07.561 --> 03:00:09.950
<v Speaker 3>basketball players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy thing because most people,</v>

4053
03:00:10.160 --> 03:00:12.380
<v Speaker 3>they have the highest earning potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're older.</v>

4054
03:00:12.530 --> 03:00:13.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they get older,</v>

4055
03:00:13.521 --> 03:00:18.521
<v Speaker 3>they make more and more money to become </v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more successful and then they </v>

4056
03:00:18.521 --> 03:00:21.221
<v Speaker 3>retire with athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the make the bulk of your money </v>

4057
03:00:21.221 --> 03:00:24.221
<v Speaker 3>when you're young and wild and </v>
<v Speaker 3>irresponsible and impulsive and then </v>

4058
03:00:24.221 --> 03:00:25.970
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to try to hold on to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that gold dust as you get older.</v>

4059
03:00:26.210 --> 03:00:28.700
<v Speaker 3>I think we're at a new show on HBO is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>

4060
03:00:28.720 --> 03:00:29.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
