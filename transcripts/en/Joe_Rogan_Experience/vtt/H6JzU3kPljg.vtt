<v Speaker 1>This is what she told you.</v>

115
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.563
<v Speaker 1>This is what you told me.</v>

116
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 1>And then she told you,</v>

117
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Greg,</v>

118
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my period.</v>

119
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm miserable.</v>

120
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>And I was so upset.</v>

121
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.641
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

122
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:29.061
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

123
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:30.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he did that.</v>

124
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

125
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:31.604
<v Speaker 1>she was hot,</v>

126
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.833
<v Speaker 1>and you're living with her.</v>

128
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I get all that.</v>

129
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.671
<v Speaker 1>I get all that,</v>

130
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't believe that you said something to her like bad about me,</v>

131
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>because in my eyes,</v>

133
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very loyal person and when someone's my friend,</v>

134
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>they're my friend and I would never go to a friend's girl.</v>

135
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:47.810
<v Speaker 1>But it was a very complicated situation.</v>

136
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:48.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

137
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>it's not healthy for a heterosexual guy to be living with a hot girl in con</v>

138
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Ted it at a,</v>

139
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.803
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

140
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I go on this Gig and the Gig was terrible.</v>

141
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking awful gig.</v>

142
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>And it was a long drive and I did not have a good set.</v>

143
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And I was coming back and I was with her and you know,</v>

144
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>she had just told me this thing that you had did and that was so fucking mad.</v>

145
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>

146
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I was so fucking Matt.</v>

147
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>And we went and got ice cream and um,</v>

148
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>I went to the bathroom and I came back and I opened my ice cream and Jennifer</v>

149
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>was eating hers and my ice cream bar had a bite taken out of it,</v>

150
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Ben and Jerry's piece pop.</v>

151
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.013
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

152
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Greg had taken a bite out of it.</v>

153
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.970
<v Speaker 1>And so that I've flipped a switch and I threw the ice cream at your face and</v>

154
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.813
<v Speaker 1>about a hundred.</v>

155
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

156
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

157
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I said.</v>

158
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what I said,</v>

159
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>but I remember I went into,</v>

160
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I want it to danger zone.</v>

161
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

162
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 2>well I wanted to bring it up cause we never talked about it.</v>

163
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.581
<v Speaker 2>We never did.</v>

164
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:50.240
<v Speaker 2>And I want to,</v>

165
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.410
<v Speaker 2>because obviously look,</v>

166
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.280
<v Speaker 2>there's always two sides if of course three sides in this case.</v>

167
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.960
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

168
00:03:56.961 --> 00:03:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I think number one,</v>

169
00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:01.550
<v Speaker 2>I was a brash fucking wise ass pervert,</v>

170
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:03.290
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of energy back then.</v>

172
00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:06.650
<v Speaker 2>And so first point I would say is that with Jennifer,</v>

173
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.420
<v Speaker 2>if I said I can't believe have living with her,</v>

174
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it was probably more of a comic premise than like a real attraction on</v>

175
00:04:12.381 --> 00:04:13.214
<v Speaker 2>any level.</v>

176
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.791
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like,</v>

177
00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:14.031
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

178
00:04:14.031 --> 00:04:18.440
<v Speaker 2>she was hot but I wouldn't be moving in with a chick to try to get laid with</v>

179
00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:19.130
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

180
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Probably more of like,</v>

181
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

182
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.983
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying,</v>

183
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a residual feeling with you that like I had said that and it was</v>

184
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe on your mind that I'm living with her and you know,</v>

185
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 2>that's a little bit fucking,</v>

186
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty open minded dude.</v>

187
00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:33.020
<v Speaker 1>She was living with another guy,</v>

188
00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:36.290
<v Speaker 1>the gay guy and I would go while he was gagged,</v>

189
00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:37.020
<v Speaker 1>don't give it up.</v>

190
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Don't get the same damn it.</v>

191
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.041
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

192
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:41.060
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing is if I,</v>

193
00:04:41.061 --> 00:04:41.750
<v Speaker 2>and if I,</v>

194
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.460
<v Speaker 2>it's possible I might have said that thing about,</v>

195
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.631
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

196
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 2>let me just say my side of it.</v>

197
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.630
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>

198
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

199
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.250
<v Speaker 2>I might've said something about you,</v>

200
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.600
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

202
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.830
<v Speaker 2>I was a fucking loud mouth.</v>

203
00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I sat and talked a lot of shit.</v>

204
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.981
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

205
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:54.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

206
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.951
<v Speaker 2>in my heart,</v>

207
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:56.000
<v Speaker 2>you and I were good friends.</v>

208
00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:58.130
<v Speaker 2>We had come up and done a lot of shit together,</v>

209
00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:58.970
<v Speaker 2>gone through a lot,</v>

210
00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 2>support each other a lot.</v>

211
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.750
<v Speaker 2>And I think if I'd said something a,</v>

212
00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:03.650
<v Speaker 2>it's again,</v>

213
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 2>I have no fucking idea.</v>

214
00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

215
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.281
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

216
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>it's so long ago,</v>

217
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>the memories aren't real anyway.</v>

218
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.180
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

219
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.013
<v Speaker 2>but it could,</v>

220
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.340
<v Speaker 2>that's why I brought it up in this,</v>

221
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:12.121
<v Speaker 2>in this arena,</v>

222
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:13.050
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like,</v>

223
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's humor in it,</v>

224
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:16.500
<v Speaker 2>but I think that there's a real moment in it where,</v>

225
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:16.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:17.521
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

227
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I think it fucked me up too,</v>

228
00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:21.630
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>

229
00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:24.300
<v Speaker 2>seeing you get that angry was like,</v>

230
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

231
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.920
<v Speaker 2>scary shit.</v>

232
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.491
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

233
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

234
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.800
<v Speaker 2>the irony of you hitting me with the Ben and Jerry's piece pop,</v>

235
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.660
<v Speaker 2>it was also not completely lost on me</v>

236
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

237
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.210
<v Speaker 2>and I felt like,</v>

238
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:36.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

239
00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:39.930
<v Speaker 2>and sadly that was right at a time when you were moving to New York.</v>

240
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.750
<v Speaker 2>He started going down and work in danger fields and all that shit.</v>

241
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.480
<v Speaker 2>So it became kind of convenient debt.</v>

242
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.220
<v Speaker 2>We just didn't see each other as much.</v>

243
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:50.970
<v Speaker 2>We would fucking write together every day we drive to gigs and then all of a</v>

244
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:53.430
<v Speaker 2>sudden this kind of blowout happened and uh,</v>

245
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:54.780
<v Speaker 2>and you just happen to be moving.</v>

246
00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 2>And so we spent a few years of just being in each other's spheres at all.</v>

247
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 2>And then it was water under the bridge and we started to,</v>

248
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

249
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 2>hang out and all that stuff.</v>

250
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 2>But I was wanting to talk to you about it because I felt like whatever your</v>

251
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 2>takeaway was from that experience,</v>

252
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:09.981
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

253
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:10.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:10.690
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

255
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.990
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

256
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 2>if I did say something,</v>

257
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't from my heart and that I think it was a loaded situation.</v>

258
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.040
<v Speaker 1>It was a loaded situation.</v>

259
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>And there was a few other things that,</v>

260
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.650
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

261
00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:24.130
<v Speaker 1>if you are the things that we're leaning into that confrontation that,</v>

262
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:06:24.611 --> 00:06:26.230
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't anything bad that you did,</v>

264
00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of an attitude that you had taken with me.</v>

265
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

266
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.921
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

267
00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:30.490
<v Speaker 1>There was a bit,</v>

268
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.600
<v Speaker 1>there was a resentment thing.</v>

269
00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty,</v>

270
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.111
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

271
00:06:32.111 --> 00:06:33.190
<v Speaker 1>pretty sensitive to it.</v>

272
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Well thinking a lot of it had to do with living with a girl.</v>

273
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>

274
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.190
<v Speaker 2>part of it too was you and I grew in different directions as comics.</v>

275
00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:39.400
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

276
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.780
<v Speaker 2>you were going hardcore,</v>

277
00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:45.160
<v Speaker 2>you were hanging out with the another Michael and you were real Kinison guy.</v>

278
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.490
<v Speaker 2>And I was starting to move a little bit more towards not necessarily clever</v>

279
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.110
<v Speaker 2>through a,</v>

280
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

281
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Clean and clever stage.</v>

282
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.260
<v Speaker 2>And you gave me a really hard time about it.</v>

283
00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:59.470
<v Speaker 2>You could call me a pussy and you've got to fucking be real up there.</v>

284
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 2>And it was intimidating because it was like,</v>

285
00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:03.580
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not worried you telling me how to do my act,</v>

286
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.800
<v Speaker 2>but you will get really dark</v>

287
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 1>histamine cause I love you.</v>

288
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.540
<v Speaker 1>I just went,</v>

289
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.790
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to see you back off.</v>

290
00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:10.710
<v Speaker 1>You were you when you were at your best,</v>

291
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Greg Fitzsimmons would have these sets and uh,</v>

292
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.551
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>

293
00:07:14.551 --> 00:07:14.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

294
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.400
<v Speaker 1>you would have a bunch of really well crafted jokes,</v>

295
00:07:17.401 --> 00:07:20.970
<v Speaker 1>you had a bunch of good things and you have one thing where you just went over</v>

296
00:07:20.971 --> 00:07:22.740
<v Speaker 1>the fucking edge completely.</v>

297
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And the comics would be howling.</v>

298
00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:25.621
<v Speaker 1>And I always knew,</v>

299
00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

300
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.980
<v Speaker 1>if he can harness that and if he can figure out how to do,</v>

301
00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have a sick fucking sense of humor.</v>

302
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.150
<v Speaker 1>So when I would see you pull back,</v>

303
00:07:33.151 --> 00:07:35.550
<v Speaker 1>like to do a Letterman said or pull back to do like any of this stuff,</v>

304
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

305
00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:39.540
<v Speaker 1>the only reason that exists is because there's someone trying to sell Toyota</v>

306
00:07:39.541 --> 00:07:40.770
<v Speaker 1>trucks or tie.</v>

307
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.170
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why censored TV exists.</v>

308
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.980
<v Speaker 1>So this idea that it became clean and clever and like what is clever about</v>

309
00:07:46.981 --> 00:07:51.981
<v Speaker 1>cutting out the most fun aspects of life and homogenizing it for so that four</v>

310
00:07:52.231 --> 00:07:54.450
<v Speaker 1>year olds can watch it really is that,</v>

311
00:07:54.451 --> 00:07:55.141
<v Speaker 1>what's clever?</v>

312
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.250
<v Speaker 1>That's clever.</v>

313
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.840
<v Speaker 1>That's not real comedy.</v>

314
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.180
<v Speaker 2>And in my head back then I was watching you and saying,</v>

315
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.901
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

316
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:06.250
<v Speaker 2>you're just going up there and you're just fucking throwing shit and common</v>

317
00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:11.050
<v Speaker 2>their faces and your healing and your fucking prancing the stage in a stock and</v>

318
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:12.580
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking get your hand over the month.</v>

319
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.421
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

320
00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:13.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

321
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:14.500
<v Speaker 2>he's killing it.</v>

322
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:18.240
<v Speaker 2>But like that's like I was coming out of college as an English major and I want</v>

323
00:08:18.241 --> 00:08:18.900
<v Speaker 2>it to write on,</v>

324
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I've gone into writing.</v>

325
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.870
<v Speaker 2>So to me it was just a different choice.</v>

326
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.240
<v Speaker 2>And it was one that you didn't respect.</v>

327
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:25.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

328
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:26.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not that.</v>

329
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:26.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

330
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.521
<v Speaker 1>you just said it.</v>

331
00:08:27.521 --> 00:08:28.354
<v Speaker 1>You didn't really,</v>

332
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I didn't respect the writing.</v>

333
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I didn't respect that.</v>

334
00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:33.341
<v Speaker 1>The discipline of it.</v>

335
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:33.761
<v Speaker 1>I know it's,</v>

336
00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:34.750
<v Speaker 1>it's more difficult.</v>

337
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:35.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a more difficult path.</v>

338
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.360
<v Speaker 1>It was that with you,</v>

339
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I always knew you had a sick fucking sense of humor,</v>

340
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.840
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>

341
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:40.901
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

342
00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:42.180
<v Speaker 1>it's like going back to Tom O'connor.</v>

343
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't pull,</v>

344
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.170
<v Speaker 1>don't pull away from that.</v>

345
00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:44.801
<v Speaker 1>Are you crazy?</v>

346
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:45.850
<v Speaker 1>That's like what makes you unique.</v>

347
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes us Howell in the back of the room.</v>

348
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.250
<v Speaker 1>We're not laughing cause we'd like you and it's not funny.</v>

349
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like you would say some really dark fucked up shit and they need bill.</v>

350
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I can never that bit.</v>

351
00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:56.434
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

352
00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.270
<v Speaker 3>but they won't use me now.</v>

353
00:08:59.271 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 3>But Boston comedy won't book me on the road because of that bit.</v>

354
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:02.210
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

355
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

356
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

357
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I think that there was a part of me that,</v>

358
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it in baseball terms,</v>

359
00:09:07.061 --> 00:09:10.930
<v Speaker 2>you are always the guy that was the grand slam swinger and I was the guy that</v>

360
00:09:10.931 --> 00:09:15.460
<v Speaker 2>just wanted to get a lot of doubles and singles and so in a sense I think</v>

361
00:09:15.461 --> 00:09:15.941
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

362
00:09:15.941 --> 00:09:16.810
<v Speaker 2>my father used to say,</v>

363
00:09:16.811 --> 00:09:19.630
<v Speaker 2>everybody ends up where they're really comfortable,</v>

364
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.290
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

365
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.430
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense for you,</v>

366
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.220
<v Speaker 2>like you talked about going on stage when you didn't have the material,</v>

367
00:09:24.221 --> 00:09:26.230
<v Speaker 2>but doing an hour like balls out.</v>

368
00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking dude.</v>

369
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.001
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't me.</v>

370
00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:29.710
<v Speaker 2>That would've been my worst fucking nightmare.</v>

371
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.101
<v Speaker 2>To me.</v>

372
00:09:30.101 --> 00:09:32.500
<v Speaker 2>It was like I wanted to make a living doing this.</v>

373
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to write,</v>

374
00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I want it to go on Letterman.</v>

375
00:09:35.081 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 2>There was like things I wanted that,</v>

376
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:38.080
<v Speaker 2>that we're in this strategy.</v>

377
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Not that I like thought about it,</v>

378
00:09:39.401 --> 00:09:40.870
<v Speaker 2>but it was just naturally where I was going.</v>

379
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

380
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.740
<v Speaker 2>And for you it was like you want it to fucking explode,</v>

381
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:09:45.071 --> 00:09:46.450
<v Speaker 2>you want it to be Kinison.</v>

383
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.540
<v Speaker 2>And that was just a different fucking strategy,</v>

384
00:09:49.541 --> 00:09:51.280
<v Speaker 2>different game plan than I had.</v>

385
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.440
<v Speaker 2>And I think that was a big part of it too.</v>

386
00:09:53.441 --> 00:09:55.870
<v Speaker 2>That was a lot of the tension underneath the fight that happened.</v>

387
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

388
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:56.681
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

389
00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:57.580
<v Speaker 2>I really resent that.</v>

390
00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:58.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

391
00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:58.331
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

392
00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:58.751
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

393
00:09:58.751 --> 00:10:03.751
<v Speaker 2>I resented that I was feeling like you were not approving of what I was doing</v>

394
00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:05.080
<v Speaker 2>and you're putting pressure on me not to.</v>

395
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.500
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious because a,</v>

396
00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt like that it was always the opposite with people,</v>

397
00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:10.280
<v Speaker 1>that the people that we're dirty,</v>

398
00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:10.521
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

399
00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:11.960
<v Speaker 1>especially back then in Boston,</v>

400
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.160
<v Speaker 1>they were the ones who were pressured,</v>

401
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.120
<v Speaker 1>pressured to clean it up.</v>

402
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

403
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.343
<v Speaker 1>Oliver Keithley,</v>

404
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.021
<v Speaker 1>that's all he ever,</v>

405
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:16.731
<v Speaker 1>he used to tell me,</v>

406
00:10:16.731 --> 00:10:17.480
<v Speaker 1>you got to clean it up.</v>

407
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.171
<v Speaker 1>You got to clean that up.</v>

408
00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:20.030
<v Speaker 1>You said 10 fox and T in 10 minutes.</v>

409
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

410
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.130
<v Speaker 1>To clean it up.</v>

411
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

412
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.250
<v Speaker 1>It was always like,</v>

413
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.760
<v Speaker 1>oh like I'm taking some sort of a shortcut by doing things and I'm actually</v>

414
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:26.810
<v Speaker 1>interested in talking about,</v>

415
00:10:26.811 --> 00:10:28.850
<v Speaker 1>so you saying that I think that uh,</v>

416
00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:30.590
<v Speaker 1>that I looked down on you for,</v>

417
00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:33.560
<v Speaker 1>for cleaning your act up or trying to go the professional route.</v>

418
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.551
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that,</v>

419
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:38.570
<v Speaker 1>it was never that it was that I didn't want you to stop doing the other stuff</v>

420
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.750
<v Speaker 1>cause the darkest shit was the shit that would make me laugh the most.</v>

421
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:42.531
<v Speaker 1>And then when you look,</v>

422
00:10:42.531 --> 00:10:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that anymore.</v>

423
00:10:43.461 --> 00:10:43.671
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

424
00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:44.540
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy.</v>

425
00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:45.380
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking bits.</v>

426
00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

427
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.990
<v Speaker 2>I know in some of the bits I look back I can't,</v>

428
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:50.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of those people I cannot watch myself.</v>

429
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.950
<v Speaker 2>I've early tapes have you all,</v>

430
00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:55.220
<v Speaker 2>I look at these clever fucking cute jokes I was doing okay.</v>

431
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.790
<v Speaker 1>I just remembered something he did that was fucking brilliant.</v>

432
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.580
<v Speaker 1>This is back in the day where there was like,</v>

433
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's somebody had heard the jerky boys,</v>

434
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.100
<v Speaker 1>like maybe like one,</v>

435
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
