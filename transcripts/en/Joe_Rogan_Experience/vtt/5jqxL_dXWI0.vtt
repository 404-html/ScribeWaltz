00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I feel like you guys,</v>

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I bought the chicken and stuff,</v>

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>believe it at first I didn't believe it.</v>

5
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:10.901
<v Speaker 1>I'm like someone said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well the match we're talking about,</v>

9
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>and me and Joe talked about this and they made a Stewart Cooper made a film on</v>

10
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:20.011
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

11
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>but Oh Tavio Sousa.</v>

12
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>His strategy was to not be honest back,</v>

13
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>stay on top and just kind of maybe get a takedown late,</v>

14
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>cause that's in that rule format or that points format in Abu Dhabi that that</v>

16
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:37.141
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

18
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't engaging.</v>

19
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>And crone is like,</v>

20
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.201
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

21
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>just like in saying,</v>

22
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>he's like Marcello,</v>

23
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

24
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>he goes after it,</v>

25
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go 100% all he wants is the submission.</v>

26
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 1>That's cronies,</v>

27
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>especial grappler,</v>

28
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>special fighter.</v>

29
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>All he wants us is the submission.</v>

30
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.141
<v Speaker 1>And Oh,</v>

31
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Tevya wasn't really engaging.</v>

32
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>And as a father,</v>

33
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

34
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

35
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

36
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.470
<v Speaker 1>not as a fine as a coach.</v>

37
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I saw his coach as the fight progress.</v>

38
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.640
<v Speaker 1>The Guy St [inaudible] in Portuguese.</v>

39
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.331
<v Speaker 1>Okay man,</v>

40
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:10.871
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

41
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:11.860
<v Speaker 1>That's all you want.</v>

42
00:01:11.861 --> 00:01:12.221
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

43
00:01:12.221 --> 00:01:12.761
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>

44
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:13.510
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

45
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

46
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

47
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>And I see a guy just running from the fight and making strategy,</v>

48
00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:21.760
<v Speaker 1>which kind of upset me completely.</v>

49
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's nothing perfect on that in my sense.</v>

50
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.380
<v Speaker 1>And but in these strategic aspect of his,</v>

51
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.543
<v Speaker 1>he's doing,</v>

52
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>so I have to counter in somehow and then I start your make shoot,</v>

53
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>tried to suggest the referee.</v>

54
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 1>He was escaping.</v>

55
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:41.530
<v Speaker 1>He was try to avoid the fight because he's not positive points in the first 10</v>

56
00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:41.921
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

57
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's negative points.</v>

58
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:43.241
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

59
00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping for a negative point with dot well fall.</v>

60
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:48.164
<v Speaker 1>This is stalling.</v>

61
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.761
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

62
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>and then I started to say,</v>

63
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Henry,</v>

64
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.771
<v Speaker 1>the guy start,</v>

65
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:51.461
<v Speaker 1>you're moving like,</v>

66
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:51.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:52.611
<v Speaker 1>he don't want to engage you.</v>

68
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just moving back like a chicken la,</v>

69
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>la,</v>

70
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>la,</v>

71
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.763
<v Speaker 1>la.</v>

72
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>And as the thing starts,</v>

73
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:57.924
<v Speaker 1>you're boiling.</v>

74
00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.841
<v Speaker 1>I start to say,</v>

75
00:01:58.841 --> 00:01:59.241
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

76
00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 1>this guy like a chicken.</v>

77
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>And the whole stage was this quiet.</v>

78
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Watching the fight is just this noise kind of overwhelming.</v>

79
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like throwing a chicken inside it in a for a Jujitsu competitor.</v>

80
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:14.724
<v Speaker 1>First of all.</v>

81
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know you're right here,</v>

82
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>but I just have to be honest.</v>

83
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Everybody says you're the greatest ever.</v>

84
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>You're the greatest Jujitsu competitor of all time.</v>

85
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>So you are here the greatest Jujitsu representative all time.</v>

86
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Your son is competing.</v>

87
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:31.881
<v Speaker 1>This guy has to respect you and admire you and you're going bock,</v>

88
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.281
<v Speaker 1>bock,</v>

89
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:32.451
<v Speaker 1>bock,</v>

90
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:32.611
<v Speaker 1>bock,</v>

91
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:32.811
<v Speaker 1>bock,</v>

92
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>bock.</v>

93
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>And the whole crowd is listening to this.</v>

94
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a lot of pressure on that guy to get into his head because it is</v>

95
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.013
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

96
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.530
<v Speaker 1>because I was was suggesting the referee he needs should be punished.</v>

97
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>And eventually like with 90 minutes or so,</v>

99
00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:53.491
<v Speaker 1>he get minus points and that's what's exactly what generates him to say,</v>

100
00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:53.921
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

101
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>now I'm honeybee,</v>

102
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.410
<v Speaker 1>raw honey running behind.</v>

103
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>So I have to make it happen and as talk and afterwards we've grown crone said,</v>

104
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

105
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.591
<v Speaker 1>when I do start,</v>

106
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>you're talking like a chicken.</v>

107
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I felt like you want to explore them.</v>

108
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make a mistake wasting the opportunity,</v>

109
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>but I know he will come.</v>

110
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>He so I was just ready for it.</v>

111
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.750
<v Speaker 1>So we kind of working together,</v>

112
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>like the father and son Ward was perfect.</v>

114
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:18.930
<v Speaker 1>He shot right in and then he's already waiting for me.</v>

115
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.803
<v Speaker 1>Boom is over.</v>

116
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Go home.</v>

117
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

118
00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:21.944
<v Speaker 1>it's ice cream.</v>

119
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it weird how it like most cities it's always like the south side is the</v>

120
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:28.331
<v Speaker 2>bad side.</v>

121
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:29.164
<v Speaker 2>It's like whoa.</v>

122
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

123
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

124
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.403
<v Speaker 2>that's what's good.</v>

125
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>What's the best area to live in?</v>

126
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 2>North Tampa is where all the rednecks live.</v>

127
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.633
<v Speaker 2>That's where I grew up.</v>

128
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.653
<v Speaker 2>North Tampa,</v>

129
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.583
<v Speaker 2>Tampa,</v>

130
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 2>elevated trucks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>hunting gators,</v>

137
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.421
<v Speaker 2>hunting gators.</v>

138
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 2>When you were a kid.</v>

139
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

140
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

141
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.011
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

142
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 2>when we,</v>

143
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget,</v>

144
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 2>when we went to look at our land,</v>

145
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 2>my dad bought like a piece of land in North Dakota in north Florida,</v>

146
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.081
<v Speaker 2>Tampa and he was like,</v>

147
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:56.914
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build on it.</v>

148
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 2>We went out as a family to go look at it and there were these two rednecks that</v>

149
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 2>had chased this other redneck in his underwear up on a mound in the middle of</v>

150
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 2>the lake and they were shooting Bibi's Adam.</v>

151
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Mike is your land.</v>

152
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:09.650
<v Speaker 2>This is our land and my day and this is our lake.</v>

153
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:10.680
<v Speaker 2>And that land that,</v>

154
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:11.514
<v Speaker 2>that little mound,</v>

155
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had a picture cause it's still there.</v>

156
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

157
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.053
<v Speaker 2>it's still there.</v>

158
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 2>And they had chased the boy up there in his,</v>

159
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 2>and he was in his underwear and my dad was like,</v>

160
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:18.671
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

161
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 2>everybody cut it out.</v>

162
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 2>That's enough in my,</v>

163
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 2>they looked at my dad and they go,</v>

164
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 2>we caught him fair and square.</v>

165
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

166
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.310
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

167
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 2>this is private land.</v>

168
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 2>It was like your land.</v>

169
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.170
<v Speaker 2>It was a lake.</v>

170
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a lake they were on,</v>

171
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.861
<v Speaker 2>they were on a boat.</v>

172
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 2>So it was a lake and the,</v>

173
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 2>and it was an island that was like maybe 10 feet off the shore of where our</v>

174
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.670
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

175
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's a big lake.</v>

176
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty big lake.</v>

177
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

178
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 2>it's not all yours.</v>

179
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.851
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

180
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:40.340
<v Speaker 2>the whole lake.</v>

181
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.173
<v Speaker 2>It's not all ours,</v>

182
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.030
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

183
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

184
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 2>and then the other side of the lake was like North Tampa.</v>

185
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.311
<v Speaker 2>It was lutes,</v>

186
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 2>it's called lutes.</v>

187
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 2>We got in the car that day and then radio stations changed.</v>

188
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.320
<v Speaker 2>And I remember the song was downtown loop.</v>

189
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 2>This is their intro to the song downtown.</v>

190
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Lutes kick off your boots,</v>

191
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 2>give a Holler in a he hall.</v>

192
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 2>And that was our new neighborhood.</v>

193
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

194
00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

195
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't your research it a little before you fucking bought land there?</v>

196
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.861
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

197
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:03.141
<v Speaker 2>cause it was,</v>

198
00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 2>it was a cheap property.</v>

199
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

200
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>childhood.</v>

201
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.491
<v Speaker 2>I fucking know.</v>

202
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Probably Hunt gators.</v>

203
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I think the whole state of Florida,</v>

204
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 2>it's considered the south side of the United States.</v>

205
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.863
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

206
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.890
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

207
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.233
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

208
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Turning the Dick in the country.</v>

209
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at like losses like that and wins,</v>

210
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 2>does that make you play more conservatively and upcoming events or do you just</v>

211
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 2>have to play intelligently,</v>

212
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 2>period and just take the losses when they come?</v>

213
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

214
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 2>the place where you get more conservative is your bankroll management rather</v>

215
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:39.934
<v Speaker 2>than your play.</v>

216
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 2>The play from one hand to the next is really about,</v>

217
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.950
<v Speaker 2>you have to put the magnitude of the numbers out of your head and try to make</v>

218
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 2>the best play each time it's on you to make a decision.</v>

219
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 2>So are you in the moment?</v>

220
00:05:56.171 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Are you zen or you still thinking about that $600,000 at you?</v>

221
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good at just getting myself into the moment.</v>

222
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.393
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

223
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.681
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

224
00:06:04.681 --> 00:06:09.681
<v Speaker 2>the place where you get more conservative is you lose for awhile.</v>

225
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 2>You have less money than you did before that period started.</v>

226
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 2>You reevaluate.</v>

227
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I have only 75% of the money I did a few months ago.</v>

228
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Should I maybe sell,</v>

229
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

230
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 2>75% of my action in this upcoming tournament instead of 50.</v>

231
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.811
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

232
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:27.171
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

233
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:28.390
<v Speaker 2>I say that,</v>

234
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 2>that that's the way in which you can get more conservative if you're going</v>

235
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>through a losing stretch is play for lower stage.</v>

236
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 2>What's the biggest losing stretch you've ever gone through?</v>

237
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.530
<v Speaker 4>MMM,</v>

238
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 2>in dollar amount period.</v>

239
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.553
<v Speaker 2>Dar mounts.</v>

240
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

241
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.460
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

242
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you ever gone through like a couple million dollars in a weekend.</v>

243
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 4>MMM.</v>

244
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 2>In Games where I didn't,</v>

245
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 2>where I had told action,</v>

246
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 2>didn't have all of myself.</v>

247
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

248
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 2>I've lost,</v>

249
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I guess my biggest losing couple of days was on the order of</v>

250
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.960
<v Speaker 2>50 million Hong Kong,</v>

251
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.801
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong dollars,</v>

252
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong dollars,</v>

253
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.533
<v Speaker 2>which are bigger,</v>

254
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.290

258
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

259

<v Speaker 2>And personally I had,</v>

262
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.100
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
