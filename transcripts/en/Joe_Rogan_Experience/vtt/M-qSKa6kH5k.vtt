<v Speaker 1>Try My day,</v>

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,</v>

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to the fight that was pulled off this card.</v>

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Cain Velasquez versus Fabrizio for doom.</v>

5
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>The rematch,</v>

6
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>which everybody was looking forward to and a cane did that meeting with that uh,</v>

7
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>that whatever a association.</v>

8
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:18.421
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

9
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>The Fighters Association and said that he's going to have to have a surgery</v>

10
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:22.974
<v Speaker 1>after this fight.</v>

11
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.963
<v Speaker 1>And they went,</v>

12
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.163
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

13
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you step that he fucked up you.</v>

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.411
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>

15
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>you can't say you need a surgery before you have a major fight.</v>

16
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>First of all that that's going to fuck with a betting lines.</v>

17
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a disaster there that's going to fuck with the insurance if something</v>

18
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:39.181
<v Speaker 1>happens to you.</v>

19
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>And then afterwards they say,</v>

20
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.921
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

21
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:41.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:41.551
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

23
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you told us that you are already hurt.</v>

24
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>We're not paying for this.</v>

25
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Like do you,</v>

26
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>do you get paid,</v>

27
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>for like when you're in training camp and you get to a fight and you have to</v>

29
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>pull out because the injury,</v>

30
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>you don't get nothing.</v>

31
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

32
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.163
<v Speaker 1>What do you get?</v>

33
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

35
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.241
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

36
00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>So you got nothing.</v>

37
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>So if he chose to fight with that injury,</v>

38
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>he said he was going to be 100% he's going to have a cortisone injection and the</v>

39
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>doctors disagreed.</v>

40
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>The Nevada State Athletic Commission disagreed that,</v>

41
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.651
<v Speaker 1>Bob Bennett Guy,</v>

43
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't fucking playing the games man.</v>

44
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

45
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>you can't say something like that.</v>

46
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And then finally long to do that.</v>

47
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>

48
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.873
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up.</v>

49
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Just emotional when I called Linacre a little monkey earlier,</v>

50
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.653
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>

51
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>See came fucked up.</v>

52
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>You just talk,</v>

53
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.503
<v Speaker 1>you say things,</v>

54
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.041
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say,</v>

56
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of racist,</v>

57
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>but I call myself a monkey though.</v>

58
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.981
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

59
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>it sounds,</v>

60
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>it sounds worse than it really is.</v>

61
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.651
<v Speaker 1>It's not racist.</v>

62
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not race.</v>

63
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm the last person racist.</v>

64
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>But the point is with when it comes to Cain is that it was a giant error and</v>

65
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>that error pulled him off of this card and now he's going to have to fight.</v>

66
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>He's going to have to get surgery and then he didn't have to fight.</v>

67
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Whoever the fuck has left and it's,</v>

68
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about more months out and then even more examination next time</v>

69
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to cost him a shit load of money.</v>

70
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>A ton of money went through the entire camp.</v>

71
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>He was a week out and they pull them from it.</v>

72
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>And then he was saying,</v>

73
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what this is about.</v>

74
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:54.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

75
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100% good to go.</v>

76
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>I've been told I've been cleared.</v>

77
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>So he was tweeting that he had been told that he was cleared right before they</v>

78
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:01.434
<v Speaker 1>pull them.</v>

79
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I thought you know I think you give the guy a physical examination in terms of</v>

80
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>his movement.</v>

81
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Like what can you do?</v>

82
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

83
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

84
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>how do you tell the guy business wise,</v>

85
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.081
<v Speaker 1>business wise,</v>

86
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>you can look in his bag back some since I added this why slide you kick cause</v>

87
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>the UFC goes man,</v>

88
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>you have a bulging disc,</v>

89
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>you get the cortisone shot and then if you get punched in the face by her doing</v>

90
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>where you get the guilty and you're paralyzed,</v>

91
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>you sue the fuck out us cause we let your true business,</v>

92
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>you just can't do that.</v>

93
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>No deny.</v>

94
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it falls on.</v>

95
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Kay came knows better.</v>

96
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>The people around this association shouldn't have let him do that.</v>

97
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all they should have known about first the Bjorn revenue thing is</v>

98
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:36.451
<v Speaker 1>very weird.</v>

99
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I was reading with John Fitch had written that John Fitch rather than an</v>

100
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>interview said that he was very a disturbed by all this because there's a class</v>

101
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>action lawsuit.</v>

102
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.940
<v Speaker 1>And what they're saying is that if the class action lawsuit is dropped like that</v>

103
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>they could form this,</v>

104
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:52.471
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>this union.</v>

106
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>And if the all agreed to abandon the class action lawsuit,</v>

107
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

108
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>it would like help the strength and form the union.</v>

109
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And John Fitch was like,</v>

110
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

111
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

112
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>so you're saying that the UFC would accept you as a union if you abandoned the</v>

113
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>class action lawsuit that we've been chasing down for two years now without</v>

114
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>picking any sides.</v>

115
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're on the side of the fighters,</v>

116
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>not picking any sides,</v>

117
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>you just have to look at that and go,</v>

118
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>well what benefit would it be for the people that are not in this to accept that</v>

119
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 1>the class action lawsuit has dropped?</v>

120
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>This all sounds like someone's trying to get some money because there's no one's</v>

121
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:26.614
<v Speaker 1>doing this for free.</v>

122
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody has to realize when it comes to like these agencies and</v>

123
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>there's like three different competing ones that are stepping in,</v>

124
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:32.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

125
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:33.401
<v Speaker 1>One soon.</v>

126
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>The other,</v>

127
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.521
<v Speaker 1>there's the associate,</v>

128
00:03:34.521 --> 00:03:35.261
<v Speaker 1>the two big ones.</v>

129
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:36.120
<v Speaker 1>There's association,</v>

130
00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:36.954
<v Speaker 1>there's the Union.</v>

131
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Well ultimately I think we all want the same thing.</v>

133
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>We all want fighters to be compensated fairly.</v>

134
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Want them to make a lot of money because it's a short window of time and it's an</v>

135
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>awesome sport to watch,</v>

136
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

137
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.663
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

138
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>So you got to wonder,</v>

139
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>does this help that?</v>

140
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Does this help them?</v>

141
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Does it do any of these organizations?</v>

142
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.021
<v Speaker 1>They haven't yet.</v>

143
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:01.021
<v Speaker 1>Because if they can get together and organize and they're gonna fight right then</v>

144
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>no one's gonna take you serious.</v>

145
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>There's three different leaders,</v>

146
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>three different ones,</v>

147
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>and they all want different things.</v>

148
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got to wonder whose agenda's over here?</v>

149
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Whose agenda's over here?</v>

150
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>What it has to come.</v>

151
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 1>It can't come from businessman,</v>

152
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>can't come from another promoter.</v>

153
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>How's it come from the fighters,</v>

154
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>the fighters,</v>

155
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.530
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

156
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying current fighters because they need to fight and then they</v>

158
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 1>need to have someone speak for them who's been there.</v>

159
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.021
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

160
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>you can't have these business guys with other hidden agendas trying to get</v>

161
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:27.071
<v Speaker 1>things done.</v>

162
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

163
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>or in a B,</v>

164
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.591
<v Speaker 1>orange case,</v>

165
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:30.200
<v Speaker 1>he has this,</v>

166
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.530
<v Speaker 1>weird jealousy with Dana and what's seem destroyed.</v>

168
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

169
00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>we can't have that.</v>

170
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Why are you speaking for us?</v>

171
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

172
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

173
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

174
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the respect of the is what the fuck you're doing.</v>

175
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And notice he's taking a seat back because everyone,</v>

176
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:43.380
<v Speaker 1>when everyone saw him speaking,</v>

177
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.721
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

178
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>we're out,</v>

179
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

180
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:45.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

182
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 1>he was going old school bell tour when he was running things over there and a</v>

183
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>king mo was pissed off at them and King Mo most of this day calls him a Dick</v>

184
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Rider all the time.</v>

185
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>There's the whole,</v>

186
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not good when you've got a guy like king mo who's a very respected guy who</v>

187
00:04:58.601 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>is horrible things to say about you.</v>

188
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 1>And I talked the association,</v>

189
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:01.931
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

190
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:02.810
<v Speaker 1>what are you guys doing?</v>

191
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Like you have one way to make an impression and you do this.</v>

192
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:08.790
<v Speaker 1>You put your best foot forward with this guy and then,</v>

193
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

194
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the dude.</v>

195
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.043
<v Speaker 1>Do you know him?</v>

196
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I know of fighters who have dealt with them.</v>

197
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>I never thought for Bella tour.</v>

198
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.970
<v Speaker 1>So I know inside the fight or circle that people have dealt with him for manager</v>

199
00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

200
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>But also personally I was looking at all the tweets and all the negative stuff.</v>

201
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 1>I think you can take a very positive angle about improving the life and the</v>

202
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>conditions of these fighters without attacking people.</v>

203
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

204
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

205
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to attack.</v>

206
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>It's also see what you want about Dana White.</v>

207
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not his job to make sure you guys get your shit together and form a</v>

208
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:39.611
<v Speaker 1>association.</v>

209
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:39.941
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

210
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm a businessman.</v>

211
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I put on fights.</v>

212
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 1>If you guys want to do that,</v>

213
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.421
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

214
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Get your shit together and then bring it to,</v>

215
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>and then let's figure something out.</v>

216
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 1>But if you guys are fighting with each other,</v>

217
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.070
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to Mcdonald's Gino</v>

218
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.070
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

219
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
