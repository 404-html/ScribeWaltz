<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.360

<v Speaker 1>pay if they got below two 27,</v>

32
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.770

<v Speaker 1>trip of their choice ix.</v>

37
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Their height has to be measured because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body mass index would indicate that</v>

38
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>they have to be a certain height or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're obese.</v>

97
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 3>He said something in passing and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I did.</v>

98
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just didn't acknowledge it.</v>

99
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.293
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

100
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.400
<v Speaker 3>she go to Burke Williams and just sweat</v>
<v Speaker 3>it out in the spa.</v>

101
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 3>That's what I've been doing for two</v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

102
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 3>I put abilene all over my body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

103
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 3>And then I just sat in the steam room</v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday and today.</v>

104
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

105
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 3>Run in fucking 10 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you didn't,</v>

106
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't drink any water?</v>

107
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:03.604
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

108
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 3>I did hot bath last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a two and a half mile track last</v>

109
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

110
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Then I did what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's what I built up a sweat</v>

111
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I recovered no water then hot bath,</v>

112
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 3>abilene everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No water at all.</v>

113
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 3>Not even a little sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a sip before bed.</v>

114
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I said after the hot bath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

115
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 3>But I've also had nothing but distilled</v>
<v Speaker 3>water for about six days.</v>

116
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 3>What's the benefits of the distilled</v>
<v Speaker 3>water?</v>

117
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 3>Because minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes right through your body.</v>

118
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 3>It's easier to sweat out it that your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body doesn't like to retain it.</v>

119
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Apparently a lot of fighters do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>before they still cut weight to laugh my</v>

120
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 3>ass off at seeing burt walk into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>spot this morning.</v>

121
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:45.920
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was waiting for it to,</v>

122
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 3>he said it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

123
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I reserved spot time at Burke Williams</v>
<v Speaker 3>at in Sherman oaks both days.</v>

124
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what is better for me to work</v>

125
00:05:59.031 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 3>it out?</v>

126
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be healthy.</v>

127
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 3>I'll work it out and I'll sweat it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then like mile five I stopped</v>

128
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:04.740
<v Speaker 3>sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

129
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 3>was the thing about this whole working</v>
<v Speaker 3>it out stuff?</v>

130
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 3>You're not losing any fat over the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

131
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>

132
00:06:11.281 --> 00:06:14.770
<v Speaker 3>it's really just dehydration and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be,</v>

133
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 3>might've been better off just sweating</v>
<v Speaker 3>it out then running and I hit my</v>

134
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:19.980
<v Speaker 3>baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

135
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't doing this week leading up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

136
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I just did right night before wanes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So or morning before,</v>

137
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.501
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

138
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you get?</v>

139
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 3>What'd you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you weigh yourself when you got</v>

140
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 3>before when you got to Burke Williams?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

141
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have a scale there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Fuck No.</v>

142
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 3>But I weighed myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I think about scale at a spa,</v>

143
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've definitely weighed myself</v>

144
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 3>there and then I knew what I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I knew,</v>

145
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 3>what I weighed when I woke up yesterday.</v>

146
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 3>And then I knew what I weighed here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that what I had done to cut that</v>

147
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:50.070
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

148
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 3>I just kind of repeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no way.</v>

149
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you right now,</v>

150
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

151
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 3>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I was bested all around</v>

152
00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:58.130
<v Speaker 3>because there's no way I could've gotten</v>
<v Speaker 3>to two.</v>

153
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 3>I would have had gotten two to 14 to</v>
<v Speaker 3>win.</v>

154
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't,</v>

155
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have to go below that because</v>

156
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 3>you would add to lose by more than two</v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>

157
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 3>You had to lose more than two pounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he beat you.</v>

158
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 3>But two pounds yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it would have to be like more than</v>

159
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:13.330
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

160
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 3>it's clear now cause you won both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no mercy.</v>

161
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.180
<v Speaker 3>I feel embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a chat.</v>

162
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Speaker 3>I want to give a shout out to God</v>

<v Speaker 3>I got up at,</v>

189
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I woke up with cramps at three 30 bad</v>

190
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 3>leg behind the knee here on the outside</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it will calf cramp.</v>

191
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 3>That kept me up for like 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I considered like,</v>

192
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start thinking about maybe I should</v>

193
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:51.750
<v Speaker 3>drink some water and dehydration clamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

194
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.600
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you could drag a whole one of</v>

195
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 3>these and you still would've won by</v>
<v Speaker 3>three pounds.</v>

196
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 4>Well I didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably good,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Four of them and still one.</v>

198
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

199
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 4>And then you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I was just counting down the</v>

200
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I spent the,</v>

201
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get my son with Christina,</v>

202
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 4>we spend time with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do a breakfast.</v>

203
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 4>I'd look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like seven 30 and I was like,</v>

204
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck eight 39 30 just counting it</v>
<v Speaker 4>down man.</v>

205
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.940
<v Speaker 4>And then in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that spa,</v>

206
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 4>sweating out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing like 10 minutes in,</v>

207
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 4>five minutes out of 10 minutes in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five minutes out every time.</v>

208
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.370
<v Speaker 4>And then I'm in there alone and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>attendant comes in with a big classical,</v>

209
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought you might want a glass of</v>

210
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:36.150
<v Speaker 4>water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he handed me a cold glass of water.</v>

211
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look like a psycho pouring it out.</v>

212
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh well I waited from leaving and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>threw it away.</v>

213
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 4>Like angrily threw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just pissed that I can't drink it.</v>

214
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was fucking livid.</v>

215
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.030
<v Speaker 4>And you really get to the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like today on the treadmill,</v>

216
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 4>I was literally chewing ice and spitting</v>
<v Speaker 4>it out into a shirt and I thought,</v>

217
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 4>I know what those people feel like when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they dive deeper in the ocean.</v>

218
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's fresh water 10 feet below.</v>

219
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people that lose their minds out</v>

220
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:05.010
<v Speaker 4>to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever heard of those?</v>

221
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 4>People know what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's freshwater people have people</v>

222
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:10.950
<v Speaker 4>who are stranded at sea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

223
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 4>you always hear the guy that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like jumps in and he's like,</v>

224
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:16.260
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's freshwater 10 people lo and they</v>

225
00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:19.410
<v Speaker 4>dive down below and drink seawater and</v>
<v Speaker 4>die or go crazy.</v>

226
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 4>I know that feeling like I know I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know what to that extent,</v>

227
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 4>but man I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could empathize with it on that</v>

228
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:24.900
<v Speaker 4>treadmill.</v>

229
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 4>The day I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

230
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.900
<v Speaker 4>I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to cheat.</v>

231
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 4>I want water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want water so fucking bad.</v>

232
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.250
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine the mind fuck of being</v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounded by water as far as the eye</v>

233
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:39.450
<v Speaker 4>can see and you're dying of thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>

234
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.820
<v Speaker 4>remember I survived that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that series.</v>

235
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was phenomenals if people haven't</v>

236
00:10:45.481 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 4>seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did a series where people who are</v>

237
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:52.671
<v Speaker 4>in like extreme life threatening near</v>
<v Speaker 4>death situations and made it like</v>

238
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:56.040
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they were kidnapped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assaulted,</v>

239
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:58.590
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they're an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they're stranded at sea.</v>

240
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.880
<v Speaker 4>And there was one where this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were stranded off some somewhere in</v>

241
00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 4>the coast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some Gulf of Mexico and boat overturns.</v>

242
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.370
<v Speaker 4>And it's just this guy and his buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said like,</v>

243
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's telling the story and as it</v>

244
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.320
<v Speaker 4>progresses he's seeing his friend kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of slip away and the friend eventually</v>

245
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 4>drinks ocean water and he's telling him</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to do it,</v>

246
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 4>but he's so far gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it just accelerates the</v>

247
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:31.200
<v Speaker 4>friend's death and the friend died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens when you drink ocean water?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

286
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.240
<v Speaker 5>Ours crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta be honest with when we started</v>

287
00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:57.060
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was concerned about height cause I was</v>

288
00:12:57.061 --> 00:12:59.340
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno if we're like I don't know what</v>

289
00:12:59.341 --> 00:13:00.061
<v Speaker 5>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the day,</v>

290
00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:01.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't know when we're going to measure</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

291
00:13:01.141 --> 00:13:02.790
<v Speaker 5>I know that I'm six one when I go to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>doctor,</v>

292
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.410
<v Speaker 5>but like I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

293
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.200
<v Speaker 5>you just get scared and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then that difference and overweight</v>

294
00:13:07.201 --> 00:13:10.560
<v Speaker 5>versus obese has like six pounds from</v>
<v Speaker 5>six one to six foot.</v>

295
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.420
<v Speaker 5>It's two 27 to two 20</v>

296
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was nervous.</v>

297
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.220
<v Speaker 3>That's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But either way our,</v>

298
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.550
<v Speaker 3>he's wrong either way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even at a just under six feet.</v>

299
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Tom Has a little bit over at five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

300
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:27.220
<v Speaker 3>11 and three quarters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

301
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was just under six feet.</v>

302
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.950

<v Speaker 3>just under six feet.</v>

303
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think your body,</v>

304
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd have to be like two 20 to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be considered over,</v>

305
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

306
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 3>No more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's as leaning the other way.</v>

309
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.690
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

310
00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:48.070

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Because I'm obese.</v>

325
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.130
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my point is don't get,</v>

326
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.190
<v Speaker 5>or if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he was being a stickler about this,</v>

327
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.390
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to find out what it is at</v>
<v Speaker 5>five 11.8 to be fair.</v>

328
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.950
<v Speaker 5>Can you type in five 11.8 now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you pause?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Can you put in?</v>

330
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.250
<v Speaker 5>So what do you at what do you at six</v>
<v Speaker 5>feet or you're not obese,</v>

331
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.920
<v Speaker 5>six feet and that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That one inch your be ob some one five</v>

332
00:14:43.921 --> 00:14:46.950

<v Speaker 5>Tom.</v>

333
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 3>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever man.</v>

334
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.150
<v Speaker 3>But obviously that body mass index</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't count you.</v>

335
00:14:54.151 --> 00:14:57.100
<v Speaker 3>You do have a lot of muscle and you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a lot of weight lifting and</v>

336
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.780
<v Speaker 3>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched a little bit of a podcast</v>

337
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:00.720
<v Speaker 3>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

338
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 3>that's where I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Muscle.</v>

339
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing toenails running shit.</v>

340
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Well if you put muscle on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is you lose fat,</v>

341
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 3>your body starts burning it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body has more calorie requirements.</v>

342
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have more body mass of more muscle</v>

343
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:16.570
<v Speaker 3>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

344
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 3>so if you actually put more muscle on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll burn off more than you can eat</v>

345
00:15:20.601 --> 00:15:21.434
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

346
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.110
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm going to start doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>crossfit pretty aggressively.</v>

347
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm really looking for this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a fresh face look to inspire me to work</v>

348
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:28.200

<v Speaker 3>beard,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So that's,</v>

470
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.730
<v Speaker 5>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why I stopped having firm views</v>

471
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 5>about things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

472
00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.280
<v Speaker 5>especially about clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause I was like,</v>

473
00:20:11.281 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 5>it was a bad weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but maybe it was me,</v>

474
00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:13.231
<v Speaker 5>Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

475
00:20:13.231 --> 00:20:14.610
<v Speaker 5>like I always take the blame on me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

476
00:20:14.611 --> 00:20:16.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't ever go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're,</v>

477
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.390
<v Speaker 5>you've always been accurate at doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that too.</v>

478
00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 5>Going fuck that club.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that guy.</v>

479
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.660
<v Speaker 5>Fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll never work with them.</v>

480
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.721
<v Speaker 4>Nimble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

481
00:20:23.721 --> 00:20:25.140
<v Speaker 4>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

482
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.700
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I give like,</v>

483
00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I feel like something sucks,</v>

484
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.630
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I have a pretty good take on</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

485
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.080
<v Speaker 4>So in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

486
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to be theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know in comedy there's a lot of</v>

487
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:37.830
<v Speaker 4>irrational people and there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

488
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.260
<v Speaker 4>comedians that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

489
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit about everything,</v>

490
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including how the show went.</v>

491
00:20:44.731 --> 00:20:48.590
<v Speaker 4>And so I feel I'm a realist and I have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty good,</v>

492
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do trust my cell phone.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you have bad sets.</v>

<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

602
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.800
<v Speaker 3>That's the best of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of what we talked about yesterday</v>

603
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:29.360
<v Speaker 3>where so many people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

607
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.240
<v Speaker 3>You're missing the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is by the way,</v>

608
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.840
<v Speaker 3>silliness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some particularly mean comments that I</v>

609
00:25:36.841 --> 00:25:40.970
<v Speaker 3>came across don't over the last 24 hours</v>
<v Speaker 3>to run long shore man.</v>

610
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I don't even read instagram</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

611
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

612
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 3>because the comments are seems so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more active than anywhere else.</v>

613
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Well if you go to Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see so many people was blocked</v>

614
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:53.690
<v Speaker 3>accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing that histogram does that</v>

615
00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:56.750
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really firmly believe that if you have</v>

616
00:25:56.751 --> 00:25:59.570
<v Speaker 3>a blocked account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be able to comment on</v>

617
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:02.480
<v Speaker 3>other people's accounts because all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people have blocked accounts and</v>

618
00:26:02.481 --> 00:26:06.320
<v Speaker 3>then they talk mad shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people's accounts and it's just an</v>

619
00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:09.530
<v Speaker 3>anonymity thing because you can't lash</v>
<v Speaker 3>back at them so they can to leave.</v>

620
00:26:09.531 --> 00:26:12.080
<v Speaker 3>How many chickens there are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>pussies.</v>

<v Speaker 3>instead of his troll account.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Horrible ones who are doing Ronda Rousey</v>
<v Speaker 8>in 10 years.</v>

700
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 8>Does,</v>
<v Speaker 8>have you seen the Ronda Rousey 10 years</v>

701
00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:58.870
<v Speaker 8>ones?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is that where she's getting hit?</v>

702
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.140
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a bunch of like really obese,</v>

703
00:30:02.141 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 8>trashy women and one of them was</v>
<v Speaker 8>screaming at,</v>

704
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:07.630
<v Speaker 8>so some kid to get her a lemonade</v>
<v Speaker 8>lemonade,</v>

705
00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.450
<v Speaker 8>which is juicy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The Ronda Rousey radiohead cover.</v>

706
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.301
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>here.</v>

707
00:30:11.301 --> 00:30:12.340
<v Speaker 8>Here she is right here.</v>

708
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.030
<v Speaker 7>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

709
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That sounds fake,</v>

710
00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:20.921
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

711
00:30:20.921 --> 00:30:22.060
<v Speaker 7>it's face.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Seems fake.</v>

712
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:25.790
<v Speaker 7>There's a picture of Ronda rousey</v>
<v Speaker 7>getting knocked out and then the radio</v>

713
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.320
<v Speaker 7>head cover and they look identical.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can you pull it up to me?</v>

714
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.000
<v Speaker 8>Rough Times.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Rough Times in the house of browsing.</v>

715
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.130
<v Speaker 7>I've never been that down in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how down that she feels by,</v>

716
00:30:38.131 --> 00:30:40.230
<v Speaker 7>I didn't down salad days,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

717
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:44.460
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a thing when you're fighting is a</v>

718
00:30:44.461 --> 00:30:47.130
<v Speaker 8>different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like losing a basketball game.</v>

719
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.780
<v Speaker 8>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

720
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.660
<v Speaker 8>But that seems like she's winning there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That sort of laughing.</v>

721
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.020
<v Speaker 8>That's the radio head one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's her winning.</v>

722
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.550
<v Speaker 8>There's one of her getting knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 8>at the same,</v>

723
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.440
<v Speaker 8>there's one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The head kick one.</v>

724
00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:03.460
<v Speaker 8>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's really crazy is how just a year</v>

725
00:31:03.811 --> 00:31:07.020
<v Speaker 8>and a couple of months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she was on top of the world.</v>

726
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.650
<v Speaker 8>It's that kind of an adjustment that's</v>
<v Speaker 8>almost impossible for a regular person</v>

727
00:31:10.651 --> 00:31:14.370
<v Speaker 8>to comprehend other than death or a loss</v>
<v Speaker 8>like that.</v>

728
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.950
<v Speaker 8>It was a very few events in your life or</v>
<v Speaker 8>your life will completely shift upside</v>

729
00:31:20.221 --> 00:31:21.840
<v Speaker 8>down.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But even in death,</v>

730
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.020
<v Speaker 8>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if someone you close,</v>

731
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.400
<v Speaker 8>you're close to that you care about</v>
<v Speaker 8>dies,</v>

732
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:30.030
<v Speaker 8>other people are sympathetic and they</v>
<v Speaker 8>care about you and they don't treat you</v>

733
00:31:30.031 --> 00:31:32.070
<v Speaker 8>like you're a piece of shit because</v>
<v Speaker 8>someone died,</v>

734
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.390
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So in a lot of ways,</v>

735
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.450
<v Speaker 8>fighting is its own completely unique</v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of,</v>

736
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.600
<v Speaker 8>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of loss because it's,</v>

737
00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.980
<v Speaker 8>it's the only time where people openly</v>
<v Speaker 8>mock you for your loss.</v>

738
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 7>Never seen people though openly mock</v>
<v Speaker 7>someone as much as they seem like</v>

739
00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 7>they're mocking Rhonda</v>

740
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.890
<v Speaker 8>in their defense,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in the people that are mocking.</v>

741
00:31:53.891 --> 00:31:56.110
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she had,</v>

742
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:59.140
<v Speaker 8>she did a lot of things that invited</v>
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>

743
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.360
<v Speaker 8>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

744
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.920
<v Speaker 8>if you ever watch the ultimate fighter</v>
<v Speaker 8>with her and Misha Tate,</v>

745
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.821
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

746
00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:08.070
<v Speaker 8>she was ridiculous and like sticking the</v>
<v Speaker 8>finger at me should take it.</v>

747
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 8>And after the fight she wouldn't shake</v>
<v Speaker 8>me should tate's hand.</v>

748
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:15.190
<v Speaker 8>And there was like a lot of non sport</v>
<v Speaker 8>anti sportsmanship,</v>

749
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.980
<v Speaker 8>like she do that on the home fight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Also not touch gloves.</v>

750
00:32:17.981 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 8>Wasn't that hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 8>didn't it?</v>

751
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.010
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>at the center.</v>

752
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.070
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

753
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 8>She touched gloves in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

754
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.700
<v Speaker 8>she touched gloves at the beginning and</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

755
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:27.400
<v Speaker 8>but she didn't touch gloves before the</v>
<v Speaker 8>fight actually started.</v>

756
00:32:27.401 --> 00:32:30.160
<v Speaker 8>She touched gloves at the stare down,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which I thought was like,</v>

757
00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 8>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's interesting.</v>

758
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.850
<v Speaker 8>And maybe her head's in a good place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then,</v>

759
00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:36.340
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she didn't touch gloves afterwards.</v>

760
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.080
<v Speaker 8>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>do think that the world will turn on the</v>

761
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.630
<v Speaker 8>conor mcgregor when he loses for the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they did.</v>

762
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.310
<v Speaker 8>The world turned on him when he did,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>

763
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 8>but the world respected him in a massive</v>
<v Speaker 8>way because he jumped right back into</v>

764
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:50.150
<v Speaker 8>the fray and then he won.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And he also was fighting that way,</v>

765
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:51.740
<v Speaker 8>way different weight,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

766
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.720
<v Speaker 8>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he was fighting in a different way,</v>

767
00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:56.410
<v Speaker 8>but everybody keeps chiming in on this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>including the UFC.</v>

768
00:32:56.411 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 8>Or they say that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

769
00:32:57.291 --> 00:33:02.291
<v Speaker 8>nate's a one 70 bull shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nate Diaz fought one 70 twice in the UFC</v>

770
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:08.380
<v Speaker 8>against dumb young Kim and against a Roy</v>
<v Speaker 8>McDonald and both times he was too small</v>

771
00:33:08.931 --> 00:33:12.560
<v Speaker 8>and got ragdolled.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's not a one 70 the reason why he's</v>

772
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:17.561
<v Speaker 8>not a one 70 is he's been fighting at</v>
<v Speaker 8>one 55 successfully his whole career and</v>

773
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:19.520
<v Speaker 8>it's fight before the conor mcgregor</v>
<v Speaker 8>fight,</v>

774
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 8>he fought.</v>

775
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 8>Michael Johnson had one 55 it looked</v>
<v Speaker 8>fantastic.</v>

776
00:33:23.181 --> 00:33:26.870
<v Speaker 8>Nate is a 155 pound fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what he,</v>

777
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 8>that's those weight class connors.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right now the champion won 55 but</v>

778
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.090
<v Speaker 8>they're different in size in that connor</v>
<v Speaker 8>can make one 45 nate eight can't make</v>

779
00:33:35.091 --> 00:33:38.580
<v Speaker 8>one 45 so connor can dehydrate himself</v>
<v Speaker 8>down another 10 pounds.</v>

780
00:33:38.581 --> 00:33:40.580
<v Speaker 8>Nate camp,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's insane.</v>

781
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.300
<v Speaker 8>He probably can't anymore cause is put</v>
<v Speaker 8>on a little bit of bulk and now he's</v>

782
00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:47.360
<v Speaker 8>fighting at one 55 I'm sure he feels</v>
<v Speaker 8>much more comfortable and healthy there.</v>

783
00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:49.460
<v Speaker 8>He doesn't want to go down to one 45</v>
<v Speaker 8>again,</v>

784
00:33:49.461 --> 00:33:52.850
<v Speaker 8>but nate is almost physically incapable.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean he would have to look like he's</v>

785
00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 8>on death's door.</v>

786
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 4>Brutal by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I can't emphasize how horrible the</v>

787
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 4>last couple of days have been and I mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is obviously a modified version,</v>

788
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:05.000
<v Speaker 4>like we're not pros but don't really</v>
<v Speaker 4>know</v>

789
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.600
<v Speaker 8>way better.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Both of you do then a lot of guys do</v>

790
00:34:08.601 --> 00:34:11.120
<v Speaker 8>when they weigh in.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So whatever you drained out of your body</v>

791
00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:12.620
<v Speaker 8>that was so hard is nothing.</v>

792
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:13.503
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

793
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.520
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I peed in the shower and it was like</v>

794
00:34:15.521 --> 00:34:16.470
<v Speaker 4>motor oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

795
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was dude,</v>

796
00:34:18.281 --> 00:34:20.980
<v Speaker 4>it was orange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was orange and there was just like,</v>

797
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.200
<v Speaker 4>like it's like my dick spit chewing</v>
<v Speaker 4>tobacco.</v>

798
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.690
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like a meme right there,</v>

799
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:30.400
<v Speaker 4>this supporting this morning and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cannot wait to get fluid in my body</v>

800
00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:33.430
<v Speaker 4>and my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my dick go fantasize about it.</v>

801
00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:35.440
<v Speaker 4>To your mind really starts playing</v>
<v Speaker 4>tricks on you.</v>

802
00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:40.030
<v Speaker 4>It's the fucking crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That cris cyborg weight loss thing</v>

803
00:34:40.031 --> 00:34:41.860
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

804
00:34:41.861 --> 00:34:44.260
<v Speaker 4>that was a horrible one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that one,</v>

805
00:34:44.261 --> 00:34:47.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>espn covered pretty extensively by the</v>

806
00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.130
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Outside the lines,</v>

807
00:34:48.131 --> 00:34:52.570
<v Speaker 4>back to the skip bayless nonsense about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things I think about.</v>

808
00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:57.130
<v Speaker 4>Like one time I asked you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you fucking know so much about</v>

809
00:34:57.131 --> 00:35:00.700
<v Speaker 4>this mma stuff and you go see only thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>occupying that space.</v>

810
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.370
<v Speaker 4>In my head it's the only sport I follow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

811
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:07.710
<v Speaker 4>That's I think the great flaw of being</v>
<v Speaker 4>the all sport comment or oh you guys</v>

812
00:35:07.931 --> 00:35:10.450
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that they're trying to keep up with</v>

813
00:35:10.451 --> 00:35:13.900
<v Speaker 4>experts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>experts in all the sports and they just</v>

814
00:35:13.901 --> 00:35:18.070
<v Speaker 4>don't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he might have a great take on maybe</v>

815
00:35:18.071 --> 00:35:21.970
<v Speaker 4>in the NBA or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it starts to dilute somewhere.</v>

816
00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:25.750
<v Speaker 4>You're not also going to be the best at</v>
<v Speaker 4>commenting on horse racing,</v>

817
00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:27.160
<v Speaker 4>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>football,</v>

818
00:35:27.161 --> 00:35:28.990
<v Speaker 4>college football,</v>
<v Speaker 4>college basketball,</v>

819
00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.240
<v Speaker 4>tennis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got like people.</v>

820
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.700
<v Speaker 4>So then you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's going to get lazy about the</v>

821
00:35:33.701 --> 00:35:35.080
<v Speaker 4>way you comment on just</v>

822
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 8>even something's going to get lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's no room.</v>

823
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Like here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example.</v>

824
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm an expert in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in mma I defer to other people about</v>

825
00:35:44.701 --> 00:35:47.580
<v Speaker 1>certain aspects of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I want to talk about Jujitsu,</v>

826
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:49.920
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Eddie Bravo.</v>

827
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.911
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

828
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:52.800
<v Speaker 1>well like we had a conversation the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other day about a,</v>

829
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:56.250
<v Speaker 1>the Anderson Silva chell Sunday fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I incorrectly remembered it and</v>

830
00:35:56.251 --> 00:35:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Eddie corrected me and we watched the</v>
<v Speaker 1>submission.</v>

831
00:35:58.410 --> 00:35:59.243
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

832
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:00.630
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remembered it wrong.</v>

833
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I understand setups and I</v>

834
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:08.670
<v Speaker 1>understand technique and I'm a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>belt in Jujitsu under him and under John</v>

835
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Machado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geeky and Nogi and still my knowledge is</v>

836
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:14.840
<v Speaker 1>nothing compared to Eddie Bradley and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

837
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.100
<v Speaker 1>his is like almost just like a gift to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

838
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.023
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he said,</v>

839
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's studied it his whole fucking life.</v>

840
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.330
<v Speaker 1>He's a wizard at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's a true jujitsu genius.</v>

841
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:29.040
<v Speaker 1>He's not just really good at techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's invented a bunch of setups and a</v>

842
00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 1>bunch of different pathways to</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques that worldclass professionals</v>

843
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:36.180
<v Speaker 1>use and when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when he watches it,</v>

844
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 1>he definitely sees something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might see a hair or two past what I</v>

845
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:45.270
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is gigantic in fighting and so</v>

846
00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:48.000
<v Speaker 1>then when it comes to Moitai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

847
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot about Moitai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I defer to like guys like mark tele</v>

848
00:36:52.191 --> 00:36:54.180
<v Speaker 1>grata or Duke roufus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

849
00:36:54.181 --> 00:36:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask them and they'll give me a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain take on things that maybe is</v>

850
00:36:57.871 --> 00:37:00.300
<v Speaker 1>different than than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than my perspective.</v>

851
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.930
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way one person can understand</v>

852
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.440
<v Speaker 1>everything better than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much to know.</v>

853
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.840
<v Speaker 1>There's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you've got a guy who's an</v>

854
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:13.140
<v Speaker 1>overall like mighty mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Demetrius Johnson,</v>

855
00:37:13.141 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 1>who I think is the best fighter ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

856
00:37:15.151 --> 00:37:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look at his technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's the best fighter ever.</v>

857
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.530
<v Speaker 1>There's guys that are better at Moy Thai</v>
<v Speaker 1>than him.</v>

858
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.930
<v Speaker 1>There's guys that are better Jiu Jitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

859
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just the best at putting it</v>

860
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:25.310
<v Speaker 1>together in his weight class and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominating his,</v>

861
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.630
<v Speaker 1>his division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still there's gay,</v>

862
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.970
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too big of an ocean.</v>

863
00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.330
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I was saying that verbally,</v>

864
00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.380
<v Speaker 5>very beginning of this conversation was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like both of us were probably</v>

865
00:37:35.381 --> 00:37:37.960
<v Speaker 5>here in this podcast during this podcast</v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

866
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.850
<v Speaker 5>when you have see signed the deal with</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fox,</v>

867
00:37:39.851 --> 00:37:42.130
<v Speaker 5>which was I think the big blow up where</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

868
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:45.280
<v Speaker 5>now all of a sudden Fox was going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>brand it with,</v>

869
00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:50.310
<v Speaker 5>with sports talent hosts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was not just you and Goldberg.</v>

870
00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.431
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

871
00:37:51.431 --> 00:37:52.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

872
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.841
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

873
00:37:52.841 --> 00:37:56.690
<v Speaker 5>I remember hearing about big fucking Fox</v>
<v Speaker 5>events where they had it all there.</v>

874
00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:58.570
<v Speaker 5>Jim Rome was going to comment on it or</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

875
00:37:58.571 --> 00:37:59.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying.</v>

876
00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.300
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what kind of socks because I</v>

877
00:38:01.301 --> 00:38:02.134
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

878
00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.330
<v Speaker 5>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

879
00:38:04.331 --> 00:38:09.040
<v Speaker 5>I feel like the mainstream media was so</v>
<v Speaker 5>against it for so long that finally when</v>

880
00:38:09.041 --> 00:38:11.500
<v Speaker 5>it pushed through to watch the</v>
<v Speaker 5>mainstream media do this,</v>

881
00:38:11.501 --> 00:38:15.130
<v Speaker 5>like almost like fucking arms wide open</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

882
00:38:15.131 --> 00:38:16.420
<v Speaker 5>We've always been lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Skip,</v>

883
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:17.770
<v Speaker 5>give us your insight about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

884
00:38:17.771 --> 00:38:18.850
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just UFC.</v>

885
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:19.840
<v Speaker 5>It's gift.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give us your insight.</v>

886
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:22.510
<v Speaker 5>It's such a complex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not just putting a ball through a</v>

887
00:38:22.511 --> 00:38:22.850
<v Speaker 5>hoop.</v>

888
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:26.870
<v Speaker 1>It's so lame when a Gig that is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause the Gig that he has is this thing.</v>

889
00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:29.900
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's like what's your hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>take on this?</v>

890
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And then those guys have to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>something almost that is somewhat</v>

891
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:35.943
<v Speaker 1>controversial</v>

892
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.180
<v Speaker 3>for a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

893
00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 3>It's very contrived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

894
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.780
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what Joe,</v>

895
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:45.520
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nate is a better one 70 I've seen it and</v>

896
00:38:45.521 --> 00:38:46.780
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just what I think.</v>

897
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:51.160
<v Speaker 3>And then that's like the take is that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagrees with you.</v>

898
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.650
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that's everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

899
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously,</v>

900
00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:57.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not putting Amy Schumer on blast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like these days,</v>

901
00:38:57.731 --> 00:39:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if they have anything</v>

902
00:39:00.911 --> 00:39:05.911
<v Speaker 3>to say other than the most aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that everyone will react to and</v>

903
00:39:05.981 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 3>then that keeps them famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

904
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like blowing air under a</v>
<v Speaker 3>feather.</v>

905
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:11.650
<v Speaker 3>It's hot air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

906
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:12.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

907
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.710
<v Speaker 3>kicking the guy out of her show for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for buying tickets and liking trump,</v>

908
00:39:17.711 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you go,</v>

909
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't kick him out of the show.</v>

910
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.630
<v Speaker 3>She just told him to get off the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

911
00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:23.440
<v Speaker 3>she told him I'll leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

912
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.950
<v Speaker 3>she's going to be the guy on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't watch the whole thing.</v>

913
00:39:26.951 --> 00:39:27.641
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

914
00:39:27.641 --> 00:39:28.510
<v Speaker 3>she brought the guy on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

915
00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:30.190
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not voting for Hillary,</v>

916
00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:31.024
<v Speaker 3>lead my show.</v>

917
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:38.330
<v Speaker 3>I think she was saying if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bu people were booing her because she</v>

918
00:39:38.381 --> 00:39:39.820
<v Speaker 3>was talking shit about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>

919
00:39:39.821 --> 00:39:42.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to put amy on blast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying like Lena Dunham,</v>

920
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had been had had an abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said that she goes,</v>

921
00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had had an abortion so I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>be with all the girls that I'd had</v>

922
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:51.640
<v Speaker 3>abortions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be on your side,</v>

923
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:52.650
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

924
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's overweight.</v>

925
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:58.000
<v Speaker 3>It's probably affecting our brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say things when they're not</v>

926
00:39:58.001 --> 00:39:59.590
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it,</v>

927
00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:01.950
<v Speaker 3>that's how I used to feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I used to feel too,</v>

928
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.380
<v Speaker 3>but like it feels like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a way to the business.</v>

929
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.720
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like that's the world she's in and</v>

930
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:12.740
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's conscious or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

931
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:16.180
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of playing to those people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I understand what she's saying,</v>

932
00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:17.650
<v Speaker 3>like if she's trying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

933
00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:21.010
<v Speaker 3>if they're trying to take away the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a woman to have an abortion and</v>

934
00:40:21.011 --> 00:40:25.840
<v Speaker 3>she's trying to align herself with those</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and she hasn't had an abortion,</v>

935
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:27.250
<v Speaker 3>that's a reasonable thing to say.</v>

936
00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not disagreeing with what she's</v>

937
00:40:29.921 --> 00:40:30.570
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

938
00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just pointing out that it seems to</v>

939
00:40:32.321 --> 00:40:35.470
<v Speaker 3>me that the way I was just coupling on</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he said,</v>

940
00:40:35.471 --> 00:40:39.880
<v Speaker 3>the way to be in the media these days is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say the most outrageous things to get</v>

941
00:40:39.881 --> 00:40:43.780
<v Speaker 3>the most activity on social media so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're still in the public eye.</v>

942
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.810
<v Speaker 3>I think these guys are scrubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think it is.</v>

943
00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 3>I think that guy's a mental scrub and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think this kind of way of talking about</v>

944
00:40:50.951 --> 00:40:53.680
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's antiquated and I think it's</v>

945
00:40:53.681 --> 00:40:55.800
<v Speaker 3>going to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that people just,</v>

946
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.900
<v Speaker 3>they gravitate towards it because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

947
00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just gossip news bullshit.</v>

948
00:41:01.361 --> 00:41:05.180
<v Speaker 3>So awesome that he wrote to himself like</v>
<v Speaker 3>such a dummy way to go.</v>

949
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.890
<v Speaker 3>Animation Point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exclamation point.</v>

950
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.020
<v Speaker 3>I should start doing that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good job,</v>

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.640
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like it feeling cynical because</v>

1044
00:45:11.641 --> 00:45:12.670
<v Speaker 3>you lost today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1045
00:45:12.671 --> 00:45:14.130

<v Speaker 3>that's not why I'm feeling cynical.</v>

1046
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Dehydration so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's have more coconut water.</v>

1047
00:45:18.001 --> 00:45:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you that you wanted to win</v>

1048
00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:20.930
<v Speaker 4>so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1049
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:21.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really did.</v>

1050
00:45:21.851 --> 00:45:23.710
<v Speaker 4>I really want it to be to beat you in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1051
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like more so than,</v>

1052
00:45:26.021 --> 00:45:27.490
<v Speaker 4>than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than uh,</v>

1053
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.270
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1054
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:31.120
<v Speaker 4>it reminded me of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was never super competitive.</v>

1055
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1056
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.330
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I played on sports teams my whole</v>

1057
00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.540
<v Speaker 4>adolescence and through high school and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

1058
00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:39.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>play and compete and everything,</v>

1059
00:45:39.311 --> 00:45:42.100
<v Speaker 4>but I was more competitive with family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1060
00:45:42.101 --> 00:45:43.290
<v Speaker 4>and stupid shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1061
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.020
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a new video game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and my sisters are playing it.</v>

1062
00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Then I was like fucking laser focused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this kind of reminded me of that,</v>

1063
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.700
<v Speaker 4>of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's because we're close that it</v>

1064
00:45:54.701 --> 00:45:56.650
<v Speaker 4>reminded me of like a sibling thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>where like,</v>

1065
00:45:56.651 --> 00:45:59.500
<v Speaker 4>I gotta beat fucking Bert at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's our next competition?</v>

1066
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Burt wants a rematch.</v>

1067
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it hurt?</v>

1068
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:05.910
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't involve fucking water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you that right now.</v>

1069
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.280
<v Speaker 4>But you are the water champ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a weird to not have water while</v>

1070
00:46:09.281 --> 00:46:10.750
<v Speaker 4>you're the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cham man.</v>

1071
00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.140
<v Speaker 4>Like my hydration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no explanation.</v>

1072
00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:16.920
<v Speaker 3>There's no explanation for my hydration</v>

1073
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:20.810
<v Speaker 4>explanation for my hydration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1074
00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.540
<v Speaker 4>it's like cutting the water was like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>vacation.</v>

1075
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Are you Muhammad Ali?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frustration with my hesitation on my</v>

1076
00:46:36.611 --> 00:46:38.860
<v Speaker 3>hydration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that Shit,</v>

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:41.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really was all about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>vacation</v>

1079
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.620
<v Speaker 4>and I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I followed that.</v>

1080
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:47.690
<v Speaker 4>What I was told pretty much to a t j</v>

<v Speaker 3>Bert?</v>

1085
00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.580
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you were kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing in the towel this morning when</v>

1086
00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:58.810

<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>

1089
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.110
<v Speaker 3>He did the long haul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>

1090
00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.160
<v Speaker 3>You did the longs tramp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But did the sprint,</v>

1091
00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.540
<v Speaker 3>the long strand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

1092
00:47:07.541 --> 00:47:12.541
<v Speaker 3>Long Strand DNA march.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you look back on like the last few</v>

1093
00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.120
<v Speaker 3>months?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking I could have tightened this</v>

1094
00:47:16.121 --> 00:47:17.410
<v Speaker 3>bitch up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of mistakes.</v>

1095
00:47:17.411 --> 00:47:18.430
<v Speaker 3>I made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five and one.</v>

1096
00:47:18.431 --> 00:47:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Jake Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no photo of him.</v>

1097
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:25.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fights and pri prime fighting eight.</v>

1098
00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:29.080
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's fighting it some smaller,</v>

1099
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1100
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.710
<v Speaker 1>it looks like he's got a good record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holla,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1103
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some dudes eliminate</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous amounts of their body weight.</v>

1104
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:46.270
<v Speaker 1>There's nobody better than this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>named glace and t bow who got popped by</v>

<v Speaker 1>He must've not cut weight recently.</v>

1113
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Which guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh by the way,</v>

1114
00:48:03.671 --> 00:48:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I can totally see that training for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and not cutting weight and be</v>

1115
00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:08.050
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1116
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.750
<v Speaker 1>my bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it does happen,</v>

1117
00:48:10.751 --> 00:48:12.340
<v Speaker 1>but you lose a shitload of money.</v>

1118
00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 1>We got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a bunch of them yesterday.</v>

1119
00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that great board last 30,</v>

1120
00:48:16.181 --> 00:48:19.660
<v Speaker 1>perceive one this weekend he was 30% of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his purse cause he was more than three</v>

1121
00:48:19.661 --> 00:48:22.720
<v Speaker 1>pounds over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has to give 30% of his purse to</v>

1122
00:48:22.721 --> 00:48:24.730
<v Speaker 1>his opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

1123
00:48:24.731 --> 00:48:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1124
00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:26.261
<v Speaker 1>When it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

1125
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 1>And he looked fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray Borg is a super talented guy,</v>

1126
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.290
<v Speaker 1>but that's a a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big amount of money to give to</v>

1127
00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:35.380
<v Speaker 1>your opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But three pounds at flyweight in</v>

1128
00:48:35.381 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot.</v>

1129
00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:40.450
<v Speaker 1>We'll heat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fighting at one 25 and Ray Wade</v>

1130
00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:43.600
<v Speaker 1>one 28 point something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of missteps.</v>

1131
00:48:43.601 --> 00:48:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I made 29 actually cause they gave him a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound over.</v>

1132
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.440
<v Speaker 1>They give you a pound to fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not a championship fight.</v>

1133
00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.690
<v Speaker 1>During a championship fight you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait on the nugget.</v>

1134
00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's one seven you have to wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>one seven you can't wait wants once.</v>

1135
00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.970
<v Speaker 1>It's actually exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1136
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:03.070
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a non championship fight you get a</v>

1137
00:49:03.071 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 1>pound play with how often does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I've been at a number of ways with</v>

1138
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:11.290
<v Speaker 1>you that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to just lose the underwear to</v>

1139
00:49:11.291 --> 00:49:13.240
<v Speaker 1>make weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that I've seen that happens.</v>

1140
00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:16.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's wet underwear on can two or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1141
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:19.630
<v Speaker 1>It could weigh very little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's enough.</v>

1142
00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 1>It's the tipping amount because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is one of those balance scales and</v>

1143
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.090
<v Speaker 1>just it's just a hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ounce,</v>

1144
00:49:25.091 --> 00:49:27.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sometimes if they,</v>

1145
00:49:27.551 --> 00:49:29.260
<v Speaker 1>if they're still over what you have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour,</v>

1146
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.710
<v Speaker 1>you have it depends on the commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you mean.</v>

1147
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.580
<v Speaker 1>It really depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on where you're at.</v>

1148
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:40.180
<v Speaker 1>They do different weigh now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do early Wayans the Wayans take</v>

1149
00:49:40.181 --> 00:49:42.640
<v Speaker 1>place early in the morning now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The day of the fight.</v>

1150
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The day before the fight day to recoup</v>

1151
00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 1>after you have to die.</v>

1152
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:53.560
<v Speaker 1>They started doing that after Duk Koo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim [inaudible] and duck,</v>

1153
00:49:53.561 --> 00:49:57.190
<v Speaker 1>who kim had this crazy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They changed a few things after that</v>

1154
00:49:57.191 --> 00:49:59.230
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing they changed is they stopped</v>

1155
00:49:59.231 --> 00:50:03.460
<v Speaker 1>doing 15 round fights and they brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>them down to 12 rounds and another thing</v>

1156
00:50:03.461 --> 00:50:05.470
<v Speaker 1>is they started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's when they started doing</v>

1157

<v Speaker 1>Dehydration fucks with your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1159
00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:10.840
<v Speaker 1>It fucks with your brain pretty</v>

1163
00:50:23.471 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a electrical current</v>

1164
00:50:26.471 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>through your body that relies</v>

1165
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.180
<v Speaker 3>on water to function at its best.</v>

1168
00:50:34.641 --> 00:50:37.550
<v Speaker 3>I was off for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body is not functioning correctly.</v>

1209
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:23.540
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I flew in an FAA 18 once with the blue</v>

1210
00:52:23.541 --> 00:52:25.340
<v Speaker 3>angels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a bit about it.</v>

1211
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:27.890
<v Speaker 3>I did in my act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking amazing.</v>

1212
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:28.911
<v Speaker 3>So crate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1213
00:52:28.911 --> 00:52:31.220

<v Speaker 3>Oh by God.</v>

1214
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Seven and a half saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1215
00:52:32.871 --> 00:52:35.210
<v Speaker 3>there was some actor before me did five</v>
<v Speaker 3>g's and I'm like,</v>

1216
00:52:35.211 --> 00:52:37.280
<v Speaker 3>fuck that pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I going to beat that guy.</v>

1217
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Let's ramp it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we went,</v>

1218
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:41.060
<v Speaker 3>we went pretty deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did that feel like?</v>

1219
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:42.860
<v Speaker 3>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a,</v>

1220
00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>an elevator door is closing in on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

1221
00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Like you see the darkness coming in from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left and the right.</v>

1222
00:52:49.251 --> 00:52:52.820
<v Speaker 3>Like literally you can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see your consciousness closing</v>

1223
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.841
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1224
00:52:53.841 --> 00:52:55.550
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do a thing called the hooking.</v>

1225
00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.010
<v Speaker 3>We hold on to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's straps,</v>

1226
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.700
<v Speaker 3>like you're all strapped in and you hold</v>
<v Speaker 3>onto your straps or the pilot would hold</v>

1227
00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:05.870
<v Speaker 3>onto the handle and you go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1228
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:06.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1229
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:11.290
<v Speaker 3>And you are literally forcing blood into</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain to stay conscious and just</v>

1230
00:53:11.291 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 3>the pilot through that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to,</v>

1231
00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:13.943
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1232
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.580
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy that there's something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pilot could do that could pass them</v>

1233
00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:16.990
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1234
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that I'd have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go hook,</v>

1235
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.160
<v Speaker 3>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hook.</v>

1236
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.430
<v Speaker 3>If I did another one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

1237
00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Speaker 3>we were fucking,</v>

1239
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.650

<v Speaker 8>how far off the ground but pretty low in</v>

1240
00:53:28.651 --> 00:53:33.090
<v Speaker 8>this canyon range.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That somewhere between San Diego and</v>

1241
00:53:33.091 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 8>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is that what it is?</v>

1242

<v Speaker 8>so it's this really crazy area where</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's all this blue angel test flight.</v>

1245
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.050
<v Speaker 8>It's like where they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they practice is this air force base out</v>

1246
00:53:49.051 --> 00:53:53.530
<v Speaker 8>there and it's where they do their test</v>
<v Speaker 8>Ron's and they drop things like if the</v>

1247
00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:56.250
<v Speaker 8>tests like where they would like drop</v>
<v Speaker 8>bombs I guess.</v>

1248
00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:01.490
<v Speaker 8>And you're flying through this like</v>
<v Speaker 8>small mountain range fucking nuts,</v>

1249
00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:04.530
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

<v Speaker 8>through these canyons and I heard him</v>
<v Speaker 8>doing it too.</v>

1272

<v Speaker 8>Fuck man.</v>

1274
00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.610

<v Speaker 8>that's when it's nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

1276
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:20.120

<v Speaker 8>there's like,</v>

1277
00:55:20.121 --> 00:55:25.121
<v Speaker 8>there's banking turns that they make</v>
<v Speaker 8>where there's so much panic just</v>

1278
00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:27.860
<v Speaker 8>watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The fact that they find spun around in a</v>

1279
00:55:27.861 --> 00:55:29.660
<v Speaker 8>circle,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they fly in tandem.</v>

1280
00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:32.420
<v Speaker 8>How fucking he fucking fly in war.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

1281

<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:38.260
<v Speaker 8>So these guys fly in war like this and</v>
<v Speaker 8>they go,</v>

1283
00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.000
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's hooking right now.</v>

1284

<v Speaker 8>That guy's doing that shit right now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's nuts bro.</v>

1285
00:55:43.851 --> 00:55:47.720
<v Speaker 8>I'm telling you it is like nothing I've</v>
<v Speaker 8>ever experienced physically and it just</v>

1286
00:55:47.721 --> 00:55:52.721
<v Speaker 8>makes you understand like the weird</v>
<v Speaker 8>demands that you've got these holes,</v>

1287
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:57.410
<v Speaker 8>your body has like a very narrow window</v>
<v Speaker 8>that it can operate in as far as like</v>

1288
00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.690
<v Speaker 8>atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as far as temperature,</v>

1289
00:55:59.691 --> 00:56:02.660
<v Speaker 8>as far as pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all those things are very narrow.</v>

1290
00:56:02.661 --> 00:56:04.820
<v Speaker 8>Like you're very,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're very vulnerable.</v>

1291
00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.640
<v Speaker 8>It's one of the reasons why fighting is</v>
<v Speaker 8>so interesting.</v>

1292
00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:10.310
<v Speaker 8>Like you take apart like this Ronda</v>
<v Speaker 8>Rousey fight for example,</v>

1293
00:56:10.311 --> 00:56:13.970
<v Speaker 8>you take a person that's obviously very</v>
<v Speaker 8>physically strong,</v>

1294
00:56:13.971 --> 00:56:17.450
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like of a female cage fighting champion</v>

1295
00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.570
<v Speaker 8>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you see her muscles and you see what she</v>

1296
00:56:20.571 --> 00:56:22.100
<v Speaker 8>can do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>throwing people around,</v>

1297
00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:26.440
<v Speaker 8>but you realize even a person it looks</v>
<v Speaker 8>like that is super vulnerable.</v>

1298
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:27.940
<v Speaker 8>All you have to do is get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bang.</v>

1299
00:56:27.941 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 8>Somebody hits you badly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hit you again.</v>

1300
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.940
<v Speaker 8>All of a sudden you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bang,</v>

1301
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:33.760
<v Speaker 8>they hit you again.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't respond and then you get</v>

1302
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:34.900
<v Speaker 8>knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

1303
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.030
<v Speaker 8>as tough as a person might think they</v>
<v Speaker 8>are is like in shape as a person might</v>

1304
00:56:40.031 --> 00:56:43.180
<v Speaker 8>think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you get in one of those Goddamn jets</v>

1305
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:47.710
<v Speaker 8>and you fly at seven and a half g's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you'd take one some crazy turns and your</v>

1306
00:56:47.711 --> 00:56:51.880
<v Speaker 8>body's literally like giving you got,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're going to go unconscious from the</v>

1307
00:56:51.881 --> 00:56:54.220
<v Speaker 8>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a makes you realize like,</v>

1308
00:56:54.221 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 8>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1312
00:57:01.871 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1318

<v Speaker 5>maybe 7,000 feet.</v>

1321
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:23.230
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>but you're so confident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you live in this bubble.</v>

1326
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:35.260
<v Speaker 5>Where nothing happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but up there I couldn't even navigate.</v>

1327
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:39.010
<v Speaker 5>Like I couldn't even traverse the</v>
<v Speaker 5>mountain a little bit to get within the</v>

1328
00:57:39.011 --> 00:57:41.890
<v Speaker 5>line that we need to do to ski down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I couldn't even walk through it.</v>

1329
00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:44.710
<v Speaker 5>So was like four foot powder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're literally like,</v>

00:57:53.291 --> 00:57:56.200
<v Speaker 5>they helped me get my board on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We start snowboarding and they're</v>

<v Speaker 5>telling us there's crevasses to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Did the bride to the Lens Cajun.</v>

1344
00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 6>I got to put this a beacon on you and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then when you got there begging</v>

1345
00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:25.810
<v Speaker 5>on you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're all good.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here we go.</v>

1347
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.580
<v Speaker 5>And so we start going and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for some reason I can't turn left.</v>

1348
00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:33.730
<v Speaker 5>Like I can still work perfectly fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can't turn it off.</v>

1349
00:58:33.731 --> 00:58:37.270
<v Speaker 5>There's so much powder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I noticed that I'm just floating to</v>

1350
00:58:37.271 --> 00:58:40.960
<v Speaker 5>the right away from his little fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>marks towards where there could be</v>

1351
00:58:40.961 --> 00:58:43.750
<v Speaker 5>avalanches are crevasses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like shit.</v>

1352
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.680
<v Speaker 5>And I'm thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like real vulnerability,</v>

1353
00:58:47.681 --> 00:58:50.080
<v Speaker 5>like going like I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't go lie,</v>

1354
00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:53.290
<v Speaker 5>I can't count for some reason it's too</v>
<v Speaker 5>much pattern for me to turn left.</v>

1355
00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:57.300
<v Speaker 5>So finally I just fucking cut it and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>start cutting hardcore left.</v>

1356
00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:58.090
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1357
00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:01.240
<v Speaker 5>time to go back right now I can't turn</v>
<v Speaker 5>right and I fucking,</v>

1358
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:03.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm facing face forward down the</v>
<v Speaker 5>mountain,</v>

1359
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:06.870
<v Speaker 5>cutting left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I see them in front of me am I,</v>

1360
00:59:06.871 --> 00:59:09.880
<v Speaker 5>I catch a nose and I fucking land face</v>
<v Speaker 5>first into the snow,</v>

1361
00:59:09.881 --> 00:59:12.100
<v Speaker 5>four feet and I'm under the snow.</v>

1362
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:14.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I go to push up and as I put my</v>

1363
00:59:14.771 --> 00:59:16.150
<v Speaker 5>arms forward,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just disappeared.</v>

1364
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:16.961
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing,</v>

1365
00:59:16.961 --> 00:59:19.930
<v Speaker 5>they don't touch anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just go into the snow and the no.</v>

1366
00:59:19.931 --> 00:59:22.580
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I immediately realized my</v>

1367
00:59:22.581 --> 00:59:23.810
<v Speaker 5>vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't remember the exact type,</v>
<v Speaker 5>900,</v>

1372
00:59:30.621 --> 00:59:35.621
<v Speaker 5>9,000 feet up a mountain and I'm the</v>
<v Speaker 5>last one on this line.</v>

1373
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.990
<v Speaker 5>No one saw me fall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When will they start looking for me?</v>

1374
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:41.030
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what will happen to me within that time.</v>

1375
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:44.240
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I start fucking panicking like</v>

1376
00:59:44.241 --> 00:59:47.900
<v Speaker 5>hardest shit and I'm trying to move and</v>
<v Speaker 5>flip myself at least open to my back and</v>

1377
00:59:47.901 --> 00:59:49.050
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't get,</v>

1378
00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:52.910
<v Speaker 5>I can't move at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I hear my dad in my head go told you</v>

1379

<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

1382
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.830
<v Speaker 5>and then this I was on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt this hand on the backs we all had</v>

1383

<v Speaker 5>like these harnesses on with a beacon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This hand pull my harness up and he's</v>

<v Speaker 5>Literally.</v>

1386
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 5>Like he's doing a handstand in the snow</v>
<v Speaker 5>gear everywhere.</v>

1387
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:15.020

<v Speaker 4>every time you do an adventure thing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>especially like when you,</v>

1397
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.890
<v Speaker 4>you realize how much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like nonchalantly you put your life in</v>

1398
01:00:32.891 --> 01:00:34.650
<v Speaker 4>people's hands and that thing is when</v>

1401
01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:38.711
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1402
01:00:38.711 --> 01:00:41.140
<v Speaker 4>this place does it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you realize it's just some guy,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know who fucking hangs out at that</v>

1406
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:52.870
<v Speaker 4>rollercoaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I even think about it in cars sometimes.</v>

1407
01:00:52.871 --> 01:00:55.770
<v Speaker 4>I know like a couple of comics that go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1408
01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:59.680
<v Speaker 4>I won't let somebody drive me anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I know a couple of guys that are</v>

1409
01:00:59.681 --> 01:01:01.150
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's allowed to drive me.</v>

1410
01:01:01.151 --> 01:01:01.671
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

1411
01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:04.230
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not letting just some fucking guy to</v>

1412
01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.590
<v Speaker 4>drive me.</v>

<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

1414
01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:11.140
<v Speaker 4>they're like almost panicked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then sometimes you feel that</v>

1415
01:01:11.141 --> 01:01:13.690
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you realize it when you have a fuck</v>

<v Speaker 4>in the rear view at you,</v>

<v Speaker 5>cause that's what I take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm used to that.</v>

1427
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind having a black hard</v>
<v Speaker 5>driving,</v>

1428
01:01:35.081 --> 01:01:37.070
<v Speaker 5>cause I feel like the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got a show for license on the side</v>

1429
01:01:37.071 --> 01:01:38.500

1434
01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:47.030
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he learned how to drive in</v>

<v Speaker 5>his country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let alone this one.</v>

1487
01:03:41.821 --> 01:03:43.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've never done something along these</v>

1488
01:03:43.981 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 7>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tom was like called me when he was like,</v>

1489
01:03:46.381 --> 01:03:48.150
<v Speaker 7>we're doing two in a row or you don't</v>
<v Speaker 7>have to carry this.</v>

1490
01:03:48.151 --> 01:03:49.410
<v Speaker 7>I'm not that funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>

1491
01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:59.280
<v Speaker 7>I like doing two permeable podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let me ask you this before I forget.</v>

1492
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:02.250
<v Speaker 7>Well what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what could you have done to get yourself</v>

1493
01:04:02.251 --> 01:04:03.850
<v Speaker 7>out of that snow?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1494
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:05.920
<v Speaker 7>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But a lot of people get trapped in the</v>

1495
01:04:05.921 --> 01:04:08.660
<v Speaker 7>snow like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is there a thing you're supposed to do?</v>

1496
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:11.310
<v Speaker 7>He's supposed to move the snow away from</v>
<v Speaker 7>your face and you have air.</v>

1497
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:14.070
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure there is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure you probably should start</v>

1498
01:04:14.071 --> 01:04:16.890
<v Speaker 7>packing snow down and around you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1499
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:20.610
<v Speaker 7>My camera man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kendall is a professional snowboarder</v>

1500
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:24.780
<v Speaker 7>and he um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he had a very similar experience.</v>

1501
01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:27.740
<v Speaker 7>We talked about it that night at a bar</v>
<v Speaker 7>and Switzerland and uh,</v>

1502
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.970
<v Speaker 7>he was telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was like one time he was flying</v>

1503
01:04:29.971 --> 01:04:31.860
<v Speaker 7>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was going through the tree lines.</v>

1504
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:34.440
<v Speaker 7>He went in for me to do an accent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was going through the tree lines and</v>

1505
01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:37.980
<v Speaker 7>he hit a tree and all the snow that was</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the tree buried him.</v>

1506
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:41.010
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he was here and he was upside down,</v>

1507
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:42.660
<v Speaker 7>upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he was in,</v>

1508
01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.270
<v Speaker 7>I guess it's called like a tree wells,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people who ski no more,</v>

1509
01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:49.290
<v Speaker 7>no more about this than I would,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but apparently what happens is no snow</v>

1510
01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:52.560
<v Speaker 7>falls around the tree at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then it's very,</v>

1511
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.410
<v Speaker 7>very light packed snow so you can get</v>
<v Speaker 7>buried in it.</v>

1512
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:57.510
<v Speaker 7>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said he,</v>

1513
01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:59.490
<v Speaker 7>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his back was fucked up but he was trying</v>

1514
01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:00.540
<v Speaker 7>to get out and he couldn't get out and</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was like,</v>

1515
01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:01.710
<v Speaker 7>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is how you die.</v>

<v Speaker 5>state and there were like 18 in this.</v>

1613
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:56.460
<v Speaker 5>I thought you were 11.</v>

1614
01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:01.880
<v Speaker 5>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1615
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:05.640
<v Speaker 5>I was 18</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could smoke cigarettes but you</v>

1616
01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:07.530
<v Speaker 5>couldn't smoke there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1617
01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.540
<v Speaker 5>and they brought me up in front of camp</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

1618
01:09:09.690 --> 01:09:10.680
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you seen Jesus?</v>

1619
01:09:10.681 --> 01:09:13.200
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw what was being real,</v>

1620
01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:16.800
<v Speaker 5>which is I think the PR,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Predominant Times that I'm funny as</v>

1621
01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:18.620
<v Speaker 5>what I'm trying to be sincere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

1622
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:20.400
<v Speaker 5>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw him in the shower today and the</v>

1623
01:09:20.401 --> 01:09:21.900
<v Speaker 5>fucking place fell apart and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1624
01:09:21.901 --> 01:09:23.400
<v Speaker 5>just sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1625
01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:26.070
<v Speaker 5>I did have a cool moment in the shower</v>
<v Speaker 5>where I was grateful.</v>

1626
01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:27.390
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you find why Jesus</v>

1627
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:29.370
<v Speaker 8>when you're naked?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why does it Jesus has to come?</v>

1628
01:09:29.371 --> 01:09:31.950
<v Speaker 8>When you were in your tie with your</v>
<v Speaker 8>shoes tied,</v>

1629
01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:34.230
<v Speaker 8>you should be able to be aroused and see</v>
<v Speaker 8>why not.</v>

1630
01:09:34.231 --> 01:09:38.760
<v Speaker 8>You should be like about to come and you</v>
<v Speaker 8>see Jesus and you clamp down to your</v>

1631
01:09:38.761 --> 01:09:40.500
<v Speaker 8>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like you're trying to choke it to death.</v>

1632
01:09:40.501 --> 01:09:44.700
<v Speaker 8>Stop the come from coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So you don't want to be disrespectful,</v>

1633
01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:45.810
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then you go,</v>

1634
01:09:45.811 --> 01:09:47.250
<v Speaker 8>I love you Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then he let it go.</v>

1635
01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.500
<v Speaker 8>What if Jesus said it's okay son,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can come.</v>

1636
01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.980
<v Speaker 8>They'd be a big time believer when</v>
<v Speaker 8>people are angry.</v>

1637
01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.840
<v Speaker 8>Listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>was talking about this right now.</v>

1638
01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:58.590
<v Speaker 8>Angry cause you're not supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 8>talking about Jesus and pleasure.</v>

1639
01:09:58.860 --> 01:09:59.730
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What if,</v>

1640
01:09:59.731 --> 01:10:02.190
<v Speaker 8>what if Jesus came to you in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 8>of a massage?</v>

1641
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:05.670
<v Speaker 8>You're lying on your stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No sexual organs are involved.</v>

1642
01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:09.600
<v Speaker 8>But when someone has like oil on your</v>
<v Speaker 8>end there on your back and they're</v>

1643
01:10:09.601 --> 01:10:13.530
<v Speaker 8>rubbing their elbow across the spine,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just loose and everything,</v>

1644
01:10:13.531 --> 01:10:15.370
<v Speaker 8>I'd be know that feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>ah,</v>

1645
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:20.840
<v Speaker 8>arguably there's times where that feels</v>
<v Speaker 8>as good as coming,</v>

1646
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.830
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Arguably right?</v>

1647
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:24.780
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but why is that okay?</v>

1648
01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:29.220
<v Speaker 8>Cause it's not sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like what weird rules do we have about</v>

1649
01:10:29.221 --> 01:10:33.240
<v Speaker 8>touching each other where you can lay</v>
<v Speaker 8>down on your stomach and some lady that</v>

1650
01:10:33.241 --> 01:10:38.241
<v Speaker 8>you don't know can rub her back on like</v>
<v Speaker 8>rubber elbow rather deep into your back.</v>

1651
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:42.930
<v Speaker 8>And it feels amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're rubbing your feet incredible.</v>

1652
01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:46.050
<v Speaker 8>Someone rubs your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh I feel so good.</v>

1653
01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:49.500

<v Speaker 8>like Dick good.</v>

1744
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.070

1842
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.940
<v Speaker 3>he always goes out of his way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like,</v>

1843
01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:18.150
<v Speaker 3>look dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fucking $2 meet me in the</v>

1844
01:18:18.151 --> 01:18:19.090
<v Speaker 3>alleyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1845
01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.430
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1846
01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:23.220
<v Speaker 3>but it's just fun to call a guy a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1847
01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:28.410
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of accept the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I was thinking that we</v>

1848
01:18:28.411 --> 01:18:30.900
<v Speaker 3>were talking about earlier about this a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda Rousey thing.</v>

1849
01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why people are so mean.</v>

1850
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.530
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always going to be like a</v>

1851
01:18:37.531 --> 01:18:42.531
<v Speaker 3>certain backlash from someone who tries</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be extraordinary because it makes us</v>

1852
01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.800
<v Speaker 3>feel like weak and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1853
01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:53.490
<v Speaker 3>and lazy and comparison and like not as</v>
<v Speaker 3>ambitious.</v>

1854
01:18:53.491 --> 01:18:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone wants to be the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>right at anything,</v>

1855
01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:58.800
<v Speaker 3>if someone's true claims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the best.</v>

1856
01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:02.040
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's conor mcgregor or whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Ronda Rousey like that,</v>

1857
01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:07.190
<v Speaker 3>that felt rushed to make it to number</v>
<v Speaker 3>one scares a lot of us.</v>

1858
01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it makes you look at what your,</v>

1859
01:19:10.321 --> 01:19:12.840
<v Speaker 3>what extent you're willing to go to for</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want to achieve.</v>

1860
01:19:12.841 --> 01:19:16.860
<v Speaker 3>And then it makes you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I actually doing things like</v>

1861
01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:19.830
<v Speaker 3>fulfilling my own potential?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what those moments do.</v>

1862
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.180
<v Speaker 3>And you won't be going to if it goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

1863
01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:27.210
<v Speaker 3>like way more than you want to punish</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone else for anything else.</v>

1864
01:19:27.211 --> 01:19:28.140
<v Speaker 3>I've gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes wrong.</v>

1865
01:19:28.141 --> 01:19:30.620
<v Speaker 3>So then let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's put this in perspective cause I</v>

1866
01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.130
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1867
01:19:32.190 --> 01:19:34.380
<v Speaker 3>I've dumped talking about friends of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine,</v>

1868
01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:38.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm not calling people out at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I saw Kevin Hart today on CNN</v>

1869
01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:42.300
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't about comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about how his job is now</v>

1870
01:19:42.301 --> 01:19:44.790
<v Speaker 3>to inspire people to be better and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1871
01:19:44.791 --> 01:19:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's odd that I would hear Kevin talk</v>

1872
01:19:46.861 --> 01:19:50.610
<v Speaker 3>like that because he is funny as shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what he's really good at is</v>

1873
01:19:50.611 --> 01:19:51.600
<v Speaker 3>being fucking hilarious.</v>

1874
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:55.440
<v Speaker 3>But apparently is like a fist fitness</v>
<v Speaker 3>guru and like he's like a,</v>

1875
01:19:55.441 --> 01:19:57.300
<v Speaker 3>he's on a different level now and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>

1876
01:19:57.330 --> 01:19:59.400
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the level where people start to</v>

1877
01:19:59.401 --> 01:20:02.550
<v Speaker 3>fucking like what they did with amy or</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the,</v>

1878
01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.710
<v Speaker 3>you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or what they did with Dane is like you</v>

1879
01:20:04.711 --> 01:20:08.820
<v Speaker 3>see a comic get bigger than that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden like slip up once</v>

1880
01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:10.980
<v Speaker 3>and we'll fucking eat your lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1881
01:20:10.981 --> 01:20:13.200
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1882
01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:17.270
<v Speaker 3>it's like you want to celebrate the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that take the risk to climb to</v>

1883
01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:19.910
<v Speaker 3>the highest mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you want a mock them if they meet</v>

1884
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.650
<v Speaker 3>they fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's oftentimes not the same people</v>

1885
01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.650
<v Speaker 3>that are mocking them like we're all</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing.</v>

1886
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:30.300
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously I have zero animosity towards</v>

1887
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Ronda Rousey and a hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>admiration for what she stands for as a</v>

1888
01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:37.390
<v Speaker 3>competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like which she tried to do and what she</v>

1889
01:20:37.410 --> 01:20:40.020
<v Speaker 3>accomplished and the coming back thing.</v>

1890
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:43.020
<v Speaker 3>So I don't experience it on the negative</v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

1891
01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.920
<v Speaker 3>but the on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that do though,</v>

1892
01:20:46.921 --> 01:20:49.770
<v Speaker 3>the people that feel like they have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>free shot to go at,</v>

1893
01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:52.080
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's enough of them that it makes a</v>

1894
01:20:52.081 --> 01:20:54.480
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even if all the same people</v>

1895
01:20:54.481 --> 01:20:57.480
<v Speaker 3>appreciate you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you win or lose the perspective</v>

1896
01:20:57.481 --> 01:21:01.920
<v Speaker 3>shifts because so many more people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you wouldn't normally narrowly be</v>

1897
01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:06.190
<v Speaker 3>in contact with who are negative are</v>
<v Speaker 3>mocking it and,</v>

1898
01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.081
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1899
01:21:07.081 --> 01:21:10.880
<v Speaker 3>and really like being like absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>vicious about their,</v>

1900
01:21:10.881 --> 01:21:15.881
<v Speaker 3>the criticism and the way like trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>knock you down when you're already down.</v>

1901
01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.440
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a matter of it being</v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate or funny,</v>

1902
01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.980
<v Speaker 3>which you're going to always have that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to always have people that,</v>

1903
01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:24.620
<v Speaker 3>that crack jokes and make fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always gonna exist,</v>

1904
01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this,</v>

1905
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:29.390
<v Speaker 3>there's this viciousness of attacking</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody when they're there,</v>

1906
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:31.290
<v Speaker 3>there's some venom and everything.</v>

1907
01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:36.290
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of me wonders like I go</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that like cobb never been cool with</v>

1908
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:39.480
<v Speaker 3>self promotion as well as made me feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable.</v>

1909
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.300
<v Speaker 3>But I've seen people in our business</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are very cool with it.</v>

1910
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:43.051
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1911
01:21:43.051 --> 01:21:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Hart is a master at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1912
01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.400
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1913
01:21:47.401 --> 01:21:49.230
<v Speaker 3>he knows what he's doing and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1914
01:21:49.231 --> 01:21:51.630
<v Speaker 3>very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart guy.</v>

1915
01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.780
<v Speaker 3>He's very smart on many levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the,</v>

1916
01:21:54.781 --> 01:21:57.100
<v Speaker 3>at the ID I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Kevin would,</v>

1917
01:21:57.150 --> 01:21:59.300
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin would not say he's,</v>

1918
01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:04.170
<v Speaker 3>he's aspiring to be a mogul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's aspiring to surpass not just being</v>

1919
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:06.660
<v Speaker 3>an entertainer but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to being a culture,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't talked to him and</v>

1946
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.150

01:23:23.021 --> 01:23:24.160
<v Speaker 7>bought Jordan's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't like,</v>

1955
01:23:24.161 --> 01:23:26.620
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know you didn't play basketball</v>
<v Speaker 7>and Jordans and uh,</v>

1956
01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.040
<v Speaker 7>they put them on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1957
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:31.690
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the big thing in that light life</v>

1958
01:23:31.691 --> 01:23:33.370
<v Speaker 7>lesson here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What are you talking about?</v>

1959
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:35.530
<v Speaker 7>It's this when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you're black,</v>

1960
01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:37.181
<v Speaker 7>you black.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1961
01:23:37.181 --> 01:23:38.260
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but this is the rule.</v>

1962
01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:40.870
<v Speaker 7>You don't win.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Jordans are not meant for white</v>

1963
01:23:40.871 --> 01:23:41.704
<v Speaker 7>guys.</v>

1964
01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:45.400
<v Speaker 7>Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tommy,</v>

1965
01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:46.300
<v Speaker 7>Tommy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm drunk already.</v>

1966
01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.130
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1967
01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:50.950
<v Speaker 7>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you're black,</v>

1968
01:23:50.951 --> 01:23:52.150
<v Speaker 7>you play basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 7>basketball,</v>

1969
01:23:52.151 --> 01:23:53.650
<v Speaker 7>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like shitty shoes.</v>

1970
01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:56.470
<v Speaker 7>But when you're in Jordans are meant for</v>
<v Speaker 7>like going out.</v>

1971
01:23:56.650 --> 01:23:58.540
<v Speaker 7>Jordan's wear like nice shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't wear them on the basketball</v>

1972
01:23:58.541 --> 01:23:59.740
<v Speaker 7>court.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the rule.</v>

1973
01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.230
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I bought a pair of Jordan's thinking I'd</v>

1974
01:24:02.231 --> 01:24:03.880
<v Speaker 7>go play basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're the best basketball shoes.</v>

1975
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.890
<v Speaker 7>That's not the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So when you buy Jordans,</v>

1976
01:24:05.891 --> 01:24:09.120
<v Speaker 7>they come into Jordan bag that'll just</v>
<v Speaker 7>come in like a footlocker bag to coming</v>

1977
01:24:09.121 --> 01:24:12.880
<v Speaker 7>to Jordan bag.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kevin Hart was in a mall and he saw me</v>

1978
01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:16.540
<v Speaker 7>and my buddy croix walking through the</v>
<v Speaker 7>mall and I had a Jordan bag and Kevin</v>

1979
01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:21.210
<v Speaker 7>came up and he grabbed my Jordan bag</v>
<v Speaker 7>from behind my back and he was give to</v>

1980
01:24:21.211 --> 01:24:23.630
<v Speaker 7>have Jordans.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I turned around and all I saw was a</v>

1981
01:24:23.631 --> 01:24:24.464
<v Speaker 7>skin color.</v>

1982
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:28.080
<v Speaker 7>I didn't see Kevin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I went and I screamed and Kevin's</v>

1983
01:24:28.081 --> 01:24:29.980
<v Speaker 7>saw the racism in my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

1984
01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:30.873
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bert.</v>

1985
01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:32.711
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sorry,</v>

1986
01:24:32.711 --> 01:24:34.180
<v Speaker 7>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know it was you.</v>

1987
01:24:34.181 --> 01:24:36.070
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was just some black kid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was like,</v>

1988
01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:39.550
<v Speaker 7>birds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but use that racism or you'd being</v>

1989
01:24:39.551 --> 01:24:43.660
<v Speaker 7>robbed by someone who could probably run</v>
<v Speaker 7>faster than you.</v>

1990
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:46.990
<v Speaker 7>Fuck how has that racism.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But anyway,</v>

1991
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:49.960
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I wasn't trying to say gimme them.</v>

1992
01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:52.180
<v Speaker 7>Jordan Jordan's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he grabbed the bag and shook it and now</v>

1993
01:24:52.190 --> 01:24:53.290
<v Speaker 7>I freaked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>

1994
01:24:53.291 --> 01:24:56.290
<v Speaker 7>I jolted like a shark in the water too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If that was a Chinese guy,</v>

1995
01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.490
<v Speaker 7>he'd be shitting your pants.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1996
01:24:57.670 --> 01:24:59.550
<v Speaker 7>If somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if they had been role reversed,</v>

1997
01:24:59.551 --> 01:25:01.810
<v Speaker 7>if he had done that to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a good chance that you'd gotten</v>

1998
01:25:01.811 --> 01:25:05.660
<v Speaker 7>punched or gone viral on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a whole lot though.</v>

1999
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.480
<v Speaker 7>Definitely punched somebody if they</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't expect it.</v>

2000
01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:10.960
<v Speaker 7>Like you know how sometimes you just</v>
<v Speaker 7>catch someone and they're already on</v>

2001
01:25:10.961 --> 01:25:12.280
<v Speaker 7>seven and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey dude,</v>

<v Speaker 7>situation where someone cuts you off and</v>

<v Speaker 7>you just get so much more mad than you</v>
<v Speaker 7>normally would get to know what you</v>

2009
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:38.020
<v Speaker 7>Where did this come from?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I had to react.</v>

2010
01:25:38.021 --> 01:25:40.270
<v Speaker 7>Obviously this person's an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is a bad move,</v>

2011
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.810
<v Speaker 7>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is it that gets you to seven so</v>

2012

<v Speaker 7>You can get it everywhere.</v>

2014
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:51.700
<v Speaker 7>When I drive out where you live or where</v>
<v Speaker 7>I live or where Tommy lives,</v>

2015
01:25:51.701 --> 01:25:54.370

<v Speaker 5>I'm a little short with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>they're always very much downplaying it,</v>

2037
01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:36.350
<v Speaker 5>but I'll feel bad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2038
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:37.570
<v Speaker 5>I had a fight with a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2039
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:40.610
<v Speaker 5>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a car driver that drove me from the</v>

2040
01:26:40.611 --> 01:26:43.970
<v Speaker 5>airport in front of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like not a fist fight,</v>

2041
01:26:43.971 --> 01:26:46.490

<v Speaker 5>because he was late.</v>

2042
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:48.260
<v Speaker 5>He was like 30 minutes late to pick me</v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

2043
01:26:48.261 --> 01:26:50.240
<v Speaker 5>And then when he did show up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was at the wrong terminal.</v>

2044
01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:53.510
<v Speaker 5>And then when he did get me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he blamed it on me for not telling him</v>

2045
01:26:53.511 --> 01:26:54.500
<v Speaker 5>where I was landing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2046
01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:56.300
<v Speaker 5>that's not my job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he got,</v>

2047
01:26:56.301 --> 01:26:57.590
<v Speaker 5>when I dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he dropped me off,</v>

2048
01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:59.930
<v Speaker 5>he got mad at me because I didn't speak</v>
<v Speaker 5>to him the whole ride home.</v>

<v Speaker 5>he</v>

2051
01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.830
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you really want to get to know you?</v>

2052
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.610
<v Speaker 5>I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got out and I go,</v>

<v Speaker 5>not the best service I've ever had.</v>

2054

<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

01:27:14.871 --> 01:27:16.700
<v Speaker 5>it was a little disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not speaking to me.</v>

2056
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:17.983
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

<v Speaker 5>I think cause you didn't talk to me the</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole Rod.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's disrespectful.</v>

2059
01:27:20.751 --> 01:27:22.670
<v Speaker 5>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not my fucking job to entertain</v>

2062
01:27:25.671 --> 01:27:28.190
<v Speaker 5>conversation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I realized I'm having this fight</v>

2063
01:27:28.191 --> 01:27:30.440
<v Speaker 5>with this guy in front of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anything about him.</v>

2064
01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.930
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

2068
01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.510
<v Speaker 5>I had 20 bucks in my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

2069
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.411
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just so you know,</v>

2070
01:27:39.411 --> 01:27:41.120
<v Speaker 5>that wasn't the best experience I've had</v>
<v Speaker 5>or whatever.</v>

2071
01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.940
<v Speaker 5>And then I had the 20 bucks in my hand</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was like sort of disrespectful</v>

2072
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:45.680
<v Speaker 5>and then we sort of going back and</v>
<v Speaker 5>forth.</v>

2073
01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.760
<v Speaker 5>Then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you,</v>

2074
01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm not giving this to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then in a weird way I went bird give</v>

<v Speaker 5>murder your family.</v>

2076
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.711
<v Speaker 5>And so I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Take it where even,</v>

2078
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:55.580

<v Speaker 5>I apologize.</v>

2079
01:27:56.110 --> 01:27:58.310
<v Speaker 5>I sh I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is the weird part about my</v>

2080
01:27:58.311 --> 01:27:59.690
<v Speaker 5>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is what I started this whole</v>

2081
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.880
<v Speaker 5>fucking talk about is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that I start going,</v>

2082
01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.510
<v Speaker 5>hey burt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how important in this fucking spectrum</v>

2083
01:28:05.511 --> 01:28:09.320
<v Speaker 5>of life is it that this guy is throat?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How often have you been 30 minutes late?</v>

2084
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:12.230
<v Speaker 5>Helps me to be 30 minutes late and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe got an attitude because you were</v>

2085
01:28:12.231 --> 01:28:13.041
<v Speaker 5>defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2086
01:28:13.041 --> 01:28:14.870
<v Speaker 5>Maybe this guy was as a cuckold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2087
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:16.820
<v Speaker 5>That's what I thought about today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you were late.</v>

2088
01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:22.060
<v Speaker 5>I was at least two minutes late.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ran here to no fucking avail.</v>

2089
01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:23.630
<v Speaker 5>It was close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should,</v>

2090
01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.100
<v Speaker 5>Uber driver dropped me off in front of</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

2091
01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:25.741
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2092
01:28:25.741 --> 01:28:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm mad at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reality of people talking to</v>

2093
01:28:28.001 --> 01:28:33.001
<v Speaker 1>each other is we it comment exchanges</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes and things get started like</v>

2094
01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:36.790
<v Speaker 1>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something goes wrong with him and</v>

2095
01:28:36.791 --> 01:28:39.520
<v Speaker 1>he shows up late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your interaction with him has</v>

2096
01:28:39.521 --> 01:28:42.190
<v Speaker 1>already unbalanced because you expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to be apologetic.</v>

2097
01:28:42.191 --> 01:28:43.900
<v Speaker 1>But how could he really apologize?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2098
01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>

2099
01:28:45.311 --> 01:28:48.220
<v Speaker 1>So now I know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're that guy who doesn't take his job</v>

2100
01:28:48.221 --> 01:28:51.340
<v Speaker 1>at seriously and you're gonna drive me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to put my headphone sets</v>

2101
01:28:51.341 --> 01:28:54.640
<v Speaker 1>in and he's mad at you that you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of things going on</v>

2102
01:28:54.641 --> 01:28:55.091
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2103
01:28:55.091 --> 01:28:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if he showed up on time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same guy and you would have had a</v>

2104
01:28:59.111 --> 01:28:59.944
<v Speaker 1>great old time.</v>

2105
01:29:00.330 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 5>Maybe there was a where he's driving</v>

2106
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:04.570
<v Speaker 7>and my headsets are in and they're</v>
<v Speaker 7>really good noise reduction headsets.</v>

2107
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:06.960

<v Speaker 7>Maybe he was driving.</v>

2108
01:29:06.961 --> 01:29:07.830
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey man,</v>

2252
01:35:02.781 --> 01:35:05.870

01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:00.950
<v Speaker 10>unless Tom's five 11 I mean that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's a chance.</v>

2296
01:37:01.670 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 10>If Tom's five 11 I got a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That'll mean he'd win the bet for most</v>

2297
01:37:06.381 --> 01:37:09.470
<v Speaker 10>loss of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but they wouldn't both be under obese.</v>

2298
01:37:10.730 --> 01:37:15.510
<v Speaker 10>So fucking burt would have to</v>
<v Speaker 10>you guys,</v>

2299
01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:17.760
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you haven't dealt with this kind of like</v>

2300
01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:21.170
<v Speaker 10>backlash until you've dealt with it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You haven't dealt with it.</v>

2301
01:37:21.170 --> 01:37:26.030
<v Speaker 10>That guy who killed the lion in Zimbabwe</v>
<v Speaker 10>or Zaire,</v>

2302
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:29.090
<v Speaker 10>one of those places,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Africa</v>

2303
01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:35.330
<v Speaker 10>got on him for killing Chutney until you</v>
<v Speaker 10>find out,</v>

2304
01:37:35.331 --> 01:37:37.760
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's 80 80 80 lions get killed every</v>

2305
01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.810
<v Speaker 10>year.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They've got to keep the population down</v>

2306
01:37:38.811 --> 01:37:41.030
<v Speaker 10>and they start killing babies,</v>
<v Speaker 10>human babies.</v>

2307
01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:44.780
<v Speaker 10>But nobody cares about that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So this fucking dentist in Rhode Island</v>

2308
01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:47.840
<v Speaker 10>has to face death threats all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You don't know what it's like to get a</v>

2309
01:37:47.841 --> 01:37:51.830
<v Speaker 10>fucking he rage against shoe and these</v>
<v Speaker 10>people are coming at me and my phone</v>

2310
01:37:51.831 --> 01:37:53.690
<v Speaker 10>calls my texts.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>

2311
01:37:53.691 --> 01:37:54.620
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>first of all,</v>

2312
01:37:54.621 --> 01:37:57.750
<v Speaker 10>I can't thread with a flip phone.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So every test comes in new.</v>

2313
01:37:57.930 --> 01:37:59.100
<v Speaker 10>They ask questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what does that mean?</v>

2314
01:37:59.101 --> 01:38:02.360
<v Speaker 10>I have to delete my texts after awhile</v>
<v Speaker 10>because I have to make room for once.</v>

2315
01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.380
<v Speaker 10>So you've got some,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Laura's saying,</v>

2316
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:06.360

<v Speaker 10>Football,</v>
<v Speaker 10>European football.</v>

2318
01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:12.870
<v Speaker 10>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I can't do this.</v>

2319
01:38:12.871 --> 01:38:13.890
<v Speaker 10>I can't deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Listen to me.</v>

2320
01:38:13.891 --> 01:38:18.891
<v Speaker 10>I'm fucking flustered.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's very possible that he's,</v>

2321
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:23.580
<v Speaker 10>that he's under height.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Barring that,</v>

2322
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:26.370
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I can't be here for this.</v>

2323
01:38:26.371 --> 01:38:28.620
<v Speaker 10>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I can't be here with them coming after</v>

2324
01:38:28.621 --> 01:38:30.060
<v Speaker 10>me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I gotta get Outta here.</v>

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:34.110
<v Speaker 10>Hilarious man.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.</v>

2326
01:38:34.111 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 10>And I got to get away from this until I</v>
<v Speaker 10>could figure out what to do.</v>

2327
01:38:40.110 --> 01:38:41.330
<v Speaker 10>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's what I gotta do.</v>

2328
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:44.210
<v Speaker 10>That's what I gotta I gotta get the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 10>away from this.</v>

2329
01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:48.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my answer.</v>

2331
01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Anybody wants to listen to the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it or all of it?</v>

2332
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Just fears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skeptic tanks.</v>

2333
01:39:00.431 --> 01:39:03.010
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing it all the time.</v>

2334
01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:05.650
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I recommend the Henry Rollins one,</v>

2335
01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:06.430
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2336
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:09.790
<v Speaker 3>burt scoffed at the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hetero is different than I am.</v>

2337
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:12.910
<v Speaker 3>Extremely dismissive of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck off.</v>

2338
01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.400
<v Speaker 3>And it was insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a gang of them.</v>

2339
01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Dave Smith is a great one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2340
01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:18.371
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best one.</v>

2341
01:39:18.371 --> 01:39:20.170
<v Speaker 3>The best ones running of the bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2342
01:39:20.171 --> 01:39:22.910
<v Speaker 3>that's a great one to getting great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One's got a lot of great ones already.</v>

2343
01:39:22.930 --> 01:39:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Has a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good podcasts going to run off.</v>

2344
01:39:26.050 --> 01:39:27.610
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna run off the map right now for</v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

2345
01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:28.540
<v Speaker 3>He was just good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>

2346
01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:29.740
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He needs to,</v>

2347
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:31.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he thinks he needs to,</v>

2348
01:39:31.851 --> 01:39:32.770
<v Speaker 3>he needs to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>

2349
01:39:32.771 --> 01:39:37.690
<v Speaker 3>what I love about what Ari's doing is</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's living his life 100% on his terms.</v>

2350
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:40.690
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing it by anybody else's</v>
<v Speaker 3>standards and he does.</v>

2351
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:45.490
<v Speaker 3>He's doing the exact what I think the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best thing at comic can do if you makes</v>

2352
01:39:45.491 --> 01:39:50.491
<v Speaker 3>it like once you make it like relax and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just just have fun and be yourself and</v>

2353
01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:53.380
<v Speaker 3>only do the things you want to do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't let him suck in and nonsense.</v>

2354
01:39:53.381 --> 01:39:54.910
<v Speaker 3>But you've been on both sides of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fence.</v>

2355
01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:55.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2356
01:39:55.691 --> 01:39:59.290
<v Speaker 3>The fear factor was like post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about post rarely.</v>

2357
01:39:59.291 --> 01:40:00.310
<v Speaker 3>Pre family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2358
01:40:00.311 --> 01:40:01.660
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2359
01:40:01.661 --> 01:40:03.850
<v Speaker 3>that's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if he had a family it would be</v>

2360
01:40:03.851 --> 01:40:07.480
<v Speaker 3>totally different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he or even if even considered having</v>

2361
01:40:07.481 --> 01:40:09.550
<v Speaker 3>one or even a girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be a different thing.</v>

2362
01:40:09.551 --> 01:40:14.551
<v Speaker 3>But he's been tied down the past and</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now what Ari's enjoying is like</v>

2363
01:40:15.341 --> 01:40:17.380
<v Speaker 3>creating stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing standup,</v>

2364
01:40:17.381 --> 01:40:22.381
<v Speaker 3>doing his podcast and just enjoying life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and enhancing his perspective and taking</v>

2365
01:40:22.631 --> 01:40:23.464
<v Speaker 3>it all in.</v>

2366
01:40:23.690 --> 01:40:26.340
<v Speaker 3>And these trips that he goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2367
01:40:26.410 --> 01:40:29.440
<v Speaker 3>he's like orchestrating them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to see things he wants to,</v>

2368
01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:32.620
<v Speaker 3>he wants to absorb experiences from</v>
<v Speaker 3>other parts of the world.</v>

2369
01:40:32.630 --> 01:40:35.650
<v Speaker 3>And it's all enhancing his standup too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's very,</v>

2370
01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:38.860
<v Speaker 3>very accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I say this as I've said this from my</v>

2371
01:40:38.861 --> 01:40:40.540
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2372
01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:44.180
<v Speaker 3>as probably an expert in world travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would tell you our,</v>

2373
01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:46.420
<v Speaker 3>he does it better than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not even fucking around.</v>

2374
01:40:46.421 --> 01:40:50.590
<v Speaker 3>I've done it for seven years straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Ari went to Switzerland and,</v>

2375
01:40:50.650 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 3>and had a different life experience than</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did and went now mine was</v>

2376
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.810
<v Speaker 7>under production,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but like,</v>

2377
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:59.410
<v Speaker 7>he really does it great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wanted to pitch a show so bad,</v>

2378
01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:01.450
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that were,</v>

2379
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:02.350
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2380
01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.390
<v Speaker 7>Ari's disappearing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wanted to pitch a show.</v>

2381
01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:05.470
<v Speaker 7>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can I find Ari?</v>

2382
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:06.730
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can I find them?</v>

2383
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:07.960
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll be able to find him.</v>

2384
01:41:07.961 --> 01:41:10.600
<v Speaker 7>It's social media.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some time off the grid.</v>

2385
01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:14.230
<v Speaker 7>He's going off the fucking green.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Does that mean now he's going to go</v>

2386
01:41:14.231 --> 01:41:15.550
<v Speaker 7>where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2387
01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:18.540
<v Speaker 7>he's not bringing any laptop or anything</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>

2388
01:41:18.541 --> 01:41:21.100
<v Speaker 7>And he was disappearing for real.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Other people have phones.</v>

2389
01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:22.270
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>

2390
01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:23.231
<v Speaker 7>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2391
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:27.430
<v Speaker 7>Ari's in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Micronesia or some shit.</v>

2392

<v Speaker 7>Stuff's to get malaria.</v>

2393
01:41:30.610 --> 01:41:31.990
<v Speaker 7>The pills.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I told him to take,</v>

2394
01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.310
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do not take the pills.</v>

2395
01:41:33.311 --> 01:41:35.050
<v Speaker 7>Malaria pills.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cause we've talked about.</v>

2396
01:41:35.051 --> 01:41:37.540
<v Speaker 7>I thought I'd fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then you get the injections though.</v>

2397
01:41:37.630 --> 01:41:40.090
<v Speaker 7>I had a horrific experience on do</v>
<v Speaker 7>vaccinations,</v>

2398
01:41:40.091 --> 01:41:42.060
<v Speaker 7>vaccinations or just don't take them at</v>
<v Speaker 7>all.</v>

2399
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:43.840
<v Speaker 7>You're probably not gonna get malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

2400
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:47.930
<v Speaker 7>I thought a lot of people get malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No Africa they've talked to about to</v>

2401
01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:49.930
<v Speaker 7>about this on your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I took malaria pills.</v>

2402

<v Speaker 7>and this is esoteric.</v>

2431
01:43:01.650 --> 01:43:02.483
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I might as well hear this.</v>

2432
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:04.780
<v Speaker 7>I don't think I've ever said anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's esoteric,</v>

2433
01:43:04.781 --> 01:43:07.280
<v Speaker 7>but please continue.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You never said it way before you had to</v>

2434
01:43:07.281 --> 01:43:09.910
<v Speaker 7>join.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd never said this is esoteric.</v>

2435
01:43:09.911 --> 01:43:13.840
<v Speaker 7>This is so fucking high.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think I exactly know what esoteric</v>

2436
01:43:13.841 --> 01:43:14.710
<v Speaker 7>meats.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't either,</v>

<v Speaker 7>but it sounds good in a sentence.</v>

2438
01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.310
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what did it give me the exact definition</v>

2439
01:43:18.311 --> 01:43:20.110
<v Speaker 7>of esoteric.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2440
01:43:20.111 --> 01:43:21.850
<v Speaker 7>Pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2441
01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:24.190
<v Speaker 7>What do you think esoteric mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a out there.</v>

2442
01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.390
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

2443
01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:28.440
<v Speaker 7>Bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What would it,</v>

2444
01:43:28.441 --> 01:43:30.400
<v Speaker 7>what does it mean here?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Intended or likely to be understood by a</v>

2445
01:43:30.401 --> 01:43:32.590
<v Speaker 7>small number of people with specialized</v>
<v Speaker 7>knowledge?</v>

2446
01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:34.840
<v Speaker 7>This is esoteric.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is esoteric.</v>

2447
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:39.970
<v Speaker 7>So this one I'm about to say is that</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sotera intended or likely to be</v>

2448
01:43:39.971 --> 01:43:43.840
<v Speaker 7>understood by only a small number of</v>
<v Speaker 7>people with a specialized knowledge or</v>

2449
01:43:43.841 --> 01:43:47.200
<v Speaker 7>interest or an enlightened inner circle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Joe Rogan.</v>

2450
01:43:47.201 --> 01:43:50.230
<v Speaker 7>This is esoteric when I'm about to say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you will get this more than anyone.</v>

2451
01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:51.853
<v Speaker 7>That's a lot of pressure</v>

2452
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:55.580
<v Speaker 5>to hit that and then listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you'll get it.</v>

2453
01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:59.780
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how sometimes when you work</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a corporation and your paycheck is</v>

2454
01:43:59.781 --> 01:44:01.850
<v Speaker 5>dependent on that corporations approval?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not right now.</v>

2455
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:03.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the middle of an esoteric</v>
<v Speaker 5>statement.</v>

2456
01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.270
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2457
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:07.880
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you get out from under that</v>

2458
01:44:07.881 --> 01:44:10.670
<v Speaker 5>corporation and all of a sudden you are</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one that kind of,</v>

2459
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:11.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I forgot that I'm passionate about</v>

2464
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.260
<v Speaker 5>making video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2468
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.720

<v Speaker 5>I forgot that when I started this</v>

2469
01:44:26.721 --> 01:44:28.400
<v Speaker 5>business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2470
01:44:28.810 --> 01:44:30.680
<v Speaker 5>the goal wasn't to get under the</v>
<v Speaker 5>umbrella.</v>

2471
01:44:30.710 --> 01:44:33.860
<v Speaker 5>The goal was to be out there in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking ocean by myself in sailing my</v>

2472
01:44:33.861 --> 01:44:36.320
<v Speaker 5>own ship and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go take a left.</v>

2473
01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:37.190
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2474
01:44:37.530 --> 01:44:41.000
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this weight loss battle coincided with</v>

2475
01:44:41.001 --> 01:44:44.960
<v Speaker 5>my decision to stop being under contract</v>
<v Speaker 5>for travel channel.</v>

2476
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:47.030
<v Speaker 5>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was really lost.</v>

2477
01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.920
<v Speaker 5>I was really lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2478
01:44:49.130 --> 01:44:51.980
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know where I'd wear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know if I should just take</v>

2479
01:44:51.981 --> 01:44:54.420
<v Speaker 5>another television deal and it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or just do another deal with trial.</v>

2480
01:44:54.490 --> 01:44:56.360
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really didn't know what to do.</v>

2481
01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:57.411
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2482
01:44:57.411 --> 01:44:59.310
<v Speaker 5>this weight loss battle happened around</v>
<v Speaker 5>that time and it,</v>

2483
01:44:59.350 --> 01:45:02.780
<v Speaker 5>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like bill burst says poetically.</v>

2484
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:05.390
<v Speaker 5>I started taking on water and I felt</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking crazy about it.</v>

2485
01:45:05.630 --> 01:45:07.280
<v Speaker 5>And then one morning I woke up and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>went,</v>

2486
01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:11.090
<v Speaker 5>oh tom is having a lot of fun with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he's having fun him and push her</v>

2487
01:45:11.091 --> 01:45:13.940
<v Speaker 5>having a lot of fun and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to write a song and I wrote a</v>

2488
01:45:13.941 --> 01:45:15.170
<v Speaker 5>song and I wrote this stupid song.</v>

2489
01:45:15.170 --> 01:45:16.610
<v Speaker 5>I thought I looked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2490
01:45:16.670 --> 01:45:19.370
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was like I felt very creative and</v>

2491
01:45:19.371 --> 01:45:21.500
<v Speaker 5>I didn't feel like there was any</v>
<v Speaker 5>parameters on me anymore and I was like,</v>

2492
01:45:22.130 --> 01:45:23.720
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what my career is about.</v>

2493
01:45:23.721 --> 01:45:27.410
<v Speaker 5>My career is about doing everything I</v>
<v Speaker 5>like and everything I like and if you'd</v>

2494
01:45:27.411 --> 01:45:29.000
<v Speaker 5>like what I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come see me to stand up.</v>

2495
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 5>But if you don't like what I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like fuck it,</v>

2496
01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.080
<v Speaker 5>this is what I like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is my,</v>

2497
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:35.900
<v Speaker 5>this is my walk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is my walk through the woods.</v>

2498
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.330
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I know that,</v>

2499
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:41.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Tommy can attest to that</v>
<v Speaker 5>as much as you can because being under a</v>

2500
01:45:41.681 --> 01:45:43.550
<v Speaker 5>fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you ever were like under</v>

2501
01:45:43.551 --> 01:45:45.290
<v Speaker 5>anyone's control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's definitely a,</v>

2502
01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:47.360
<v Speaker 5>a corporate umbrella that you're under</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you're like,</v>

2503
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.910
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't show,</v>

2504
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:48.231
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2505
01:45:48.231 --> 01:45:50.390

<v Speaker 5>again?</v>

2508
01:45:54.261 --> 01:45:56.270
<v Speaker 5>all that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrote that song and it was like,</v>

2509
01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:57.740
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those moments where you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>

2510
01:45:57.980 --> 01:45:59.450
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get to do whatever the fuck I want to</v>

2511

2515
01:46:09.471 --> 01:46:11.780
<v Speaker 5>untethered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Being untethered is so cool.</v>

2516
01:46:11.781 --> 01:46:13.820
<v Speaker 5>As an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just get to do what you want to do.</v>

<v Speaker 7>alcohol for a little bit.</v>

2771
01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:27.860
<v Speaker 7>I got a business meeting at four.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2772
01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:30.920
<v Speaker 7>that's plenty of time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My only be slightly buzzed.</v>

2773
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:33.890
<v Speaker 7>I used to hear stories about chappelle</v>
<v Speaker 7>going into auditions.</v>

2774
01:54:33.891 --> 01:54:36.650
<v Speaker 7>Highest Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wish I had that confidence.</v>

2775
01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:37.401
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>part of me goes,</v>

2776
01:54:37.401 --> 01:54:39.980
<v Speaker 7>that's why he's so successful as he</v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't give a fuck.</v>

2777
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:41.120
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh for sure.</v>

2778
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:44.060
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well Dave is another example of a guy</v>

2779
01:54:44.061 --> 01:54:47.000
<v Speaker 7>just does things the way he wants to do</v>
<v Speaker 7>them and he knows,</v>

2780
01:54:47.070 --> 01:54:49.670
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he realized after a while,</v>

2781
01:54:49.671 --> 01:54:53.390
<v Speaker 7>I guess when you're a guy like him or a</v>
<v Speaker 7>guy like Ari that it doesn't benefit you</v>

2782
01:54:53.391 --> 01:54:55.970
<v Speaker 7>to have people influence you and tell</v>
<v Speaker 7>you what to do.</v>

2783
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.510
<v Speaker 7>Just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And all three of us are,</v>

2784
01:54:58.530 --> 01:55:00.320
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a great example of that.</v>

2785
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:03.290
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the best stuff I think that we've done</v>

2786
01:55:03.291 --> 01:55:05.600
<v Speaker 7>is stuff that we've done online where</v>
<v Speaker 7>you just,</v>

2787
01:55:05.630 --> 01:55:06.930
<v Speaker 7>you're yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2788
01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.870
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like your podcast with your wife,</v>

2789
01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:13.820
<v Speaker 7>that that podcast is you guys being</v>
<v Speaker 7>super fucking silly together like you</v>

<v Speaker 7>And Dan would have never happened if</v>

2792
01:55:21.081 --> 01:55:22.300
<v Speaker 7>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2793
01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:25.580
<v Speaker 7>had the reigns to it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If there was a bunch of people that were</v>

2794
01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.220
<v Speaker 7>executive producers and comedy central</v>
<v Speaker 7>had like 10 people behind the scenes</v>

2795
01:55:30.230 --> 01:55:34.010
<v Speaker 7>getting this Jean's comment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's high and tight?</v>

2796
01:55:34.370 --> 01:55:37.290
<v Speaker 7>What's high and tight and what do you</v>
<v Speaker 7>mean when you're glassing?</v>

2797
01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:41.390
<v Speaker 7>When there's no reason for you to do it</v>
<v Speaker 7>other than it's funny to you.</v>

2798
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:42.500
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>

2799
01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 7>That's the only I tried to tell</v>

2800
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.450
<v Speaker 5>people I get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you get asked a lot.</v>

2801
01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:46.313
<v Speaker 5>I get like</v>

2802
01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:50.290
<v Speaker 7>tons of emails.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't you get them from people go,</v>

2804
01:55:53.210 --> 01:55:54.620
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] told me one time.</v>

2806
01:55:58.130 --> 01:56:00.320
<v Speaker 7>Did you ever remember you're developing</v>
<v Speaker 7>a sitcom?</v>

2807
01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:02.630
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did that ever happen or did it go away?</v>

2808
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:03.900
<v Speaker 7>It went away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2809
01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.500
<v Speaker 7>can you please tell everyone what the</v>
<v Speaker 7>premise was?</v>

2810
01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:12.890
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm walking through Walmart and like</v>

2811
01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.690
<v Speaker 7>fucking Richmond,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Virginia and Tom Calls me,</v>

2812
01:56:16.730 --> 01:56:17.720
<v Speaker 7>we're talking about sit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>calm,</v>

2813
01:56:17.721 --> 01:56:18.554
<v Speaker 7>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he goes,</v>

2814
01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.660
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm developing like real serious.</v>

2815
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:23.780
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's your character?</v>

2816
01:56:23.781 --> 01:56:24.614
<v Speaker 7>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>me,</v>

2817
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:27.890
<v Speaker 7>I'm a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're a doctor.</v>

2818
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.903
<v Speaker 7>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2819
01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:30.300
<v Speaker 7>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lots of it.</v>

2820
01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:31.910
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't look like a doctor goes,</v>

2821
01:56:32.090 --> 01:56:32.923
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>

2822
01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:42.220
<v Speaker 7>But there was a twist to it</v>
<v Speaker 7>after they graduated last in medicine.</v>

2823
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:50.350
<v Speaker 7>So he's like essentially a dumb doctor</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tom going scalpel.</v>

2824
01:56:53.630 --> 01:56:56.780
<v Speaker 7>Not how it went.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2825
01:56:56.830 --> 01:57:01.010
<v Speaker 7>the idea of being a doctor was the best</v>
<v Speaker 7>prep is I've ever heard of a sitcom</v>

2826
01:57:01.011 --> 01:57:02.850
<v Speaker 7>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My fucking last doctor.</v>

2827
01:57:04.670 --> 01:57:07.820
<v Speaker 7>I could be a straight comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the look on your face,</v>

2828
01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:13.700
<v Speaker 7>you don't know what's going on over.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think I've ever,</v>

2829
01:57:17.181 --> 01:57:21.710
<v Speaker 7>how long did I laugh on the phone?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Really long and really hard to where I</v>

2830
01:57:21.711 --> 01:57:23.150
<v Speaker 7>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know what I'd done.</v>

2831
01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:26.353
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2832
01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:28.490
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've probably made me laugh harder</v>

2833
01:57:28.491 --> 01:57:32.300
<v Speaker 5>than anyone person that I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

2834
01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:36.710
<v Speaker 5>100% I do feel like everything has to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>a contest.</v>

2835
01:57:37.190 --> 01:57:38.090
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel,</v>

2836
01:57:38.091 --> 01:57:40.490
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like number one,</v>

2837
01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:43.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we do even the burt stuff,</v>

2838
01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:47.450
<v Speaker 5>we do it to make you laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like there's a part of me that</v>

2839
01:57:47.451 --> 01:57:50.360
<v Speaker 5>wants to make you laugh all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seriously.</v>

2840
01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:53.420
<v Speaker 5>There's parts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could share them on this</v>

2841
01:57:53.421 --> 01:57:56.120
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's times times the,</v>

2842
01:57:56.121 --> 01:57:58.820
<v Speaker 5>my favorite parts of Tom is when he is</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2843
01:57:59.330 --> 01:58:02.360
<v Speaker 5>he's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this the side liner that says the thing</v>

2844
01:58:02.361 --> 01:58:04.350
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or is affected by something like a,</v>

2845
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:06.110
<v Speaker 5>the only one I can think of it as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2846
01:58:06.111 --> 01:58:11.000
<v Speaker 5>a very applicable as</v>
<v Speaker 5>we and Tom did,</v>

2847
01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:12.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did when I shaved his tits,</v>

2848
01:58:12.861 --> 01:58:15.860
<v Speaker 5>we were in Honolulu doing Pearl Harbor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2849
01:58:15.890 --> 01:58:18.830
<v Speaker 5>the two things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the two things they said to us that were</v>

2850
01:58:18.831 --> 01:58:19.720
<v Speaker 5>recollect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're like,</v>

2851

<v Speaker 5>I didn't know they were talking about</v>

02:03:51.291 --> 02:03:54.350
<v Speaker 7>But once you get in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was in a boat that turned into it or</v>

2982
02:03:54.351 --> 02:03:56.600
<v Speaker 7>was it just a submarine?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2983
02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:58.880
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But getting in there is very</v>

2984
02:03:58.881 --> 02:04:00.070
<v Speaker 7>claustrophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Same high.</v>

2985
02:04:00.071 --> 02:04:02.570
<v Speaker 7>I'd imagine being into a like an f 14 or</v>
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>

2986
02:04:02.571 --> 02:04:04.130
<v Speaker 7>It'd be claustrophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Same Shit.</v>

2987
02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:06.560
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you started going down and then you</v>

2988
02:04:06.561 --> 02:04:08.450
<v Speaker 7>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh fuck,</v>

2989
02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.200
<v Speaker 7>if something goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone dies immediately.</v>

2990
02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2991
02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:14.600
<v Speaker 7>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no like,</v>

2992
02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:17.060
<v Speaker 7>there's no like exits.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no,</v>

2993
02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.800
<v Speaker 7>they don't give you a speech at the</v>
<v Speaker 7>beginning and they just go,</v>

2994
02:04:18.801 --> 02:04:20.420
<v Speaker 7>everyone sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's hope we do this.</v>

2995
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:22.940
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it would be the craziest community in</v>

2996
02:04:22.941 --> 02:04:26.480
<v Speaker 7>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What if you could build an underwater</v>

2997
02:04:26.690 --> 02:04:29.360
<v Speaker 7>under ocean city?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They got one.</v>

2998
02:04:29.361 --> 02:04:30.260
<v Speaker 7>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2999
02:04:30.290 --> 02:04:35.290
<v Speaker 7>like a submarine city where you</v>
<v Speaker 7>literally build it into like you take a</v>

3000
02:04:35.811 --> 02:04:38.120
<v Speaker 7>train through the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3001
02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:41.610
<v Speaker 1>To the center of the ocean where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a city where you know you can't</v>

3002
02:04:41.611 --> 02:04:45.870
<v Speaker 1>survive if anything goes wrong and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>all live in this little thing where you</v>

3003
02:04:45.871 --> 02:04:48.390
<v Speaker 1>have to keep that train path though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because that's where the food and</v>

3004
02:04:48.391 --> 02:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>air comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way other than that here</v>

3005
02:04:51.151 --> 02:04:54.900
<v Speaker 1>in the denial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supercharged life would be nice people</v>

3006
02:04:54.970 --> 02:04:59.970
<v Speaker 1>and be be freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true as a genius fucking idea</v>

3007
02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:05.130
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the ocean thinking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that at any moment this could fuck</v>

3008
02:05:05.131 --> 02:05:10.131
<v Speaker 1>ups with this constant checks on all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tolerances of all the joints of the</v>

3009
02:05:10.341 --> 02:05:14.580
<v Speaker 1>ball for glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the Shin and you're just sitting</v>

3010
02:05:14.581 --> 02:05:16.740
<v Speaker 1>there just being nice to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having Martinis,</v>

3011
02:05:16.741 --> 02:05:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

3012
02:05:17.250 --> 02:05:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you could sleep?</v>

3013
02:05:18.691 --> 02:05:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about you every day he's like that.</v>

3014
02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:22.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's always enough air.</v>

3015
02:05:23.010 --> 02:05:25.680
<v Speaker 1>There's always enough fair and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>always enough food as long as you keep</v>

3016
02:05:25.681 --> 02:05:27.930
<v Speaker 1>that train open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if anybody's unhappy,</v>

3017
02:05:28.170 --> 02:05:31.170
<v Speaker 1>they just put a suicide vest on and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>running in the middle of that fucking</v>

3018
02:05:31.171 --> 02:05:31.680
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3019
02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:33.670
<v Speaker 1>that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How quickly the people,</v>

3020
02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:36.720
<v Speaker 1>how long would it last?</v>

3021
02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:37.231
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3022
02:05:37.231 --> 02:05:39.210
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no dues was close off the blockage.</v>

3023
02:05:39.211 --> 02:05:42.570
<v Speaker 5>Big guys like fucking do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're just close off the boxes and go.</v>

3024
02:05:42.630 --> 02:05:44.250
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a tariff being paid.</v>

3025
02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:45.600
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3026
02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

3027
02:05:47.691 --> 02:05:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but would that work today?</v>

3028
02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Would that word today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it used to work but it used to</v>

3029
02:05:52.711 --> 02:05:56.010
<v Speaker 1>work without communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the kind of communication that</v>

3030
02:05:56.250 --> 02:05:58.590
<v Speaker 1>everybody has today with a smart phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3031
02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it would work the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

3032
02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you'd be able to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you can a hundred years ago or</v>

3033
02:06:04.891 --> 02:06:08.550
<v Speaker 1>200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have to have like a super</v>

3034
02:06:08.551 --> 02:06:11.580
<v Speaker 1>supportive community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's yelling and everybody would have</v>

3035
02:06:11.581 --> 02:06:13.500
<v Speaker 1>to be like treated equally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

3036
02:06:13.501 --> 02:06:16.980
<v Speaker 1>if there's any disparity whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also wanted to have to do is pluck and</v>

3037
02:06:16.981 --> 02:06:20.350
<v Speaker 1>point a gun at the wall and it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't last.</v>

3038
02:06:21.590 --> 02:06:22.520
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm</v>

3039
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:25.830

<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3040
02:06:25.831 --> 02:06:30.831
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw that.</v>

3041
02:06:33.721 --> 02:06:36.150
<v Speaker 6>I saw it in my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in my imagination.</v>

3042
02:06:36.151 --> 02:06:38.280
<v Speaker 6>Some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you can see a joke over and over</v>

3043
02:06:38.281 --> 02:06:39.001
<v Speaker 6>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go,</v>

3044
02:06:39.001 --> 02:06:42.180

3045
02:06:42.181 --> 02:06:44.570
<v Speaker 6>fucking Clint Eastwood Magnum put it on</v>
<v Speaker 6>a wall.</v>

3046
02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:46.470
<v Speaker 6>The joke I saw my head,</v>

3047
02:06:46.630 --> 02:06:49.180
<v Speaker 5>it could never get out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is we were on Catalina one night.</v>

3048
02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:51.490
<v Speaker 5>We're moved my sisters and we're all</v>
<v Speaker 5>smoking pot.</v>

3049
02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:53.800
<v Speaker 5>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's buffalo that roam around</v>

3050
02:06:53.801 --> 02:06:56.500
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I said,</v>

3051
02:06:56.501 --> 02:06:59.800
<v Speaker 5>why is there a buffalo here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then my buddy Chris Gillen goes,</v>

3052
02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:00.580
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the 20s,</v>

3054

<v Speaker 5>this island.</v>

3055
02:07:05.801 --> 02:07:07.330
<v Speaker 5>So he used to have spring training out</v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

3056
02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:12.600
<v Speaker 5>So he brought the buffalo out and my</v>
<v Speaker 5>sister goes for a scrimmage and I saw</v>

3057
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.870
<v Speaker 5>the owner coming out in a seer sucker</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoots seeing buffalo on one side and</v>

3058
02:07:16.871 --> 02:07:17.860
<v Speaker 5>the cubs working out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 7>hedging going on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I told you a while ago that you would</v>

<v Speaker 8>is one thing though.</v>

3231
02:15:05.121 --> 02:15:07.400

3275
02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:02.440
<v Speaker 1>probably more like that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first one.</v>

3276
02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:02.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3277
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:03.131
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3278
02:17:03.131 --> 02:17:05.350
<v Speaker 1>It's the one that didn't have the scruff</v>
<v Speaker 1>off his hair.</v>

3279
02:17:05.410 --> 02:17:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that one died like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's not that,</v>

3282
02:17:08.741 --> 02:17:10.570
<v Speaker 1>but it was that he didn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scruff of his hair yet.</v>

3283
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Really upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scuff off his hair.</v>

3284
02:17:13.810 --> 02:17:16.060
<v Speaker 1>They grow new antlers every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3285
02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:18.970
<v Speaker 1>but regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard that as a Newbie,</v>

3286
02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I heard you guys talk about it like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like a baby and my baby and I got</v>

3287
02:17:22.721 --> 02:17:23.560
<v Speaker 1>really emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3288
02:17:23.650 --> 02:17:24.130
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3289
02:17:24.130 --> 02:17:26.380
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big ass dear.</v>

3290
02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know they grew them new every</v>

3291
02:17:27.970 --> 02:17:29.550
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually brought that up a lot.</v>

3292
02:17:29.590 --> 02:17:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Most giant of giant deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3293
02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:35.470
<v Speaker 1>their antlers fall off every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's like a nine year old deer.</v>

3294
02:17:35.471 --> 02:17:39.010
<v Speaker 1>What's like an impossibly old deer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every year their antlers fall off and</v>

3295
02:17:39.011 --> 02:17:41.560
<v Speaker 1>those antlers are actually bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really crazy.</v>

3296
02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know until it really recently</v>

3297
02:17:44.010 --> 02:17:46.420
<v Speaker 1>decided to all these facts to random</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3298
02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:51.760
<v Speaker 1>They grow new bone every year and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it falls off and they grow that stuff in</v>

3299
02:17:52.181 --> 02:17:56.110
<v Speaker 1>their head just so that they can fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the death over pussy.</v>

3300
02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:59.800
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really why they grow it.</v>

3301
02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:01.990
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kill each other all the time.</v>

3302
02:18:01.991 --> 02:18:05.170
<v Speaker 1>We stumbled across a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an elk that had been killed.</v>

3303
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:09.220
<v Speaker 1>My Friend Cam stumble across one this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and another friend of Mine,</v>

3304
02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:11.890
<v Speaker 1>a stumble across one last year in</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

3305
02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:14.830
<v Speaker 1>They had been killed by another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just stab each other in the body</v>

3306
02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.680
<v Speaker 1>and like puncture each other's lungs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shaman.</v>

3307
02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:19.750
<v Speaker 1>They go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fuck now.</v>

3308
02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:21.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what then that's exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

3309
02:18:21.491 --> 02:18:25.330
<v Speaker 1>That's why they grow those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom is one of the biggest ones always</v>

3310
02:18:25.331 --> 02:18:28.960
<v Speaker 1>dominate because they can stab you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a further distance.</v>

3311
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a benefit of having these</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic summary Norman,</v>

3312
02:18:32.821 --> 02:18:34.510
<v Speaker 1>so what's the benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the benefit of,</v>

3313
02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>of like when people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a 10 point dear.</v>

3314
02:18:36.691 --> 02:18:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that late in the season?</v>

3315
02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:39.131
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3316
02:18:39.131 --> 02:18:39.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3317
02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It means it's an old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mature,</v>

3318
02:18:41.381 --> 02:18:44.260
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant male that's probably been</v>

3319
02:18:44.261 --> 02:18:47.650
<v Speaker 1>dominating the area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a big deer with a lot of</v>

3320
02:18:47.651 --> 02:18:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Antler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the ones that have the bigger</v>

3321
02:18:49.661 --> 02:18:53.470
<v Speaker 1>deers and those are the ones that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>most dominant in terms of like spreading</v>

3322
02:18:53.471 --> 02:18:54.161
<v Speaker 1>their genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3323
02:18:54.161 --> 02:18:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>

3324
02:18:56.110 --> 02:18:57.850
<v Speaker 1>let's go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times the,</v>

3325
02:18:57.851 --> 02:19:01.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind the conservation angle</v>

3326
02:19:01.241 --> 02:19:05.320
<v Speaker 1>is that if you hunt an animal like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hunting an animal that's already</v>

3327
02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:07.830
<v Speaker 1>long spread its genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

3328
02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:10.030
<v Speaker 1>there's no danger of losing its</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics.</v>

3329
02:19:10.270 --> 02:19:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Its genetics have been spread and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually better for the biodiversity of</v>

3330
02:19:14.561 --> 02:19:16.810
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you let the younger bucks start</v>

3331
02:19:16.811 --> 02:19:20.020
<v Speaker 1>breeding now as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's super highly debated though</v>

3332
02:19:20.550 --> 02:19:23.050
<v Speaker 1>because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some key conservationists feel like</v>

3333
02:19:23.070 --> 02:19:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're better off leaving them in there</v>

3334
02:19:25.121 --> 02:19:26.710
<v Speaker 1>as long as they survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3335
02:19:26.711 --> 02:19:28.180
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very controversial,</v>

3336
02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:31.260
<v Speaker 3>hunters tend to think that the idea is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if the,</v>

3337
02:19:31.261 --> 02:19:31.940
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3338
02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:32.773
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3339
02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:36.080
<v Speaker 3>get them out of the food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the younger bucks,</v>

3340
02:19:36.081 --> 02:19:38.210
<v Speaker 3>we'll have a chance to rise up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>become dominant.</v>

3341
02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:40.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go,</v>

3342
02:19:40.890 --> 02:19:41.870
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tense?</v>

3343
02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do something you enjoy.</v>

3344
02:19:43.791 --> 02:19:48.470
<v Speaker 3>I want to do something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cameron Hanes ultra marathon now that</v>

3345
02:19:48.471 --> 02:19:52.430
<v Speaker 3>don't want to do that furthest in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cameron Hanes is ultra marathon.</v>

3346
02:19:52.610 --> 02:19:54.080
<v Speaker 3>That's what you want to try and meet you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Ari.</v>

3347
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got knee surgery.</v>

3348
02:19:56.541 --> 02:19:57.920
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not stupid.</v>

3349
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>

3350
02:19:58.960 --> 02:19:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

3351
02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:01.960
<v Speaker 3>what's our next contest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to another kind of art,</v>

3352
02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:07.520
<v Speaker 3>but art is integrity on this contest</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's definitely a marathon is</v>

3353
02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:08.900
<v Speaker 3>what makes it the funniest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3354
02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:10.850
<v Speaker 3>If it was real spinning out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would agree with you.</v>

3355
02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:15.650
<v Speaker 3>It's obviously for comedic effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Ari very well</v>

3356
02:20:17.490 --> 02:20:20.540
<v Speaker 3>and honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like the fairness of the</v>

3357
02:20:20.541 --> 02:20:23.120
<v Speaker 3>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I benefited from this thing more than</v>

3358
02:20:23.121 --> 02:20:24.620
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have to lose any weight.</v>

3359
02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:26.570
<v Speaker 3>I had two awesome podcasts with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

3360
02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:28.370
<v Speaker 3>By all rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should pay for it.</v>

3361
02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:30.620
<v Speaker 3>This has been a fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's figure out what to do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3368
02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:45.710

<v Speaker 3>contest between youtube every month.</v>

3462
02:24:14.891 --> 02:24:17.020

<v Speaker 3>ever known.</v>

3463
02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:21.730
<v Speaker 3>I would pick a pitch up beat.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what it should be.</v>

3465
02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be online because that's what</v>

3466
02:24:25.980 --> 02:24:27.260
<v Speaker 3>we could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3467
02:24:27.290 --> 02:24:30.280
<v Speaker 3>forget all this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to explain it to people that give</v>

3468
02:24:30.281 --> 02:24:33.550
<v Speaker 3>you money and put cameras on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to do that anymore.</v>

3469
02:24:33.551 --> 02:24:35.830
<v Speaker 3>And not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that you've ever had bad</v>

3470
02:24:35.831 --> 02:24:38.950
<v Speaker 3>relationships with any of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you won't be able to smoke pot.</v>

3471
02:24:38.980 --> 02:24:41.200
<v Speaker 3>You won't be able to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You won't be able to talk.</v>

3472
02:24:41.201 --> 02:24:43.870
<v Speaker 3>You won't be able to swear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do it online.</v>

3473
02:24:43.871 --> 02:24:47.140
<v Speaker 3>You could just be you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why podcasts are so fucking good.</v>

3474
02:24:47.290 --> 02:24:50.020
<v Speaker 3>But it is why podcasts are so good and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why people really know who you</v>

3475
02:24:50.021 --> 02:24:51.370
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3476
02:24:51.430 --> 02:24:54.210
<v Speaker 3>People know you from the travel channel</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they love you from standup,</v>

3477

3481
02:25:04.301 --> 02:25:05.134
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

3482
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:12.250
<v Speaker 5>This is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this was the defining turning me</v>

<v Speaker 3>it for five years.</v>

3495
02:25:41.171 --> 02:25:44.590

<v Speaker 3>the fun event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the places you got to go rather</v>

3498
02:25:51.581 --> 02:25:52.840
<v Speaker 3>than a fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

3499
02:25:52.841 --> 02:25:54.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of it was local.</v>

3503
02:25:58.601 --> 02:26:02.050
<v Speaker 3>It was definitely a fun game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the difference between that and</v>

3504
02:26:02.051 --> 02:26:04.930
<v Speaker 3>standup is giant and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't give stand up,</v>

3505
02:26:04.931 --> 02:26:07.750
<v Speaker 3>the fucking respect it deserves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes dog shit.</v>

3552
02:28:20.340 --> 02:28:21.110
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I,</v>

3553
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:26.110
<v Speaker 3>which one you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came out and he was so ex below sieve</v>

3554
02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:29.960
<v Speaker 3>with the way he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every punchline,</v>

3555
02:28:29.961 --> 02:28:33.390
<v Speaker 3>he was involved in a semi shirtless too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>

3556
02:28:33.410 --> 02:28:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Like there was something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something was picking up a picture of</v>

3557
02:28:37.521 --> 02:28:39.000
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so,</v>

3558
02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.630
<v Speaker 3>it was like the way he was moving there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was so much energy.</v>

3559
02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:42.710
<v Speaker 3>This is not it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3560
02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:44.510
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was another one that we said it's a</v>

3561
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:45.130
<v Speaker 3>half hour special.</v>

3562
02:28:45.130 --> 02:28:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was?</v>

3563
02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.110
<v Speaker 3>That might've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

3564
02:28:48.111 --> 02:28:49.610
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an hbo.</v>

3565
02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I think he did this and then he did</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3566
02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:53.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well anyway,</v>

3567
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:56.330
<v Speaker 3>when he did that special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that special was,</v>

3568
02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:59.900
<v Speaker 3>when I watched parts of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if I had,</v>

3569
02:29:00.140 --> 02:29:04.220
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd started doing stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like an open at time,</v>

3570
02:29:04.221 --> 02:29:07.970
<v Speaker 3>just Kinda just getting going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember thinking,</v>

3571
02:29:07.971 --> 02:29:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy just tapped into that</v>

3572
02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:15.530
<v Speaker 3>weird rare spot where you could never</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine yourself doing it.</v>

3573
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:17.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's it either,</v>

3574
02:29:17.001 --> 02:29:19.370
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it says it is?</v>

3575
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:23.720
<v Speaker 3>It might be it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The colors look off,</v>

3576
02:29:23.721 --> 02:29:25.540
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it's just my memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did food.</v>

3577
02:29:25.541 --> 02:29:26.820
<v Speaker 3>Who Child too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going off.</v>

3578

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3579
02:29:28.131 --> 02:29:29.900
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that was a later one.</v>

3580
02:29:29.930 --> 02:29:31.340
<v Speaker 3>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone always had seen live.</v>

<v Speaker 7>born,</v>

3737
02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:32.800
<v Speaker 7>almost 1213 years ago.</v>

3738
02:35:32.801 --> 02:35:34.030
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I would have kicked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'll see.</v>

02:53:37.270 --> 02:53:39.700
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of this was healthy for you,</v>

4127
02:53:39.701 --> 02:53:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the majority of it was healthy</v>

4128
02:53:42.191 --> 02:53:43.700
<v Speaker 3>except for the last couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4129
02:53:44.230 --> 02:53:47.710
<v Speaker 3>The actual trying to make the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Burt at the very least like you</v>

4130
02:53:47.711 --> 02:53:49.680
<v Speaker 3>curbed some of your insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4131
02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:52.630
<v Speaker 3>he curved it to the point where you lost</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tremendous amount of weight.</v>

4132
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:55.510
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to feel lighter and better.</v>

4133
02:53:55.660 --> 02:53:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you,</v>

4134
02:53:57.220 --> 02:53:59.350
<v Speaker 3>how do you move forward now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

4135
02:53:59.351 --> 02:54:02.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to life as usual or do you start</v>

4136
02:54:02.141 --> 02:54:03.100
<v Speaker 3>another contest?</v>

4137
02:54:03.580 --> 02:54:05.740
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can start another contest.</v>

4138
02:54:05.741 --> 02:54:07.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally comfortable with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like burt wants to start none</v>

4139
02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:09.340
<v Speaker 3>of the content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to start another contest.</v>

4140
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:11.890
<v Speaker 3>I want already to be involved too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I like Orange Ball Chin,</v>

4141
02:54:11.950 --> 02:54:12.401
<v Speaker 3>Don,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don,</v>

4142
02:54:12.401 --> 02:54:13.234
<v Speaker 3>Don,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don.</v>

4143
02:54:13.400 --> 02:54:17.470

<v Speaker 3>We should do this online.</v>

4144
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:20.470
<v Speaker 3>But the challenge doesn't have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>weighed at the time.</v>

4145
02:54:20.471 --> 02:54:21.304
<v Speaker 3>It can be something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4146
02:54:21.470 --> 02:54:23.110
<v Speaker 3>it be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what could it be?</v>

4147
02:54:23.300 --> 02:54:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be anything,</v>

4148
02:54:26.081 --> 02:54:27.880

<v Speaker 3>That's the crazy thing about the</v>

4149
02:54:27.881 --> 02:54:29.170
<v Speaker 3>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do whatever the fuck we want.</v>

4150
02:54:29.620 --> 02:54:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Whatever we come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could just do,</v>

4151
02:54:31.330 --> 02:54:32.051
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no shit.</v>

4152
02:54:32.051 --> 02:54:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys can compete and stuff.</v>

4153
02:54:33.341 --> 02:54:34.840
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't even suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4154
02:54:34.870 --> 02:54:36.400
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't have to be something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sucks.</v>

4155
02:54:36.401 --> 02:54:39.130
<v Speaker 3>Like trying to drain your body and</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal go around the world the</v>

4156
02:54:39.131 --> 02:54:42.010
<v Speaker 3>fastest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a bird thing.</v>

4157
02:54:42.010 --> 02:54:42.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4158
02:54:42.390 --> 02:54:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to ballpark your guns</v>

4159
02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:49.120
<v Speaker 3>but a bunch of data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea is like a competition show,</v>

4160
02:54:49.150 --> 02:54:51.730
<v Speaker 3>which mean to you guys would be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4161
02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Cause it would be in the best spirits</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

4162
02:54:54.790 --> 02:54:57.640
<v Speaker 3>Like here's the thing about competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this right.</v>

4163
02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:00.310
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was never any animosity.</v>

4164
02:55:00.311 --> 02:55:02.140
<v Speaker 3>So after it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all laughing.</v>

4165
02:55:02.170 --> 02:55:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like if you have a fight for</v>

4166
02:55:04.251 --> 02:55:05.890
<v Speaker 3>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

4167
02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:07.850
<v Speaker 3>two people don't like each other in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular.</v>

4168
02:55:07.890 --> 02:55:10.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always animosity before and</v>

4169
02:55:10.371 --> 02:55:12.080
<v Speaker 3>after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are pissed.</v>

4170
02:55:12.770 --> 02:55:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always chaos.</v>

4171
02:55:13.970 --> 02:55:16.150
<v Speaker 3>She get our wives involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

4172
02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:18.680

<v Speaker 3>you're trying to get this personal sun.</v>

4173
02:55:18.770 --> 02:55:19.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our wives.</v>

4174
02:55:19.580 --> 02:55:22.220
<v Speaker 3>That's cause that's what the untapped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're both happy this is over.</v>

4175
02:55:23.980 --> 02:55:25.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I I liked this.</v>

4176
02:55:25.630 --> 02:55:28.280
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you I'm not adverse to doing</v>

4177
02:55:28.281 --> 02:55:31.370
<v Speaker 3>another competition at all and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be something crazy.</v>

4178
02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Well here we are in January,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4179
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:34.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the beginning first couple of</v>

4180
02:55:34.851 --> 02:55:39.851
<v Speaker 3>days of January,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2017 why don't we knock it around for a</v>

4181
02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:45.670
<v Speaker 3>few months and we'll figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>finance some other competition.</v>

4182
02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:48.260
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4183
02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:51.590
<v Speaker 3>so instead of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well let's just figure out like what</v>

4184
02:55:51.591 --> 02:55:54.950
<v Speaker 3>would be a fun thing to do and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult thing to do.</v>

4185
02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Like write two things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two parts.</v>

4186
02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:58.330
<v Speaker 3>A key fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4187
02:55:58.410 --> 02:56:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Like will it be a fun thing to do but</v>
<v Speaker 3>also a difficult thing to do?</v>

4188
02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:04.430
<v Speaker 3>Will you guys could do it as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>

4189
02:56:04.610 --> 02:56:07.490
<v Speaker 3>It would be a big deal for you to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>point where winning it would be</v>

4190
02:56:07.491 --> 02:56:09.890
<v Speaker 3>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd want to like really work hard</v>

4191
02:56:09.891 --> 02:56:11.600
<v Speaker 3>towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be worth your dedication.</v>

4192
02:56:11.890 --> 02:56:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Did we can even bring like sponsors</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved?</v>

4193
02:56:13.971 --> 02:56:17.720
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes like five minutes to figure out</v>

4194
02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:21.440
<v Speaker 3>what sponsors would be interested in</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever kind of competition we figured</v>

4195
02:56:21.441 --> 02:56:24.620
<v Speaker 3>out</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could do something really fun.</v>

4196
02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:26.480
<v Speaker 3>We could do something really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to go there.</v>

4209
02:57:03.201 --> 02:57:05.900
<v Speaker 3>physical advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you started in a physical</v>

<v Speaker 3>competition right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just listen to me.</v>

4216
02:57:18.471 --> 02:57:19.350
<v Speaker 3>That's worse than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4217
02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:23.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about some crazy like one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those obstacle courses we have to like</v>

4218
02:57:23.751 --> 02:57:27.590
<v Speaker 3>swing from the monkey bars and climb on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pole and all that jazz and climb up</v>

<v Speaker 3>other doing something like that and make</v>

4220
02:57:32.331 --> 02:57:33.620
<v Speaker 3>a big deal out of that.</v>

4221
02:57:33.650 --> 02:57:35.760
<v Speaker 3>That would be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys didn't have to getting sick</v>

4222
02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:39.930
<v Speaker 3>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fireman Training Department Training</v>

4223

<v Speaker 3>Ninja,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American Ninja.</v>

4224
02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Matt Iseman is on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is like,</v>

4225
02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:47.080
<v Speaker 3>do you really think you could even</v>
<v Speaker 3>complete that?</v>

4226
02:57:47.081 --> 02:57:49.820
<v Speaker 3>I could get halfway through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4227
02:57:49.821 --> 02:57:51.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you I'm not that cocky</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental gene.</v>

4228
02:57:51.940 --> 02:57:54.080
<v Speaker 3>It for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I moved my body pretty good and I</v>

4229
02:57:54.081 --> 02:57:56.540
<v Speaker 3>watched that on TV and I go out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd probably fall off one of</v>

4230
02:57:56.541 --> 02:57:57.640
<v Speaker 3>those things called Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt Iseman.</v>

4231
02:57:57.710 --> 02:58:02.070
<v Speaker 3>Right now he can get us on the course</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you were telling me what they'll get</v>

4232
02:58:02.071 --> 02:58:04.260
<v Speaker 3>halfway through and fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can definitely,</v>

4233
02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:06.780
<v Speaker 3>that is alphabet starts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can definitely get halfway through.</v>

4234
02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think you'd be able to do?</v>

4235
02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:09.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already done the training.</v>

4236
02:58:09.930 --> 02:58:10.291
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

4238
02:58:11.580 --> 02:58:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely more than half,</v>

4239
02:58:13.141 --> 02:58:16.620

<v Speaker 3>I can get past on lily pads.</v>

4240
02:58:16.740 --> 02:58:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I think the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we find it a course that is</v>

4241
02:58:20.370 --> 02:58:22.070
<v Speaker 3>like what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult wipe out,</v>

4242
02:58:23.130 --> 02:58:24.210
<v Speaker 3>wipe out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't do anymore.</v>

4243
02:58:24.270 --> 02:58:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be an easy one to set up</v>

4244
02:58:26.191 --> 02:58:28.170
<v Speaker 3>because Mac units was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>executive.</v>

4245
02:58:28.171 --> 02:58:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Bruce is a fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

4246
02:58:29.710 --> 02:58:30.421
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4247
02:58:30.421 --> 02:58:32.310
<v Speaker 3>That was his show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4248
02:58:32.311 --> 02:58:35.820
<v Speaker 3>The people who created wipe out and made</v>
<v Speaker 3>wipe out in America.</v>

4249
02:58:36.060 --> 02:58:37.800
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them were friends of mine,</v>

4250
02:58:38.310 --> 02:58:41.580
<v Speaker 3>but I could like a triathlon mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like something triathlon would be a</v>

4251
02:58:41.581 --> 02:58:42.420
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

4252
02:58:42.421 --> 02:58:44.060
<v Speaker 3>if you really wanted to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your man.</v>

4253
02:58:44.080 --> 02:58:46.040
<v Speaker 3>Serious commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4254
02:58:46.190 --> 02:58:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might come in and sponsor us,</v>

4255
02:58:48.330 --> 02:58:51.510
<v Speaker 3>then we start to go to the death to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next level.</v>

4256
02:58:52.290 --> 02:58:54.300
<v Speaker 3>Now that you have him over the ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to go,</v>

4257
02:58:55.350 --> 02:58:57.690
<v Speaker 3>he wants to drown you in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants,</v>

4258
02:58:57.900 --> 02:59:00.540
<v Speaker 3>he wants the possibility that he'll be</v>
<v Speaker 3>swimming away and he looks back and a</v>

4259
02:59:00.541 --> 02:59:03.330
<v Speaker 3>shark takes you could have the iron man.</v>

4260
02:59:04.980 --> 02:59:05.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the,</v>

4261
02:59:05.551 --> 02:59:06.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

4262
02:59:06.391 --> 02:59:09.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like a short race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking marathon.</v>

4263
02:59:09.481 --> 02:59:12.960
<v Speaker 3>You've got to run a hundred miles a</v>
<v Speaker 3>marathon and you get to ride a hundred</v>

4264
02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:15.000
<v Speaker 3>miles on a bike and you get to swim a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple miles.</v>

4265
02:59:15.001 --> 02:59:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the guy at Spartan race,</v>

4266
02:59:17.980 --> 02:59:20.370
<v Speaker 3>the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what exactly are the parameters?</v>

4267
02:59:20.371 --> 02:59:21.600
<v Speaker 3>Like what clothes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>

4268
02:59:21.660 --> 02:59:23.850
<v Speaker 3>What is this Jayman battle frog thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>they show on espn.</v>

4269
02:59:23.851 --> 02:59:26.820
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's like teams really racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they could probably do it.</v>

4270
02:59:27.030 --> 02:59:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do battle frog.</v>

4271
02:59:29.220 --> 02:59:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I'll look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to run up this thing.</v>

4272
02:59:32.350 --> 02:59:34.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like a navy seal obstacle course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically.</v>

4273
02:59:34.570 --> 02:59:37.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying what's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating about you guys is that you</v>

4274
02:59:37.111 --> 02:59:42.111
<v Speaker 3>both love each other and you're both</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting combination of impulse and</v>

4275
02:59:42.301 --> 02:59:45.780
<v Speaker 3>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Re ridiculous,</v>

4276
02:59:45.870 --> 02:59:50.580
<v Speaker 3>fanatical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like scramble sprint to catch up versus</v>

4277
02:59:50.581 --> 02:59:55.230
<v Speaker 3>slow steady marathon pace and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really funny man.</v>

4278
02:59:55.590 --> 02:59:57.480
<v Speaker 3>And laughing hard the whole way.</v>

4279
02:59:57.810 --> 02:59:59.850
<v Speaker 3>The tip of the spear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who made those graphics?</v>

4280
02:59:59.851 --> 03:00:02.850
<v Speaker 3>You don't make the tip of the spear and</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it a neon green.</v>

4281
03:00:02.851 --> 03:00:04.410
<v Speaker 3>You fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not scary.</v>

4282
03:00:04.980 --> 03:00:08.670
<v Speaker 3>Tip of the spear out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jabbing at the enemy with a cartoon</v>

4283
03:00:08.671 --> 03:00:10.560
<v Speaker 3>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that going to be our thing?</v>

4284
03:00:10.561 --> 03:00:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Then we're going to find a course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4285
03:00:12.091 --> 03:00:15.780
<v Speaker 3>What we should do is turn this TV show</v>
<v Speaker 3>into like ultimate fighter competition</v>

4286
03:00:15.781 --> 03:00:19.280
<v Speaker 3>thing where we beat both have teams of</v>
<v Speaker 3>losers like us.</v>

4287
03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4288
03:00:20.521 --> 03:00:23.280
<v Speaker 3>let's bounce around a bunch of ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not commit to any of them.</v>

4289
03:00:23.281 --> 03:00:26.820
<v Speaker 3>Let's try to figure out like what would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the best idea to have a fun</v>

4290
03:00:26.821 --> 03:00:30.750
<v Speaker 3>competition between you guys that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit you because you guys both</v>

4291
03:00:30.751 --> 03:00:34.200
<v Speaker 3>benefited in a huge way harder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You both look amazing.</v>

4292
03:00:34.410 --> 03:00:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I showed your video to my wife of you.</v>

4293
03:00:37.021 --> 03:00:39.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm joking around about the work was</v>
<v Speaker 3>already done,</v>

4294
03:00:39.451 --> 03:00:41.130
<v Speaker 3>that your work was already done and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

4295
03:00:41.131 --> 03:00:43.140
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just went,</v>

4296
03:00:43.141 --> 03:00:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they look you,</v>

4297
03:00:44.541 --> 03:00:46.250
<v Speaker 3>your skin looks healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4298
03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:48.420
<v Speaker 3>your face looks thinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4299
03:00:48.450 --> 03:00:52.260
<v Speaker 3>then you look vibrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look like your body had more energy</v>

4300
03:00:52.261 --> 03:00:53.520
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks man.</v>

4301
03:00:53.580 --> 03:00:55.080
<v Speaker 3>I definitely do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

4302
03:00:55.081 --> 03:00:57.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of weight to he then you</v>

4303
03:00:57.301 --> 03:00:58.111
<v Speaker 3>always think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4304
03:00:58.111 --> 03:00:59.650
<v Speaker 3>I was walking around with that every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

4305
03:00:59.790 --> 03:00:59.980
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

4306
03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:02.800
<v Speaker 8>too crazy and we talked about it</v>
<v Speaker 8>yesterday and sometimes people think</v>

4307
03:01:02.801 --> 03:01:04.390
<v Speaker 8>we're insensitive when we talk about</v>
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>

4308
03:01:04.391 --> 03:01:07.090
<v Speaker 8>like the subject of fat shaming,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whether or not fat shaming is a good</v>

4309
03:01:07.091 --> 03:01:07.361
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

4310
03:01:07.361 --> 03:01:09.340
<v Speaker 8>it's never a good thing to be mean to</v>
<v Speaker 8>people,</v>

4311
03:01:09.460 --> 03:01:13.150
<v Speaker 8>but it might not be the worst thing in</v>
<v Speaker 8>the world to feel uncomfortable about</v>

4312
03:01:13.151 --> 03:01:17.020
<v Speaker 8>the current state you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you know that states unhealthy and</v>

4313
03:01:17.021 --> 03:01:19.300
<v Speaker 8>attaching all these like magic words to</v>
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>

4314
03:01:19.301 --> 03:01:21.820
<v Speaker 8>like fat shaming,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you decide and it's certain actions can</v>

4315
03:01:21.821 --> 03:01:25.360
<v Speaker 8>never take place so you certain</v>
<v Speaker 8>acknowledgements of someone's issue with</v>

4316
03:01:25.361 --> 03:01:27.940
<v Speaker 8>their wade can never be discussed</v>
<v Speaker 8>because it hurts people's feelings.</v>

4317
03:01:28.300 --> 03:01:30.940
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't necessarily always do that</v>
<v Speaker 8>person a service.</v>

4318
03:01:31.090 --> 03:01:33.280
<v Speaker 8>Like we'd all be better off if we were</v>
<v Speaker 8>healthy.</v>

4319
03:01:33.550 --> 03:01:35.980
<v Speaker 8>It feels great to eat fucking Krispy</v>
<v Speaker 8>Kreme doughnuts,</v>

4320
03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:37.240
<v Speaker 8>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it feels better.</v>

4321
03:01:37.910 --> 03:01:41.530
<v Speaker 8>It's he krispy Kreme donuts after he</v>
<v Speaker 8>lost 40 pounds and you know that</v>

4322
03:01:41.531 --> 03:01:43.720
<v Speaker 8>tomorrow you're going to get back on the</v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking treadmill.</v>

4323
03:01:43.750 --> 03:01:44.291
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4324
03:01:44.291 --> 03:01:45.670
<v Speaker 8>and you're going to start eating healthy</v>
<v Speaker 8>again.</v>

4325
03:01:45.671 --> 03:01:48.760
<v Speaker 8>Give yourself a reward days,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but don't let it control your goddamn</v>

4326
03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:52.840
<v Speaker 8>life and don't wrap it up and wrap that</v>
<v Speaker 8>criticism of protect yourself from that</v>

4327
03:01:52.841 --> 03:01:57.841
<v Speaker 8>criticism and a blanket of these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 8>stupid rules like don't ever talk about</v>

4328
03:01:58.361 --> 03:02:00.520
<v Speaker 8>someone being fat or don't ever discuss</v>
<v Speaker 8>it or don't.</v>

4329
03:02:00.670 --> 03:02:03.220
<v Speaker 8>Don't make them feel uncomfortable about</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're supposed to be on feel</v>

4330
03:02:03.221 --> 03:02:05.530
<v Speaker 8>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's something that you can change,</v>

4331
03:02:05.710 --> 03:02:09.520
<v Speaker 8>but if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's going to kill you and if you do,</v>

4332
03:02:09.521 --> 03:02:12.370
<v Speaker 8>it's going to make you feel way better.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's encouragement.</v>

4333
03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:14.980
<v Speaker 8>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's the only way to encourage people</v>

4334
03:02:14.981 --> 03:02:17.050
<v Speaker 8>about certain things that are</v>
<v Speaker 8>uncomfortable is to make them</v>

4335
03:02:17.051 --> 03:02:19.630
<v Speaker 8>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's just no way around it.</v>

4336
03:02:19.750 --> 03:02:22.930
<v Speaker 8>It's no way someone's going to find out</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're overweight and not have it feel</v>

4337
03:02:22.931 --> 03:02:23.230
<v Speaker 8>bad.</v>

4338
03:02:23.230 --> 03:02:26.470
<v Speaker 4>I think the uncomfortable feeling is</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably like the biggest catalyst.</v>

4339
03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:28.480
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what makes you do stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so too,</v>

4340
03:02:28.481 --> 03:02:29.030
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

4341
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:32.110
<v Speaker 4>You know it's an uncomfortable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like someone being blue,</v>

4342
03:02:32.140 --> 03:02:36.400
<v Speaker 4>brutally honest with you about something</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you don't like about yourself and</v>

4343
03:02:36.401 --> 03:02:37.760
<v Speaker 4>then you act on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4344
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:38.520
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4345
03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:39.353
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

4346
03:02:39.860 --> 03:02:44.860
<v Speaker 8>I just think that we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we definitely could use more nice people</v>

4347
03:02:44.871 --> 03:02:46.790
<v Speaker 8>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We could definitely use each other being</v>

4348
03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:50.690
<v Speaker 8>kinder and the world for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but when you,</v>

4349
03:02:50.691 --> 03:02:52.520
<v Speaker 8>when you're dealing with certain</v>
<v Speaker 8>situations,</v>

4350
03:02:52.521 --> 03:02:56.090
<v Speaker 8>like at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have to be stern with people over</v>

4351
03:02:56.091 --> 03:02:58.370
<v Speaker 8>certain issues.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like if someone was a drug problem,</v>

4352
03:02:58.580 --> 03:03:00.320
<v Speaker 8>someone has a weight problem.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4353

<v Speaker 8>things that a person can do.</v>

03:05:35.911 --> 03:05:39.590
<v Speaker 8>between friends and you both got</v>
<v Speaker 8>healthier because of it maybe</v>

4420

<v Speaker 8>temporarily unhealthy and the last</v>
<v Speaker 8>couple of days does the dehydration,</v>

<v Speaker 3>talking about fat shaming is that people</v>

4462
03:07:18.361 --> 03:07:21.000
<v Speaker 3>don't understand what it feels like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be on the other side of that.</v>

03:07:33.780 --> 03:07:36.450
<v Speaker 3>I did on Amazon.</v>

4469
03:07:36.451 --> 03:07:38.710
<v Speaker 3>but it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero sugar in it just in Stevia is like</v>

4470
03:07:38.711 --> 03:07:42.930
<v Speaker 3>a natural plant based sweetener so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't fuck with your blood sugar</v>

4471
03:07:42.931 --> 03:07:43.550
<v Speaker 3>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4476
03:07:53.731 --> 03:07:56.640
<v Speaker 3>before we leave because it is quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous because you've had a drink</v>

4477
03:07:56.641 --> 03:07:57.474
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>two o coconut water?</v>

4482
03:08:08.730 --> 03:08:13.200
<v Speaker 3>These are 17.5 Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he killed two of those and then for 16</v>

4483
03:08:13.201 --> 03:08:14.670
<v Speaker 3>ounce waters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4487
03:08:20.010 --> 03:08:21.510
<v Speaker 3>it tastes like jazz and it's delicious.</v>

4488
03:08:23.730 --> 03:08:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Hey is a coconut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're allowed to just steal that and</v>

4489
03:08:25.921 --> 03:08:28.380
<v Speaker 3>put that in an ad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to get the right coconut</v>

4490
03:08:28.381 --> 03:08:29.910
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get it from Thai,</v>

4491
03:08:30.310 --> 03:08:31.730
<v Speaker 3>Thai coconuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best one.</v>

4492
03:08:31.740 --> 03:08:33.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a very sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4493
03:08:33.190 --> 03:08:36.900
<v Speaker 3>If you ever had the Tiki ones that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mocha that have caffeine in them,</v>

4494

<v Speaker 3>those are really good too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like yeah,</v>

4495
03:08:38.971 --> 03:08:41.280
<v Speaker 3>those are good too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those have a lot of sugar in them,</v>

4496
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:42.660
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4497
03:08:42.661 --> 03:08:45.000
<v Speaker 3>they're really Yummy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they do have a lot of sugar in them.</v>

4498
03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:47.940
<v Speaker 3>You know what really is the bass like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a company that has it or it's</v>

4499
03:08:47.941 --> 03:08:49.740
<v Speaker 3>fresh coconut water.</v>

4500
03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:52.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a harmless harvest</v>

4501
03:08:55.890 --> 03:08:57.760
<v Speaker 3>coconut water and you drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like it.</v>

4502
03:08:57.800 --> 03:09:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Your whole body's just going to make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee flavored one.</v>

4503
03:09:00.211 --> 03:09:02.130
<v Speaker 3>They have a copy of flavor that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>different one.</v>

4504
03:09:02.190 --> 03:09:03.330
<v Speaker 3>That's different one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

4505
03:09:03.430 --> 03:09:05.700
<v Speaker 3>and the coconut waters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>

4506
03:09:05.730 --> 03:09:08.280
<v Speaker 3>People get mad if you start talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about coconut water or Kale.</v>

4507
03:09:08.840 --> 03:09:11.550
<v Speaker 3>You're the person that introduced me to</v>
<v Speaker 3>coconut water yesterday.</v>

4508
03:09:12.700 --> 03:09:14.790
<v Speaker 3>It looks good and I'm actually already</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to it.</v>

4509
03:09:14.820 --> 03:09:16.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm used to it already too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all bullshit,</v>

4510
03:09:16.560 --> 03:09:17.393
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right guys.</v>

4511
03:09:17.460 --> 03:09:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Listen man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was scared,</v>

4512
03:09:18.651 --> 03:09:19.680
<v Speaker 3>shaved my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

4513
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:22.650
<v Speaker 3>before I shaved my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about it for like a</v>

4514
03:09:22.650 --> 03:09:22.861
<v Speaker 3>couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4515
03:09:22.861 --> 03:09:25.170
<v Speaker 3>should I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should I shaved my fucking head?</v>

4516
03:09:25.430 --> 03:09:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Cause it was just getting more and more</v>
<v Speaker 3>Janky looking up there.</v>

4517
03:09:29.140 --> 03:09:31.170
<v Speaker 3>It was just giving out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

4518
03:09:31.260 --> 03:09:35.010
<v Speaker 3>I was you in five years and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost over.</v>

4519
03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:38.790
<v Speaker 3>I just got to give in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when I finally fucking changed</v>

4520
03:09:38.791 --> 03:09:39.450
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4521
03:09:39.450 --> 03:09:40.650
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was I,</v>

4522
03:09:40.920 --> 03:09:42.360
<v Speaker 3>why did I shave it a long time ago?</v>

4523
03:09:42.360 --> 03:09:44.910
<v Speaker 3>This is way better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way easier.</v>

4524
03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:46.530
<v Speaker 3>He had just looked different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4525
03:09:46.840 --> 03:09:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people are,</v>

4526
03:09:47.761 --> 03:09:50.250
<v Speaker 3>everyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all afraid of looking different</v>

4527
03:09:50.251 --> 03:09:51.890
<v Speaker 3>for some weird reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4528
03:09:52.210 --> 03:09:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4529
03:09:53.980 --> 03:09:54.910
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better,</v>

4530
03:09:55.240 --> 03:09:56.260
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I do,</v>

4531
03:09:56.261 --> 03:09:57.940
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I work at deadwood,</v>

4532
03:09:57.941 --> 03:10:00.490
<v Speaker 3>but on the south side this will be</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

4533
03:10:00.670 --> 03:10:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Here's one that actually the big things</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how this,</v>

4534
03:10:03.011 --> 03:10:06.160
<v Speaker 3>it turned out because you've lost so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much weight.</v>

4535
03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:11.760
<v Speaker 3>The impact is not like if you had been</v>
<v Speaker 3>full two 50 [inaudible] oh my goodness.</v>

4536
03:10:12.430 --> 03:10:14.590
<v Speaker 3>It would look worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you lost 30 some pounds,</v>

4537
03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:16.240
<v Speaker 3>so it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4538
03:10:16.300 --> 03:10:19.060
<v Speaker 3>did she keep it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that mustache looks good.</v>

4539
03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I think the mustache at the very least</v>
<v Speaker 3>should stay at chin hair.</v>

4540
03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:26.080
<v Speaker 3>But kind of what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really want to it.</v>

4541
03:10:26.170 --> 03:10:29.680
<v Speaker 3>I really want to use a razor raised on</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 12 years.</v>

4542
03:10:30.810 --> 03:10:33.460
<v Speaker 3>They've been going go get a real shave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

4546
03:10:38.471 --> 03:10:40.690
<v Speaker 3>but he's just trimmed my beard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well go there again and you'll trim your</v>

<v Speaker 3>We might be able to get that.</v>

4583
03:12:11.430 --> 03:12:12.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a second place?</v>

4584
03:12:13.900 --> 03:12:17.990
<v Speaker 3>A second place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are some of the second place kid?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was the loser was the loser.</v>

4586
03:12:21.611 --> 03:12:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Get nothing does a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I get something to lose,</v>

4587
03:12:23.891 --> 03:12:25.360
<v Speaker 3>he gets dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

4589
03:12:26.470 --> 03:12:29.290
<v Speaker 3>It seems usually how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems exploitative.</v>

4590
03:12:29.530 --> 03:12:30.311
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The should get less,</v>

4592
03:12:33.581 --> 03:12:36.190
<v Speaker 3>but the losers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the losers should be compensated just</v>

4593
03:12:36.191 --> 03:12:37.360
<v Speaker 3>for competing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>150,000 hours.</v>

4630
03:14:04.781 --> 03:14:06.870

<v Speaker 3>yellow fever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamesy that they'd beat him up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should watch.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Get shorty into beer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4643
03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:37.160

<v Speaker 3>Get Baked and watch.</v>

4644
03:14:37.161 --> 03:14:40.010
<v Speaker 3>Get Shorty and talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll tell people to sync it up.</v>

4645
03:14:40.310 --> 03:14:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Let's do one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

4646
03:14:41.211 --> 03:14:44.660
<v Speaker 3>let's fucking do that for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen this movie and forever.</v>

4647
03:14:44.690 --> 03:14:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I barely remember anything in this</v>

4648
03:14:47.421 --> 03:14:49.550
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I might've seen this movie when it</v>

4649
03:14:49.551 --> 03:14:51.830
<v Speaker 3>came out and completely forgot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since then.</v>

4650
03:14:52.130 --> 03:14:54.920
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen it since.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it'll be a total surprise if Jamie</v>

4651
03:14:54.921 --> 03:14:57.150
<v Speaker 3>kills these previous calibrator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4652
03:14:57.290 --> 03:15:00.320
<v Speaker 3>Let's do one with Ryan Reynolds for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>van wilder.</v>

4653
03:15:00.890 --> 03:15:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4654
03:15:02.200 --> 03:15:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I is that going to be weird because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't seen it.</v>

4655
03:15:04.490 --> 03:15:05.450
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4656
03:15:05.451 --> 03:15:08.060
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never saw the movie that was based</v>

4657
03:15:08.061 --> 03:15:11.270
<v Speaker 3>on a story about your life in college?</v>

4658
03:15:11.570 --> 03:15:15.050
<v Speaker 3>That seems crazy to me too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to be honest about it.</v>

4659
03:15:15.170 --> 03:15:15.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4660
03:15:15.831 --> 03:15:18.410
<v Speaker 3>I never could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had the validation that I had</v>

4661
03:15:18.411 --> 03:15:22.280
<v Speaker 3>now in my life where his company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says that that's what it was based</v>

4662
03:15:22.281 --> 03:15:24.590
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'd take it say it on radio and so I</v>

4663
03:15:24.591 --> 03:15:26.900
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to ever watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I felt like I was lying.</v>

4664
03:15:27.050 --> 03:15:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Did they pay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know number?</v>

4665
03:15:29.910 --> 03:15:31.640
<v Speaker 3>That could be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awkward moment.</v>

4666
03:15:32.060 --> 03:15:33.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think Ryan Reynolds is into it.</v>

4667
03:15:33.970 --> 03:15:37.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's company says he's into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he'd be into it,</v>

4668
03:15:38.690 --> 03:15:43.220
<v Speaker 3>into watching it live with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all get baked and have a few drinks.</v>

4669
03:15:43.730 --> 03:15:45.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Ryan.</v>

4670
03:15:45.081 --> 03:15:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know him either.</v>

4671
03:15:46.430 --> 03:15:47.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why he'd invite them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even know him.</v>

4672
03:15:47.941 --> 03:15:50.340
<v Speaker 3>I like the assumption that he'd be like</v>
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

4673
03:15:50.550 --> 03:15:53.160
<v Speaker 3>Well they said they do loves gets baked</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the Internet.</v>

4674
03:15:53.190 --> 03:15:56.910
<v Speaker 3>They said he's a regular guest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said he'd do it on my podcast and I</v>

4675
03:15:56.911 --> 03:15:57.744
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do it.</v>

4676
03:15:57.780 --> 03:16:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Definitely do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who in who like took your story and</v>

4677
03:16:01.471 --> 03:16:03.380
<v Speaker 3>brought over there and profited from it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4678
03:16:03.540 --> 03:16:06.570
<v Speaker 3>some writer and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was never an issue because it</v>

4679
03:16:06.571 --> 03:16:10.320
<v Speaker 3>wasn't really you as based on you or</v>
<v Speaker 3>stories about you that they added a</v>

4680
03:16:10.321 --> 03:16:11.220
<v Speaker 3>bunch of 'em.</v>

4681
03:16:11.310 --> 03:16:14.610
<v Speaker 5>The option was made by a company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by an agency,</v>

4682
03:16:14.760 --> 03:16:19.590
<v Speaker 5>a literary agency and they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>took it and they sold it with me and the</v>

4683
03:16:21.540 --> 03:16:25.980
<v Speaker 5>writer of the article attached.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the are the movie had to be about a</v>

4684
03:16:26.220 --> 03:16:28.800
<v Speaker 5>journalist writing an article about a</v>
<v Speaker 5>party animal.</v>

4685
03:16:29.140 --> 03:16:32.430
<v Speaker 5>That was the caveat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then I got,</v>

4686
03:16:32.560 --> 03:16:36.990
<v Speaker 5>I discovered by will smith and that deal</v>
<v Speaker 5>fell apart and the oliver stone deal</v>

4687
03:16:36.991 --> 03:16:39.360
<v Speaker 5>fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then one of the producers are one of</v>

4688
03:16:39.361 --> 03:16:43.890
<v Speaker 5>the writers who had submitted scripts or</v>
<v Speaker 5>send a script in and it was moving</v>

4689
03:16:43.891 --> 03:16:46.200
<v Speaker 5>forward and they thought that was gonna</v>
<v Speaker 5>be the one when it fell apart,</v>

4690
03:16:46.201 --> 03:16:49.020
<v Speaker 5>he just took it and sold it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Van Monitor or to national lampoon</v>

4691
03:16:49.350 --> 03:16:52.080
<v Speaker 5>and they made a van mater.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4692
03:16:52.140 --> 03:16:55.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I didn't really have any attachment</v>

4693
03:16:55.381 --> 03:16:57.780
<v Speaker 5>to any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never got paid for any of it and I</v>

4694
03:16:57.781 --> 03:16:59.790
<v Speaker 5>didn't make any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time,</v>

4695

<v Speaker 3>boom during their adolescence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4820
03:21:42.460 --> 03:21:45.130
<v Speaker 3>like the big grew up with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the comedy fans,</v>

4821
03:21:45.260 --> 03:21:46.220
<v Speaker 3>comedy fans</v>

03:21:46.220 --> 03:21:49.220
<v Speaker 4>and the Internet boom is allowed them to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have access to everything.</v>

4823
03:21:49.640 --> 03:21:50.660
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we were kids,</v>

4824
03:21:50.810 --> 03:21:52.950
<v Speaker 4>we'd have to go find a bill cosby album.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4825
03:21:53.140 --> 03:21:55.190
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we used to have to find a kinison</v>

4826
03:21:55.191 --> 03:21:59.450
<v Speaker 4>cassette or a dice cassette.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had to go find a Richard Pryor CD,</v>

4827
03:21:59.480 --> 03:22:00.340
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4828
03:22:00.830 --> 03:22:02.570
<v Speaker 4>It was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to go seek it out.</v>

4829
03:22:02.571 --> 03:22:06.380
<v Speaker 4>Like now it's instantly the moment you</v>
<v Speaker 4>get it in your head that I would like to</v>

4830
03:22:06.381 --> 03:22:09.260
<v Speaker 4>see some comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost everyone has some kind of a</v>

4831
03:22:09.261 --> 03:22:14.261
<v Speaker 4>computer today to remember when you said</v>
<v Speaker 4>that when I used to open for Bert and</v>

4832
03:22:15.261 --> 03:22:16.960
<v Speaker 4>like really early on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4833
03:22:17.540 --> 03:22:21.740
<v Speaker 4>see how it hard he would kill like he</v>
<v Speaker 4>kills so much harder than most people</v>

4834
03:22:21.741 --> 03:22:26.741
<v Speaker 4>can understand and I would try to mimic</v>
<v Speaker 4>some version of what he was doing,</v>

4835
03:22:28.280 --> 03:22:31.370
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause like hit such this energy energy</v>

4836
03:22:31.371 --> 03:22:32.450
<v Speaker 4>and his the way he is.</v>

4837
03:22:32.460 --> 03:22:35.030
<v Speaker 4>So I'll go up there and I do my act but</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

4838
03:22:35.310 --> 03:22:37.250
<v Speaker 4>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4839
03:22:38.540 --> 03:22:41.450
<v Speaker 4>like he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like I had a friend who was like,</v>

4840
03:22:41.840 --> 03:22:44.390
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look real crazy up there right now.</v>

4841
03:22:44.690 --> 03:22:48.390
<v Speaker 4>He told me afterwards it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trying to be like best the best.</v>

4842
03:22:49.160 --> 03:22:53.120
<v Speaker 4>Maybe my favorite time in my friendship</v>
<v Speaker 4>with he is when uh,</v>

4843
03:22:53.930 --> 03:22:58.930
<v Speaker 4>when you bombed in Sacramento.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never enjoyed like,</v>

4844
03:22:59.001 --> 03:23:01.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's a real bad bomb too.</v>

4845
03:23:01.670 --> 03:23:05.210
<v Speaker 4>It was like what started it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a rape joke,</v>

4846
03:23:07.640 --> 03:23:12.640
<v Speaker 4>but</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was good,</v>

4847
03:23:12.770 --> 03:23:15.350
<v Speaker 4>at least tasteful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it was,</v>

4848
03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:18.600
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't like endorsing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was making it.</v>

4849
03:23:18.740 --> 03:23:20.100
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

4850
03:23:20.101 --> 03:23:22.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

4851
03:23:22.730 --> 03:23:27.730
<v Speaker 4>you remember Hurricane Katrina</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened and there were stories that,</v>

4852
03:23:28.490 --> 03:23:33.490
<v Speaker 4>that I think that and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the chaos people were getting raped</v>

4853
03:23:34.880 --> 03:23:38.300
<v Speaker 4>and I opened with something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like,</v>

4854
03:23:38.301 --> 03:23:40.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing like a floating corpse</v>

4855
03:23:40.731 --> 03:23:42.540
<v Speaker 4>to get me in the mood to fuck somebody.</v>

4856
03:23:43.180 --> 03:23:45.560
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I would elaborate on the story and</v>

4857
03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:50.800
<v Speaker 4>have joked that it would started there</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was the early show Friday and I</v>

4858
03:23:52.071 --> 03:23:54.950
<v Speaker 4>mean that now I did that and I get a</v>
<v Speaker 4>laugh and I'm telling you it's a full</v>

4859
03:23:54.951 --> 03:23:59.951
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got no laughs for the next 22 and a</v>

4860
03:24:00.291 --> 03:24:03.380
<v Speaker 4>half minutes and I know it was 22 and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>half minutes because I was supposed to</v>

4861
03:24:03.381 --> 03:24:05.480
<v Speaker 4>do 25 by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom had his hair,</v>

4862
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:07.700
<v Speaker 4>his hair was long at the time it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a comb over.</v>

4863
03:24:08.090 --> 03:24:10.220
<v Speaker 4>And what would happen is slowly as he</v>
<v Speaker 4>worked,</v>

4864
03:24:10.221 --> 03:24:12.380
<v Speaker 4>it would flatten onto his hat on his</v>
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>

4865
03:24:12.440 --> 03:24:14.090
<v Speaker 4>on his face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just be wet.</v>

4866
03:24:14.540 --> 03:24:15.860
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sweating a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4867
03:24:15.980 --> 03:24:18.050
<v Speaker 4>And then when I got upstaged the lady</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>

4868
03:24:18.290 --> 03:24:20.840
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were supposed to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

4869
03:24:20.880 --> 03:24:22.120
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4870
03:24:22.130 --> 03:24:24.200
<v Speaker 4>cause you're just like so vulnerable.</v>

4871
03:24:24.200 --> 03:24:25.011
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's The lady?</v>

4872
03:24:25.011 --> 03:24:27.680
<v Speaker 4>The booker and you've managed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

4873
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:29.330
<v Speaker 4>did you do any other sets there that</v>
<v Speaker 4>week?</v>

4874
03:24:29.390 --> 03:24:31.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a 10 o'clock show,</v>

4875
03:24:32.390 --> 03:24:35.960
<v Speaker 4>10 o'clock show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I opened the same way and I bombed just</v>

4876
03:24:35.961 --> 03:24:39.770
<v Speaker 4>as hard back to back 25 minute sets just</v>
<v Speaker 4>as hard.</v>

4877
03:24:40.890 --> 03:24:44.130
<v Speaker 4>And then I remember the host goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen a feature bomb like</v>

4878
03:24:44.131 --> 03:24:44.964
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was,</v>

4879
03:24:45.210 --> 03:24:46.860
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was the MC.</v>

4880
03:24:47.340 --> 03:24:50.640
<v Speaker 4>And then I really was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4881
03:24:50.641 --> 03:24:53.040
<v Speaker 4>like having to lie to myself at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hotel.</v>

4882
03:24:53.041 --> 03:24:54.270
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't what the fuck I'm doing.</v>

4883
03:24:54.271 --> 03:24:54.991
<v Speaker 4>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4884
03:24:54.991 --> 03:24:55.651
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4885
03:24:55.651 --> 03:24:56.790
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it unlike,</v>

4886
03:24:56.791 --> 03:24:59.460
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a shaky thing.</v>

4887
03:24:59.461 --> 03:25:01.890
<v Speaker 4>And then the next day burt goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4888
03:25:01.950 --> 03:25:03.000
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I tell you just one thing?</v>

4889
03:25:03.540 --> 03:25:04.440
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4890
03:25:04.441 --> 03:25:05.274
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

4891
03:25:05.310 --> 03:25:07.380
<v Speaker 4>just open on a different joke.</v>

4892
03:25:07.800 --> 03:25:10.520
<v Speaker 4>Just open a different joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do exactly everything else just opened</v>

4893
03:25:10.521 --> 03:25:12.750
<v Speaker 4>on different joke and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4894
03:25:13.530 --> 03:25:15.210
<v Speaker 4>I go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do what he said.</v>

4895
03:25:15.211 --> 03:25:18.930
<v Speaker 4>I have to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably the best that I've ever had.</v>

4896
03:25:19.560 --> 03:25:23.760
<v Speaker 4>And then I go to the manager who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>behind the curtain and the kitchen and I</v>

4897
03:25:23.761 --> 03:25:24.990
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4898
03:25:25.020 --> 03:25:26.850
<v Speaker 4>and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what did you do your set?</v>

4899
03:25:27.240 --> 03:25:29.520
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you definitely just heard what happened.</v>

4900
03:25:29.820 --> 03:25:31.620
<v Speaker 4>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's 300 people out there.</v>

4901
03:25:31.950 --> 03:25:34.260
<v Speaker 4>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it go well or was it just like last</v>

4902
03:25:34.260 --> 03:25:38.280
<v Speaker 4>night I was like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I went back and the same thing,</v>

4903
03:25:38.281 --> 03:25:41.100
<v Speaker 4>I did the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the second show just open differently</v>

4904
03:25:41.101 --> 03:25:41.940
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So through that,</v>

4907
03:25:45.220 --> 03:25:46.810
<v Speaker 3>it's hard if people don't know who you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

4908
03:25:46.811 --> 03:25:50.290
<v Speaker 3>If you jump out there and alienating him</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a fucked up joke and then they tell</v>

4909
03:25:50.291 --> 03:25:50.891
<v Speaker 3>me later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what they used to do.</v>

4914
03:25:59.891 --> 03:26:02.590
<v Speaker 3>They just sell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sell out the place for church.</v>

4915
03:26:02.591 --> 03:26:04.490

<v Speaker 3>performing for.</v>

4916
03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:08.650
<v Speaker 3>It'd be fine if they get drank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like Mormons,</v>

4917

4960
03:27:55.070 --> 03:27:57.700
<v Speaker 4>two w w what happened when they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did you take?</v>

4961
03:27:57.701 --> 03:27:59.260
<v Speaker 4>What did you write down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They gave me,</v>

4962
03:27:59.530 --> 03:28:00.660
<v Speaker 4>so I'm strapped down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

03:28:00.820 --> 03:28:02.190
<v Speaker 4>what they do when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>this starts to swell.</v>

4966
03:28:08.320 --> 03:28:12.190

<v Speaker 4>tracheotomy and they put tubes down</v>

4967
03:28:12.191 --> 03:28:14.620
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are strapped down so that you don't</v>

4968
03:28:14.621 --> 03:28:18.040
<v Speaker 4>pull the tubes out when you come to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I did like your,</v>

4969
03:28:18.041 --> 03:28:21.340
<v Speaker 4>your hands are really restricted and</v>

4972
03:28:26.590 --> 03:28:29.540

<v Speaker 4>I'm lefthanded for,</v>

4973
03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:33.520

<v Speaker 4>my right hand and strapped.</v>

4974
03:28:34.150 --> 03:28:36.160
<v Speaker 4>So they write like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>my sisters have never watched this</v>

5084
03:32:48.401 --> 03:32:50.040
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've heard it before that ever</v>

5085
03:32:50.080 --> 03:32:52.300
<v Speaker 3>watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They watched it with my wife and my</v>

5086
03:32:52.301 --> 03:32:55.330
<v Speaker 3>daughters yesterday and I came home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

5087
03:32:55.780 --> 03:32:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Tommy's lost a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5088
03:32:57.980 --> 03:33:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your dad has two and they're like,</v>

5089
03:33:00.221 --> 03:33:01.830
<v Speaker 3>I know what Tommy has lost a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>

5090
03:33:01.840 --> 03:33:03.640
<v Speaker 3>but they see your daily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see me daily,</v>

5091
03:33:03.641 --> 03:33:05.260
<v Speaker 3>but they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy is also a lot of weight.</v>

5092
03:33:05.470 --> 03:33:07.480
<v Speaker 3>That is a problem though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people are around you all the time,</v>

5093
03:33:07.481 --> 03:33:10.660
<v Speaker 3>they get used to a certain look and even</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it shifts radically over the course</v>

5094
03:33:10.661 --> 03:33:12.460
<v Speaker 3>of six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't notice it.</v>

5095
03:33:12.490 --> 03:33:16.060
<v Speaker 3>This one's going to take a while for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>family with the failed the mustache.</v>

5096
03:33:17.810 --> 03:33:19.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to trim it up a tad bit before</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go home,</v>

5097
03:33:19.840 --> 03:33:24.070
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the bottom part is a little tad</v>

5098
03:33:24.071 --> 03:33:27.820
<v Speaker 3>bit uneven and it looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agree to disagree.</v>

5099
03:33:27.850 --> 03:33:30.850
<v Speaker 3>If you want to trim it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all fine and dandy to trim it up</v>

5100
03:33:30.851 --> 03:33:32.470
<v Speaker 3>a tad bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the most I should stay and I'm</v>

5101
03:33:32.471 --> 03:33:34.570
<v Speaker 3>very happy you made that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5102
03:33:34.571 --> 03:33:37.000
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the mustache freak the fuck out.</v>

5103
03:33:37.050 --> 03:33:38.700
<v Speaker 3>They're going to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be fine.</v>

5104
03:33:38.701 --> 03:33:41.130
<v Speaker 3>We're happy to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be like this eating</v>

5105
03:33:41.131 --> 03:33:42.090
<v Speaker 3>dinner when we just odd.</v>

5106
03:33:42.150 --> 03:33:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I have a business meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5107
03:33:43.950 --> 03:33:45.180
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be laid for that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

5108
03:33:45.181 --> 03:33:45.661
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That cushion is very important.</v>

5111
03:33:50.151 --> 03:33:51.420
<v Speaker 3>But Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we have to leave?</v>

5112
03:33:51.660 --> 03:33:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Cause Tom's moving around like he has to</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave,</v>

5113
03:33:53.371 --> 03:33:55.650
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think he has to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to leave.</v>

5114
03:33:55.860 --> 03:33:57.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to leave either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy,</v>

5115
03:33:57.570 --> 03:33:59.850
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things you get off a</v>
<v Speaker 3>waffle state.</v>

5116
03:34:00.780 --> 03:34:03.630
<v Speaker 3>No one's your waffle date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the time.</v>

5117
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:05.970
<v Speaker 3>There's no time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No time decision.</v>

5118
03:34:06.270 --> 03:34:07.560
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good move.</v>

5119
03:34:07.640 --> 03:34:11.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Waffles are like pure enjoyment.</v>

5120
03:34:11.240 --> 03:34:15.360
<v Speaker 3>There's no illusion of nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when the crispy on the</v>

5121
03:34:15.361 --> 03:34:17.760
<v Speaker 3>outside and you could just tell us all</v>
<v Speaker 3>into something.</v>

5122
03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:20.620
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go fucking whole hog.</v>

5123
03:34:20.621 --> 03:34:23.220

5124
03:34:23.260 --> 03:34:24.800
<v Speaker 3>chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The souffle I talked about.</v>

5125
03:34:25.240 --> 03:34:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just making a decision to</v>

5126
03:34:26.971 --> 03:34:27.641
<v Speaker 3>indulge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

03:34:27.641 --> 03:34:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Just hardy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go deep.</v>

5128
03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Ever had a caviar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5129

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5130
03:34:34.860 --> 03:34:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Rod Stewart Daughter's party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first weekend I'll name drop out and</v>

5131
03:34:39.121 --> 03:34:42.600
<v Speaker 3>I had caviar so much I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't take it away.</v>

5132
03:34:42.650 --> 03:34:44.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't number five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took it away.</v>

5133
03:34:45.330 --> 03:34:47.790
<v Speaker 3>They took the caviar away from you if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating too much.</v>

5134
03:34:47.791 --> 03:34:49.560
<v Speaker 3>Eating so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'd never had it before.</v>

5135
03:34:50.190 --> 03:34:53.880
<v Speaker 3>They actually moved to the whole plate</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all the seafood and pulled it out of</v>

5136
03:34:53.881 --> 03:34:55.500
<v Speaker 3>the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

5137
03:34:55.620 --> 03:34:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Nicole [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicole Richie.</v>

5138
03:34:57.001 --> 03:34:58.260
<v Speaker 3>What's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How drunk were you?</v>

5139
03:34:58.261 --> 03:34:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Kimberly Stewart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sober.</v>

5140
03:34:59.660 --> 03:35:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Still sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just never had caviar.</v>

5141
03:35:01.230 --> 03:35:04.620
<v Speaker 3>So you were going at it so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They decided this guy's going to eat it</v>

5142
03:35:04.621 --> 03:35:08.160
<v Speaker 3>all and it's selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gluttonous rampage of caviar</v>

5143
03:35:08.161 --> 03:35:09.840
<v Speaker 3>consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Buddy Eddie was like,</v>

5144
03:35:09.841 --> 03:35:11.160
<v Speaker 3>if you're at caviar before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

5145
03:35:11.161 --> 03:35:11.791
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

5146
03:35:11.791 --> 03:35:12.624
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should try it.</v>

5147
03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:14.700
<v Speaker 3>So I tried it with like a cracker.</v>

5148
03:35:17.010 --> 03:35:17.731
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

5149
03:35:17.731 --> 03:35:19.890
<v Speaker 3>you should try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm in hall.</v>

5150
03:35:20.770 --> 03:35:23.160
<v Speaker 3>I was dipping into it like a guacamole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was</v>

5151
03:35:25.230 --> 03:35:28.050
<v Speaker 3>murdering it and they came out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>remove the whole plate.</v>

5152
03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:30.990
<v Speaker 3>It was like a like literally as you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>scooping or three people,</v>

5153
03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:33.120
<v Speaker 3>three foot plate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were moved it back to the kitchen</v>

5154
03:35:33.121 --> 03:35:34.560
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did that go?</v>
