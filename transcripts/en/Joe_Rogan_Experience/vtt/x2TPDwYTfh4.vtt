4
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.550
<v Speaker 1>did you check out my,</v>

5
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:05.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>special bombing episode that I earned?</v>

7
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.071
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

8
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:08.851
<v Speaker 1>you told me about it.</v>

9
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about it before the podcast.</v>

10
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.711
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

11
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>it's funny where I'll almost three hours then we were going to,</v>

12
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>we really mention it or two hours in.</v>

13
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.453
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck happened?</v>

15
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>You were up in Winnipeg as a Winnipeg.</v>

16
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.443
<v Speaker 1>I was um,</v>

17
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>doing this club that I've done many times called rumors.</v>

18
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.961
<v Speaker 1>It's the old club.</v>

19
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:29.961
<v Speaker 1>It's a good club and it was a Saturday night and instead of like regular comedy</v>

20
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:33.654
<v Speaker 1>club crowd,</v>

21
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.180
<v Speaker 1>it happened to be like private events.</v>

22
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>People like a group of 80 was doing their corporate party,</v>

23
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.481
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

24
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't like,</v>

25
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't individuals buying one and two tickets,</v>

26
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>which was a giant group,</v>

27
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.270
<v Speaker 1>giant groups.</v>

28
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>There was like three groups.</v>

29
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>One was like 81 was 60.</v>

30
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.933
<v Speaker 1>So you don't like,</v>

31
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>it's more like you're doing a corporate,</v>

32
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>like you're doing a private event,</v>

33
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>and I talk,</v>

35
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>I break it down if you,</v>

36
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>if you want to listen to,</v>

37
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.070
<v Speaker 1>it's episode one 72 of your mom's house and I play the audio from this thing</v>

38
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 1>falling off the rails.</v>

39
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it is like,</v>

40
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>there was a lady who worked at the club,</v>

41
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>she's been there 20 years and she told me,</v>

42
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:17.281
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

43
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen shit like that.</v>

44
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Even close to that before what happened?</v>

45
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

46
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's like a,</v>

47
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>a combination of things happening to them.</v>

48
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>They fall apart that way.</v>

49
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

50
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I went up there,</v>

51
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I had one guy in the front row who I fucking,</v>

52
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:36.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>when he'd just hate somebody and you fixate on them because like this one guy</v>

54
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>who was like kinda mumbling,</v>

55
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

56
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.591
<v Speaker 1>tagging my,</v>

57
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:45.280
<v Speaker 1>everything I saw no.</v>

58
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.541
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

59
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:45.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

60
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I bet you'd like that.</v>

61
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.101
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

62
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

63
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>What did you just say?</v>

64
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 1>One of those guys who I fucking absolutely lost my shit.</v>

65
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't lose my shit on them,</v>

66
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of tried to straighten them out.</v>

67
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And then there was one of the groups,</v>

68
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>one of the groups of like 50 50 60 people was like being super loud and like the</v>

69
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 1>first like really talking about when I went to talk to them,</v>

70
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>they were kind of like dis like kind of shitty about it.</v>

71
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is like,</v>

72
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>it's different when you,</v>

73
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>when you do a regular show and you,</v>

74
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>let's say you go after somebody or you go after a table,</v>

75
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you're just working on five people,</v>

76
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe write a group that like,</v>

77
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>but then everybody else in that room has nothing to do with them.</v>

78
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

79
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>In this case it was more like mob mentality where when I was like,</v>

80
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

81
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>go fuck yourself.</v>

82
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Then the group is like talking to us.</v>

83
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.971
<v Speaker 1>Not you're not,</v>

84
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:42.751
<v Speaker 1>you're not just talking to them.</v>

85
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to my group of 80 so then it was like,</v>

86
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:46.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

87
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>fuck you like,</v>

88
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>but in in unison there's all of them and then it just went.</v>

89
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Then I tried to put it back on the rails,</v>

90
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:54.541
<v Speaker 1>which I was like,</v>

91
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I can,</v>

92
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I've done this a thousand times.</v>

93
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Let me put this back together.</v>

94
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you man.</v>

95
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.013
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like,</v>

96
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

97
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>they were booing in unison for like 1520 minutes.</v>

98
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>The 80 people at this point,</v>

99
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.090
<v Speaker 1>it was more than their groups.</v>

100
00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>So it was probably 200 people doing that.</v>

101
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.913
<v Speaker 1>All my God.</v>

102
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>So is their group and then other groups chimed in and Saria Boeing.</v>

103
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>You two unrelated groups?</v>

104
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

105
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

106
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

107
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty crazy.</v>

108
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like,</v>

109
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>bring back the,</v>

110
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>I had a black feature act to like bring back the Black Guy,</v>

111
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>like screaming that screaming it man.</v>

112
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And it went and I,</v>

113
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.441
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

114
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I resigned to the fact that it was so crazy.</v>

115
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>It was less emotional.</v>

116
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I talk about this on that episode.</v>

117
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Then your standard bombing,</v>

118
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>you're bombing an irregular bond where it's just not going your way and you</v>

119
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>start to sweat and you're like,</v>

120
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:48.101
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

121
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>this fucking sucks.</v>

122
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Shoeing Dick's up here.</v>

123
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

124
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.631
<v Speaker 1>and that and that,</v>

125
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>like emotionally affects you.</v>

126
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
<v Speaker 1>This was different in that I felt like their response to me was so outrageous.</v>

127
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Like I felt like it was unwarranted.</v>

128
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>How upset they were that it affected me less.</v>

129
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I was just standing up there.</v>

130
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:09.934
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

131
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.901
<v Speaker 1>all right guys,</v>

132
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>here we are ready for some more jokes as they're booing me,</v>

133
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>like not as,</v>

135
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.600
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't as flustered as I've been during a reg.</v>

136
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.281
<v Speaker 1>Real bomb.</v>

137
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

138
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>So you were just dealing with a giant group of Conc yes.</v>

139
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>A school of cons.</v>

140
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

141
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Swimming through your pond.</v>

142
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

143
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

144
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Why did the club do something about that?</v>

145
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

146
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the only part I bikes I take responsibility,</v>

147
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I of that I tried to make it clear on that,</v>

148
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:38.881
<v Speaker 1>on that episode that like I'd take responsibility for yelling at a guy,</v>

149
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>for insulting people.</v>

150
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.531
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm saying,</v>

151
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I put it on myself that I made things go downhill.</v>

152
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.770
<v Speaker 1>The club takes responsibility for kind of not really policing and they like the</v>

153
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>one part is I tried to,</v>

154
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 1>I told a guy that he had to go.</v>

155
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.241
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

156
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>you have to go,</v>

157
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.793
<v Speaker 1>you're gone.</v>

158
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.443
<v Speaker 1>See you later.</v>

159
00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

160
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I've done that before.</v>

161
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to do that.</v>

162
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.621
<v Speaker 1>You're out of here,</v>

163
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

164
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

165
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>And then they were like,</v>

166
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 1>the club came and taught and they're like,</v>

167
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>just give him another chance.</v>

168
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be good now.</v>

169
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.493
<v Speaker 1>When I was like,</v>

170
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I've already thrown them out.</v>

171
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.843
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no,</v>

172
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>we're not negotiating now.</v>

173
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

174
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 1>So the club asked to keep the guy there.</v>

175
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.293
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

176
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>So that they do that.</v>

177
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

178
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

179
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>they now realize that that was fucked up.</v>

180
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Like I've talked to them and they were like,</v>

181
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

182
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>that was all some people you can give a second chance.</v>

183
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:25.871
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

184
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I've most likely,</v>

185
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.170
<v Speaker 1>most of the time I've asked clubs to leave people alone.</v>

186
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.001
<v Speaker 1>They're okay.</v>

187
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:31.834
<v Speaker 1>They're okay.</v>

188
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.750
<v Speaker 1>They're just not do that again.</v>

189
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 1>And he'll say that.</v>

190
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:35.051
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

191
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

192
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.260
<v Speaker 1>you can't yell shit out.</v>

193
00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Just too,</v>

194
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>too confusing.</v>

195
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I've done that a bunch of times.</v>

196
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Like he's okay.</v>

197
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

198
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.150
<v Speaker 1>But this time,</v>

199
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>the difference was this time I was saying,</v>

200
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>get them out of him out.</v>

201
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.640
<v Speaker 1>What was he saying to you?</v>

202
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:45.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

203
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:46.624
<v Speaker 1>this is going on.</v>

204
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

205
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>it was the fucking,</v>

206
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.560
<v Speaker 1>he was the Mumbler the the tower like,</v>

207
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>so we had our first interaction,</v>

208
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.600
<v Speaker 1>we had another interaction,</v>

209
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I think the third I said something to him,</v>

210
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.411
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

211
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did you say?</v>

212
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I forget exactly what he said.</v>

213
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.371
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>

214
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>oh you're a tough guy.</v>

215
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.091
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

216
00:06:06.091 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 1>do you want to step outside and find out?</v>

217
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.243
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

218
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>you can go outside cause you're out of here.</v>

219
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.463
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>

220
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Get out of my fucking show.</v>

221
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.133
<v Speaker 1>It's my show.</v>

222
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.033
<v Speaker 1>You're Outta here.</v>

223
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.941
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

224
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:17.680
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

225
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And His table.</v>

226
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.681
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

227
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:19.281
<v Speaker 1>we all go and go,</v>

228
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>great and have a great night.</v>

229
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

230
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.603
<v Speaker 1>I don't need you here.</v>

231
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>That's when the crowd was the problem.</v>

232
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>We felt like we were discussing what happened.</v>

233
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about it with the club.</v>

234
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:34.481
<v Speaker 1>The guy is that a lot of people in that room didn't hear what he was saying.</v>

235
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 1>He thought I was just attacking a guy for no reason.</v>

236
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:41.174
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

237
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

238
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.750
<v Speaker 1>But I still,</v>

239
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I take,</v>

240
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I was an asshole that night.</v>

241
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

242
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 1>the guy was clearly,</v>

244
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>he was instigating it.</v>

245
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

246
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>He was a fucking cunt.</v>

247
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>He was a real concept of guy and I didn't like him at all.</v>

248
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.133
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

249
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that like,</v>

250
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 1>like I always say,</v>

251
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to be like pleasing to the different,</v>

252
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.831
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

253
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:04.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm there doing comedy.</v>

255
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 1>You came to see my standup if you want,</v>

256
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:08.811
<v Speaker 1>if you're not liking it,</v>

257
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

258
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 1>But if you tried to take over the room,</v>

259
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

260
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Well it's not just taking over the room.</v>

261
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:15.320
<v Speaker 2>It's interfering.</v>

262
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

263
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:15.971
<v Speaker 2>It's interfacing,</v>

264
00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 2>interfering with the performance and it's,</v>

265
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 2>there's hundreds of other people that have to deal with the fact that you have</v>

266
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:22.680
<v Speaker 2>to deal with this guy.</v>

267
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

268
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.050
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

269
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 2>it's all in how to do it and not lose your cool and when you lose your cool.</v>

270
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:28.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

271
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:30.150
<v Speaker 2>So it's a fucking bad scene.</v>

272
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible feeling too.</v>

273
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.301
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

274
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 2>And the audio is insane.</v>

275
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

276
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 1>you've probably not heard alarming like that.</v>

277
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

278
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:39.111
<v Speaker 1>it's a different,</v>

279
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a standard bombing.</v>

280
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

281
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of aggression from,</v>

282
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>from the crowd on it.</v>

283
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 1>And how does it end?</v>

284
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

285
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 1>the best part and the only,</v>

286
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 1>cause I also was bummed at myself for not,</v>

287
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:49.731
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

288
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

289
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

291
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>you always look at moments where you're like,</v>

292
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had said something funny or here,</v>
