1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.290
Five four,
three,
two,
one.

2
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.190
<v 1>Yes.
And we're live Brian Callahan.</v>

3
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:18.480
We are live on the Internet in cashmere right now.
Everybody catch me.

4
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.080
How come you don't wear watches?
You were just saying I don't wear it.
I don't.

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.380
I was thinking kind of saying that Brennan,

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.130
you could rob my house and there's nothing you'd find a value like there's not a

7
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.180
fucking thing.
It's still your car.
Oh no

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.010
wonder why you make money then.
Yeah,
well a lot of money,
right?

9
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.490
I do believe like not work for years.
I,
yeah,
I have enough.

10
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.110
I make money but I never,
I was thinking about that too.
I can,

11
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.040
I genuinely,

12
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:51.300
I did some soul searching about this because I watched how motivated Chavez.

13
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.980
He's so buttoned down about his stuff.

14
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:57.981
He's just always coming up with ideas and I don't think I ever gave to Fox for

15
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:01.620
real about fame or money.

16
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.310
I still don't,
I have a very precarious relationship with that.

17
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.230
What I love is coming up with new ideas and writing new stand up and you know,

18
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.520
like now having done the album and now I've got to come up with a whole new bag

19
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:16.980
of tricks that that's a really fun time.

20
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.070
I'm probably more happy or never as happy as when I'm on the road at some cafe

21
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:24.030
somewhere coming up,
solving problems,

22
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:27.300
coming up with new ideas and surprising myself and everything else.
You know,

23
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.340
I like hanging with my boys and laughing and like having a nice house.

24
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.620
Do you get any pleasure out of having a nice house?
Yeah,
but I could live.
Uh,

25
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.400
I have lived in rudimentary places and I have,
I don't notice.
Yeah,

26
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.240
I noticed that when I,
when I first started making money,
you get,

27
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.530
everything gets normal.
Like this is your house.
Wake up.
It's normal.

28
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.280
You know what doesn't change wouldn't always makes you feel good as views.

29
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.450
I was about to say that I can't believe you just said that you is not
underrated.

30
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.620
No views or views are very underrated.
I said,
interesting.
You say that.

31
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:06.210
I just said that,
you know also that to me,
Ray Kurzweil,
really?
Yeah,

32
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:10.110
he always lives in a place with a view.
When I interviewed him,

33
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.200
he was on a very high floor in an apartment building in San Francisco.

34
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.060
That's where he lives.
And You out,

35
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.090
you look out from his apartment and you see the city and you see the bay and

36
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:26.460
it's beautiful.
Yeah,
it's expansive.
Yes.

37
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.400
He said views are very important to him.
They are.

38
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.230
But I have another weird thing that like if you put me in a French cafe,

39
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:37.080
there's that,
there's a,
I don't know if it's still around,
but there was a fuss.

40
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.830
I'm so French just,
he took a phone sale.
We should.
Uh,

41
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.850
so my accent,
Samsung launched the jazz for him.
I said,
I speak French fluently.

42
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.880
I'm Camo.
Do Jumbo.

43
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.480
How well do you speak it for the line?
No,
I mean I used to speak it.

44
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.410
I went to French schools in Lebanon.
Yeah.
Um,
you know,

45
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:03.130
I mean I can give me,
give me six months and I'm going to hop right back.

46
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.140
And then I think so the dating pool and from Shelly she see,

47
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.050
um,
what will you,
uh,
saying you're about to see something about?

48
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.590
You were in a cafe in France,
there's a place called Chez Paul,
which is,
uh,

49
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.580
this restaurant where you're crammed in with a bunch of people and,

50
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.390
and the walls and the wood has been there.
You know,
you go to the comedy store,

51
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.290
like a comedy,
like a comedy club that's been around since the 70s,

52
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.520
eighties yourself and you think these,
the wood in this,
this is a weird thing,

53
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:34.810
but the wood in these walls has it have absorbed so much laughter and good

54
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:38.770
energy.
I was just saying that the other day about the ice house.
Ah,
it's,
it's,

55
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.320
it's very special.
If they ever dump,
demolish that,

56
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:45.310
God forbid I would buy that wood and put it up on my walls.
Oh,

57
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.700
so you did it to match stuff.
Yes.
Magical stuff.
Yes.

58
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.960
I like things that last,
I like marble and,

59
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.200
and heavy would like old railroad tracks.

60
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.870
Reclaimed wood.
Yeah.
I like this table.
Yeah.
Good leather.
He was reclaimed wood.

61
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.180
Yeah.
A man with a mustache and one aid,
things like that.

62
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.990
It's handmade.
I do crafts like,
like,
like if I had,

63
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.090
if I wanted to,
I would maybe go and have my shoes made in London.

64
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:20.230
I'd have bespoke shoes be spoke.
Yes.
That when they use that high,

65
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:24.490
now I'd have bespoke shoes.
The problem with jewelry watches,

66
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.420
nice shoes and everything is I have to maintain them and I,
I,

67
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.130
I'd rather have.
Mm.
I also think we have to maintain watches.
Just put them on.

68
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.890
That's right.
But I have a weird,
I have another weird thing,

69
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:38.050
which I think if I have leather under my feet,

70
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.490
I don't feel as secure and I don't feel like I can run or fight.
Oh.

71
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:45.620
Like leather soles.
I need some,
I need some rubber bro.
I gotta.
Yeah,

72
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.220
you should have some tread.
Yeah.

73
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.880
They can put some leather tread below the rubber tread rather below the leather.

74
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.720
You don't want those scuffed up leather,
bottom shells.
Those bitches are useless.

75
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.920
Not Socks.
Right.
But it's good for pivoting.
If you want to pivot,

76
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.620
like you want to throw it wheel kick,
it's really good.
Yes.
It's true.

77
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.420
If you want to bear down,
if I want to,

78
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.670
let's call it squash the bug when I throw my right and squash the bug with my

79
00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:10.090
and my back foot.
No,
because you want to push off.

80
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.690
You want to have some something to push off.
You don't need that much pivot.

81
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.580
You really need pivot with a kick.
A spinning kick.
Yes.
Yeah.

82
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.540
This,
this is the kind of bullshit you and I still talk about it.

83
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.030
52 it's so that ever going to end,
well,

84
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.280
the fucked up thing is that w you know,

85
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.690
I am always getting ready for home invasion or a situation smart.

86
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.010
It might be the problem.
Is it that they're just too many things to worry about?

87
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:36.581
I can also,

88
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:41.170
I also have to worry about fucking ticks and things that I can't see like flesh

89
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:44.350
eating bacteria and Murcia worry about more than anything.
Honestly.

90
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.340
ASTEROIDAL impacts you too.
Yup.
Oh really?
Yeah,

91
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:51.610
because they can come and then wipe out civilization almost instantaneously.

92
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:55.630
There was something that I just retweeted a yesterday,
the Graham Hancock put up,

93
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:58.940
they found a new impact at 12,500

94
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 2>years ago,
that,
that coincides at the end of the ice age.</v>

95
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.130
This is one of the things that he and Randall Carlson had been saying ad nauseum

96
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:10.400
and now Brian or Robert Schoch rather,

97
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:14.170
who's a professor at Boston University.
Did you hear about the,
uh,

98
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.490
explosion on the media that exploded in December,
December?
Yeah.

99
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:23.350
This media that exploded in December had something like 50 times these men on

100
00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:27.800
earth power.
It didn't,
the atmosphere,
oh,
oh,
10,
10 atomic bombs,

101
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.090
10 times the power of the atomic bomb that exploded.
And Hiroshima.
Wow.
Yeah.

102
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.830
And it exploded in our atmosphere.
But no,
there's,
um,

103
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.630
this impact that they think happened and well,
there's two concepts.
Uh,

104
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.850
Robert Schoch thinks that it might've coincided.

105
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:46.100
These impacts might've coincided with,
uh,

106
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.400
he believes there's a great deal of evidence for a mass coronal ejection that

107
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:54.530
there was some sort of a,
a solar flare,

108
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.250
massive solar storm that happened,

109
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.010
which can periodically happen every few thousand,

110
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:05.180
every few hundred years something can happen.
And,
uh,
when that does happen,

111
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:08.570
it just wipes out everything.
And he said that there was thunderstorms.

112
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.770
It's like there's,
they'd sit thunderstorms or lightening storms that were like,

113
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.560
like the hail that was coming out outside that we filmed today.
Yeah.
But that,

114
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.960
but like lightning,
but that back please.
Jesus.

115
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.250
So this is the impact created that they found in Greenland.
Um,

116
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.500
it's 30 miles,
31 kilometers across,

117
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:30.080
which is not 15 miles.
Yeah.

118
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:33.980
Somewhere around 15 miles in fucking sanely.
Huge.

119
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.420
But do you think,
um,
as you think about your impending doom,

120
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.580
which is going to happen,
right?
I just worry about the civilization.

121
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.820
We're so dependent upon electricity and any small catastrophe,

122
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.130
oh,
this is,
they have an,
an impact video of where it hit.

123
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.270
Wow.
So it's all,
all this,

124
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:02.120
this hit like where there's glaciers right now,

125
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:05.600
but there's this massive impact they got hit man.
The,

126
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:09.650
the people that lived 12,500 years ago got hit.
They get,

127
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:11.480
there's more than one credit or two.
By the way.

128
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:16.530
This is one of the many craters that they found during the time period of 12,500

129
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:21.140
BC or 12,500 years ago rather to 10,000 years ago.

130
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.320
In that time period,
that 2000 year time period,

131
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:28.070
they think there was multiple impacts on the earth.
Why?
Why?

132
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.370
I guess it just wasn't our time now.
Well,

133
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.590
we're lucky we've just been through a really lucky stage,

134
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.600
but what he's saying essentially is that this is what wiped out the Egyptian

135
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.910
civilization,
the first Egyptian civilization.

136
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.980
This is what wiped out the civilization that built a called Beckley tappy.

137
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:51.010
This is what wiped out the civilization that preceded Sumir and ancient Babylon

138
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:55.980
and Mesopotamia,
that all those were rebuild

139
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.640
<v 1>of a,
I can't wait for him to come back on again.
He's coming back on again.</v>

140
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:02.730
Graham Hancock is coming back on again.
I think April,
the slam debate.

141
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:05.880
That other guy that you had on the podcast,
it was great.
Yeah,
wolves,

142
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:09.540
Michael Shermer,
who was actually a friend of mine who I like,
but he's,

143
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.550
he's a skeptic and there's an issue with skeptics and the,

144
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.020
the issue is not that it's not good to be skeptical.

145
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:17.210
It's very good to be skeptical.

146
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.130
The problem is when you approach things as a skeptic,

147
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:22.080
you're not approaching them as a scientist.

148
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:23.460
And I'm not saying that Michael Does this,

149
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.690
but that I think he did in that debate.
I think it was a mistake.
People,

150
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:32.691
they approach these things looking to debunk them rather than objectively

151
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:35.810
assessing all the possible evidence.
Right.

152
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.570
And so because of that you miss out on big thing like this is evidence,

153
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:43.170
this is a not like big foot tracks or some shit like that.

154
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:48.170
This is fucking real evidence of a crater that they have dated back to 12,500

155
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:49.621
years ago.
Yeah.

156
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:54.621
But people have a hard time believing in doomsday scenarios and because it kind

157
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:56.280
of like,

158
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.580
you know when you talk about taking the entire chessboard and throw it in the

159
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:03.960
air and you have evidence for it,
look at global warming and stuff like that.

160
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.830
There is a,
I really believe that people have,

161
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.100
whether it's late and are not a religious notion that we are ultimately sacred

162
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.900
and that God would never do something that terrible to us on moss.
And I really,

163
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.040
I really believe that like humanity itself to go away.
No,

164
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.600
because that would make no sense where we're moving in a certain direction.

165
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.230
We're making progress.
There's,
there's this sort of neural net.

166
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:36.210
It's becoming easier to understand what it is to be each other.
Uh,
you know,
uh,

167
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.380
and,
and that's kind of what virtual reality and being able to download other

168
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:44.700
people's brains will eventually do.
That probably brings us into one,

169
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.420
I guess universal consciousness.
I mean,
you can go on and on.

170
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.990
So the idea that that would be all be obliterated before it happens.

171
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:55.800
Before the singularity,
for example,
what happens is too much to bear.

172
00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.810
It would make no sense for us because we have this narrative that we all kind of

173
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.660
adhere to.
It's very easy to do that.
Well,

174
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:08.040
it's a little psychological sort of,
sort of,
I want to say,

175
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.740
I want to say a trick that we play on ourselves,

176
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.480
but it's really a defense mechanism.

177
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.040
It's a little trick that we try to pretend that we're important.
God dammit.

178
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.700
Just look up at the sky and although you can't see it,

179
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.360
there are stars that are being swallowed up by black holes.
Yeah.

180
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.680
Like if the universe doesn't give a fuck about something that's a million times

181
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:29.514
bigger than the earth,

182
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.110
why would you think it gives a fuck about you eating stars?

183
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.450
That's a terrible question.
Most people,
that's a terrible insulting question.

184
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.170
The problem,
you know,
that's kind of what,
um,
uh,
who has an Albert Kamoo,

185
00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:44.670
the French existentialist and start and all those guys,
they were saying like,

186
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:47.400
come,
who said the,
the fundamental question is why wouldn't you,

187
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.960
why not just commit suicide?

188
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.900
Because everything is totally absurd and nothing means anything,
right?

189
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:54.970
It's like the rock of sis that you keep pushing up and it keeps rolling down.

190
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.800
And then he said,
but,
but the truth is most people don't want to kill themselves,

191
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:01.960
but they'll commit philosophical suicide.

192
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.010
Meaning instead of like really starting to ask these questions and really

193
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:10.330
getting into it and realizing that it's all hopeless in despair,
you know,
you,

194
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.560
you just,
you just glom on to a certain philosophy that gives you hope,

195
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.740
religion or whatever it might be,
which is what it is.

196
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.120
And maybe the way out of that is just to enjoy every day,

197
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.960
taste your food,
enjoy your friends and realize that it could end in any,

198
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.350
in any second.
You know,
one another thing that's fucked with me,

199
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.560
the concept of reincarnation,
not the concept of re incursion,

200
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.020
coronation look coming back as a butterfly or something like that.

201
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.260
But the concept of living your life over and over and over again until you get

202
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:45.610
it right.
Oh Jesus.
Now here's what fucks with me.

203
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.370
I am having a great time.

204
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.930
So why wouldn't I want to do this again?
I'm having a great time.

205
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:57.140
I have great friends like you and young Jamie over there and I have,

206
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.040
I love my family.
I love what I do for a living.

207
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.310
I love our circle of friends is amazing.
I mean,

208
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:08.311
we are for sure some of the luckiest men I've ever met in my life.

209
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.920
There's no doubt.
There's no doubt we have fun,
man.
Dude,

210
00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:14.410
I was thinking about all the mistakes I've made,
but then I went,
wait a minute,

211
00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:19.330
but I'm here.
52 I'm here.
I've made a fuck load of mistakes.
We all are.

212
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:24.160
We are,
but we're also risk takers.
I mean,
we're professional performers.

213
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:29.140
We want to a job that has zero job security.
Yeah,
fucking head first,

214
00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:32.290
no safety net.
Dove right in.
You know,

215
00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:36.670
we make mistakes when we make mistakes with our,
our job.

216
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:39.560
We make mistakes with our personal life and make a mistake with it.

217
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:43.440
There's just no [inaudible],
no way of knowing because,

218
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.020
because I don't have a dress rehearsal,
I'm a presented with these.

219
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.450
I'm presented with the scenario.
I have to make a choice in real time.

220
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.320
I'm going to make a mistake.
And,

221
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.970
and once I realized that and stop beating myself up about it and realize that

222
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.600
I've always done the best I can.
But here's where you,
here's what you can do.

223
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.950
Be brutally honest and assess yourself and see where you're falling short and

224
00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:06.490
then just change your approach.
So that's kind of what I do.
When I saw acting,

225
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:11.491
when I saw what just being an actor was and I saw how precarious it was and I

226
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:16.480
saw where the business was moving with the like new media and stuff and I was

227
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.040
like this doesn't make I.

228
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.030
Then I watched you doing your podcast and you would say start up high.

229
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.640
So guess what?
I started a podcast,
didn't go well,
start another podcast,

230
00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:25.180
didn't make money,

231
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.120
then started a third podcast with Brennan shop and Blah Blah Blah.

232
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.600
But you know it's same thing with stand up.
You just keep doing it.

233
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.170
You keep following the models that work cause I was doing it the wrong thing

234
00:14:35.171 --> 00:14:38.930
over here.
And next thing you know,
you know you've got to grind underground.

235
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.600
That's where a lot of comics fuck up.

236
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.680
Like they do it like once a week and then they take a few weeks off and then you

237
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:48.190
come back and do it again.
And they're like,
how do you do it all the time?

238
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:51.470
I'm like,
cause I know how to grind.
I'm a grinder.
It's not just grind.

239
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:54.800
Like for me the idea is original self expression.

240
00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.220
I'm interested in trying to take the way I think so a lot of things scare me and

241
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:04.290
they make me angry and I don't know how to know how to react,
but you know,

242
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.910
instead of fretting about it,
I create,
you know Michelangelo,
my favorite quote,

243
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.960
criticized by creating a great fucking Croak and he said that's beautiful.
Yeah,

244
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.700
he said that.
He said criticized by creating.

245
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:18.701
I always think about that because that's kind of when I look at my body of work

246
00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:24.230
in the progression of my,
my specials for example,
like man class a little too,

247
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.690
you know,
just about being funny in a silly goose.

248
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.080
Then never grew up a little more personal but my dad,
but then this last one,

249
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.340
complicated apes.
Where's my camera out right now?
It's out right now.
Oh my God.

250
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:38.260
Is this the number one iTunes comedy albums,
rank things.

251
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.310
Apparently it's crushing and anywhere you could.

252
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:42.620
It's number one in the world where you can rent and buy.

253
00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:44.450
I guess complicated apes is doing very well.

254
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:47.850
If you want to get it and laugh hard and learn,
feel like we should celebrate.

255
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.090
This is not one.
This is not about promoting my special.

256
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.020
We should feel you should promote it a little bit.
All right,
fine.

257
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.470
Get complicated.
[inaudible] let's just get that right now.
Right?

258
00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.450
I guess it's out right now on iTunes or anywhere you are.

259
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.740
[inaudible] terrible TV.
You could just watch it on your TV,
Xbox or playstation.

260
00:16:03.741 --> 00:16:07.340
You can listen to how you can get on Amazon.
I don't stop any platform.

261
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:11.780
All the platforms.
You know,
Amazon is really getting into the special games.
Yes,

262
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:16.190
they are doing Alonzo Boden special.
He's going to be coming on soon.
Love Alonzo.

263
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.160
They're doing a good man.
He's a very smart guy.
Check.
Good Dude.

264
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.810
Um,
they're doing Jim Gaffigan special.
He's fucking hilarious.
Um,

265
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:26.400
and um,

266
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.810
I think they're talking to a bunch of other people but doing specials as well.

267
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.620
They decided to,
I love that there are all these other people love it.

268
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.470
And we're in the renaissance where we're stamps can make real money.

269
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:38.540
It used to not be that way.
You had clubs,

270
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.500
now you got theaters now you got a whole network now,

271
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.580
the Internet and everything else.
And what's beautiful about,
um,

272
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.430
the road now is I don't have to do that local press.
Oh,
that's so good.

273
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:52.860
Come see me in Kansas City this Friday,
Saturday and Columbia doing the Improv.

274
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.700
Louis Kansas City.
I love Kansas City.
Kansas City's,
I like it a lot.

275
00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:02.990
It's fucking,
Oh hell yeah.
I did an outdoor theater there the summer.
Yeah,

276
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:07.010
it was fucking great.
Me and seeing Tino really fucking amazing man.

277
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:11.980
Really an outdoor theater.
Really Fun.
That's pretty bad ass.
Yeah.

278
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.320
Kansas City's a shit.
It's one of those places that people forget.
St Louis.

279
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:19.280
That's also the sh the shit.
That's a fun place.
But to me it's terrible town.

280
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.280
Now here's how,
how dare you,
first of all,
barbecue St Louis,

281
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:24.310
I had a little problem with,
but Kansas City.
Fantastic.

282
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.870
What kind of problems you have?
I just thought it was very ugly city.

283
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.010
Maybe you're generalizing,
maybe.

284
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.760
Maybe you didn't go to the pretty spot which go over like Kugler.

285
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.330
He'd drive all over the whole fucking city.
I drove around.
How about Cleveland?

286
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.250
This is where we draw the line.
I like cleaning.
I fucking love clean.

287
00:17:38.251 --> 00:17:40.340
Let me tell you why.
Like leaving.
It's a beautiful city.

288
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:44.500
I mean talk about architecture.
It's like Pittsburgh,
us and some great holidays.

289
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.090
He said like Pittsburgh.
Yes,
that's true.
That's totally true.
It's wet.

290
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.010
It's where the oil.
But then at some of the,

291
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.000
<v 2>the iron,
I mean it was,</v>

292
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:53.520
I think Clinton was where some of the richest people in the world where at one

293
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:57.240
point last time I was in Pittsburgh.
Well,
the first time rather,
I said,
well,

294
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.670
not even the first time.
One at a time.
So I was in Pittsburgh.

295
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.860
I was there for a furry convention.
Oh,

296
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.340
I was there for the UFC and the UFC was in Pittsburgh at the same time.

297
00:18:05.341 --> 00:18:08.820
A furry convention was on it.
That's when I found out about furries.

298
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:14.240
I had a nice long conversation with the dudes who work behind the desk at the

299
00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:17.670
hotel.
They were telling me the firies were asking for their food in bowls.

300
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.330
They can eat off the ground.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They were all furries except us.

301
00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.970
Like the fuck is going on.
Went with me.
I forget who opened for me.

302
00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:26.970
It might've been Dunkin,
but um,
the,

303
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.740
they were asking for a litter box so they could shit and piss in a box.

304
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:36.270
I want to do that now.
You don't just for a laugh.
How are you gonna Wipe?

305
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.410
Where are you going to finish fetish?
Well,
it's like grown men who want to be a,

306
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:43.050
they want to wear diapers and have somebody spanked them and change them.

307
00:18:43.051 --> 00:18:47.730
And well,
here's what's interesting and there's a lot of people that think that,

308
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.010
look,
I am a hundred percent in support of people being trans.

309
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.050
Don't get me wrong.
If you want,
I'm in sport.

310
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.530
I'm supporting you being whenever you want to be a person who believes in

311
00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.390
freewill or,
or your,
your ability to freely express yourself,
I should say.

312
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.260
But if you work for a corporation,
you work for a Tech Corporation,

313
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.310
especially a particularly Progressive Tech Corporation.

314
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.290
You run into some real problems.

315
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:18.420
And I was talking to a guy who was telling me the,
you don't know the half of it,

316
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.270
that we're dealing with a guy who,
uh,

317
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:25.660
he identifies as an animal and that he,
he,

318
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.420
he believes that he's kin,

319
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.990
like he's a fox kin or a dog can or something like that,

320
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.690
and he wants a litter box in his office.

321
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:38.590
This guy wants to be able to shadow in his fucking office into a,

322
00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:42.390
a box of,
now I,
I appreciate that.

323
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.250
Now I want to say this about him,

324
00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:47.040
and I'm not a psychiatrist and I have no right to really diagnose,

325
00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:50.880
but he's fucking crazy.
He is crazy.
Right?
But here's the thing,

326
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:55.860
like you're letting people be crazy correct when you're letting a six foot four

327
00:19:55.861 --> 00:20:00.861
man compete in women's weightlifting because he's decided that he's a woman now

328
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.760
and,
and now he's winning and he's wearing makeup and he looks like a gorilla and

329
00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:09.540
he's on stage lifting his arms up.
Yay.
Diversity.
You're,

330
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.290
you're stealing from women's stealing,
you're stealing victory,
cheating,

331
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:15.780
you're cheating.
You're fucking 100% cheating.

332
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.590
Anybody says or not you're an asshole,
you're an asshole.
But you know,

333
00:20:19.591 --> 00:20:22.800
this is about humanness.
And when,
when,

334
00:20:22.801 --> 00:20:27.330
when someone's feelings,
how they identify in that moment,

335
00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:31.410
which of course is so transitory,
right?
I mean I'm,
I the hope my fucking,

336
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.790
not to bring it back,
but the whole idea of complicated apes is this,
your,

337
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:39.480
your new specialties and it's available basically everybody,
right?
Amazon,

338
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.640
you could get it on iTunes.
You have it.
It does.

339
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.010
Oh my God.
And wherever the fuck under here,
if I look

340
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.300
<v 1>in your sock drawer,
there's my specialty is in your sock drawer.
But,
but,
but I,</v>

341
00:20:52.301 --> 00:20:53.740
but I do think that,
you know,

342
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.310
we are complicated like were were bipolar apes,

343
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:01.390
sinners and saints and everything in between.
None of it.
Your feelings,

344
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.390
how you feel.
Sometimes I feel like an asshole.

345
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.850
And other times I feel like a saint and everything in between you,
you know,

346
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.440
it's very difficult to say,
well,
this is your a noun,
which means you're,

347
00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:13.480
this is opposed to sort of a verb,

348
00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:17.320
which is I'm always changing and that that to me is the problem with when you

349
00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:21.160
identify,
when you,
when you emotionally identify with something,

350
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.480
well for now you do for now that that's what's important to you.

351
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:30.250
But I can't,
I can't tailor my life and my entire corporation,

352
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.070
this is what the part of the problem is and this is what you just hit on.

353
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.950
Part of the problem is these people want to be special for no reason at all.

354
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.260
Correct.
And so to be special for no reason at all,

355
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:42.280
one of the best ways is to do a Bruce Jenner.
Did you become Caitlyn Jenner?

356
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.360
And then he special.

357
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:48.340
That guy was a fucking loser even though he was a gigantic superstar in the

358
00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:49.570
Olympics 40 years ago.

359
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.250
But from then on they shat on that guy every fucking show.
That's right.

360
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.400
They shit on him.
He was the buffoon of that show.

361
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.720
And then all of a sudden he becomes a woman ever.
It's like,
you're amazing.

362
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:05.050
And we'll meet women the year after I a woman for six months.

363
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.860
All the women that do things I cribbed Christina Dowd know came up with Chris

364
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.290
because CRISPR cas nine and all those one.
Oh,
is this the guy?
Okay,

365
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:14.820
this is hilarious.
This is a dude who's a comic,
is a comic.

366
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.190
He's a rapper and he's fucking jacked.

367
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.540
So he decided to identify as a woman wanted me to.
So,

368
00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:26.700
and if he destroys the British women's deadlift record without even trying.
Wow.

369
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.310
Psi identified as a woman whilst lifting weights don't be a bigot.

370
00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:35.260
I love his mom and he's so jacked.
Imagine that.

371
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:39.370
So two biological men don't have any physical strength advantage over women in

372
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:43.390
2019 okay.
Anybody says that is a fool.
That's foolish.

373
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.470
There's a reason why.
Yeah,
good for him.
What's his name?
Zuby.
Zuby.

374
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.840
Zuby is his stage name.
Shout out to Zubin Oxford graduate.

375
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.770
It doesn't that mean you're a Rhode Scholar?
Zubie congratulations to you,
sir.

376
00:22:56.771 --> 00:22:59.560
I'm following you right now.
I'm going to go right to my God damn.

377
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:03.010
Twitter for free is a free,
God bless you.
Look,

378
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:08.011
it's like this is silliness for six these and here's the problem with a lot of

379
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:12.540
these progressive's is that they're really nice people.
That's what it is to be.

380
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.400
Follows me and now I follow him.
Shout out to Zubin.

381
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.070
They're nice people as long as you agree with them.
Yes,
exactly.

382
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.420
Don't they tried to Ddi platform you?
I got listed.
Tim Pool sent me this thing.

383
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:27.530
Ready next to Richard Spencer as being a far right influenced me.

384
00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:34.450
Far right was it?
They called me far right.
That's amazing.
I'm left.

385
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:39.470
They're liars.
I am fucking left.
Did that ball.

386
00:23:39.471 --> 00:23:43.330
You know the socialist?
Yeah.
I consider universal basic income.

387
00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:46.040
Have really good idea.
I want free college education

388
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.470
<v 2>could easy.
I would like to spend more in taxes.</v>

389
00:23:48.471 --> 00:23:52.400
If they could fix inner city communities and take these poor neighborhoods and

390
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:55.750
we spent a lot of them spend more you fucking Republican.

391
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.440
The more money you spend,
it doesn't.
The problem is money doesn't solve problems.

392
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.420
That's the price and you son of a bad deal.
It coming out of your pores,

393
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.480
you socialists,
why don't you leave my country?
It's 6% African.

394
00:24:05.481 --> 00:24:07.430
So watch your fucking mouth,
dude.

395
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:11.150
No one cares is so compassionate.

396
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.900
Compassion is everything.
But I think these people were too compassionate.

397
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.830
This is what the problem is.
They're like,
oh,
you identify as a Wood Elf.
Oh cool.

398
00:24:18.831 --> 00:24:22.700
You're an Elf.
I don't want to,
I didn't,
you know,
like whatever your feelings,

399
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.790
and here's the thing.
They're terrified of someone coming after them.

400
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.840
So they tried to embrace the more preposterous,
the better.
Yeah.
Like they're,

401
00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.990
they're having a real hard time now with this woman,
the congressman,

402
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.510
you know who said a bunch of antisemetic Shia,
they stop,
right?

403
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:38.463
Antis really shit.

404
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:44.050
Is it antisemetic has she said anything bad about Jews and general anti Israeli

405
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.110
stuff,
which,
which I think you can make a distinction,
I think,
be able to,

406
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.010
I think you should be able to make an intelligent argument that there is a

407
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:55.160
difference between being not anti Israeli,

408
00:24:55.161 --> 00:25:00.161
but having problems with their policies and Jews because there are a lot of Jews

409
00:25:00.921 --> 00:25:05.410
that are critical of Israel as well.
100%.
Yeah.
So it's,
you know,

410
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.600
but sometimes to silence you and stop the argument.
I don't,

411
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:12.600
I'm not familiar with what she said exactly,
but I'm not either.
Yeah.
Um,
but,

412
00:25:12.601 --> 00:25:17.420
but yeah,
but go on.
What were you saying about,
about uh,
the problem,

413
00:25:17.421 --> 00:25:18.710
they don't know what to do with her.

414
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.040
They're stuck in this weird spot because they don't like,

415
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:26.270
here's a perfect example.
Where was it?
Um,
was there,

416
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.780
so it was somewhere in Europe where these,

417
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:34.810
this Muslim group was shouting down this LBGT demonstration and the like,

418
00:25:37.191 --> 00:25:39.380
everybody's like,
oh,
well,
Jesus,
what do we do here?

419
00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:42.440
We have to protected classes going to war with each other.

420
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.810
And one of them is shouting down.

421
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:48.800
The other one's saying that homosexuality is forbidden by God,

422
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.650
but then we're supposed to be protective of LBGT.

423
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:55.450
People were supposed to be open minded and progressive and allowing them.
But,

424
00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.700
but then you have these people who were saying that it's their religion,

425
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.410
that they think that this is,
this is wrong.
And this is also a protected class.

426
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.300
You don't want to be Islamophobic.

427
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.090
So what does everyone do it where everyone stands back.

428
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.290
And this is one of the weird moments where people are standing back while Lbgt

429
00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:15.560
people were getting absolutely crucified in the streets,

430
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.450
yelled at with bullhorns,

431
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.810
told her being they're sinners in blast females,

432
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:24.030
that that actually is part of free speech,
right?
So,

433
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.500
so it's part of organized and expressed yourself.

434
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.200
Organize in petition your government that's constitutional.

435
00:26:30.201 --> 00:26:34.790
As long as you don't incite someone to violence,

436
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.200
as long as you don't say,
Hey,
you guys go kill those gay people over there.

437
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.050
Well I'm not talking about constitutionally,
constitutionally.

438
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:44.010
I agree it is free speech.
But what

439
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.660
<v 1>I'm saying is that there's no outrage.
There's no commensurate outrage.</v>

440
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.930
Like there would be if say like white nationalists were screaming at these

441
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:56.760
people.
So,
so here's my issue with the far left or the left,

442
00:26:56.761 --> 00:27:00.840
or even,
I forget the right for a second.
I have my own issues with that.
But my,

443
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.000
what the progressive argument,

444
00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:07.850
I always noticed that the narrative is very binary.
The narrative is always a,

445
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:12.780
so for example,
uh,
racism as the argument,
right?
So we need to get rid of racism.

446
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.320
I happen to think we could be as identical as penguins and we'd still find

447
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:19.620
reasons to break into US versus them.
Well,
we'd have an ideological,

448
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.540
but of course we did look,
look at the Middle East.
If racism is the,

449
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.890
was the the ultimate problem,
then the Middle East would be fairly,

450
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.980
would be a Sunni and Shia,
the Ebo and Yoruba.

451
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.160
I mean I can keep going with the,
there'd be all kinds of,

452
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.940
so people are looking at the Dinka and the new of the sedan sworn enemies,

453
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:36.960
they look exactly the same.

454
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.890
So human beings don't need to have different colored skin.
I couldn't agree more.

455
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:42.000
Yeah.
So,
so,

456
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.960
so we are tribal and it's fun to break into these us versus them.

457
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:50.010
I think the biggest problem is,
is kind of deciding that first of all,

458
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.760
the Internet has made it very possible for you to purify your echo chamber.
Yeah.

459
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.940
That's a big problem.
And,

460
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.720
and then you surround yourself with people who think and,

461
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.280
and see the world exactly like yourself.

462
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.650
And I think we get smarter when we listened to the other side of me.

463
00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:09.840
If you don't agree with them because your ideas aren't working and their ideas

464
00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:10.261
are working,

465
00:28:10.261 --> 00:28:14.460
but put your ideas together and maybe somebody gets pregnant with a new idea,

466
00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.420
you know the,

467
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:20.420
the ideas that there's some way that you could stop all division between human

468
00:28:22.021 --> 00:28:22.440
beings.

469
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.900
As long as people are allowed to express themselves and they live unique and

470
00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:26.580
individual lives,
that's never gonna happen.

471
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.190
You're gonna have people that come from different parts of the world where

472
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:30.450
different things are more important.

473
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.540
You're going to have people that come from different economic situations.

474
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.830
It's going to be different.
I mean,
when,
when I say that I'm almost a socialist,

475
00:28:37.831 --> 00:28:39.330
what I mean is like,
look,

476
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.200
there's certain things that we just accept that we need.
Like here's one.

477
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.700
You need a well funded fire department,
right?
Who's,
who's money?

478
00:28:47.701 --> 00:28:50.910
Everybody would pull in all our money into that grind.
Right?
We agree with that.

479
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.140
We agree there's well funded public education.
You have to have that right.

480
00:28:55.141 --> 00:28:56.970
While we barely do that right now,

481
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.050
but we do have that teachers are getting fucked left and right.

482
00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:02.220
They're getting minimal pay.

483
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.630
Children are going to school in hazardous conditions but it's at least there's

484
00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:11.220
some money being pumped.
Police officers,
we agree so street fixing the streets.

485
00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:15.510
We agree.
We agree on a lot of things,
but then it gets to certain things.
We go,

486
00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:18.260
okay,
well that's where we draw the line.
Well why do we draw the line there?

487
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:22.950
Why do we draw the line when it comes to community up peoples like fixing,

488
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.450
fixing communities.
Why do we mean infrastructure?
Like chill.

489
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.620
Why do,
why?
Why don't we have like why don't we,

490
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.630
if we really a team or if the United States really team,

491
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:38.760
why don't we look at it as a team in terms of equal allocation of resources to

492
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:41.920
solve conflicts and problems including crime.
We don't.

493
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.520
We do a lot of times the problem is isolating the source of the problem,
right?

494
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:52.150
So people disagree on what the actual problem is.
I can give you examples.

495
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:53.110
I mean when,

496
00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:56.260
when we talk about illegal immigration and what to actually do about it,

497
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.820
people are all over the board with it and they'll challenge your solution in

498
00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:03.640
court and there's all kinds of steel and they switched probably is a good thing.

499
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.670
So things don't get too,
they don't swing too far.
And I think interaction,

500
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.110
a universal basic income,
universal healthcare con control,

501
00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:14.500
these are actually fairly complicated issues.
You know,

502
00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:18.430
I don't want spree shooters,
you know,
but when you get down to it and,

503
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.120
and you hear people that are really educated on the subject of guns,

504
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.160
they can get you twisted up in an argument.

505
00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:27.370
If you start talking about gun control because you realize this is a complicated

506
00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:30.570
issue and maybe it's a mental health issue,
maybe it's a thousand issue,

507
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.370
there's a lot of issues with it.
But the ability that someone has to do,

508
00:30:36.371 --> 00:30:40.480
what is it wizard only one guy,
more than one person got arrested in New Zealand,

509
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.010
correct?
No,
I think it was just one guy.

510
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.730
They got arrested but only one shooter as far as I know.

511
00:30:45.731 --> 00:30:48.730
So the other ones were planning it is out there,
maybe.
Yeah,
no,

512
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.350
I think he was saying.
Yeah,
but,
but my,

513
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:53.700
my thing is that point is that you have to be ill.
There's no other way.

514
00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.890
You do have to be mentally ill nor to do that.

515
00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.490
Now I want you to think about the fact there's more guns in there are people.

516
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.660
So in this country alone,
there's 300 plus million people.

517
00:31:04.661 --> 00:31:08.230
There's more than 300 million guns,
relatively speaking.

518
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:13.500
The number of mass shootings is incredibly small in comparison to the amount of

519
00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:18.661
guns and the amount of sick people and how many people are sick who don't become

520
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:23.020
mass shooters.
Right?
It's a big number.
Yes,
it's very true.
Those are things.

521
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:26.350
And a lot of the gun violence,
uh,
that the left talks about,

522
00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:30.070
a lot of those are suicides.
So a lot of it.
Yeah,
a lot of that of suicides.

523
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:33.790
A lot of it is cops shooting bad guys,
a lot of his people defending themselves.

524
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.770
And then after that you have gang violence.
But so,

525
00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:39.010
so let's say the problem is that when people argue they make these things very

526
00:31:39.011 --> 00:31:43.870
simplistic and they're not,
you know,
even the,
even identity politics.
I mean,

527
00:31:43.871 --> 00:31:46.330
you know,
straight white males are essentially the enemy.

528
00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:50.680
So the idea would be if we take straight white males out of the equation,

529
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:54.340
because this is all power,
right?
It's all talking to Amy Schumer links now,

530
00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.390
but I know I'm not.
But this tyrannical hierarchy and stuff as if,

531
00:31:58.391 --> 00:32:01.960
if you took white males and took all of them out of the equation as if there

532
00:32:01.961 --> 00:32:04.930
wouldn't be a new hierarchy,
that's fucking new code.
You know,

533
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.000
it's just the way shit happens.
People,

534
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.240
when you try to make things really equal in a communist society,

535
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.900
the people closest to the government making decisions,
they become the new elite.

536
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.200
So you're not gonna fucking know.
Avoid that shit.
You know?

537
00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:19.900
And also there's no equality of effort.

538
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.650
The problem with the quality of income and equality,
people want success too.

539
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.850
They think that if you're more successful that it's because of some sort of a

540
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:31.840
cheat.
You've,
you've rigged the system or cheated somehow or another.

541
00:32:31.841 --> 00:32:35.680
But that's not true.
Some people work harder.
They just,

542
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.280
they just do.
Of course,
some people become obsessed with success and some people,

543
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.480
my uncle,
my uncle Vinny doesn't give a fuck.

544
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.350
You know what my uncle Vinny does,
he makes art really sells it.
Yeah.

545
00:32:48.351 --> 00:32:52.510
He's always been that way.
Used to be a photographer and now he uh,

546
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.790
he makes a,
he sent me some driftwood that he painted.

547
00:32:56.270 --> 00:33:01.040
He painted signs from my daughters made out of driftwood.
He's just really,

548
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.610
he's so eccentric,
but he's never given a fuck about it.

549
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:08.630
Drove his ex wife Craig just makes beautiful things for,
he's an artist.

550
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:13.100
He's like a legitimate artists that way.
Jimmy Breck is truly not ambitious.

551
00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:18.080
He is,
he is only interested in feeding his brain.
He loved,
like,

552
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:21.440
he listens to us.
Stephen West podcasts philosophize this,
which is my love that,

553
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:25.010
that's my new talking to that guy back and forth.
I'm going to get him on.
Yeah,

554
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:26.250
I got to get him on.
I love it.

555
00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.660
He's 29 and he's got such a command and philosophy,

556
00:33:29.661 --> 00:33:30.920
but he makes it so accessible.

557
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.760
Like Jimmy will start his day with philosophize this,
just listen,

558
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:37.700
can I get a nugget?
And then he goes and works out and plays tennis and just,

559
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.810
he's a national treasure because he only lives to educate himself and make the

560
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:42.644
world a better place.

561
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.710
He just makes people feel good about themselves and he's trying to enjoy life.

562
00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:47.960
But do you think you'd want to do it over and over and over again?

563
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.920
The exact same life?
I do.
He's,
he's the happiest.

564
00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:55.430
He's the closest thing to a monk.
I was just with him.
I,

565
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.640
I flew him down to Florida because I just had them on the podcast.

566
00:33:58.641 --> 00:34:02.160
Folks who want to watch a disaster.
We got him way too high.

567
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.800
I got him like three or four hits deep and he doesn't smoke weed and he hadn't

568
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.580
eaten.
He hadn't eaten and he was thirsty.

569
00:34:07.581 --> 00:34:11.450
I don't think the eating helps when you're smoking it.
I might be wrong,
does it,

570
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.350
but he was already low blood sugar.
Any haven't slept.
We barbecued that dude.

571
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.240
We threw him in a Traeger grill,
set it,

572
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.840
set it to 25 for six hours.

573
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.820
He was forgetting stories in the middle of the first sentence.
Amazing isn't bad.

574
00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:27.710
We fucked him up,
which is too bad because he tells some great stories.

575
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.590
Now the world will forever know him as the guy who couldn't keep it together.

576
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.100
I remember when he had tuberculosis,
I called him Jimmy Tuberculosis.

577
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.481
Tuberculosis.

578
00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:39.800
Sure did they think he got it from his grandfather when he was three years old

579
00:34:39.801 --> 00:34:42.650
and it laid dormant and they couldn't find it because it wasn't on the outside

580
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:45.740
of his long.
Holy Shit.
I'm with him in the hospital.

581
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:49.280
I've never seen anything like this.
I'm with him in the hospital.
And he had,

582
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.200
they thought he had two things.
One,

583
00:34:51.201 --> 00:34:55.340
the disease that killed Bernie Mac or two long sees killed bringing man.

584
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:59.150
He had a disease that firemen get from nine 11.
Uh,

585
00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:03.530
we are lungs basically turned to sand.
I mean,
you know,
it's awful.

586
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.850
So Bernie Mac died of that.
So they said you have a,
either a fatal disease,

587
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.820
which is that lung disease or you have lung cancer.
Okay.

588
00:35:10.821 --> 00:35:12.140
Now this was what he was looking at.

589
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:16.070
And I remember he was just talking to me like this dude it doot,
doot,

590
00:35:16.071 --> 00:35:20.120
doot and joking around.
I Ha oh dude.
Yeah.
And I went,
Bubba,
I go,

591
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.530
you are,

592
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.030
you've been given like they are looking at you either being,
you know,

593
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:29.930
you're dead or dead.
I don't understand how you're not even missing a beat.

594
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:34.820
And he goes,
dude,
come on.
I've made peace with my death a long time ago.

595
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.540
I live every day as it comes.
Wow.
And He,
and that,

596
00:35:38.541 --> 00:35:41.640
he was getting ready for them to come out and tell him what it was.

597
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.160
And the doctors,
you know,
you can't help but to love him.

598
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:49.110
So he was there for three weeks and the doctor finally found that he had

599
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.080
tuberculosis.
Now at this point,
all the doctors fell in love with them.

600
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.910
All of them.
They'd come in and listen to his stories.

601
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.970
So the doctor came running in and goes,
we found out what you have,

602
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.450
you have tuberculosis.
And to me it was like,
oh great.
And he goes,
no,

603
00:36:00.451 --> 00:36:03.150
we can cure that.
This is fucking great.
We can care of that.

604
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.190
So he went on nine months of antibiotics,

605
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:09.780
nine and he went colorblind from the anabolic.
Yeah.
That's what happened to him.

606
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.070
He is now called color blind color.
Whoa.
That's the antibiotics did.
But Hey,

607
00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.590
he's 100% but I remember,

608
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:20.700
I've never seen anybody faces his own death and be that just monk like about it.

609
00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:25.530
He's done it.
Yeah.
Now when he was on the antibiotics,

610
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.460
the given probiotics as well.
I,
he does probiotics.

611
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:32.340
He brought his body right back.
I mean,
he is just a beast.

612
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.400
He's never stopped working out.
He's never stopped eating really well too.

613
00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:40.401
They know what caused his anti biotic reaction that made him colorblind and

614
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.300
apparently is a side effect when you take nine months of a very strong cocktail

615
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:50.220
of antibiotics,
you know,
and that curate it though.
Nine months.
Yeah.
Thank God.

616
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.500
Thank God.
No Way.
It cures it on its own.
Well,

617
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:56.070
it back in the day you had consumption and almost you died eventually.

618
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.170
But some people would go up into the mountains and it would,
it would,
uh,

619
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:04.230
tuberculosis can go into remission and not come out again.

620
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:05.603
When you go to the mountain,

621
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:11.150
the idea was we'll go to the mountains and breathe fresh air and sometimes you

622
00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:13.800
could go into remission with anthem,
with tuberculosis.

623
00:37:13.801 --> 00:37:16.610
But Tuberculosis was almost always a death sentence in long day's journey into

624
00:37:16.611 --> 00:37:19.770
night,
the great play and Nobel Prize winner,
Eugene O'Neill,

625
00:37:19.771 --> 00:37:23.930
his brother had it and uh,
he knew his brother was going to die and uh,

626
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.430
he just watched his brother deteriorate.
It was like,

627
00:37:26.431 --> 00:37:30.000
it was like having aids or something.
You would cough,
you'd spit up blood.

628
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.540
And I think she'll pat the great piano player died of it.

629
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.670
This is why when people talk about,
you know,

630
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.120
when they're there anti-vaccine or they're anti,
uh,

631
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:44.160
antibiotics or western medicine,
just read,
I forget every other science.
Don't,

632
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.180
don't worry about big Pharma.

633
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.330
Just pick up a history book or a piece of literature,

634
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:52.020
anything that's written before in 1950,
which most people don't,

635
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.720
1960 any classic book.
And the,

636
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:59.730
one of the central themes is,
is the fact that people,

637
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:04.770
especially children,
died.
Lincoln lost what?
Three of his children?
Three to fever,

638
00:38:04.771 --> 00:38:09.000
quote unquote,
usually probably diptheria or something that came rolling through.

639
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.390
Smallpox was a fucking,
it was the biggest killer for Fr.

640
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.060
The Spanish flu of 1918 people alive.
20 million.
20 million people.

641
00:38:18.061 --> 00:38:21.490
Unes of people.
Yeah,
so if you just don't forget,

642
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.780
I mean just pick up a history book or pick up a piece of literature.

643
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:27.050
It was unavoidable.
It's very [inaudible].

644
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.750
The Spanish flu apparently was a really weird one because it actively attack

645
00:38:30.751 --> 00:38:33.270
people with really good immune.
Oh,
young people.

646
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.980
Young people got them better than it killed older people

647
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.400
<v 2>for some strangers.
Yeah,
and that was a,
that was a fact of life.</v>

648
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:42.580
You usually buried your children throughout history.

649
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:45.820
You had to bury your children.
That's a,
that's a unequivocal fact.

650
00:38:45.821 --> 00:38:48.700
We don't live in that world anymore.
We don't worry about those.

651
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:52.000
Those diseases like tetanus and diptheria and things that would roll through and

652
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:55.320
just kill.
People are getting it now.
People are getting tetanus again.

653
00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.720
Some kid got tetanus and I saw people arguing that one of the dumbest fucking

654
00:39:00.791 --> 00:39:01.810
things I ever saw in my life,

655
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:04.240
someone was saying there's a simple cure to tetanus,

656
00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:08.310
just expose it to open air or
is that a scientist?

657
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.120
Was that a guy who has his degree?
Why?
Wow,
this guy's never have a degree,

658
00:39:11.121 --> 00:39:13.410
is that chem trail believer,
but why?

659
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.750
Why is it that all of these guys make the noise don't have degrees because they

660
00:39:16.751 --> 00:39:19.300
want to believe that there's some sort of a,

661
00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.790
some sort of an organized clan of people that train to keep your health down or

662
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.880
support big Pharma or there they're the real facts of diseases like smallpox and

663
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:33.280
like polio,

664
00:39:33.281 --> 00:39:37.420
like all these horrific diseases that people in our grandparents' generation had

665
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:40.630
to deal with is that they were cured by Madison.
Yeah.
Yup.

666
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.260
It is modern Pharma.
Greedy.
Fuck.

667
00:39:43.261 --> 00:39:46.060
Couldn't look no further than the oxycontin crisis.

668
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.420
The opiate crisis we were facing this,
this country.
Yeah.

669
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:54.610
Big Pharma left unchecked is like anything else where it's a corporation that

670
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:56.270
wants to have universal growth,
right.

671
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.620
They wouldn't have constant never ending growth and they want to keep making

672
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:03.510
money in the way to do that as a prescribed more people poison.
Ben Goldacre.

673
00:40:03.511 --> 00:40:06.010
You ever had those podcasts?
He wrote a book called Bad Pharma,

674
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.700
but he's a doctor who takes a very,
he said they there is evil,

675
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:12.790
but you have to know what kind of evil.
Don't just throw the whole exact,

676
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:16.750
if you have Murcia you need big Pharma.
Fuck yeah.
You know.
Do you have staff?

677
00:40:16.751 --> 00:40:20.500
Just talk to anybody who's ever wrestled there anything to Kim Haines son had

678
00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:23.200
staff and he called me up.
He's like a how bad his staff,

679
00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.470
I'm like Jesus Christ because he told me son got it at the gym.
I'm like,

680
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:28.750
get him to the fucking doctor immediately.

681
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:33.410
Now my wife's friend went into a coma.
She,
she was,

682
00:40:33.411 --> 00:40:37.350
she started having seizures cause of an unchecked staph infection.

683
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.680
She got at the gym,
she started having seizures.
I'm at Sushi with Frank Grillo,

684
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.250
our buddy and he,

685
00:40:43.251 --> 00:40:46.630
he boxes every day and I see his arm and he's kind of a long sleeve shirt and

686
00:40:46.631 --> 00:40:50.320
his arms bleeding and I go,
what's going on with your arm?
And he goes,
I got cut.

687
00:40:50.321 --> 00:40:53.570
I was at the gym and he's always on that dirty,
you know,

688
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:54.880
Matt or just do whatever.

689
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.470
In a literally seven hours his,

690
00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:03.520
he had a sack hanging off his elbow.
Doctor Goes,
you got to get,

691
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:06.700
he almost lost his arm.
He had to get shots and antibiotics for a whole week.

692
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.810
I mean,
that shit moves quick,
moves very,
you would lose your arm,
your die.

693
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:11.291
I told you,

694
00:41:11.291 --> 00:41:14.110
I'd tell you the arch of your story mean Aria playing pool and he's limping.

695
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.730
I'm like,
what's going on with your leg?
And he goes,
ah,

696
00:41:16.731 --> 00:41:20.500
I think I've got a spider bite or let me see your leg.
He pulls his leg.
I go,

697
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:24.070
dude,
listen to me.
You're going to the doctor right now on screw my cue.

698
00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.370
He's like,
are you serious?
I go,
we're,

699
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.600
we're quitting right now and I'm taking you to the fucking hospital.
I go,

700
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:33.220
you gotta go to the hospital now?
He goes,
now I go,
do you have a staph infection?

701
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.180
And it's bad.
And you could tell,
fuck yeah.
What?

702
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.780
It looked like a zit like a giant Zit on his knee.
I go,

703
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.450
that's our spider bite bro.
And he has been,
he was doing Jujitsu because of me.

704
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.650
I bought him a year.

705
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:51.080
I bought him a year membership for Jujitsu for a Hanukkah.
But uh,
yeah man,

706
00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:52.010
it was fucking nasty.

707
00:41:52.011 --> 00:41:55.370
And he would've just walked around with it and then it would have gotten really

708
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:57.610
bad and he probably would've got systemic and died.
Yeah.

709
00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:01.460
My Bud happens to people.
My Buddy Ryan,
who was a health Gracie black belt,

710
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.350
they had to cut out,

711
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.970
they had to cut up an inch off of his shinbone because the screws.

712
00:42:07.971 --> 00:42:09.210
So every time he'd be on antibiotics,

713
00:42:09.211 --> 00:42:10.700
a year and a half in and out of the hospital,

714
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:12.440
it took them two years to recover with probiotics,

715
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.370
year and a half because the screws,
every time they put the screws back in,

716
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:21.110
they grooves,
the screws had the virus,
what's bacteria?
So he had to have,

717
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:26.300
when they took out the,
they took out the bone and they had to put a plate there.

718
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.690
They would use screws.
So for whatever reason,

719
00:42:29.691 --> 00:42:34.340
the screws that were in the metal with,
somehow they were infected.

720
00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.220
They kept infecting the bone.
Oh.
And they had to grow.

721
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.110
They had some aloe graft bone back on.
It was a fucking crazy.
Right.
It's no joke,

722
00:42:42.111 --> 00:42:45.350
man.
Happy.
What's the,
something like that happens though?

723
00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:49.640
How happy are you when you're healed?
Yeah.
I had a cold recently.

724
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.530
Just a little cold.
Not that bad,

725
00:42:51.531 --> 00:42:56.420
but I was running ragged too many trips and too busy and getting up early and

726
00:42:56.421 --> 00:42:58.970
going to bed late and I was just really tired and sick.

727
00:42:58.971 --> 00:43:01.310
And then I couldn't work out for like four or five days.

728
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:04.580
And I remember thinking to myself,
you got to remember this.

729
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.100
You got to remember this shitty feeling when you can't even exercise.

730
00:43:08.101 --> 00:43:12.680
And I'm Hawkin up Green Shit and spitting in the sink just to look at it.
I know.

731
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:16.360
Do you do that?
You blow your nose in the same course?
I do.
I do that.
I go,
yeah,

732
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.590
I want to see it.
See what it looks like.
Just,
yeah,
just big fucking smurfs.

733
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:26.030
Shit.
Big Green Gob.
Ewells all over the fucking sink.

734
00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.840
But um,
I just remember thinking like,
you gotta be smarter,
stupid.

735
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.800
Just be smarter by having most of the time I am most of the time,
man.

736
00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:37.610
But sometimes I just go,
I've got to hit that gas.
I got nothing in the tank,

737
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.650
but I got to fucking keep that accelerator pressed.

738
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.900
That's why I don't fuck around with my sleep anymore.
I read that book.

739
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:45.680
Why we sleep Matthew Walker,
he's amazing.
I,
I just,

740
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:47.660
I don't fuck around with my sleep and him should not,

741
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.070
you should not sleep is critical.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's um,

742
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.610
you know what?
It is amazing for sleep,
man.
You know we should get in your place.

743
00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:00.620
Get yourself a sauna.
Really,
really?
Oh yeah.

744
00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.520
You do 20 close towns.
Some of that's for fucking clowns.

745
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:08.240
You wear a rubber nose when you do it.
Yeah.
Hey Man,

746
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:12.140
I did cold showers after yoga.
He wear our rubber nose,

747
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.520
man.
Joe's being mean to me.
Colombian clowns.
You'll fucking Cologne.

748
00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:20.810
Welcome clown.
Tried to Quaive shock proteins.

749
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:24.670
I've got to get really cool.
You should have an ice bath.
You want to do that?

750
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.560
I'll do an ice bath.
I've done you done?
Crile?
Yeah.

751
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.520
Have you done the real one when you hit your head?
Goes in?
No,
he didn't.

752
00:44:31.521 --> 00:44:35.430
The one where the neck below ana has the bullshit one.
Really?
Yeah.

753
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:38.340
The real ones only made by cryo healthcare.

754
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.880
They have one in New York or one center in New York.

755
00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:44.820
They have one in La.
They have one here.

756
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.630
They want to woodland hills like 10 minutes away.

757
00:44:46.631 --> 00:44:51.270
His path for 20 minutes and talk to me.
Um,
okay.
You go numb.
It sucks,

758
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:56.130
I'm sure.
But so does 250 degrees below zero.
Have you not done an ice pick?

759
00:44:56.131 --> 00:44:59.960
Three minutes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come on Bro.
It sucks.
All right bro.
I get it.

760
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:02.820
You were a fucking Jew where I sat down nose.

761
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:08.060
I just double burned in a song.
I was singing.
Same.
Awesome.

762
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:10.480
Um,
yeah,
it's not good.
Um,

763
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.920
there's probably some real benefits to ice baths that benefit of,
um,

764
00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:17.710
cryo over ice baths that you could work out right afterwards.
I spouse,

765
00:45:17.711 --> 00:45:21.240
they recommend you not work out there.
Like you just chill out for awhile,

766
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.590
but it's great after working out.

767
00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:26.850
But for muscle strength and development,

768
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.730
it's actually not good to do it right after training.

769
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:34.500
You actually should wait quite a while,
like maybe an hour or two.
So when you,

770
00:45:34.501 --> 00:45:35.250
you've been,

771
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:39.360
you've had countless conversations with cutting edge scientists and exercise

772
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:43.020
people,
the five things that you do every day,

773
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.830
like that debt without fail,
what are they in terms of for your health?

774
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.120
First of all,
I supplement I think you believe in south,

775
00:45:51.121 --> 00:45:54.870
I believe absolutely.
Wholeheartedly.
And supplements,
which though,

776
00:45:54.871 --> 00:45:59.390
what kind of Tom?
I take athletic Greens.
It's a,
it's a sponsor.
Um,

777
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:03.990
they have,
it's a great whole food supplement.
I'm doing an ad form right now,
one,

778
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:09.050
one serving as 12 one scoop has 12 servings of fruits and vegetables in terms of

779
00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:13.110
the amount of antioxidants.
And yet it's very healthy.

780
00:46:13.111 --> 00:46:16.130
It's good just for like a backup plan,
right?
Like,

781
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.850
take these little packs with being on the road.
Um,

782
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:22.200
I take a lot of the Onnit Shit I take,
uh,

783
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.990
obviously I shouldn't be saying that shit.
Shroom tech,
you know,

784
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:30.480
w we have some awesome whole food supplements.
There's a bunch of great stuff.
Um,

785
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:35.250
I take a lot of vitamins.
I take vitamin D,

786
00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:39.990
I take vitamin B,
I take a lot of fish oil,
a lot of essential fatty acids.

787
00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.250
I believe in all those things.

788
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:46.110
I cut way back on my sugar.
I mean,

789
00:46:46.111 --> 00:46:50.460
way back to where maybe once a week I'll have dessert.

790
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.020
Maybe let's do that too.
Yeah.
I don't fuck around man.
Um,

791
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.620
I just intermittent fast.
Yes.

792
00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.560
16 hours a day.
Yeah,
I do that.
That makes me feel that,
you know,

793
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.090
my psoriasis is 100% gone.
That's awesome.
Part of it's also,
and I,

794
00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:10.260
and I gotta give a shout out to Dan Garner.
Dan Garner 88 at Gmail.

795
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:14.700
If you need his email.
He's a fuck.
So he's the guy who was a terrible idea.
No,
no,

796
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:17.370
it's fine.
It's fine.
I want to,
I want to promote him because he's a fucking,

797
00:47:17.371 --> 00:47:19.620
people are going to email be pictures of dicks.
Good.

798
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:22.290
But a lot of people have psoriasis.
But let me,
let me tell you,
it was so,

799
00:47:22.291 --> 00:47:25.630
so Andy Galpin who you know.
Yes.
I talked to Andy Golf and,
and,

800
00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:30.010
and a FIFA consume.
Who Does who?
Aubrey put me in touch with.
He uh,

801
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.460
<v 1>he's the guy who coined the term the Gut biome should actually have on,</v>

802
00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.810
he's really,
really smart guy.

803
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:37.590
He's a scientist who's leading scientist in Gut biome.

804
00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:40.960
They're working with the Cleveland Institute of Dermatology I think with

805
00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:44.950
psoriasis.
So how the gut affects psoriasis.
So anyway,
long story short,

806
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.560
Andy got them,
puts me together with Dan Gardens,
got like 12 degrees,

807
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:49.210
but he a strengthen nutrition coach.

808
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.900
This mother fucker such a nerd with everything.
And this guy,
he,

809
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.330
I did as an gut analysis and all that stuff.

810
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:58.690
This guy gives me a diet and a and find some,
an opportunity,

811
00:47:58.691 --> 00:48:02.290
an opportunistic infections and my gut bacteria that shouldn't be there.

812
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:05.920
He's got me doing like oil of Oregano and fucking um,

813
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.480
garlic pills and stuff like that.

814
00:48:07.481 --> 00:48:10.990
But there's a whole regimen I do for four months.
Long story short,

815
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.680
then there's a probiotic protocol that you do.
I do all that.

816
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:17.500
My psoriasis just goes away.
It's just,

817
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:20.980
it has not come back and it's been gone now.
It's something I'll have to manage.

818
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:23.860
But when I say complete,
cause you saw my back.
Remember when you saw it?

819
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:28.390
It's all gone.
And I had that for nine months.
It got bad.

820
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:31.410
So somebody talked to Kim Kardashians,
just get that shit over.

821
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.320
There's overwhelming evidence that a lot of these owners of immune diseases are,

822
00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:40.780
are somehow a gut issue.
You know how Jordan Peterson cleaning his up?
Yeah.
Yeah.

823
00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.140
Carnivore.
Done.
Yeah.
And they think the corner carnival died.

824
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:46.210
It might be from what I've heard on your podcast and elsewhere,
is that,

825
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:50.980
I guess you,
you kind of give your gut bacteria a kind of a reset or,

826
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:52.510
or is it an elimination diet?
Yeah.

827
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:55.800
You take away virtually everything except one thing.
Yeah.

828
00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:00.840
Your body adjusts and your body just somehow or another it secures itself have a

829
00:49:02.261 --> 00:49:05.680
lot of ailments with an elimination diet and yeah,
well that's why.

830
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.550
That's what intermittent.
Controversial.
Yeah.

831
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.500
That is why in fasting in general it's so beneficial but helps me.

832
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.300
But the carnivore diet,

833
00:49:13.301 --> 00:49:17.170
it's very fascinating because people fucking swear by it,
man.

834
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.550
There's people that they look great.
Their health is improved,

835
00:49:20.551 --> 00:49:25.330
have lost weight and gain muscle.
All.
That's my question.
That is the question.

836
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.720
You need some fiber?
I don't think so.
I don't think you really do.

837
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:31.780
Most people that are taking it say they don't have any issues.

838
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:33.970
Some people have issues in the beginning of it,
but men,

839
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:37.360
people who have been doing it for years,
there've been doing,

840
00:49:37.361 --> 00:49:39.970
they've been on the carnivore die for you.
Let Dr. Sean Baker,

841
00:49:39.971 --> 00:49:43.210
he's been on it for years and you all eads is fucking rib eyes.

842
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.260
He just eats revise and eggs but aren't,
aren't the,
uh,

843
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:49.600
there are certain cultures that are a hundred percent carnival or like I think

844
00:49:49.601 --> 00:49:52.000
the Masa traditionally where a lot of the,

845
00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:56.080
a lot of the font to belt and Africa where,
where the Mohs I would great.
Oh yeah.

846
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.440
I've seen him in person.
I've been to Kenya twice.

847
00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:02.830
I mean they look like professional athletes.
A full people.
Yeah.

848
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:07.190
I mean the turns of the effect on their body.
They don't look Mel nourish,

849
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:11.470
nourished rather.
There's six foot six.
There's no,
yeah.
My friend,
you know,

850
00:50:11.471 --> 00:50:12.800
my friend lived with them for,

851
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:17.820
he's a pro triathlete and he lived with them for six weeks and uh,
he goes,
dude,

852
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:21.400
why?
I've been an athlete my whole life.
I'm not an athlete.

853
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:23.050
I tried to run with those guys.

854
00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.000
I tried to do stuff with those guys and he's like,

855
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:27.470
the way they can like track shit.
He goes,

856
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:31.460
they could look at a blade of grass and the way it was bent or like a certain

857
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:33.980
area and go,
oh,
cuckoo.
Whenever they,

858
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:37.520
the fucking could do ran through here or whatever the fuck it was.
They could,

859
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.280
they could tell what kind of animal cancer.
Whoa.

860
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.580
And then it had this throwing contest.
They were throwing shit,
not just spears,

861
00:50:43.581 --> 00:50:47.210
but they're throwing like this,
whatever it was.
And he said,
dude,
I could,

862
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:51.950
I was so embarrassed.
He was embarrassed.
He was just such a bitch.

863
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.090
It's like I have,
I have northern European bullshit genes.

864
00:50:56.510 --> 00:51:01.040
These motherfuckers from Kenya,
you know,
it was a hold of this for sure.

865
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:04.370
It's really interesting that the cradle of civilization,

866
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:09.400
which is where all human beings emanated from Africa has the best jeans,

867
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:14.510
they have the best athletic genes when it comes to like physical performance.

868
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.390
Look,
since there's no denying to be off the coast.

869
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:20.300
I mean like Nigeria and that area that,
those,

870
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:24.790
that's a of Senegal bring up Senegal out that,
that,

871
00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:29.510
what's that wrestling,
they call a,
I know what you're talking about.

872
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:33.080
Frank Grillo and on fight world did a,
he went to Senegal.
He goes,
dude,

873
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:35.670
six foot six.
I mean they all look like,
uh,

874
00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:39.740
like that's what the NFL is made up of that and that guy wrote the sports gene,

875
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.551
Richard Bernstein.

876
00:51:40.551 --> 00:51:43.820
I think sports illustrated writer said the fastest people in the world come from

877
00:51:43.821 --> 00:51:47.420
that part of the world to be African coast.
That's where Jamaica,

878
00:51:47.421 --> 00:51:50.480
that's where the slave trade had gone.
And,
and they,
they,

879
00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:55.540
they came from that area so you can actually isolate the genes lambda.

880
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.590
Oh Wow.
This is interesting.

881
00:51:57.591 --> 00:52:02.570
They're like pawn at each eyebrow and they're all giant.
Why did it,
why the fuck?

882
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.480
Huh?
Because they punched and they wrestle and they do great.

883
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:07.970
High Level Greco Shit.
Watch this is punching too.

884
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.920
And you'll say watch this high level Greco Shit.

885
00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.900
They throw single ease wrestling,
indycar championship.

886
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:18.860
Beautiful.
It's La Luta is the um,

887
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:23.120
the title of the video.
Yup.
La Space.

888
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:28.100
L.
U.
T.
T.
E,
single ease wrestling,
indycar championship.

889
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:31.250
Now they're working for position but,
and if you see some of these guys,

890
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:35.150
you see them,
what their bodies look like.
It's so good.
Just so ridiculous.

891
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:39.230
Like they live on fish and rice and be frank went there.
It's so poor.

892
00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.630
And he said,
you just see dudes where you're like,
well,
if I had a body like that,

893
00:52:41.631 --> 00:52:45.440
I would never wear clothes.
So I don't understand what they're doing here.

894
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:48.830
They're just getting coaching,
just getting positioned.
Whoever gets thrown.

895
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:52.710
Then these guys are rock stars in Senegal.
Okay.
They need coaching.
No.
No.

896
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:55.490
You'll see none.
They punched me.
Tell you something.

897
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:59.450
Cain Valasquez shoots a power double on these mother fuckers back in the sand.

898
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:03.370
Sir,
I'm going to ask you to know.
That's true.
Five minutes.
I skipped.

899
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.420
I skipped ahead.
Five minutes.
Keep dead.
Five minutes.

900
00:53:05.421 --> 00:53:10.370
There's still waiting to patty cakes,
bro.
It's like sumo deuces nuts.

901
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:15.160
Oh,
exactly.
It's nonsense.
No,
excuse me.
Tread trip.
Oh,

902
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:19.100
they're punching each can't to shit,
dude.
This is serious.
Oh Shit.

903
00:53:19.101 --> 00:53:22.310
They're punching from the clinch yam,
bro.
Wow.
This is fighting.

904
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:26.010
I said justice headband.
Yeah.
You've got to always adjust your van time.

905
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.180
<v 2>Tom.
What is the time?
What did they do in time?
Time.
That's it.
That was the match.</v>

906
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.690
No,
I maybe not called keep going with,

907
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:35.710
it's gotta be a better one that you got to see the heavyweights.

908
00:53:35.711 --> 00:53:37.280
They heavy weights are the championship.

909
00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:39.560
I figured that maybe it just sucks and you're really into it because it's

910
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:43.980
foreign.
Sir.
That's possible.
I'm telling you,
I've seen some incredible lamb.

911
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.150
Those dudes who play a petty case.
You will respect lamp.
Okay.

912
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:52.250
Kickbox and world champion.
Oh,
go to the far right one.
That one.
Okay,
there.

913
00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:56.010
Here we go.
Now we'll see what's up.
Kickboxing world champion challenges.

914
00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:58.680
Singling these wrestlers.
Who is this kickboxing world champion?

915
00:53:58.681 --> 00:54:01.800
It's like a documentary.
I don't care.
I want to see who it is.

916
00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:05.940
Not like there's got to find the fight.
Oh,
is it looking at other associates,

917
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:10.310
all sorts of stuff going on here.
Who's this kickboxing where he's like,

918
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:14.010
they're Sufi Muslim,
so they're hanging out with them very,
very spiritually.

919
00:54:14.011 --> 00:54:18.030
Kickbox.
Okay.
Uh,
oral.

920
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:23.650
Say his name.
Brian.
Or learn or lean Duarte orally.

921
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:29.370
French,
multiple kickboxing,
Muay Thai and Chodo con karate champion.

922
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.700
That's like me.
So it looks like he's learning from these folks.

923
00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:36.570
I don't think he's really challenging them.
Okay.
Let's see what happens in the,

924
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.230
there we go.
Look at it.
Look at my man right there.
Instead of saying still,

925
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:45.900
what does it say?
Sort of stand still.
Just let it go.
We'll see what happens here.

926
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:52.020
Other Breslin?
Yeah.
Oh,
so they're wrestling,
but it's all that dude.

927
00:54:52.021 --> 00:54:54.900
Back up a little.
I'm gonna see that dude the kickbox and got interact with them.

928
00:54:54.901 --> 00:54:55.734
There we go.

929
00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:04.000
Okay.
Let's see.
Throws.
Okay.

930
00:55:04.001 --> 00:55:07.960
They're just teaching him how to throw.
Oh,
they're teaching them some technique.

931
00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.260
That's Kinda cool that they do it on the beach though.
That's smart.

932
00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.790
That's a duck under it right there.
It took his back.
Yeah.
Nelson,

933
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.840
they know some wrestling techniques.
Wrestling is,
you know,

934
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.900
you could make the argument that wrestling,

935
00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:24.760
would you say that wrestling is probably the best thing you could ever do coming

936
00:55:24.761 --> 00:55:27.700
up if you want to get an MMA,
like to have the US?
Yes.

937
00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.660
I think wrestling is the most important sport.
Yeah,
because you see guys like,
uh,

938
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:36.090
Camaros,
Guzman.
It was a perfect example.
Who was just on the podcast.
He's,
um,

939
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:41.240
another example of awesome African genes.
Um,
but he's,
he's a,

940
00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:46.740
he's an excellent example of a guy who really didn't start striking at all until

941
00:55:47.021 --> 00:55:51.980
like 2009 I mean,
but he's been watching how your body moves for Africa.

942
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.020
He mean he's been watching and fucking around,

943
00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:58.300
but it doesn't matter like the way he strikes now you would think he's been

944
00:55:58.301 --> 00:56:00.850
doing it his whole life and he's been only striking for 10 years.

945
00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.510
I think wrestlers are just tougher.
You know?

946
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:08.470
C'Mon was saying that his needs are so fucked up for some of his fights that he

947
00:56:08.471 --> 00:56:12.970
had to walk on grass cause it hurt to walk on concrete.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Really?

948
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:16.570
Yeah.
His daughter makes fun of him cause he goes down the stairs backwards.
Ah,

949
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.390
cause he goes downstairs.
Back.
Yes.
Yes.

950
00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:22.300
She thinks it's hilarious when I see him.

951
00:56:22.301 --> 00:56:26.260
Like I saw with Rashad Evans and he looked as big as Rashad.
He's a big fella.

952
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:29.950
Yeah.
But here's the thing,
he couldn't be a nicer guy.
He's great.

953
00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:33.370
He couldn't be a nicer guy.
And when you hear him talk on the podcast,
he's,

954
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:37.870
he's like,
he's so almost soft spoken.
He's easy going,

955
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:43.030
you know,
it's like,
it's weird that he's so good,
but in the way he describes it,

956
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:47.770
when he gets inside the cage of a switch gets flipped and he just becomes a

957
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:51.970
different person.
I felt like,
uh,
um,
all due respect to the great Tyron Woodley,

958
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:56.590
but he did,
he,
his body looks a little different and he looked a little bit,
um,

959
00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.180
I don't know.
He didn't look as,
he didn't look the way he normally does.

960
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.990
[inaudible] see it.
I didn't see it.
And I look for that shit.

961
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:09.640
Looks like a car you go to.
I don't know about that man.

962
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:13.870
Go to a Tyron Woodley versus C'mon Huseman see if you could get a,

963
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:17.010
the video of the two of them right about the fight.
Why?

964
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.090
Why are you shaking your head so new?

965
00:57:19.091 --> 00:57:23.920
I don't know if we can so new this happened.
So what?
It's not online yet.

966
00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:29.230
That shit's online.
Everything's online.
You don't think it's online?

967
00:57:29.231 --> 00:57:32.610
How much of my bed?
Just Oh,
why we cross right there,
I guess.
Well,

968
00:57:32.611 --> 00:57:35.710
we don't have to show it like people are gonna show.
You guys show us.

969
00:57:35.711 --> 00:57:37.990
Just show us.
People find it.
Go to,

970
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:42.850
you're going to have to go to ESPN for now on folks.
All fights are on ESPN.

971
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.470
All paper views.

972
00:57:44.471 --> 00:57:48.030
Plus you have to get a subscription for ESPN plus if you want to get a paper

973
00:57:48.031 --> 00:57:52.450
because that y'all,
yes,
yes.
Strange.
Yeah.

974
00:57:52.451 --> 00:57:56.080
That's a good word.
Change is good words.
I love,
you know,

975
00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.340
like I have certain favorite fighters of course.
I,
Ronnie,
I,

976
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:04.240
I love Nick Diaz shorts,
but I,
Jorge Mazda at all.

977
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:09.340
It's a beast.
I just love,
I love like just a true fighter,

978
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:14.230
like an animal.
And he's so good.
He's so fucking good.
So smart.

979
00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:17.530
Oh,
you're so smart,
man.
Clever changes it up.

980
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.110
Does things like you can't see what he's doing.
It's subtle.

981
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:24.730
He lives for fighting to really does.
Oh,
he's a fucking smart man.

982
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.320
There are men and then there's hard mosquito.

983
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:31.660
Just shows another label for sure.
He's on another level.
He's,
he's,

984
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:35.240
I think he's such a contender for,
I mean he just chewed.

985
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:39.340
He has 100% of the pretenders cowboy and then it takes two years out of the

986
00:58:39.341 --> 00:58:40.870
octagon.
I don't know what,

987
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:44.340
he must have had an injury Darren till locked out Darren [inaudible].

988
00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:47.170
I mean knocked him the fuck out.

989
00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:52.540
I mean he hit him with that left hand a couple times early in the fight too.

990
00:58:52.541 --> 00:58:55.330
He was doing some sneaky shit.
He was switching stances.

991
00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:58.240
He was switching stances and throwing that left hand.
Yeah,

992
00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.430
and he's throwing the right hand switching stances,

993
00:59:00.431 --> 00:59:03.520
throwing the left hand and I think he's starting to read till point back and

994
00:59:03.521 --> 00:59:05.740
like that and that's take,
then he finally through that right.

995
00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:09.460
And then when he left he had caught him with that left hand several times.

996
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.370
Caught him in the first round and then call them in the second round.
He's a,

997
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:15.370
he's a bad motherfucker man.
He really is.
He's coming on soon too.

998
00:59:15.371 --> 00:59:17.510
I'm going to have mom with Joey Diaz.
Moms would,

999
00:59:17.511 --> 00:59:19.060
I was going to come home with Joey Diaz and get a little bit,

1000
00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:23.670
you may also be able to get knocked like that.
My Darren till who hits like a,

1001
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:28.550
you know,
and come back and just regain his composure.
Punch of the fight.

1002
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.460
It was the first punch of the fight now and smile the wine.
Yeah.

1003
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:33.320
That's all right.
Let's do it.
He did the first move,

1004
00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:38.000
the fight he charges towards till and tries to side kick him in the thigh and

1005
00:59:38.001 --> 00:59:42.940
hits him in the Dick.
Yeah.
Like right away.
First shot right to the SAC.
Yup.
Yeah.

1006
00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:47.210
I love that guy.
I love,
I love Washington flight.
Well,
he's very crafty.

1007
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:51.180
He's a real veteran.
You know,
I remember him knocking out,
uh,

1008
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:56.390
Eve Edwards in Bodog fight.
Do you remember botox?
Botox?
You know,

1009
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:58.430
Calvin Ayers's see some,
uh,

1010
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.820
super millionaire playboy character who,
um,

1011
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:06.940
he came up with this bow dog fight thing and it was back when you used to be

1012
01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:11.600
able to gamble online,
right.
You were able to gamble on line.
Now you can again,

1013
01:00:11.601 --> 01:00:14.690
but you used to be able to gamble online and a lot of businesses,

1014
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.820
we're sort of constructed around the premise that online gambling was going to

1015
01:00:19.821 --> 01:00:23.060
be legal,
but through some bullshit finagling,

1016
01:00:23.061 --> 01:00:26.390
the federal government put the Kibosh on online gambling.

1017
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:30.980
They put the stop on this thriving business and a lot of these companies,

1018
01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:34.940
like there was professional pool organizations like the IPT that went under

1019
01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:38.660
because they were counting on online gambling.
But Bodog was counting on it to,

1020
01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:42.830
cause he had like this online gambling website.

1021
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:47.540
Well because of the online gambling shit.
He's like,

1022
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:48.890
I don't want to say this,

1023
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.980
I don't want to be incorrect because Dana White was saying that he's a fugitive

1024
01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.300
and he wasn't even allowed in the country.

1025
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:56.450
But that's not too far removed from the truth.

1026
01:00:56.870 --> 01:01:00.110
I don't think he's allowed back in the United States.

1027
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:04.040
I think he used to live in like,
you know,
just for providing service.

1028
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:06.420
People wanted to be part of,
well,
for Duke,

1029
01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:09.110
for being a part of online gambling when it was illegal.

1030
01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:14.060
I think that's the issue.
Oh No,
it's fucking stupid.
I mean people,

1031
01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.790
you know,
let people do what they will.
I,
I think you should have,

1032
01:01:16.791 --> 01:01:19.700
it'd be cool if you could bet on fight Tyrone Woodley versus c'mon what was
done.

1033
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:21.380
So I just would get more money and everything.

1034
01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.530
We'll see what tyrant loose man looks jacked.

1035
01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:29.570
Let's see what Tyron looks like when he gets into the cage.
T to me,

1036
01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:33.590
he looked exactly the same.
Let's see what happens when he takes his shirt off.

1037
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:38.810
Hurry up time.
Right?
He's a beast.
Yeah.
I just don't think that was it,
man.

1038
01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:43.850
I mean,
you're also dealing with Tyron.
He's 37 now.

1039
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
He is also in the middle of a,

1040
01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.930
he's in a transitionary stage in terms of his career,

1041
01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:56.110
so he doesn't look quite as checked.
Yeah.
But he's not mean.

1042
01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.080
He's not a tech based.
I mean,
you know,
it was pretty God damn good to me.
I mean,

1043
01:02:00.081 --> 01:02:04.030
he always does that.
I just see blood,
you know what I'm saying?
He's not like,

1044
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:08.330
that's what I mean.
That's an,
I mean it was pretty good.

1045
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.740
Hard to say.
Great fighter man.
Yeah,
he's 36,

1046
01:02:12.741 --> 01:02:17.480
I think he's 37 now.
He's also,
he's got a rap career now.

1047
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:20.610
He was like opening for Wiz Khalifa.
Really?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1048
01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:23.610
He does a bunch of shit for TMZ now.
You know,

1049
01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:27.540
he's a busy man on top of the fighting.
He's smart.
Like that shit.

1050
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:29.790
Get out of the fight game.
Yes.
He has nothing to prove.

1051
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:33.320
Well he's one of those guys that can do that too.
He's a great talker.
Yeah.

1052
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:34.530
He's uh,
he's,

1053
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.340
he would be a great commentator if he decided to get into commentary and
percent,

1054
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:40.910
but he wants a rematch,
you know,

1055
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.950
I don't think he's happy with his performance and I think he thinks he could

1056
01:02:43.951 --> 01:02:48.300
have done better.
Trust me,
I just look like a bigger and a different way.

1057
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:51.300
Class man.
Well,
it loose months.
Definitely Taller,

1058
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:56.310
but I think even more importantly,
[inaudible] gas tank is just fucking,
it's,

1059
01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.630
well,
that's what's crazy antics.

1060
01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:01.260
And I feel like Tyron may have done a lot of cardio for that camp because he

1061
01:03:01.261 --> 01:03:03.030
knew he was going to have to deal with that.
So he looked,

1062
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:05.230
he looked a little thinner than he normally.
Well,
Ooh.

1063
01:03:05.231 --> 01:03:09.720
Spawn just pushes the pace and he pushes the such a weapon.

1064
01:03:09.721 --> 01:03:11.700
Some guys can do that.
That's such a weapon.

1065
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:15.150
Well he could do it for five rounds to men.
He doesn't get off the gas.
We were,

1066
01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:17.550
he was pretty honest too.
He's funny man.

1067
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:18.990
When he was talking about the fourth round,

1068
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.590
cause in the fourth round he had Tyron hurt and he poured the gas on,

1069
01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:26.820
just poured the gas on at tire and managed to survive.
And uh,

1070
01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:30.990
when Tyron managed to survive,
he was thinking to myself,
oh no,
what have I done?

1071
01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:36.840
But he recovered quick.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He does look a lot bigger though.

1072
01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:41.590
Huh?
Nice and long legs though in comparison.
In comparison,
you know,

1073
01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:45.330
also skinny legs.
John John's.
Exactly.
Jon Jon Jones.

1074
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.590
You look at John Jones cafs only if you only saw his cash.
Weird.

1075
01:03:49.591 --> 01:03:50.760
And someone said to you,
all right,

1076
01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:53.490
is that guy in elite athletes like get the fuck out of here.

1077
01:03:53.491 --> 01:03:57.050
That guy's an accountant.
Exactly.
He's no way that,

1078
01:03:57.051 --> 01:03:59.610
that there are a lot of guys like that where you just don't judge a book by its

1079
01:03:59.611 --> 01:04:03.630
cover.
You'll go to sleep.
Yeah,
but Jon Jones is the Mo,
well his upper body,

1080
01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:07.020
obviously it's pretty strong.
Five.
I mean it's a different thing,

1081
01:04:07.021 --> 01:04:08.400
but he's got a farm,

1082
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:12.630
phenomenal frame for combat sports cause he's got length,

1083
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:17.070
but he's also has muscle.
I think that's the best frame.
I um,
I personally,

1084
01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:21.340
that's not real.
That's not real.
That's photo shopped assholes.
Real.

1085
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:25.830
That's Photoshop.
Trust me.
Those are his calves.
Do.
Oh,
they're not that small.

1086
01:04:25.831 --> 01:04:30.090
Yes they are.
Those ankles don't even fit into his shoes.
He's got very skinny.

1087
01:04:30.091 --> 01:04:34.230
He has no gas.
But that last one was,
that's ridiculous that he set the one up.

1088
01:04:34.231 --> 01:04:37.440
There is a perfect one.
We're still in that kick right there.
How do you answer?

1089
01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:40.820
You can talk to you.
We'll look at it and plan for that terrible photo shopped.

1090
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:43.950
They cut off the back of his leg there.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

1091
01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:48.930
That's his leg.
No,
look at that.
That's his leg.
I don't think so.

1092
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.800
That's 100% Photoshop.
You can see the blur on the Photoshop.
Why is that blurred?

1093
01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:57.060
Yes.
From a guy that does Photoshop every single day.
Yeah.
That's photoshopped.

1094
01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:59.970
You do Photoshop every single day.
What are you doing online?

1095
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:02.400
I make our logo though.
I thought he'd doing weird shit.

1096
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:05.730
Make me make the ended up photo and making me stronger.

1097
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.440
Give Brian Abs.
I need to get down to it.
Let me see.
Uh,
well,

1098
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:13.950
you know John is skinny calves point by saying,
um,

1099
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:18.130
how do you defend against that terrible front kick to the fucking stomach every

1100
01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:21.330
time back?
Well,
he loves to throw it to the thigh,
to the,

1101
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:26.090
he throws that oblique kick to the thigh and the sidekick to the knees.
You know,

1102
01:05:26.091 --> 01:05:28.910
all the,
it's interesting when I see people criticizing that can't come.

1103
01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:32.680
Like you're crazy that they,
they,
they're kicking people in the face.
You're,

1104
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:36.870
you're,
you're mad that kicking him in the knee like,
oh,
you can ruin a career.

1105
01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.100
Like,
oh,
well you can't ruin a career by head kicking somebody.
Yeah.

1106
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.020
Like Wonderboy was saying that about Darren till he thought Darren till was

1107
01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:45.850
trying to ruin his career or buy side,

1108
01:05:45.851 --> 01:05:48.730
kicking them in the knee and he doesn't like that technique should be legal.

1109
01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:53.530
Damn.
I came in,
I mean I get it,
but your head kicking people.
Yeah.

1110
01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:56.580
We'll kicked Jake Ellenberger in the fucking head.
Yeah.

1111
01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:01.090
How good is that for your career?
Not so good.
Come on,
man.

1112
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:05.590
Brutal Sport,
man.
It is.
It's as brutal as it gets man,

1113
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:07.690
but it's not the worst thing for your body.

1114
01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:11.220
I think football's the worst cause some days he'll get hit like that.
Mustard.

1115
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.660
I was another example of that.
I don't think I've seen him.
I don't know when.

1116
01:06:13.661 --> 01:06:17.500
The last time I saw him actually get cracked was he's so opening punch from

1117
01:06:17.501 --> 01:06:21.100
Darren till two mighty mouse or the best example.

1118
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:23.770
Mighty mouse gets hit less than anybody,
but there's,

1119
01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:26.110
there's other guys that they're very hard to hit.

1120
01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:29.980
Y'All just get hit in practice though.
Yeah.
I know a lot of guys though,

1121
01:06:29.981 --> 01:06:34.930
who don't spark like that anymore.
I think Robbie Lawler stopped doing it.

1122
01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:36.970
I think cowboy,
I think a lot of these guys still,

1123
01:06:36.971 --> 01:06:41.110
I'll be stopped sparring completely for years while he's fighting for strike

1124
01:06:41.111 --> 01:06:45.010
force.
But then when he moved to a American top team,

1125
01:06:45.011 --> 01:06:48.540
he started sparring again and it was training really hard and that's when

1126
01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:52.480
actually he became the welter weight world champion.
He's,
he's so fucking tough.

1127
01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:54.880
And like I want to see that ask and fight again.
Cause he,

1128
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:58.420
I put my money on Robbie Lawler that he does not care about.

1129
01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.570
He looked better than I've ever seen him cause he shape,

1130
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:05.710
I've gone back and forth about five times on whether or not that was a good

1131
01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:06.191
stoppage,

1132
01:07:06.191 --> 01:07:10.420
but Huseman convinced me after we watched the footage that was a bad stoppage.

1133
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:15.070
I think Robbie was okay.
I think,
uh,
he's just relaxed.
He was there.
He had what,

1134
01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:18.480
how,
I don't,
I mean,
how many more seconds,
but that bulldog jail time or,
but yeah,

1135
01:07:18.481 --> 01:07:22.060
but for Robbie Lawler,
I think he was all right.
But it's hard to tell.

1136
01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:24.010
It's just unfortunate.
And again,

1137
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.790
herb dean is as good a referee as there is on planet earth.

1138
01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:30.040
There is no one better than him.
There's no one better.

1139
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:33.010
Herb Dean is as good as it gets.
Yeah,
he made a mistake,

1140
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:35.860
but it's hard to say if it was a mistake because I wasn't even sure it was a

1141
01:07:35.861 --> 01:07:36.340
mistake.

1142
01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:39.610
We were not sure if better than err on the side of caution because he couldn't

1143
01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:42.610
hear him.
He couldn't talk.
But here's the thing,

1144
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:46.320
he's only getting choked out like if it's been aspirin,

1145
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.980
it's only he's only get choked out if it's
Frances and gone.
No.

1146
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:55.000
And he's fucking punching you in the head and you think your unconscious then

1147
01:07:55.001 --> 01:07:57.250
stopped the fight.
But if it's just a choke,

1148
01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:01.180
like Ben Aspirin is not known for being in any way,

1149
01:08:01.181 --> 01:08:04.720
shape or form a power striker.
No.
And he's not hitting them.

1150
01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:06.070
It's only holding onto his neck.

1151
01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:10.150
And I think that shows have been how tough bad ass Kronos cause he got his head

1152
01:08:10.151 --> 01:08:12.010
bounced off that fucking,
I was like,

1153
01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.860
you're getting crushed here and he's just like,
whatever.

1154
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:19.400
I'm going to stick to my wrestling.
Yeah,
he was getting fucking pounded.

1155
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:23.360
He figured it out and he,
even though the disengaged,

1156
01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.170
he managed to get ahold of Robbie again and get them on the ground and get that

1157
01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:30.110
choke on.
Yeah,
look,
it was,
it was fun while it lasted,

1158
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:31.460
but he doesn't want to fight Robbie again.

1159
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:36.490
I think if I was the UFC I would be absolutely trying to make that fight again.

1160
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.350
Do you think that they will?
I think they want to.

1161
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:42.980
That's what Dana White said that Ben said,
why would I want to do that?

1162
01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:46.700
I already went already one,
why would I want to do that?
But the thing about,

1163
01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:49.950
you know,
uh,
Kamara was saying like,
you don't get a choice like the UFC.

1164
01:08:49.951 --> 01:08:51.470
He's going to tell you who to fight again.

1165
01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.280
Maybe they just offer Ben a good amount of money off from Robbie.

1166
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:59.660
Robbie is,
uh,
you know,

1167
01:08:59.661 --> 01:09:04.460
he deserves that privilege and I think he's easily up there and he can always be

1168
01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:08.120
the champion again cause he looks as good.
He looks as good as he's ever looked.

1169
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:11.570
It looked amazing.
You look amazing physically.

1170
01:09:11.571 --> 01:09:15.110
He looked amazing when he was fighting.
Even more importantly,

1171
01:09:15.111 --> 01:09:18.440
I think that's the fight that makes the most money because people want to see

1172
01:09:18.441 --> 01:09:22.360
that.
I want to see it.
You want to see it all the real fans want to see it.
Yeah.

1173
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:25.430
I think I don't do enough of that in USA.
They do sometimes,

1174
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:29.270
but when I was going to say is like that,
he deserves it,
but Jesus,

1175
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:32.190
no one deserves it more than Steve Bay Meo Church.

1176
01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.450
Steve Bay loses to DC and we haven't heard hide nor hair of them.

1177
01:09:35.451 --> 01:09:39.230
He's the fucking most successful heavyweight of all time.

1178
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:42.350
He defended the title four times.
No one's ever been able to do that.

1179
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:47.330
He does that and he gets nothing after that.
No love,

1180
01:09:47.331 --> 01:09:52.160
no respect,
no nothing to Kratom.
No talk about him fighting DC again.
You know,

1181
01:09:52.161 --> 01:09:55.090
they're just talking about DC Brock Lesnar and they don't even know Brock lasers

1182
01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:59.810
is really gonna fight,
isn't it?
DC kind of retired though.
DC once a fight.

1183
01:09:59.811 --> 01:10:02.420
Brock,
he's got a fight,
Brock and he's going to retire.

1184
01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:05.450
He's going to just kind of get that to me.
To me the most,

1185
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:10.070
the most impressive fighter to ever step in the octagon is Daniel Cormier.

1186
01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:11.090
You certainly one of them.

1187
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:14.720
I've just hit intern housing more impressive when when Jon Jones beat him

1188
01:10:14.721 --> 01:10:15.680
because,
well,

1189
01:10:15.681 --> 01:10:19.040
so John Jones is without a doubt the most talented and best fighter.

1190
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:24.170
To me with the tools that DC's working with when you're five,
nine,
five,

1191
01:10:24.171 --> 01:10:27.800
10 and you,
you know,
you just,

1192
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:31.750
you're dealing with guys with so much taller,
with so much more reach,

1193
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.580
know he's undefeated as a heavyweight.

1194
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:37.550
The only man he's ever lost to was John Johnson.
Everybody else,

1195
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:41.810
all commerce steep payment.
Just give me a number and he takes,

1196
01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:45.780
he's taking every one of them out.
Listen,
I'm a giant fan.
Just incredible.

1197
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:47.910
Don't get me wrong,
it just shows you how good Jon Jones,

1198
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:51.020
Jon Jones has his number,
whatever the case.
But it's both.

1199
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:54.030
I'd like to see DC fight Jon Jones at heavyweight,

1200
01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.860
me to two 40 that might happen.
That might be the big fight.

1201
01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:00.740
The big fight might be if DC fights Brock,

1202
01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.470
let's assume he beats Brock,
which I think you would then DC fights Jon Jones.

1203
01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.680
Yeah.
But he might not be Brock.
Here's the thing about Brock,

1204
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:11.780
and this is so ridiculous to say.

1205
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:17.070
He still a fucking giant Viking human.
Yeah.

1206
01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.560
He's so extraordinarily big.

1207
01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:24.670
He's so powerful that if he clips DC,
anything can happen.
Yeah.
But he's got,

1208
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:27.130
he's going to get punched in the face by DC and I think,

1209
01:11:27.131 --> 01:11:31.920
I personally believe that if you are not getting punched in the face and working

1210
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.470
on patterns and really working on your striking,

1211
01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:38.580
you get into the ring with a guy like Daniel Cormay who does that every day.

1212
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:42.600
True.
But we don't get all the and the jaw.
We don't know that that's the case.

1213
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:45.360
We also know that he has been wrestling with this,

1214
01:11:45.361 --> 01:11:48.900
a Michigan state wrestler that's one of the best wrestlers on the planet earth.

1215
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:54.140
This video of him wrestling with this current phenom and he's training with like

1216
01:11:54.451 --> 01:11:56.400
real elite world chest fighters.

1217
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:58.830
But you're wrestling when he's doing with his striking.
Yeah,

1218
01:11:58.831 --> 01:12:02.820
but Daniel Cormier has got that down and he's also,

1219
01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.220
Brock has also the WWE champ,
Bro.

1220
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.700
I don't know if you know there is that strong people around there is that got

1221
01:12:08.701 --> 01:12:12.120
hit with a chair?
You're right.
I don't know man.
I mean all my money on DC,

1222
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:16.190
I would say that DC would be heavily favored.
Yeah.

1223
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:21.180
I would also say that that big gorilla can fucking punch any person on the

1224
01:12:21.181 --> 01:12:25.570
planet with those lunchbox fists and you're fucked.
He's so big,
man.

1225
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.480
When you stand next to Brock,
he just like,
oh,
you're a total east silver back.

1226
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:33.390
Yeah.
He's as close to a silver back because I've ever seen is a viking.

1227
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:38.700
A long arms.
Giant human.
Yeah.
Ridiculous fists.

1228
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:40.290
The the real question is,

1229
01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:44.490
I mean how much has he really been working on is striking in in these years that

1230
01:12:44.491 --> 01:12:46.590
he's been outside of the cage,
how much does he,

1231
01:12:46.591 --> 01:12:49.440
much easier to work on your wrestling if you're him than it is striking.

1232
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.710
Striking is a whole different animal.
Well,
particularly spark,

1233
01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:56.070
not just like hitting Mitts and hitting the pad,
but getting,

1234
01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:59.970
getting good rounds and against people that can crack and people that can crack

1235
01:12:59.971 --> 01:13:04.350
like DC where he clinches you and then hits you in the clinch and also learning

1236
01:13:04.351 --> 01:13:07.800
how to adjust.
Like the great fighters that I noticed are guys who,

1237
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:09.210
they come in with a game plan,

1238
01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:13.020
that game plan gets shut down and then they change it up.
Right.

1239
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.490
Then they do subtle things.

1240
01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:18.120
They just start doing little differences and you got all your,
you're doing,

1241
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:22.590
you're doing a whole different thing here and that guy can't see it or a lot of

1242
01:13:22.591 --> 01:13:25.650
people can't to end.
That's what I think is amazing.
Then there's the other thing,

1243
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:29.430
he's got to get off the sauce,
so he got,
he got off the sauce,

1244
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:34.820
so if he gets off the sauce now he's 40 and he's been on Mexican supplements for

1245
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.050
the last few years for sure.
Yeah,
and your whole endocrine system is just like,

1246
01:13:40.330 --> 01:13:45.180
wait,
what's going on?
Hey [inaudible] good luck.

1247
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.560
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean who knows?
Who knows?

1248
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:52.080
I'm going to,
I'm going to have to get myself on some,

1249
01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:55.500
I'm looking forward to get onto charity.
I don't feel like I need it yet.

1250
01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:00.270
Be on a right now.
Really.
It should be done in a long time ago.
You think so?
100%,

1251
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:03.940
but telling you forever.
I know,
I know.
I want to,

1252
01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:08.760
I want to keep squeezing every little ounce of natural juice.
Well,
it's real.

1253
01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:12.040
I mean,
you,
you can do it without it,

1254
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.810
but you won't be as healthy.
You won't be as strong.

1255
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.000
We won't have as much energy.
The real,
you got some energy.
Yeah.

1256
01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:26.280
The best thing would be if they could figure out a way to revitalize your body's

1257
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:28.840
natural production of testosterone.
That's,

1258
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:33.100
that's similar to the way it is when you're a 30 year old man.

1259
01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.540
They could really do that right now.
The camp,
you know right now,

1260
01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.510
you can only add it.
You can,
you can get your,
it put it.

1261
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:43.630
There's a lot of other stuff going on.
Like if you listen to that,
um,

1262
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:48.400
the podcast that I did with,
um,
what's the doctor's name?

1263
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:52.830
That anti aging doctor.
Oh,
David's David Sinclair.
Yeah.
Um,

1264
01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:54.970
there's a lot of factors.
You know,

1265
01:14:54.971 --> 01:14:59.200
there's a lot of different things that you can do and mn,
resveratrol,

1266
01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:01.420
all these different things that I want those things.

1267
01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.110
I want to m and m and m and what is an m?

1268
01:15:04.111 --> 01:15:07.720
N It's telomere along gators.

1269
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.680
Linkedin's you're telling me,

1270
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.780
she's telling me the best sign of the telomeres.

1271
01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:17.590
Get Google the actual definition of telomeres,

1272
01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.880
but it's a the best sign of whether or not your body's aging.
Correct.

1273
01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:28.110
Resveratrol.
Um,
you get online.

1274
01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:32.200
Yeah.
That little container out there.
You could take that if you want.

1275
01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:35.830
I got shit loads of it.
Yeah.
I got a lot of it.
I want to live forever.
Yeah.

1276
01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:37.900
When he told me about it,
I started taking it every day.

1277
01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:42.930
I take it every day with my morning vitamins pretty in a lot of meat you have.

1278
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:48.240
He says no,
I don't listen to him.
He also says to take,
uh,

1279
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:51.960
I listen to him when it's convenient to me and I'll tell him.

1280
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:57.010
He is also called Terra mail telling me or terminal transfer ASE is an enzyme

1281
01:15:58.811 --> 01:16:03.811
made of protein and RNA subunits that long gates chromosomes by adding t t a,

1282
01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:07.480
G,
G,
G,

1283
01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:12.340
O triple g sequences to the end of existing chromosomes.

1284
01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:15.880
Tell him,
tell him.
Morays is found in fetal tissues,

1285
01:16:15.881 --> 01:16:19.030
adult germ cells and also tumor cells.

1286
01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:22.870
The result of aging cells in an aging body,

1287
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:26.990
so just slows down aging.
I'll tell you what,
man,
that NMN stuff,

1288
01:16:26.991 --> 01:16:30.550
it makes me feel great.
It does 100% yeah,
it gives me a lot of energy.
Really?

1289
01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:33.990
Yeah.
How about kitten?
Oh,
Bri.
Some.
I'll get you some.
Yeah,

1290
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.380
unless you want me to die faster.
No,
I love you.
All right,
well look.
Hey,

1291
01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:42.370
get me some fucking,
let's go.
Let's you want me to dive?
I mean,

1292
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:45.100
I was just going to get you TRT verse 10 years.

1293
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.880
I got on it 10 years ago and I was telling you,
dude,
you should be honest.

1294
01:16:48.881 --> 01:16:52.360
Like I'm good,
I'm good.
I know I'm still nervous about it,

1295
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:55.420
but I'm going to do some tests.
Nervous about,
I want to get thick.

1296
01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.460
I people like this.
I want to go like that.

1297
01:16:57.490 --> 01:17:00.610
I want to go and date and jump off a building and glide to the fucking ground.

1298
01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:02.980
You want to look at something like that?
You got a nice body.

1299
01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:04.180
Let's go ahead and lose that shit.

1300
01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:09.410
Let's get you moving around in the corner over there.
They're scared.
Um,
yeah,

1301
01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.280
I wish there was a way to do it naturally and I think there's going to be,

1302
01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:16.520
I think they're going to be able to do it through some sort of gene manipulation

1303
01:17:16.521 --> 01:17:18.850
that the little turn on your bus there,

1304
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:24.070
there is so close to doing this to mice where they're literally reversing the

1305
01:17:24.171 --> 01:17:28.310
age of a mouse and Sinclair was talking about this and I've had some

1306
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:31.400
conversations with some other people that are really deeply entrenched in the

1307
01:17:31.401 --> 01:17:35.610
world of genetic engineering and um,
and CRISPR and all,
all the,

1308
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:39.260
the new innovations there.
They're going to be able to do that.

1309
01:17:39.261 --> 01:17:43.100
It's a matter of when,
I think when we're 80,
it's,

1310
01:17:43.101 --> 01:17:46.430
there's a high probability the,
by the time you and I are 80,

1311
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.450
you're going to be able to be 20 again.
Come on.
I'm,
I'm not bullshit.
Come on.
No,

1312
01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:51.860
I think that's real dude.
I want,

1313
01:17:51.861 --> 01:17:55.580
I want there's that gene that people can get just five hours of sleep,

1314
01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:00.350
that wakefulness thing.
Um,
as in 3% of the population it's called Adderall.

1315
01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:04.530
Yalla there's that tip says that too.
But there's one gene that is,
yeah,

1316
01:18:04.531 --> 01:18:09.470
that where you can act and why we sleep.
He was talking about it but also,
um,

1317
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:11.500
my friend has that gene does genome and the,

1318
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:13.790
I don't let you have that gene frank Grillo cause you'd have that gene.

1319
01:18:13.791 --> 01:18:15.590
Cause I know he doesn't sleep at all.
And I'm always like,

1320
01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:17.030
how do you sleep five hours?
He goes,

1321
01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:21.740
I just wake up and he's fully awake and he works out for fucking two hours and,

1322
01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.340
and I've,

1323
01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:26.180
I've only met one of the dude like that and that's a gene that's vanishingly

1324
01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:30.920
rare.
And some people had can can get five to six hours of sleep,

1325
01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:34.340
five hours and achieve total wakefulness.
They're going to be able to do that.

1326
01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:38.150
Yeah,
they're going to be able to manipulate your eyesight with germs.

1327
01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:43.190
They're going to be able to inject you with a germ that repairs your eyesight.

1328
01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:47.440
What's going on with this pitch?
Can't wait.
You See,

1329
01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.720
Francisco neurology professor using Hue Food Phd discovered the mutation of the

1330
01:18:53.301 --> 01:18:58.301
gene d c to any family of natural short sleepers people who go to bed at a

1331
01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:02.680
normal time.
11:00 PM midnight.
He usually wake up naturally at 5:00 AM.

1332
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:05.390
I wonder if Jocko has that shit.
These are not.

1333
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:09.230
I think he just gets up with pure hate that now.
He probably has that gene.

1334
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:10.940
I don't believe that.
Self Control,

1335
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.710
discipline and self control last only so long.
Wish she was right next to you.

1336
01:19:15.711 --> 01:19:19.610
Change your tune.
It starts sucking his dick.
Jocko is kind of tough,

1337
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:24.920
terrifying black belt in Jujitsu.
Hundred and 40 pounds.
Serial killer that thick.

1338
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:28.490
I didn't know he's that big.
Oh my God.
Oh,
Jesus.
Tacos a tank.
Oh,

1339
01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:32.120
I didn't know that.
Dude.
He's an inch taller than me anyways.
240 pounds.

1340
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:35.750
You don't know what Jocko was a fucking white Samoan to Jocko taps.

1341
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:39.170
Dean lister and training.
What?
Yes.
You don't understand what you're talking.
Oh,

1342
01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:42.440
he's at freezing gorilla.
Yeah,
he is looking at him.
Yeah.

1343
01:19:42.441 --> 01:19:45.530
He said it was that picture of him with his shirt off.
Some men are just men.

1344
01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:49.460
Does that hit click on it?
That's it.
No,
that's not him.

1345
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:53.930
Yeah,
he's a gorilla dude.
That's stupid.
It's getting into bow hunting.

1346
01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:58.220
You should too.
Yeah,
he's a killer.
Don't you want to be a born warrior?
Yeah.

1347
01:19:58.221 --> 01:20:00.990
I went pheasant hunting when my boy Tarik and his brother.
Fun.

1348
01:20:00.991 --> 01:20:05.090
Right and blast flushing pheasant.
Huh?
It's cook the pheasants pheasant.
Oh,

1349
01:20:05.091 --> 01:20:07.860
that's right.
You told me in Napa and Sonoma.
Oh my God.

1350
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.090
Next time you come out we'll go.
Okay.
My Boy Tarik has got it locked down.
We eat.

1351
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.420
We shoot pheasant and you eat the best president.
Drink the best wine.

1352
01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:19.020
There's nothing better and smoke cigars and hang out.
Tell me a better time.

1353
01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.550
Tell me about Jake's buddy Jake.
Yeah.
Jake shields.
Buddy.

1354
01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:27.030
Jake said he corners chick Tarik Tarik Hazeem teaches me boxing.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

1355
01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:30.630
He's got this incredible Jim called empower.
I go there in San Francisco.

1356
01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:33.480
I go to San Francisco.
Just collect.
Hang on.
Is this you guys?

1357
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:35.580
That would be me running.
Oh,
getting cardio.

1358
01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:40.350
Did you have a dog to fetch the birds or did German short hair.
Oh my buddy.

1359
01:20:40.351 --> 01:20:43.260
Tarik Azeem and shout out to,
why are you running with a gun though?
Dude?

1360
01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.780
Cause I get my cardio in a loaded gun.

1361
01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:50.550
Don't mustache that you look like you have a sets right now.
Are you growing one?

1362
01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:52.650
Nah.
I just got to think in a show there,
bro.

1363
01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:56.310
It seems like you're dancing with us and dude,
I just,
I grow hard.

1364
01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:59.680
I grow hard if I could,
if I take a poo and I push hard,
I grow a mustache.
Hm,

1365
01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:04.440
interesting.
Yeah.
Do you try?
Nah,
it just,
it just happens.
I like being manly.

1366
01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:08.880
I like shooting pheasant and by the way that you flush them and then they fly up

1367
01:21:08.881 --> 01:21:12.210
and they're about six feet in front of you and we were still missing still

1368
01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:16.420
fucking course.
It's so annoying.
I went pheasant hunting once with Bordain.

1369
01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:21.010
Oh you did?
Yeah,
I shot one in the feather.
I shot,

1370
01:21:21.011 --> 01:21:23.790
it's feather blue,
a piece of its feather off and it flew away.

1371
01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.540
Laughed at me pro took a shit in my general direction.

1372
01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:31.690
I like caught off one shot.
Look,
public land hunting is hard.
You know,

1373
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:36.510
most of the hunting that I do is on private land.
It's public land hunting.

1374
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.930
A lot of pressure,
a lot of people out there doing it,
you know?
Well,

1375
01:21:39.931 --> 01:21:43.740
animals get smart.
Well they get in,
there's the argument,

1376
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:46.500
there's two arguments and I support both of them.

1377
01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:50.040
One argument is it public land hunting is harder and you should really be more

1378
01:21:50.041 --> 01:21:54.090
proud of success on public land because it's for everybody.

1379
01:21:54.091 --> 01:21:57.240
It's not an elitist thing.
It's very difficult to do.

1380
01:21:57.241 --> 01:22:00.210
You've got to really put in the work.
Yeah,
you got to have discipline.

1381
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:02.700
I get that argument,
but my,

1382
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:05.910
the problem that I have with it is,
first of all,

1383
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:08.580
I don't have a lot of time and I liked success,

1384
01:22:08.850 --> 01:22:13.020
but to the animals,
when they're pressured,

1385
01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:17.550
they don't act normal.
They don't call as much like elk,

1386
01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:20.970
elk in particular event in a high pressure areas.
Problem with wolves,

1387
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:24.630
wolves moving to areas.
The elk just shut down all the calling.

1388
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:29.950
One of the coolest things about elk hunting is they fucking scream.
One,

1389
01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:33.460
the first time I ever went elk hunting with campaigns,
we took me elk hunting.
Uh,

1390
01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.910
I remember this morning we're out there in this base and you hear just boy,

1391
01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:42.660
you hear him screaming and it's still dark out and we're walking in like,

1392
01:22:42.661 --> 01:22:45.480
this is the fucking coolest thing I've ever heard in my life.

1393
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:49.260
Just hearing them scream and yelling at each other and trying to fight off the

1394
01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:50.310
other males.
And you hear their,

1395
01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:54.150
their horns clashing against each other because their antlers are,
they're there,

1396
01:22:54.170 --> 01:22:57.400
they're fighting.
And this is on public land or is this,
this was on private land.

1397
01:22:57.401 --> 01:22:58.530
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause I,
I,

1398
01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:01.590
this is for me a lot of that hunting and we needed to do it again,
by the way.

1399
01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:05.200
Yeah,
I don't,
it's not so much about killing the animal.
I,
it's the comradery.

1400
01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.560
Like,
like so I'm on this,
they stock this field with these pheasant.

1401
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:11.770
I'm not there to kill the fest and I loved the meats and stuff and,
but,

1402
01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:16.690
but it's more the experience with my two friends and we're out there with a dog.

1403
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:20.590
I like to say that too,
but I like to kill elk.
Oh,
to eat.
I like the food.

1404
01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:24.130
I liked the meat.
Yeah.
I live off elk.
You check my DNA.

1405
01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:28.390
It's 65% el kindly to Mel.
I'm not bullshitting.
I eat so much of it.

1406
01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:33.700
I feel focused.
Great.
I bet.
I mean,
I think there's something to it.
I did too.

1407
01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:37.480
It's what I say.
I need a lot of it.
I'm meeting this dark red protein.

1408
01:23:37.481 --> 01:23:37.990
That's good.

1409
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:41.620
It's coming from these fuck when I have animals that are dodging mountain lions

1410
01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:46.350
and it's good for you.
Yeah.
You take the life force of the animal into your man.

1411
01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:50.710
There's something about that.
I swear to God and even the pheasant,
like you know,

1412
01:23:50.711 --> 01:23:52.390
it's,
it's,
there's just something,

1413
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:58.110
there's something about looking for an animal that focuses your mind and even in

1414
01:23:59.111 --> 01:24:01.570
something as lame as when they're roosting on a field.

1415
01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.010
You've got the dog and the dog points.
It's exciting.
And fishing.

1416
01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:09.700
I had such a,
what's that?
You look fishing.
I don't,
I'm not a good Fisher.

1417
01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:12.730
I'm sure if I learned how to fish,
but fishing is technique.

1418
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:16.710
We tried to know I grew up fishing.
Oh you did?
Yeah,
I was real.

1419
01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.830
I was in the Bass Angler Sportsman society like 13 years old.

1420
01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:24.380
You're a competitive warranty,
you know,
I mean I just like to fish.
Yeah.

1421
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:27.250
I mean competitive by friends,
you always want to catch the biggest fish.

1422
01:24:27.251 --> 01:24:29.440
But there's something about fishing,
man.

1423
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:34.470
There's something about casting align and the best to me is like a top water

1424
01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:35.920
bait.

1425
01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:40.720
Like you cast a plug and you see it land on the water pauses,

1426
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.720
the ripples sort of spread out and then you'd give it a twitch,

1427
01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:46.420
give it another twitch and you let it pause again.

1428
01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:48.910
And then a big explosion of water.

1429
01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:55.150
It got that mother fucker like,
Oh shit dude.
My little daughter,

1430
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:58.370
my youngest is hundred percent hooked on fishing.
Really?

1431
01:24:58.371 --> 01:25:02.040
She got a six pound bass in Florida.
Yeah,
man,

1432
01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:07.480
it keeps me out to no end because she's my little fishing buddy.
Like we were,

1433
01:25:07.481 --> 01:25:12.370
we were in Maui and when we were in Maui we went,
um,
we went hunting or hunting.

1434
01:25:12.371 --> 01:25:16.530
We went and caught a yellow tail and she caught out gang,

1435
01:25:16.531 --> 01:25:19.060
a yellow tail and this little tiny girl,

1436
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:23.520
like a 10 pound yellowtail is a mother fucker to try to reel in.

1437
01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:27.730
There is so hard to reel in.
And she was reeling him in on her own man.
I mean,

1438
01:25:27.731 --> 01:25:30.940
all I had to do is hold the rod because it literally would have yanked the rod

1439
01:25:30.941 --> 01:25:33.260
out of her hands.
I'm trying to show you a picture that's okay.

1440
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:38.230
I've got a picture in here somewhere.
Take my daughter fishing.
Dude.
It's fun man.

1441
01:25:38.231 --> 01:25:42.340
And then,
you know,
with,
with the Bass,
we'd let them go.
Okay,
here's,
here's,

1442
01:25:43.090 --> 01:25:47.770
here's her with a six pound bass.
Perfect.
Look with the,
with the Bass,

1443
01:25:47.771 --> 01:25:51.820
we let him go.
It was a catch and release deal.
Um,
but the yellow tail,

1444
01:25:51.821 --> 01:25:55.410
we ate that that night.
So the whole family ate something that she called.

1445
01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:00.270
That's good.
She loved,
that's huge.
So excited by it.
She got,
so she just,

1446
01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:03.650
she beams with pride.
It's this little tiny girl.
Yeah.
You know,

1447
01:26:03.651 --> 01:26:07.160
and she's holding onto this,
right?
She would not let me reel it in.
She's like,

1448
01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:09.350
do you want me to,
I go,
do you want me to real an answer?
No,

1449
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:14.590
she had two hands on it going to get us cranking and I'm holding onto it and she

1450
01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:19.460
made sure she pulled it into the boat too.
Like she's obsessed.
It's awesome.

1451
01:26:19.461 --> 01:26:20.180
I love that.

1452
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:24.320
I think once you've felt what it's like to catch a fish and then cook it and eat

1453
01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:29.300
it once.
And by the way,
if you never had really fresh fish,

1454
01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:31.040
it's really fresh.

1455
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:36.041
Fish is so flavorful and delicious and just a little bit of butter and lemon on

1456
01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:39.680
it.
And since it's a little bit of seasoning and I've done that plenty of times.

1457
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:45.080
I've gone on organize fishing,
deep sea fishing.

1458
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.070
You know what we should do?

1459
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:51.430
We should organize a Gig in Alaska in July during the salmon runs a great idea.

1460
01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:54.950
We'll do a gig up there and got to encourage,

1461
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:59.450
we'll catch some salmon for a few days,
do a Gig to pay for the whole trip.

1462
01:26:59.930 --> 01:27:03.470
Just have a good time.
Ari and I did that a few years and I love to do that.
Dude,

1463
01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:06.590
Ari and I did that and we caught some giant salmon.
Let's do that.

1464
01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:10.670
We caught some king salmon.
They were like 30 pounds was amazing.
Wow.

1465
01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:15.230
I ate salmon for fucking months.
Jesus.
Yeah.
I love that.
So fun.

1466
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:18.920
I'd love to do that,
but you know what's fucked?
The mosquitoes,
it's crazy.

1467
01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:22.550
The worst.
Never seen anything like it.
It's like an assault.
Yeah.

1468
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.970
It's like a gang violence in Indonesia.
When I,
when I,

1469
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:29.960
when I was tracking orangutans and the rainforest,

1470
01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:33.760
I was 21 or whatever and I thought I wanted to be a naturalist.
Yeah,
right.

1471
01:27:33.761 --> 01:27:38.330
I love that story.
About the ants.
Oh Dude,
fuck,
forget the ants.

1472
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:43.460
You had to carry a sulfur coil because bug repellent didn't work on those

1473
01:27:43.461 --> 01:27:47.390
mosquitoes.
You had to carry around a sulfur coil.
Look at that.

1474
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:50.160
That's already in the salmon.
Could I the Queen afterwards?

1475
01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.210
Fucking Santa Grand Jewish.
How doors as a big ass salmon.
Yeah,

1476
01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:58.730
it is.
Is there any more pictures of our fish?
One picture.

1477
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:03.650
There's one other thing,
but I didn't check that.
That was a big ass fish though.

1478
01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:08.570
Look at Ari.
Handsome bastard.
Yeah,
it's fun man.

1479
01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:09.493
I love fishing.

1480
01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.980
I really wish there was a place click close to my house where I could fish.

1481
01:28:13.190 --> 01:28:17.930
It's very peaceful,
you know like fish for your breakfast.
Catch a trout.
Yeah.

1482
01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:22.400
And then you know cook that motherfucker in a pan right there on the shore.
Oh,

1483
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:25.610
it's incredible.
So known to have a lot of,
and people want to haunt him.

1484
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:30.800
Like Justin Napa Valley,
a shitload of mountain lion hunt them though.

1485
01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.740
Now they're everywhere though.
Apparently too many of them.

1486
01:28:34.110 --> 01:28:36.800
There was a real dump thing because they do hunt them,

1487
01:28:36.801 --> 01:28:39.620
but they hunt them with a professional hunters.

1488
01:28:39.621 --> 01:28:44.360
At the state has to hire because they get depredation permits because they start

1489
01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:47.790
killing livestock or dogs or what.

1490
01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.440
I grabbed a Lama when I'm glad a Llama and jumped over the fence with the Lama

1491
01:28:51.441 --> 01:28:55.260
in its mouth.
Yeah.
I mean that's fucking nuts.
You can't do that then.

1492
01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:59.660
No crazy.
I train but you,
but even if you train,
he put it on your back.

1493
01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:02.310
Let's see.
Let's,
if you put a a lama

1494
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.590
<v 1>in a backpack,
say you got like a fucking Cafaro backpack.</v>

1495
01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:10.560
Good luck stuffed the in there.
You had the whole lobby zipped it in,
had it.
Okay.

1496
01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.100
Go over that fence.
He'd be like,
well my buddy who was a guide in Alaska,

1497
01:29:14.490 --> 01:29:17.400
my buddy Chad,
he said that they were climbing up this mountain.

1498
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:18.900
It was a fucking nightmare.

1499
01:29:18.901 --> 01:29:22.970
Like they'd like just slogging up this steep mountain just like,

1500
01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:26.340
and they were like looking up and they're like,
God damn,
this is a nightmare.

1501
01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:28.590
You know,
you're making like inches.
Just like,

1502
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.920
Oh and you got a backpack and it just like,
when is this going to be over?

1503
01:29:31.921 --> 01:29:36.810
And don't try not to think about it.
Let's take a break,
you know,

1504
01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:42.320
and they just hear this and they just see this grizzly with an elk in its mouth

1505
01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.670
and it just bounds up the mountain.

1506
01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:47.900
It just goes Shagun Shagun right by them with,
uh,

1507
01:29:48.190 --> 01:29:52.470
with an open its mouth and just goes up over the mountain and over the ridge,

1508
01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:57.090
just no problem in 12 seconds.
And they were like,
well,
that's a grizzly.

1509
01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:02.220
That's how strong a fucking girls face.
And this is me,
Jesus Christ.

1510
01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:05.400
I don't want to get,
that's,
I'm so terrified of,
I'm terrified.

1511
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:08.010
I don't want to fuck get fucked up by a chimpanzee.

1512
01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:11.430
A chimpanzee will eat my face and my boss.
So I don't want that.

1513
01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:15.180
And I definitely don't want to get attacked by a grizzly because they'll start

1514
01:30:15.181 --> 01:30:18.570
eating you when you're still alive.
And that's a problem.

1515
01:30:18.571 --> 01:30:19.620
Most of the time grizzlies

1516
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.630
<v 2>eat people though,
or most time of grizzlies kill people.</v>

1517
01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:25.030
They're not killing someone because they want to eat them,
right?

1518
01:30:25.031 --> 01:30:28.010
They're killing someone because you startled them and they're with their female,

1519
01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:31.150
the females with their cubs.
So that's the most.
So what happens when,

1520
01:30:31.151 --> 01:30:34.480
what are you supposed to do when a grizzly just pray?
Well,

1521
01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:38.710
if it's a female grizzly,
you are literally better off letting her fuck you up,

1522
01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.690
right?
It just curl up in a ball.

1523
01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.550
You're supposed to put your hand behind your neck,

1524
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:47.350
lay in a fetal position and don't let her get access to your organs cause she

1525
01:30:47.351 --> 01:30:49.210
wants to chew your Oregon's apart.
Yeah.

1526
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:52.360
It's one of the reasons why it's really important to have a strong backpack.

1527
01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:56.860
He was strong backpack.
She'll fuck up that backpack while you're on,
on your,

1528
01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:59.290
you know,
on your knees,
curl up in a fetal position,

1529
01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:03.160
but that's assuming you can survive that she's probably going to break your
arms.

1530
01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:06.760
She's probably going to snap your legs bite into you in ways that you can't

1531
01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:09.070
imagine the kind of force and power she can generate.

1532
01:31:09.670 --> 01:31:10.960
She's trying to immobilize you.

1533
01:31:10.961 --> 01:31:14.770
She wants to mobilize you as a threat to her children.
But a male,

1534
01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:18.190
if a male is trying to kill you,
it's usually because he's starving to death.

1535
01:31:18.490 --> 01:31:22.690
They don't recognize people as a food source,
so they rarely people.

1536
01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:26.290
So that mail PR,
it probably has never eaten a person.

1537
01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.380
It's one of the reasons why it's safer to be in a place where they hunt

1538
01:31:29.381 --> 01:31:32.020
grizzlies.
Cause in a place where they hunt grizzlies,
the grizzlies,

1539
01:31:32.021 --> 01:31:35.290
he's a person,
he goes,
fuck this,
they'll smell you and get the fuck out of there.

1540
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:39.880
Right.
But like Yellowstone,
they haven't hunt grizzlies there and forever.

1541
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:43.720
So people still get jack.
They're still,
they get jack or every couple of years.

1542
01:31:43.721 --> 01:31:46.000
So it gets killed.
You should,

1543
01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:49.630
but you might not be able to get to it and you also have to be prepared to pull

1544
01:31:49.631 --> 01:31:53.080
it out and shoot quickly.
You can't think that just because you have a gun,

1545
01:31:53.081 --> 01:31:55.270
you're going to be okay.
No,
because you don't hear him coming up on,

1546
01:31:55.290 --> 01:31:58.630
you come up so fast.
They move so fast.
They run,

1547
01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:02.230
they fast as a dog and they're huge.
That's true.
Yes.

1548
01:32:02.231 --> 01:32:06.450
There they run fast as fuck man.
And they're huge means a giant animal.

1549
01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.810
That 800 pounds.
Think about that.
Sure.

1550
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:11.240
<v 3>That's just stumbled across a story about this just happened.</v>

1551
01:32:11.970 --> 01:32:16.140
Bear spray didn't work and it was attack and the guide and the,
the,

1552
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:21.350
the client went to grab the glock out of the pack and it didn't fire.

1553
01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:23.400
And then the bear came after him.

1554
01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:26.790
So he tried to throw the gun to the other guy and then it didn't a deck I just

1555
01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:31.320
ran.
And I guess that's how follow the died and who died.
It doesn't say,

1556
01:32:31.650 --> 01:32:34.900
I don't,
I didn't find out.
I mean it happens all the time.
Yeah.

1557
01:32:35.010 --> 01:32:37.750
<v 2>The best story is Rinella story,
uh,</v>

1558
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:42.330
Rinella and Remy Warren and is Fatalis and uh,
our friends,

1559
01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:47.310
they uh,
they got attacked while they were in a fog neck island in Alaska.

1560
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:51.420
Yeah.
Yes.
Like two years ago.

1561
01:32:51.421 --> 01:32:55.290
And Remy came on here and told the story and it's fucking terrible.
God,

1562
01:32:55.291 --> 01:32:58.650
what happened?
Well,
they killed an elk and um,

1563
01:32:58.651 --> 01:33:02.400
they had hung it in a tree and they had taken some of the meat back cause you

1564
01:33:02.401 --> 01:33:06.480
know,
you have to hike out a fog.
NAC is particularly dense.
It's very,

1565
01:33:06.481 --> 01:33:08.910
very dense.
Vich like,

1566
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:12.350
remember when we were on Prince of Wales island when we went on that dense.

1567
01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:16.710
Dense,
yeah.
Well,
it's like that,
but even worse.
And Grizzlies everywhere.
Yes.

1568
01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:18.480
Grizzlies everywhere.
Where was a huge problem with that?

1569
01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:22.410
When we were on an island that island had black bears.
Yeah.
Which weirdly enough,

1570
01:33:22.411 --> 01:33:26.010
they're not as dangerous,
but they are more predatory towards people.

1571
01:33:26.010 --> 01:33:30.100
I want a giant spike Telmate and spiked collar and I want my guns like clothes

1572
01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.610
closed.
Won The iron man suit.
That's right.

1573
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:36.100
I want to be able to correct shoot rockets out of my hands.
That's right.

1574
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:39.050
And I want to be able to electrify it when the,
when the thing bites,
yes.

1575
01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:43.500
Kill it and then immediately cut its head off and put it on a steak so all the

1576
01:33:43.501 --> 01:33:46.670
other grizzly bears known not to fuck.
That's exactly right.
Right.
Okay.

1577
01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:50.400
There you go.
We're on like a man.
Yeah,
we definitely need to go on a hunt again.

1578
01:33:50.490 --> 01:33:53.670
I know,
Dude.
It's so much fun.
Yeah.
Even if a,
if it's a rifle hunt,

1579
01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:56.960
I'll go on a rifle hunt.
You,
you just love bow hunting.
Huh?
I love you.

1580
01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:59.190
Bought me a bow.
I need,
I was going to bring it to the tells you.

1581
01:33:59.190 --> 01:34:03.120
You shoot it shot and I wanted to apply your boat three years ago.

1582
01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:07.260
I know you a new one
comes out with new models every year.

1583
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:10.650
I liked that one.
I haven't,
I've never shot.
It's great bow.
So let me,

1584
01:34:10.651 --> 01:34:14.100
let me get used to that one.
Not become expert.
Well,
um,

1585
01:34:14.130 --> 01:34:16.950
what I would like you to do,
honestly,
what I'd like to do,

1586
01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:19.530
and we should organize this with John.
Oh,
John Dudley,

1587
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:21.110
because we have access to the,

1588
01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:25.230
literally the best archery coach on the planet earth in John Dudley.

1589
01:34:25.530 --> 01:34:29.340
He's the best.
He's so good when he's,
first of all,
he's a world.

1590
01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:31.820
He was a world class competitive archer.
Look,

1591
01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:36.120
he competed on the world stage who traveled all throughout the planet.

1592
01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:40.320
But so what is his like what are the principles he teaches?
Well,
first of all,

1593
01:34:40.321 --> 01:34:43.470
it's just like martial arts.
If you have a bad coach,

1594
01:34:43.471 --> 01:34:46.680
you'll develop bad technique and it's going to be very difficult for you to

1595
01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:50.790
learn.
You can still excel.
Some People Still Excel with bad coaching,
you know,

1596
01:34:50.791 --> 01:34:54.720
there's people that have just a natural ability to fight,
right?

1597
01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.940
And you teach them,
you just a few things,

1598
01:34:56.941 --> 01:34:58.850
they know how to like put knuckles to your face.

1599
01:34:58.851 --> 01:35:01.570
Some people are just better at that and they just,

1600
01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.290
they have a good mentality for it,

1601
01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:06.230
but they would be way better if there were with for Rasa Hobby,

1602
01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.680
they would be way better if they're with Duke Roufus there's just no doubt about

1603
01:35:09.681 --> 01:35:14.070
it.
Great Coaching is imperative for achieving your full potential and percent.

1604
01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:18.680
That's the same thing with archery.
With archery.
A guy like John Dudley,

1605
01:35:18.681 --> 01:35:23.660
we'll put the fundamentals in the perfect position for you and he changed my

1606
01:35:23.661 --> 01:35:28.220
archery so much that like I had been doing archery for more than a year or so

1607
01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:31.780
before I met him.
Maybe a year and a half.
My,
my whole,
uh,

1608
01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.880
my ability jumped up 20 to 30% within the first couple hours of meeting him.

1609
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.710
Wow.
Yeah.
What 100%.
Geez,

1610
01:35:39.711 --> 01:35:44.711
you got video of me and him and my backyard and I'm laying these nocturnal Aero

1611
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:49.490
Knox.
They lit Knox.
So they fly through the air,

1612
01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:54.080
it looks like laser beams and I'm laying them into my elk target at like 65

1613
01:35:54.081 --> 01:35:56.930
yards.
Just thunk,
thunk,
thunk all of them going into the vitals.

1614
01:35:56.931 --> 01:36:00.170
So boxing is like that.
Oh,
I had uh,
Donald Serani one time.

1615
01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:05.030
Just sit there and explain to me like where to place my feet and what I was

1616
01:36:05.031 --> 01:36:07.760
doing wrong and why more way should be on my back foot.

1617
01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:10.490
But just little things like that or my buddy Tarik all,

1618
01:36:10.491 --> 01:36:12.950
I'm weighing the Calico of course who I train with,
but,

1619
01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:15.920
but my boy Tarik like he'll teach me stuff that,

1620
01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:18.560
it comes from that MMA background,
but just where,

1621
01:36:18.561 --> 01:36:22.610
where you're looking like how to judge distance and there are certain techniques

1622
01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:26.240
to do it or just where your back foot should be in relation to that person's

1623
01:36:26.241 --> 01:36:29.630
foot regarding,
you know,
they're just how to set things up and they can,

1624
01:36:29.631 --> 01:36:33.170
some people can simplify it and teach it as basic principles were like,

1625
01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:38.180
Damn Damn,
it makes such a huge difference.
A huge difference.
Sure.

1626
01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.160
You know,
I mean,

1627
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:45.050
there's ways to do things correctly and people have spent their entire life

1628
01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:49.220
learning these things and learning how to teach these things too,

1629
01:36:49.221 --> 01:36:50.750
which is critical.
You know,

1630
01:36:50.751 --> 01:36:55.751
theirs look like we both came from a taekwondo background and I got very,

1631
01:36:56.271 --> 01:37:00.530
very,
very fortunate in that the school that I found that I stumbled into,

1632
01:37:00.531 --> 01:37:04.460
Jay Kim taekwondo and do in Boston was one of the best gyms on earth.

1633
01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:09.140
I just got super lucky.
So I learned from the time I was a young kid,

1634
01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:14.360
I learned the right way to do things and the emphasis was always on technique.

1635
01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:18.080
Yep.
It,
it didn't matter how fast you were,
if you were doing it wrong,

1636
01:37:18.081 --> 01:37:22.670
you were corrected.
The Russians are like that.
Like there's this tennis woman in,

1637
01:37:22.671 --> 01:37:26.300
in Moscow who's responsible for the tennis revolution,

1638
01:37:26.301 --> 01:37:30.350
Sharapova and all those people,
and she is a coach who,

1639
01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:35.270
she's like 77 she's got like two courts and the kids,

1640
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.320
when they get there,

1641
01:37:36.321 --> 01:37:39.920
I don't think they're allowed to really hit a ball for the first six months.

1642
01:37:39.921 --> 01:37:44.900
I mean,
there's swing your swing and you're,
you're positioning.

1643
01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:49.100
She ingrains those fundamentals so that you can't do it wrong.

1644
01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:53.630
So before you start playing tennis,
you are ingraining,
uh,
uh,

1645
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.800
neural pathways and patterns

1646
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.150
<v 1>that are perfectly correct so that when the shit hits the fan,</v>

1647
01:38:00.151 --> 01:38:03.440
you get emotional.
You don't know how to do it wrong.
You don't know how.
Right,

1648
01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:03.960
right,
right.

1649
01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.900
I think virtual hunter and those guys do the same thing when they train.

1650
01:38:06.901 --> 01:38:11.030
You know,
like when you went very long.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Virtual hell no,
but,

1651
01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:13.800
but hunter who is,
um,
who's,
uh,
uh,

1652
01:38:13.801 --> 01:38:17.160
Andre Ward's coach virtual though,
isn't that right now?

1653
01:38:17.170 --> 01:38:19.290
I think it's personal hunter look that up.
But,
but,

1654
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:22.590
but what they'll do is that original hill was the light heavyweight champion

1655
01:38:22.591 --> 01:38:25.920
that Roy Jones Jr and knocked out with a body shot.
Um,

1656
01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.840
I think his coach,
but version of those,

1657
01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:32.220
I've been talking to Andre Ward on the Instagram to get ahold of him.

1658
01:38:32.221 --> 01:38:35.400
Such a mass.
Get Him in here.
He's,
he's not just a mastery.

1659
01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:38.250
So brilliant analyst too.
He's,
he's amazing.

1660
01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:43.250
But he was trained where the discipline of of fundamentals and perfecting your

1661
01:38:44.461 --> 01:38:47.800
technical hunter.
Yeah.
First of all,
hunter,
can you listen to Virgil Hunter?
I've,

1662
01:38:47.810 --> 01:38:52.680
I listened to him the way he speaks and uh,
I just,
I obsess over over that.

1663
01:38:52.681 --> 01:38:54.480
Like I love watching the old school guys.

1664
01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.110
This has got coach Anthony who I watch his videos on Youtube.

1665
01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:59.820
I think he's in Kansas City by the way.

1666
01:38:59.821 --> 01:39:02.160
I'd love to get in there and train with him,
but he's,

1667
01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:06.810
he's a guy who like breaks shit down in those little details and you just

1668
01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:11.160
realize what a science boxing is and you realize like it was that awesome Eddie

1669
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.240
Teddy House thing you did where he goes,

1670
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:15.630
his boxer like you're making mistakes but then there are mortal,

1671
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:18.630
like you're making sins but you're making mortal sins like getting hit with

1672
01:39:18.631 --> 01:39:22.620
shots you don't see.
He can teach you how to avoid that.
Yeah.

1673
01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:25.770
And that's a little detail and everything in life is that way.

1674
01:39:25.771 --> 01:39:27.690
It's like you want to be really good at something,

1675
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:32.580
get great coaching and it's those small adjustments that make all the

1676
01:39:32.581 --> 01:39:34.260
difference.
Like the bed,
that was the number one,

1677
01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.180
the a hundred a hundred tennis player in the world.

1678
01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:39.000
And the number two tennis player in the world is that much,

1679
01:39:39.330 --> 01:39:41.730
but it's all the difference in the world.
Yeah.
Um,

1680
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:46.790
learning how to do things correctly in every single discipline is the most

1681
01:39:47.071 --> 01:39:51.360
important thing.
Yeah.
Learning how to do it correctly.
And then from there,

1682
01:39:51.690 --> 01:39:56.370
all your creativity and all your ability to improvise all comes from these

1683
01:39:56.371 --> 01:39:59.070
perfect fundamentals.
That's right.
Did you watch Earl spins?

1684
01:39:59.071 --> 01:40:02.730
Junior miking Garcia and I did not and I want to see Earl Spence.

1685
01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.210
He just looks so much bigger than Michael Garcia.
A lot bigger.
A lot bigger.

1686
01:40:06.211 --> 01:40:10.770
I want to see her.
I'll Spence and Mr. Crawford go at it.
Oh,
me too.

1687
01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.910
That's going to be,
that's going to be a big fight.
I just felt like Mike Garcia,

1688
01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:16.250
who I love,
I'm going to watch it,
but he,

1689
01:40:16.251 --> 01:40:19.980
he just looked so much smaller and rural.
Spence hits too hard.

1690
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:23.250
He won't look bigger.
He won't look that much bigger than Terrence.

1691
01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:25.520
Terrence Crawford is about is he's,

1692
01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.680
he's a guy who changes things up,
man.

1693
01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:32.650
Always thinking that he'll come out and fight the first five rounds of the

1694
01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:33.210
southbound.

1695
01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:36.240
You think you got them figured out and then they'll switch stances and fuck you

1696
01:40:36.241 --> 01:40:41.040
up.
That that kind of genius,
that Kinda high fight Iq is crazy.

1697
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:43.830
What's also that ambidextrous ability is so critical.
I mean,

1698
01:40:43.831 --> 01:40:47.340
that was Marvin Hagler.
Marvin Hagler used to switch back and forth and no one,

1699
01:40:47.370 --> 01:40:50.280
you couldn't do Jack Shit about it.
He would fight you as a southpaw,

1700
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:53.500
just as good as you'd fight you orthodox and he didn't know what the fuck coming

1701
01:40:53.501 --> 01:40:56.800
next there is.
Taran could do that.
There was add fighter who said,
I can't,

1702
01:40:56.801 --> 01:41:00.400
he's reading my mind because he's reading my mind.
He goes,
what?
He goes,

1703
01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:02.200
he knows what I'm gonna do before I do it.
Well.
Well,

1704
01:41:02.201 --> 01:41:05.380
Duran understood those patterns so well.
He could,
he could just,

1705
01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.770
he'd just cuts you off.
He just be like,
oh,
I know what you're going to do.

1706
01:41:08.771 --> 01:41:12.250
I can see already what you're setting up before you do it.
Yeah.

1707
01:41:12.251 --> 01:41:15.610
That's like Jujitsu.
You know your role with someone who's really good.

1708
01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:19.150
They know watch tenor Gracelyn way before you're going to do it.

1709
01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:21.910
I watched Henna Gracie Take Brendan Shop Lit.
I'm a cheetah.

1710
01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:24.710
I mean all these guys,
these killers,
I was like,
I was,

1711
01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:28.060
he was starting on his back and they're on top of him and he wouldn't choke them

1712
01:41:28.061 --> 01:41:32.900
out.
I was like,
what?
Yeah,
he lets them take us back.
But,

1713
01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.570
but again,
he's so far ahead of them.

1714
01:41:34.571 --> 01:41:38.200
He knows what you're going to do so he can cut you off.
It's like every hair tie.

1715
01:41:38.201 --> 01:41:41.980
I tried to move around with Wayne McCullough,
like he'll just,
he just,

1716
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.170
no matter what I'm doing,
I'm doing the winky right thing.

1717
01:41:44.171 --> 01:41:45.670
I'm keeping my hands here.
I'm like,
there's no,

1718
01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:48.610
and he just finds your face and he's touching you.

1719
01:41:48.611 --> 01:41:52.720
And it's like everything right along that things get you get better at

1720
01:41:52.721 --> 01:41:53.291
everything.
I mean,

1721
01:41:53.291 --> 01:41:56.200
like you know that feeling that you get when you watch someone who's only been

1722
01:41:56.201 --> 01:41:59.830
doing standup like a year and you see them going on in front of a crowd and you

1723
01:41:59.831 --> 01:42:04.831
see them choking up panicking and maybe rushing a joke or being awkward.

1724
01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:09.970
I have to run away.
Yeah,
man,
it's weird.
But then ladies and gentlemen,

1725
01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:14.410
here's your next comic.
Brian Cowen.
Yeah,
just go up and just loose and relaxed.

1726
01:42:14.650 --> 01:42:17.560
You've seen it all before,
but I do,
but this is what I like.

1727
01:42:17.561 --> 01:42:22.561
What I like is that there are all these things that you can do like that where

1728
01:42:23.021 --> 01:42:25.750
you just get better.
If you keep doing it,
you learn more.

1729
01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:29.710
I think learning things and there's an art to learning.
There's an art to learn,

1730
01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:32.170
but I think it's so critical to enjoying life.

1731
01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:36.730
I think that's one of the like learning stuff and doing difficult things.

1732
01:42:36.731 --> 01:42:40.930
We can see incremental improvement that's that's based on your effort and your

1733
01:42:40.931 --> 01:42:44.680
concentration.
I think these are really important for happiness.

1734
01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:48.880
100% like think about all of our friends that are really happy that we're all

1735
01:42:48.881 --> 01:42:50.350
pursuing things.
Also,

1736
01:42:50.351 --> 01:42:53.260
I know where to place my energy and I can see myself getting better,

1737
01:42:53.261 --> 01:42:57.220
but more importantly I can,
not only do I see myself getting better,
but I can.

1738
01:42:57.230 --> 01:43:02.030
I come to understandings when I'm writing standup now when I'm thinking of what

1739
01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:06.350
my next,
my next one hours going to be,
I I'm,

1740
01:43:06.690 --> 01:43:11.290
I start kind of like getting to what I think about an essence,

1741
01:43:11.291 --> 01:43:14.920
like where am I right now?
I've kind of arrived at a place.

1742
01:43:14.921 --> 01:43:19.540
I set these goals for myself and now what?
Now what?
Now I've got to stand still.

1743
01:43:19.541 --> 01:43:23.380
Maybe what the fuck does that look like?
Well,
I'm going to write about that.

1744
01:43:23.650 --> 01:43:26.680
I'm going to write about not,
not my life has been either a fight or I'm not.

1745
01:43:26.681 --> 01:43:27.880
I'm ready to run away,
right?

1746
01:43:28.090 --> 01:43:31.450
Just choke about not wearing moccasins and I had this therapist a wore
moccasins.

1747
01:43:31.451 --> 01:43:31.661
I was like,

1748
01:43:31.661 --> 01:43:34.210
I don't trust somebody who wears moccasin mock something really good for

1749
01:43:34.211 --> 01:43:36.040
stalking the year either.

1750
01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:39.730
I was going to say the only time a mock moccasin is macho as if you're sneaking

1751
01:43:39.731 --> 01:43:43.270
up on a castle guard to take them out with a knife or your hunting deer.

1752
01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:46.240
That's the only time.
Otherwise we're a cult leader and you're selling your cock.

1753
01:43:46.241 --> 01:43:48.280
I have,
you know what I mean?
Paris mock saying,
well,

1754
01:43:48.281 --> 01:43:52.010
I don't trust you unless you've got a bone in your hand.
If you come out with her

1755
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:55.430
<v 2>moccasins and you're smiling,
you're trying to fuck bought.
A new pair is bottle.</v>

1756
01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:58.760
Yeah.
All right.
Well good.
Just for stalking.
I like

1757
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:02.140
to see you.
Don't break any twigs.
I'm here.
Well,

1758
01:44:02.170 --> 01:44:04.610
you want on your fucking phone to be able to walk like this.

1759
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:08.810
You want to be able to walk?
Yes.
Well,
when I was in,

1760
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:11.240
when I was in Indonesia and my Dayak guides,

1761
01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:15.410
the indigenous people of Indonesia didn't break a twin under their feet.

1762
01:44:15.630 --> 01:44:18.650
Bare feets her bare feet in feet for great.

1763
01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.170
The in the rain forest for no problem.
Cooties.
I'd hunt with bare feet.
You got,

1764
01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:29.030
you got leeches.
You got spiders.
They didn't get by.
He ain't,

1765
01:44:29.031 --> 01:44:32.930
I'm worried about snakes and girls.
US of us.
Well,
you should be.
Yeah,

1766
01:44:33.110 --> 01:44:35.800
especially warm months.
The last scene when here

1767
01:44:37.530 --> 01:44:42.410
she's,
fuck man,
I've never been bitten,

1768
01:44:42.411 --> 01:44:45.350
but I've had my dogs bitten three times.
The Frank.
Yeah.

1769
01:44:45.351 --> 01:44:49.730
Frank got bitten three fucking times.
Yeah.
Franklin,
Lucy,
they both got bitten.

1770
01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:53.450
You have to get him.
I'm going to bring him to the fucking doctor.

1771
01:44:53.451 --> 01:44:57.020
One time I brought him to the doctor,
the doctor looked at him,
says,
well,

1772
01:44:57.021 --> 01:44:58.210
I don't see any swelling.
The mind,

1773
01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:01.580
it might not have gotten them cause he killed the snake.
And I was like,

1774
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.020
I don't see that thought.
He's such a psycho.
He's not smart.

1775
01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:09.950
He just would charge in it and just snap at things like the idea that this thing

1776
01:45:09.951 --> 01:45:13.280
didn't bite him.
And he goes,
well,
you know,
if he's feeling bad,

1777
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:16.040
take them back in again.
I bring them home an hour later.

1778
01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:19.020
His face has got it growing up,
basketball off the side of it.
I haven't it,

1779
01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:23.810
my dog just fucking bring them back in.
But it was expensive.
Two minutes,

1780
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:27.470
which is a real bummer because it's thousands and thousands of dollars for this

1781
01:45:27.471 --> 01:45:31.720
antivenom.
And if you're a poor person and they want that money right now,
I know,

1782
01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:35.720
man.
I have,
I have pet insurance.
My dog got hit by a car.

1783
01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:39.620
$14,000,
sir.
Thank God for pet insurance.
Wow.

1784
01:45:39.650 --> 01:45:42.840
I paid like nothing embassy.
It was incredible.
Um,

1785
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:47.660
so pet insurance is unnecessary.
I think my dog got bit by a rattlesnake.

1786
01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:51.200
It didn't see the rattlesnake,
but I heard my dog like that and I went,

1787
01:45:51.201 --> 01:45:55.010
what the fuck?
And we're walking back.
I'm,
I'm,
I've,
I've never seen him.
Like,

1788
01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:55.890
we're walking back,

1789
01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:00.440
my dog's tongue is out and my dog starts weaving and then just kind of falls

1790
01:46:00.441 --> 01:46:03.740
over.
Oh,
Jesus.
I picked the dog up.
I bring that dog to the vet.

1791
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:07.050
I thought maybe he got stung by a wasp or something.
I didn't know.

1792
01:46:07.051 --> 01:46:08.960
And then I was like,
this,
this sheet.
And I was like,

1793
01:46:08.961 --> 01:46:13.580
I think she got bit by a rattlesnake.
And uh,
she was so swollen.

1794
01:46:13.581 --> 01:46:16.340
Her head was so,
it led by the time I got there at her head was like,

1795
01:46:16.341 --> 01:46:18.050
literally it looked like a giant balloon.

1796
01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:21.260
I think my dog got bit by a rattlesnake.

1797
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:24.590
You know what's really crazy ever gave her of antivenom when I think about it.

1798
01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:29.430
You know what's really crazy is the venom is actually digesting tissue.
Yeah.

1799
01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:32.750
That's what's fucked up like that.
What that venom is for.
Like,

1800
01:46:32.751 --> 01:46:36.500
if they bite a snake,
like a snake bites around a rabbit or some shit like that,

1801
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:41.860
it's actually digesting the rabbit so that cause they don't have like a stomach

1802
01:46:42.301 --> 01:46:45.980
click we have their,
their whole body is just like one,

1803
01:46:45.981 --> 01:46:50.981
just rot track things is rot of it and then they absorb it slowly.

1804
01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:55.260
Amputate a lot of science if you don't get to it.
Yeah.
Dirty monsters.

1805
01:46:55.710 --> 01:47:00.450
Do you ever see that video that I posted that I got from one of those guys that

1806
01:47:00.451 --> 01:47:02.740
I follow on Instagram,
but uh,

1807
01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:07.760
they were in the desert and his big fucking huge fat rattlesnake had a rabbit

1808
01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.070
and was dragging the rabbit away.

1809
01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:14.970
This is lifeless rabbit is being dragged away by this thing that's as thick as

1810
01:47:14.971 --> 01:47:18.900
my forearm.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
See if you can find it.

1811
01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:23.520
Good luck finding it.
Probably four years ago,
three years ago,

1812
01:47:23.521 --> 01:47:27.440
four years ago.
Is it?
Found it [inaudible] man,
how do you do that?

1813
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:32.970
Watch this.
So this thing,
look at this.
It's got the rabbit.
Wow.

1814
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:34.660
Yeah.
And they,

1815
01:47:34.661 --> 01:47:39.150
they close in on it and it just drags it away.
Wow.

1816
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:45.570
It's creepy.
And if this is a different video,
the one that I had,

1817
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.800
um,
it was a bigger snake in it pulls it away way quicker,

1818
01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:54.360
but it's just,
it's just a gross little animal.
But then again,

1819
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:58.440
you need those gross salon,
uh,
animals like that's the same lick.

1820
01:47:58.441 --> 01:48:01.740
The argument that people say you don't want coyotes in your neighborhood.
Well,

1821
01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:03.330
okay.
I kind of see what you're saying,

1822
01:48:03.331 --> 01:48:06.950
but the problem is you don't want rats in your neighborhood either.
Stupid.
Yeah.

1823
01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:11.250
And Coyote is going to kill the rats.
They do.
Right.
What does this one,
the mom,

1824
01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:16.020
rabbit comes in,
fucks up the snake.
Oh,
that's right.
Yeah,
that's right.

1825
01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:17.730
Really?
Yeah,

1826
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:21.743
<v 0>sure.</v>

1827
01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:25.410
<v 2>Yeah.
The mom rabbit recognizes some shit is going down.</v>

1828
01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:27.090
Fucks up that snake.

1829
01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:28.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1830
01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:32.830
<v 3>Get off my baby.
Look at that.
Yeah.
Rabbits are fucking fierce man.</v>

1831
01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:34.650
Man.
In Span,

1832
01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:39.690
lots of video where a kid stopped,
uh,

1833
01:48:40.110 --> 01:48:42.480
cat,
I think it was like a bobcat.
Small Bobcat,

1834
01:48:42.481 --> 01:48:45.840
like in a village was getting attacked by a sim snakes and it was protecting its

1835
01:48:45.841 --> 01:48:49.590
babies and the mom just left the babies to die or whatever.

1836
01:48:49.591 --> 01:48:51.210
Cause she knew that she couldn't fight it.

1837
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:55.410
The kid just grabbed the snake by the head and walked away and threw it like in

1838
01:48:55.411 --> 01:48:58.500
the Bush,
came back and grabbed the baby's and gave them back to the mom.

1839
01:48:59.130 --> 01:49:02.220
It was a crazy video,
like eight year old kid,

1840
01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:06.030
maybe younger crowd and it was wild.
Grabbed a snake,
grabbed the snake.

1841
01:49:06.031 --> 01:49:09.960
It was a eight,
seven,
six 58 foot snake,
six to eight foot,
probably crazy.

1842
01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:15.720
<v 2>Some kids grow up hard,
dude.
No idea what country I was a kid.</v>

1843
01:49:15.721 --> 01:49:19.530
I would grab snakes.
If I saw a snake,
I'm going for it.
I was obsessed.

1844
01:49:20.490 --> 01:49:21.630
I know I'd grab whatever,

1845
01:49:21.631 --> 01:49:24.740
but I didn't live in a place where there were poisoned snakes.
Well,
when I lie,

1846
01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:29.460
when it lives in Florida,
I was always worried about running into an alligator.

1847
01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:34.410
We'd run into alligators and a snapping turtles.
A lot of snapping turtles,

1848
01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:38.400
some snakes.
There are some snakes we'd run into do.
The problem with Florida is,

1849
01:49:38.401 --> 01:49:38.611
yeah,

1850
01:49:38.611 --> 01:49:42.120
once in a while there's a crime in American crocodile or they even say in the

1851
01:49:42.121 --> 01:49:44.970
everglades,
they got couple of miles out there.
Oh yeah,
they do.

1852
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.190
A couple of the old Nile crocs assholes who,
uh,

1853
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.940
<v 1>got them as in the 70s and then just let them loose and now they have a viable</v>

1854
01:49:51.941 --> 01:49:55.110
population as the sounding board doing the kid,

1855
01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:57.490
it almost seems fake because they have cameras everywhere.

1856
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.800
I think that's what he does it,
regardless of the fact that it's a pet python.

1857
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:06.040
I would've done that in a heartbeat as a kid.
So he's pulling on it.

1858
01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:09.700
Is that a python?
Oh,
they set this up,
right?
That's what I mean.

1859
01:50:09.701 --> 01:50:12.130
I as I was pulling it back up and seeing all the cuts and I was like,
okay,

1860
01:50:12.131 --> 01:50:16.060
that might not be real.
This is a set.
A set is not real.
This is set up.
Look,

1861
01:50:16.890 --> 01:50:20.140
that kid's been grabbing sneaks his whole life.
He grabbed that thing.

1862
01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:23.320
I'd expertly,
I'd make that thing a cock holster.
That's what I would do.

1863
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:25.840
A Cock coster cock rings.

1864
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:30.550
I just dumped a bunch of cock rings or a Congo Holster motherfuck into a belt.

1865
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:32.623
Yeah.

1866
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:37.690
It's like growing up like that around snakes and all kinds of evil fucking shit

1867
01:50:37.691 --> 01:50:42.160
like that.
Have you been to South Africa?
No.
Cape Town.
I'm scared.

1868
01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:44.790
Okay.
Task the most beautiful place I've ever been in my life.
That was,

1869
01:50:44.791 --> 01:50:48.100
I saw a wild,
that's a lie,
but thanks for playing.
It is.
No,

1870
01:50:48.101 --> 01:50:51.100
it might be the most beautiful place I've ever seen.
Just like,
wait,
it looks,

1871
01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:56.200
oh fuck.
It's incredible.
It's so beautiful.
Bring up Cape Town.
It's ridiculous.

1872
01:50:56.230 --> 01:51:01.150
Ridiculous.
It's ridiculous.
When I saw it,
I saw one.
For me,

1873
01:51:01.151 --> 01:51:05.450
it's ridiculous.
It's not that.
It's just,

1874
01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:08.770
it's so beat up.
Bad Looking.
No,
no,
no,
no.
You don't understand like Australia,

1875
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:13.840
we have no idea.
Don't ever bring,
I lost her later.
What about Maui?
It's better.

1876
01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:18.210
No,
that's not true.
I've been all over Cape Town.

1877
01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:22.110
It's got my number one.
Sure.
It's awesome.
In terms of breathtaking.
Really?
Yeah,

1878
01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:22.953
and food.

1879
01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:28.890
Any interest in going to Africa and going hunting?
What?

1880
01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:33.250
The Africa now four times.
It's a long flight.
What would would it be?

1881
01:51:33.251 --> 01:51:37.990
Hunting antelope,
shit like that.
Kudu.
I love Kudo Ivy League guy.

1882
01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:38.860
It's delicious,

1883
01:51:39.370 --> 01:51:43.390
but at the end of the day I feel you'd get the same in a way.

1884
01:51:43.391 --> 01:51:46.120
I feel like you'd get the same cause that,
can I tell you what that would be?

1885
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:50.820
You'd go to a game reserve,
which is probably a cattle,
uh,

1886
01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:53.860
an an abandoned cattle range.
Yes.

1887
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:57.370
And they stocked the area with those animals.

1888
01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:02.820
And so in a way I think you could get the same exact feeling in Texas.

1889
01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:06.610
Yeah.
In Texas,
right.
Texas.
And I'm not kidding.

1890
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:11.590
And in Texas you could go get Texmex.
Correct sir.
Some great food in Africa,

1891
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:17.230
there are a lot of those issues.
Right.
So,
so the,
the trip,

1892
01:52:17.231 --> 01:52:19.990
by the time you get there,
you're older,
it's just too fucking,

1893
01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.870
they're older 16 hour flight,
16 hours.

1894
01:52:22.871 --> 01:52:25.140
But then you've got to take a fucking bus and the whole field,

1895
01:52:25.150 --> 01:52:27.610
whole thing and something goes wrong every time.

1896
01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:30.730
What do you got to doing that photo?
I just flashed up at Cape Town,

1897
01:52:30.731 --> 01:52:32.550
just made me think of something I saw yesterday that,

1898
01:52:32.590 --> 01:52:37.590
I don't know if you saw it's a so they can create a picture like this.

1899
01:52:38.170 --> 01:52:40.690
Oh yeah,
I did see that.
If you draw like a little sketch,

1900
01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:45.410
they could turn that into like instantly turned that into a photo.
Realistic.
Hmm.

1901
01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:46.070
So I mean you

1902
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:50.210
<v 2>haven't seen that?
No,
this just came out yesterday.
Today's fucking bananas.</v>

1903
01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:54.620
So look at that sketch on the right.
So through the software rendering,

1904
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:58.820
they could do something like that on the left and then they make it on the
right,

1905
01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:03.450
but make it with a lake and a mountain.
Like watch this.
Bam.
Damn.
Yeah.

1906
01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:08.390
Yeah.
So this is within seconds they can create this.

1907
01:53:08.391 --> 01:53:09.850
And what does this software call Jamie?

1908
01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:13.100
I don't know that the software from an I saw has made by Nvidia,

1909
01:53:13.130 --> 01:53:17.130
which is a veg video card maker and all sorts of other things for [inaudible]

1910
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:22.410
never be able to replace comics.
No,

1911
01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:25.790
no,
I don't think they're going to be able to figure out personality.

1912
01:53:25.791 --> 01:53:28.370
But I think what they can,
they'll never figure out.
Joey Diaz

1913
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:35.360
take what they can do is make artificial reality.

1914
01:53:35.570 --> 01:53:37.370
They're going to be able to make artificial reality.

1915
01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:40.280
It's like how long will it take before that artificial reality?

1916
01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:45.880
I don't think you can quantify creativity.
I don't think,
I don't know.

1917
01:53:45.881 --> 01:53:46.850
I might be wrong though.

1918
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:51.060
<v 1>I agree that it might be able to figure it out because part of what creativity</v>

1919
01:53:51.061 --> 01:53:54.660
is is,
is surprise and almost destruction.

1920
01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:59.661
Like when you hear somebody say something you've never heard before or a

1921
01:54:00.031 --> 01:54:03.390
different take,
that kind of destroys the old way of thinking.

1922
01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:07.080
It's kind of what a lot of creativity and innovation is a form of destruction.

1923
01:54:07.290 --> 01:54:11.880
Yes.
And and so destroying ideas.
Yeah,
but like,

1924
01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:16.920
like,
like when when you see a great piece of art,

1925
01:54:17.130 --> 01:54:21.600
like,
like there's a match to it.
It's an awe.
You're awestruck.

1926
01:54:21.601 --> 01:54:25.460
Like the Vatican,
the inside of the Sistine Chapel,
perfect example.
I mean you're,

1927
01:54:25.461 --> 01:54:30.210
you're,
you're on that a human being did that for the sake of beauty in itself,

1928
01:54:30.211 --> 01:54:34.800
like almost lives of hundreds of years
and generations of artists,
right?

1929
01:54:34.801 --> 01:54:39.180
They'd work on the same tapestry or something like three d that is an act of

1930
01:54:39.181 --> 01:54:41.850
faith and you're doing it for its own sake.

1931
01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:45.090
You're not even doing it because you're making money.
It's like you,

1932
01:54:45.091 --> 01:54:50.091
you are doing it because you can and because you want to see what you're capable

1933
01:54:50.731 --> 01:54:55.580
of.
Like creating beauty for its own sake is,
but it's original.
It's,
it,
it,

1934
01:54:55.581 --> 01:55:00.300
it changes in many ways your perspective.
Like you kind of go,
ew,

1935
01:55:00.810 --> 01:55:01.870
ew,
the soul.

1936
01:55:01.871 --> 01:55:05.340
So Nietzsche and Schopenhauer talks about the idea that there's the will,
right?

1937
01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:09.540
So as a human being,
you're stuck in this fucking,
I got to eat,
I've got to fuck,

1938
01:55:09.541 --> 01:55:14.541
I got to sleep and I got to breed and I eat and I sleep and I fucked so I can

1939
01:55:14.701 --> 01:55:18.150
bring it,
you know,
and I can stay alive and then,
you know,
further my gene pool.

1940
01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:21.500
And you're stuck in this kind of like will to live.
There's don't,

1941
01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.080
but there is a risk bite.
And that respite is,
is when you,

1942
01:55:25.230 --> 01:55:28.920
when you see a great work of art or you're doing great works of art and somehow

1943
01:55:29.070 --> 01:55:31.950
when you see something beautiful,
when you're laughing,
really hard,

1944
01:55:31.951 --> 01:55:32.520
equate standard,

1945
01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:35.100
when you're seeing all them an amazing movie like American beauty,

1946
01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:39.390
the state it puts you in is so incredible because it gets you to forget

1947
01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:44.100
momentarily about your own biology,
about your own,
your own needs,

1948
01:55:44.101 --> 01:55:48.570
your own watts for what a reason you,
you rest in this state of majesty,

1949
01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:52.110
this sort of high relief,
this your higher self and you go,
you go man,

1950
01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:53.760
that might be what God's about.

1951
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:58.290
That might be what it's like to be touching something bigger than myself or

1952
01:55:58.291 --> 01:56:01.580
bigger than all of this other appetite stuff.
Like I,
it's almost like,
um,

1953
01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:03.520
it's almost like something you,

1954
01:56:03.521 --> 01:56:06.930
you forget that you forget about death and you forget about your fears and

1955
01:56:06.931 --> 01:56:07.561
everything else.
You know,

1956
01:56:07.561 --> 01:56:10.950
that those feelings of inspiration that can happen when you're listening to

1957
01:56:10.951 --> 01:56:14.520
great music or it can happen when you're making great music.

1958
01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:19.320
But that is almost the only time you have,
um,

1959
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:20.580
I guess,

1960
01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:22.830
and of course we can talk about flow and you're climbing a mountain with no

1961
01:56:22.831 --> 01:56:24.060
ropes or whatever it might be.

1962
01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:29.240
I think that puts you in those states of true focus and true flow and um,

1963
01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:33.480
that's what we stay alive for.
We stay alive for that.

1964
01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:37.950
And when you are not that,
you know,

1965
01:56:38.430 --> 01:56:41.190
everything else becomes drudgery.
It almost,
because everything becomes,

1966
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:43.920
and I would even,
I wouldn't even equate like,
oh,

1967
01:56:43.921 --> 01:56:47.250
we stay alive also not just for our accomplishments but like when you're with

1968
01:56:47.251 --> 01:56:48.510
your friends like we're doing,

1969
01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:52.440
if I companion and we're laughing and being silly geese for no other reason,

1970
01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:55.620
there is a flow to that.
Oh yeah,
there's a,
there's a,
you are,

1971
01:56:55.621 --> 01:57:00.420
you are removed for temporarily from the world,
from,
from,

1972
01:57:00.450 --> 01:57:03.170
from the reality of your own limitations.
And there,

1973
01:57:03.171 --> 01:57:05.340
there's something that's so beautiful about that.

1974
01:57:05.341 --> 01:57:07.320
I think Nietzsche talked about the idea that you can,

1975
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:10.590
you can actually make your life that your life should be a work of art,

1976
01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:13.740
live dangerously and leave a good looking corpse.
Don't,
don't,

1977
01:57:13.741 --> 01:57:17.670
don't worry about all the other things.
Just,
just it's worth living at the lead.

1978
01:57:17.671 --> 01:57:20.670
She was a mess.
They're all a mess.
That's part of the problem.

1979
01:57:20.671 --> 01:57:24.840
And listening to him,
every fucking philosopher,
I've done my own studies on that.

1980
01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:28.650
Every philosopher didn't get laid and they lived alone and some of us live with

1981
01:57:28.651 --> 01:57:31.540
their mothers and they were all a disaster but they thought deeply they have the

1982
01:57:31.541 --> 01:57:32.250
concepts,

1983
01:57:32.250 --> 01:57:35.430
they've concepts and oftentimes the not really putting these concepts of

1984
01:57:35.431 --> 01:57:38.280
practice in their own life,
which is very strange.
That's right.
Yeah.

1985
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:39.390
That's very true.
Yeah.

1986
01:57:39.391 --> 01:57:42.630
Those moments that we have when we're doing the fight companion where we're just

1987
01:57:42.631 --> 01:57:46.920
fucking howling and laughing.
Oh that's,
that's why.
And and those,

1988
01:57:46.921 --> 01:57:48.660
you can't recreate that.
You know,

1989
01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:51.710
one of the things that's interesting about fight companion is a bunch of people

1990
01:57:51.711 --> 01:57:52.920
who've tried to recreate it,

1991
01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:57.060
they've done their own and they always have been give up.

1992
01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:01.800
Cause cause we're really friends,
we're really friends and we really go hard.

1993
01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:04.900
That's what I said about getting fucked up.
I mean,
how,

1994
01:58:04.901 --> 01:58:09.901
how many shows are there where people are just getting drunk and saying

1995
01:58:10.890 --> 01:58:15.290
ridiculous Shit live in front of millions of people now.

1996
01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:19.910
And then we'll have a show where there's a,
you a,
you know,
UFC that may,

1997
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:24.950
may get 100,000 pay per view buys and we get 5 million views.

1998
01:58:27.410 --> 01:58:28.400
Is that how many is that?

1999
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:33.510
How many we get between the v the in between Youtube and iTunes.

2000
01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:36.540
And next time I take my shirt off,
I gotta be at,
I gotta be a little more Jack.

2001
01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.910
Well,
Lucy don't have psoriasis anymore.
That's true.

2002
01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:41.650
But Sha Sha likes people that try to come,
like,
they're like,
well,

2003
01:58:41.651 --> 01:58:43.540
you know the fighter and the kid,
I want to start my own podcast.
Well,

2004
01:58:43.541 --> 01:58:47.620
how do I go?
We're friends,
we're really friends.

2005
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:48.700
That's why it works.

2006
01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:53.050
You can't let just make it like the monkeys fucking organize a fake band.

2007
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:56.970
No fucking way.
We're just,
we're just friends.
No matter.
Right.

2008
01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:02.040
And Eddie is legitimately crazy and he's also legitimately a Jujitsu genius,

2009
01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:06.520
you know,
innovative fucking,
and he really does think the earth is flat like him.

2010
01:59:06.521 --> 01:59:11.200
And I have conversations with,
I'm like,
Eddy,
stop,
stop.
What'd you go flat?

2011
01:59:11.201 --> 01:59:15.580
You never go back.
I mean,
what does that mean?
What does that mean?
He's so great.

2012
01:59:15.730 --> 01:59:19.210
I don't understand that thinking,
but that's part of the reason why he's fun.

2013
01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:22.030
You know?
I was saying,
I was talking about him the other day.

2014
01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:26.110
I was there like he bugs me about,
I go,
he's a genuinely good person.
Oh,

2015
01:59:26.111 --> 01:59:29.140
he's awesome.
He said Jenny loved that.
I love,

2016
01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:31.930
he's been one of my best friends for 20 fucking years.
That's why,

2017
01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:34.660
cause he's such a good person.
Yeah,
he's a great guy.

2018
01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:37.390
He's a great person and he's like,

2019
01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:40.930
he's brilliant when it comes to Jujitsu.
I mean really brilliant.

2020
01:59:41.290 --> 01:59:46.290
But like his unique way of thinking is creativity is what allowed him to

2021
01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:49.720
formulate that system.

2022
01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:54.790
That system of Jujitsu was a lot of very unorthodox and,
and submissions.

2023
01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:59.560
It was very,
very,
very,
very clever with his Jujitsu.
Very clever.

2024
02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:03.640
So important.
But that,
you know,
you wonder sometimes his brain,

2025
02:00:03.641 --> 02:00:08.270
that kind of brain can have it cuts all the way across.
It can have liabilities.

2026
02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:11.230
Your strengths are the same as your liabilities?
Well,

2027
02:00:11.231 --> 02:00:14.080
he'll have that super obsessed with computer conspiracies,

2028
02:00:14.081 --> 02:00:18.850
like legitimately super obsessed,
but it wasn't always,
it's a form entity though.

2029
02:00:19.090 --> 02:00:22.810
It's also gives you a tribe and it gives you people,
all of us have that.
Yeah,

2030
02:00:22.811 --> 02:00:26.710
well he does that tin foil hat podcast to at Sam Tripoli and then they do

2031
02:00:26.711 --> 02:00:30.340
conspiracy,
standup comedy with a go to perform in clubs together.

2032
02:00:30.341 --> 02:00:34.960
But it's really selling well.
I mean,
they're doing it great.
Great for Sam too.

2033
02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:39.580
Yeah,
that's good to see.
Sam's a great guy.
He was like I was saying earlier,

2034
02:00:39.581 --> 02:00:44.530
world versus insanely fortunate in our circle of friends and insanely fortunate

2035
02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:48.160
and the camaraderie that we all have to all protect each other and look out for

2036
02:00:48.161 --> 02:00:52.020
each other and support each other.
And I noticed that too.
They come,

2037
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:54.130
I feel so lucky that I,
I,

2038
02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:57.870
I get to just stand up because the challenge never goes away.
And then I,
I,

2039
02:00:57.950 --> 02:01:02.290
I see a lot of actors like Sean Penn,
like Johnny Depp,
like the guys.

2040
02:01:02.291 --> 02:01:05.950
I really look up Mickey Rourke and something happens to them along the way.

2041
02:01:05.951 --> 02:01:07.330
Brad Pitt,
not so much,
you know,

2042
02:01:07.331 --> 02:01:09.580
but the real actors that I really kind of thought were,

2043
02:01:10.050 --> 02:01:13.270
there's something goes on like I think had had a real struggle,

2044
02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.780
then he married a crazy lady.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2045
02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:21.340
I don't know.
Married a chicken was ridiculously hot,
but crazy as fuck.

2046
02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:25.300
I think they might get,
I dunno,
acting doesn't,
when you,

2047
02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:28.210
when you've done a movie,
when you're on set,

2048
02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:31.750
you're shooting a page a day and that mundane,

2049
02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:35.560
repetitive process,
you're in costume.

2050
02:01:35.650 --> 02:01:37.900
You're saying the same fucking lines,

2051
02:01:37.901 --> 02:01:41.780
knowing the same scenes over and over again.
Right.
I'm sorry man.

2052
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:46.430
You're there 16 hour days and I don't think that's as satisfying.

2053
02:01:46.431 --> 02:01:47.690
No matter who you are,

2054
02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:52.370
it becomes a very peculiar skill that it's not like doing a play here.

2055
02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:55.880
It's different because standup is standup though you're writing and you have to

2056
02:01:55.881 --> 02:01:58.220
perform it.
And it's always changing it.
I agree.

2057
02:01:58.250 --> 02:02:03.250
But I also think that you and I were supposed to do stand up like a guy who made

2058
02:02:04.131 --> 02:02:08.570
clocks.
That's his passion.
The guy who fixes cars.
Like there's certain people,

2059
02:02:08.571 --> 02:02:12.330
like my friend Steve Strope who uh,
built my corvette and you know,

2060
02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:16.730
he builds a bunch of muscle cars and shit that fights this loves cars.

2061
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.300
He loves the construction of them in the design of them and he loves putting

2062
02:02:20.301 --> 02:02:21.021
them together.

2063
02:02:21.021 --> 02:02:24.010
And now Daniel Day Lewis and Christian Bale is supposed to be actors.

2064
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:26.660
There's people that are astonished,
do that,
they're really good at,

2065
02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:29.360
but then there's other folks that get into it and then become disillusioned

2066
02:02:29.361 --> 02:02:33.260
along the way because the process is so weird and also it's so fake.

2067
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:35.240
That's what always drove me crazy.

2068
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:38.060
Like being around all these people that are like not really,

2069
02:02:38.061 --> 02:02:41.540
they're talking to you that not really being vulnerable than not really being

2070
02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:43.850
present.
They're putting on the little acts,

2071
02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:46.100
but also the trap is having a persona.

2072
02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:50.120
I think like Johnny Depp got caught up in that persona,

2073
02:02:50.150 --> 02:02:53.810
became a pirate scarves in real life.
You can't be that vein.

2074
02:02:53.811 --> 02:02:56.720
You have to have friends like me and you.
If I showed up,

2075
02:02:57.220 --> 02:03:00.110
I showed up with a lace hanky hanging out in my,
my pocket.

2076
02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:03.830
It came all the way down to my knee.
You tackle me hotel.
It's like Jimmy Burke.

2077
02:03:03.831 --> 02:03:05.330
When I showed up after mad TV,

2078
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:08.930
I showed up in New York and I decided to start wearing Kangle hats backwards.

2079
02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:11.180
They look good on me and I was hot.

2080
02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:15.460
I decided I'm going to be a good look and talk cause I saw some active duty and

2081
02:03:15.461 --> 02:03:18.620
I and I go there.
[inaudible]
dude,
I'm so fucking proud of you.

2082
02:03:18.621 --> 02:03:21.610
I'm at the bar with all the guys.
I'm so proud of you bro.
It's gonna go out,

2083
02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:24.470

2084
02:03:24.471 --> 02:03:27.740

Okay.

2085
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:32.870
What about for Doris?
My hand,
he goes,
it's too busy.
It's busy.

2086
02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:37.070
But if a Dora that's a that's,
that's the best.
No.
What's the ultimate?

2087
02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:41.340
A Straw hat.
Oh,
I'm a member of the press.
Now.

2088
02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:44.600
A baret is if you were a fucking Baret,

2089
02:03:44.601 --> 02:03:47.320
I'm going to throw in a French braid and throwing you in a flying headlock.

2090
02:03:47.330 --> 02:03:50.680
Even if your Broccoli Asthma,
if you have a baret and a cigarette holder,
like,

2091
02:03:50.690 --> 02:03:53.930
like hunters Thompson,
I kinda like you if you're a dandy,

2092
02:03:54.350 --> 02:03:57.440
if you're a dandy and you have an ear trumpet and a cigarette holder.

2093
02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:02.360
Now I like you.
I have a hard time with dudes who wear vests.
Me Too.
I do want,

2094
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:06.710
I do want to dress like that.
Like,
uh,
like a a salsa dancer.

2095
02:04:06.711 --> 02:04:09.410
I want to be a Cuban gentlemen at the end of the day.

2096
02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:12.410
Like I do kind of want to be,
I want to wear linen suits.

2097
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:17.010
I want to be an older gentleman and I want to smoke fine cigars.
There is the,

2098
02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:20.960
or a pipe there is part of me and I want to pontificate and I want to hang out

2099
02:04:20.961 --> 02:04:24.240
with Stephen West and I want to talk about philosophy.
I like Watson.

2100
02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:28.460
Do you smoke cigars?
Never.
Ever,
ever.
So what's stopping you?
I don't know.

2101
02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:31.180
It's a store down the street.
I just thought I've still got some cigarettes.

2102
02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:36.170
This is a joint,
bro.
Oh Jesus.
A blunt.
Yeah,
I like that.

2103
02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:42.490
Yeah,
it's tobacco on the outside.
Oh really?
Oh,

2104
02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:47.220
this is the shit that crashed Tesla stock was down six.
That'll hurt my lungs,

2105
02:04:47.221 --> 02:04:50.760
man.
Is it mostly weed?
Oh yeah.
The inside's we'd

2106
02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:55.530
get a little,
little head rush from the tobacco.

2107
02:04:56.850 --> 02:05:00.360
They need get a little
little,

2108
02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:04.140
little life.

2109
02:05:04.380 --> 02:05:09.360
I'm such a lightweight life inside the brand because of the marijuana.

2110
02:05:10.070 --> 02:05:12.310
No,
we only had some wine.

2111
02:05:12.311 --> 02:05:16.560
It be perfect pink for breakouts and fine whiskey and have some fine whiskey.

2112
02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:19.770
We don't have any glasses and we'll be all right.

2113
02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:23.790
Or it could just drink another glass.
Like gentlemen,
I got to the bottom of mean.

2114
02:05:23.850 --> 02:05:27.120
Do we have any more of this?
Yeah,
we have cups.
You have to get out of here.
No.

2115
02:05:27.310 --> 02:05:28.650
All right.
I never have to.

2116
02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:38.480
Oh,
sorry.
I'm here.
Um,
we have,
let's,

2117
02:05:39.590 --> 02:05:43.750
did you have a special drop on?
Oh God,
I'm glad you mentioned that.
Uh,

2118
02:05:44.250 --> 02:05:48.570
complicated eight guys get my,
uh,
my number one selling,

2119
02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:53.610
uh,
one hour and I'll be at,
in Kansas City.
It can't stay in prompt this Friday,

2120
02:05:53.610 --> 02:05:57.090
Saturday,
and then I'll be in a walk.
Sit.
Philly's already sold out,

2121
02:05:57.330 --> 02:06:01.350
but then I'll be out Calgary on the fourth,
fifth and 6th of April.
This stuff,

2122
02:06:02.010 --> 02:06:05.640
single malt scotch and this stuff is made by a boy band.

2123
02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:09.990
I like good whiskey.
I don't like this bullshit.
Where does this come from?

2124
02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:12.060
I'm not trying to Bang Bang whiskey.

2125
02:06:12.061 --> 02:06:14.370
I believe it's the Florida Georgia line's whiskey.
Oh,
okay.

2126
02:06:14.371 --> 02:06:15.870
They're not a boy band.
They're a band band.

2127
02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:19.260
I thought it was like in sync or some shit at what point in time.

2128
02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:21.780
But there's a boy band ever get to a point where they're like,
okay,

2129
02:06:21.781 --> 02:06:25.740
we can't call ourselves a boy band anymore.
We're 40 I,
yeah,
we're still rolling.

2130
02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:29.320
It's a man.
It's a man band.
They're still back street caught a man bed.

2131
02:06:30.250 --> 02:06:31.740
There's euro glass empty there.

2132
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:35.670
No finish across fuckface hold on.

2133
02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:40.950
Oh,
you're gonna pour it in there.
I'll put the coffee in there.
Good move.

2134
02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:44.220
Good move.
I can put the whiskey in there.
I'll have them one gallons obviously.

2135
02:06:44.221 --> 02:06:47.760
Cause that was Scott.
I believe it's Scott.
Jesus days is much.

2136
02:06:47.761 --> 02:06:51.960
What you're doing take is hazy.
Dented whiskey.

2137
02:06:52.050 --> 02:06:56.750
Was it the Irish Scotch Scotch?
The Scots Highlands.

2138
02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:00.660
So the Irish stolen from the Scotts.
I don't know.
I don't know.

2139
02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:05.010
Is that you're a broke my broke.
You know who from Scotland,

2140
02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:10.020
who's was on his way?
I'll Holla who?
Um,
Billy Connolly famous.

2141
02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:15.040
Yeah,
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
How old is he?
He's,
uh,

2142
02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:17.820
I want to say he's in the 70s.
What happened?

2143
02:07:17.821 --> 02:07:22.470
Did he just got some terminal illness?
See if he could find it.
76.

2144
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:25.680
Great comedian,
great comedians.
Supposedly.
I'd never met him,

2145
02:07:25.681 --> 02:07:29.880
but supposedly a great guy too.
We're all going,
bro.

2146
02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:32.930
Yes.
That's the other thing I think about.
I want to make,
I want to,

2147
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:35.260
I don't want to be too attached to him.
Mortality.
I want make,

2148
02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:36.213
that's why number watch

2149
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:38.710
<v 2>I've been doing the areas you don't have to do doing is I do a,</v>

2150
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:42.850
Sam Harris is not dying.
Not Dead,
sir.
Billy Connolly's sins.

2151
02:07:42.910 --> 02:07:47.830
Reassuring musical message to fans.
Okay.
Okay.

2152
02:07:47.890 --> 02:07:52.690
So he's still,
he's still going.
He's got some sort of a cancer and Parkinson's.

2153
02:07:52.691 --> 02:07:57.160
It says double dose fucking machine breaks down because I've been doing,

2154
02:07:57.970 --> 02:08:01.420
I've been reading,
I mean I was doing Sam Harris's a waking up APP,

2155
02:08:01.590 --> 02:08:05.590
real guided meditation.
I've been doing it now for three months.
I actually,

2156
02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:06.940
I love it cause I read his book,

2157
02:08:06.941 --> 02:08:11.290
spirituality without religion and I really liked it.
I've always dabbled.

2158
02:08:11.291 --> 02:08:12.460
I've always thought about meditation,

2159
02:08:12.461 --> 02:08:16.540
but I without fail have done it now for over three months and it's only 10

2160
02:08:16.541 --> 02:08:20.270
minutes a day.
Sometimes I do a little longer,
you know.
But um,
it's,

2161
02:08:20.271 --> 02:08:24.280
it's kind of profound.
I never would have seen the value of it,
but it's a,

2162
02:08:24.290 --> 02:08:28.450
it took me a while to see.
He helps.
It's very,
he's,

2163
02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:32.890
he's a very good guide because he's been doing it for 30 years and he's a very

2164
02:08:32.891 --> 02:08:36.790
smart guy obviously.
He's done a lot of those quiet retreats.
Yeah.

2165
02:08:36.810 --> 02:08:40.390
So did go Yuval Harari,
the road Sapient's he goes,
I'm three month retreats.

2166
02:08:40.391 --> 02:08:44.620
I mean,
when I started seeing guys were that smart do that,
I kind of went,

2167
02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:46.300
this is very interesting,

2168
02:08:46.301 --> 02:08:49.450
especially from Sam who's always takes flak for being an atheist,

2169
02:08:49.451 --> 02:08:51.670
but he's pretty religious for an atheist.

2170
02:08:52.210 --> 02:08:55.910
I mean in terms of how he speaks about meditation consciousness,
uh,

2171
02:08:56.230 --> 02:08:57.730
mind versus brain.

2172
02:08:58.030 --> 02:09:02.560
You didn't use the term spiritual or appreciate that people say that.

2173
02:09:02.650 --> 02:09:07.480
I'm not religious,
but I'm spiritual.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
I guess he's,

2174
02:09:07.810 --> 02:09:12.810
he's very concerned with the health of his mind and he recognizes the power of

2175
02:09:13.151 --> 02:09:17.860
meditation.
You know,
I do a bunch of different things that,
um,

2176
02:09:18.130 --> 02:09:20.170
helped me keep my mind clear,

2177
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:23.920
like one of them is running or something about running that I never really

2178
02:09:23.921 --> 02:09:27.250
understood until I started doing it.
The form of meditation.
Well,
you're,
yeah,

2179
02:09:27.251 --> 02:09:27.581
you're,

2180
02:09:27.581 --> 02:09:32.581
you're in this sort of weird state of mind where you're just trudging and

2181
02:09:33.431 --> 02:09:36.610
breathing and that's all you really can concentrate on.

2182
02:09:36.611 --> 02:09:38.770
You don't have much room for other things.

2183
02:09:39.010 --> 02:09:41.450
Like when you're really struggling like a,

2184
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:44.560
when I'm running up a steep hill and I'm running with a dog,

2185
02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:47.890
he's so much faster than me.
He just fucking takes off.
He took,

2186
02:09:47.891 --> 02:09:51.280
I have the best dog man.
He turns around and checks to make sure I'm okay.

2187
02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:54.280
He's like,
you're all right.
I'm like,
I'm good dude.
I'm good.
I'm right behind you.

2188
02:09:54.490 --> 02:09:58.420
And then he takes off and runs again.
He's loves freedom and he's so,

2189
02:09:58.421 --> 02:10:01.840
he's such a good dog.
Like I never worry about them meeting people.

2190
02:10:01.841 --> 02:10:05.020
He would just be kissing them.
Like the only thing I worry about is like cats,

2191
02:10:05.021 --> 02:10:06.090
like mountain lions.
Shit.

2192
02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:10.870
I do worry about that because we do run in these really remote areas and um,

2193
02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:16.180
when,
when I do that,
when I'm trudging up those hills,
all I'm doing is breathing.

2194
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:20.560
<v 4>Shh,
Shh,
shh.
No</v>

2195
02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:24.080
<v 2>pushing my thighs and I'm fucking trying to get to the top of this hill.</v>

2196
02:10:24.081 --> 02:10:27.440
And it had some rough,
steep fucking long hill.

2197
02:10:27.710 --> 02:10:30.410
You don't think about Jack Shit other than that.

2198
02:10:30.411 --> 02:10:35.330
And then when you do come down,
your heart rate drops and you ready to go again.

2199
02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:40.300
You know,
like I'll,
I'll do like a long 200 yard hill.
Like,

2200
02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:44.270
I'll spread it as much as I can and I get to the top and I have to catch my

2201
02:10:44.271 --> 02:10:48.740
breath.
I don't want to kill myself.
But then when you catch your breath,

2202
02:10:49.130 --> 02:10:51.710
it's like during the time where your heart rate is dropping,

2203
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:56.840
you start looking at the actual real magnitude of your problems.
Like what are,

2204
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:58.870
what are they really like,
what,

2205
02:10:58.871 --> 02:11:03.871
what is mono are our biggest problems is the way we interact with each other.

2206
02:11:03.981 --> 02:11:06.680
Right?
If you had to think about all the problems that people have in the world,

2207
02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:10.760
obviously there's the big global ones,
global conflict and war,

2208
02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:15.710
financial conflict and weird shit that countries do to each other back and
forth.

2209
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:19.430
But it's human beings in conflict with other human beings.

2210
02:11:19.730 --> 02:11:21.960
And how much of that can be avoided,
right?

2211
02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:26.720
Like isn't it mostly avoidable like with people with one to one,

2212
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:30.560
two reasonable people?
You and I,
you and I is perfect example.

2213
02:11:30.561 --> 02:11:31.790
We've run into some people,

2214
02:11:32.210 --> 02:11:35.690
we've run into a person and waste and how wars are.

2215
02:11:35.691 --> 02:11:38.570
I think so sometimes of course it's good groups,
well not,

2216
02:11:38.571 --> 02:11:43.400
and it's also like sometimes it's about resources.

2217
02:11:43.401 --> 02:11:44.001
I mean if you,

2218
02:11:44.001 --> 02:11:49.001
if you only have access to one water way and your kids may not be able to drink

2219
02:11:49.491 --> 02:11:52.250
water,
you can get genocidal right quick.

2220
02:11:52.290 --> 02:11:55.880
Of course there are certain things where you kind of go,
well,

2221
02:11:55.881 --> 02:11:59.900
we have to fight for our survival,
but again,
people go to war.

2222
02:11:59.901 --> 02:12:04.220
The way you organize men,
young men is not,
well,
we hate them.

2223
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:08.780
That doesn't last as much.
What you do is you,
you go,
hey,
it's about love.

2224
02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:12.260
It's about defending our country,
our way of life and you,

2225
02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:15.710
you create symbols and propaganda and things for them to march behind.

2226
02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:19.160
That's always how you motivate large groups.

2227
02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:24.080
How you create an ideology in your,
you know,
you're fighting force.

2228
02:12:24.110 --> 02:12:28.700
You need that because they tend to fight for something.

2229
02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:29.121
You know?

2230
02:12:29.121 --> 02:12:32.120
I think at west point it says a nation to finds itself on what is going to fight

2231
02:12:32.121 --> 02:12:35.750
for.
Nobody wants one world government.
Right?

2232
02:12:35.751 --> 02:12:40.370
That's one of the things that everybody's scared of.
Like one world,
like what?

2233
02:12:40.371 --> 02:12:44.040
One group that runs all the countries on the whole planet.

2234
02:12:44.041 --> 02:12:47.390
Like that's too crazy,
right?

2235
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:52.700
That's terrifies all of us.
One group having all that fucking power.
Yeah.

2236
02:12:52.701 --> 02:12:56.570
Anytime,
anytime.
One group.
That's my fault.
Problem with a big federal government.

2237
02:12:56.710 --> 02:13:01.280
Right.
But like isn't,
I mean it seems that they're all ridiculous at this point,

2238
02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:05.930
but if there was laws,
laws that we all agreed on,

2239
02:13:06.110 --> 02:13:09.620
like you can't just like you say,
if you go to Singapore with weed,

2240
02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:12.590
you're going to jail for like the rest of your life.
You know,

2241
02:13:12.630 --> 02:13:16.850
like if you're a dealer there.
Yeah.
They'll,
they'll,

2242
02:13:16.890 --> 02:13:20.810
they'll fuck you up and it can't be traveling over there with cocaine or

2243
02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.460
anything crazy like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're in deep shit.

2244
02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:29.180
No jury just to judge Lee Kuan Yew talked about that.
He goes,
yeah,

2245
02:13:29.181 --> 02:13:33.120
we hang about seven people a year.
Sad,
terrible.
No,
you know,
just judges.

2246
02:13:33.121 --> 02:13:37.140
But how many people die from drugs,
from your drug issue in the United States?

2247
02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:40.470
How many people,
how many kids are orphaned?
I was like,
Oh shit.
Hey Man,

2248
02:13:40.471 --> 02:13:44.910
they have a perspective.
It's a hard ass perspective,

2249
02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:49.140
but we've got to realize that,
that that perspective exists still on this earth.

2250
02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:53.310
It's really interesting.
We think of all the different cultures.

2251
02:13:53.311 --> 02:13:58.311
Like I was thinking of like stoic cultures and cold northern cultures and they

2252
02:13:59.851 --> 02:14:00.780
have to get ready for the winter.

2253
02:14:01.170 --> 02:14:06.170
A man or you starve Germans and the Swedes and the Nordic folk.

2254
02:14:07.050 --> 02:14:07.230
Yeah.

2255
02:14:07.230 --> 02:14:12.230
Time becomes a real factor time with your harvest when all that stuff also no

2256
02:14:14.071 --> 02:14:18.420
bullshit.
Some fucking insane genes in these people.
Right.

2257
02:14:18.421 --> 02:14:20.580
Like that game of Thrones guy,

2258
02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:25.740
you know Brock Lesnar's folk are from that world.
Yeah.

2259
02:14:25.741 --> 02:14:27.580
Land of the giants.
Yeah.

2260
02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:32.400
This is the craziest hardiest stock serve the real,

2261
02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:34.020
the real vikings.
Yeah,

2262
02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:38.370
and the real survivors like they have to deal with some shit.

2263
02:14:38.371 --> 02:14:42.180
In the winter before there was any kind of cars.

2264
02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:46.530
I know those people were living up there riding animals when it was,

2265
02:14:46.710 --> 02:14:51.270
God knows how fucking cold war those animals and skins and shit,

2266
02:14:51.630 --> 02:14:55.650
they would open the door.
She is blowing and giant beards.

2267
02:14:55.710 --> 02:14:59.580
One fire in the center of this fucking house and everyone's gathered around the

2268
02:14:59.581 --> 02:15:03.570
fire.
It was all about staying warm man and having enough to eat,

2269
02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:06.930
and then you got to worry about some other dudes just like you coming into your

2270
02:15:06.931 --> 02:15:11.040
town,
fucking you up by you slept,
taking you as a slave.
Oh my God.

2271
02:15:11.070 --> 02:15:15.180
Chopping you up in front of your family.
People just chop people up.
That's right.

2272
02:15:15.181 --> 02:15:19.520
And that's the mostly what happened forever.
That's right.
Mostly what happened.

2273
02:15:19.521 --> 02:15:20.430
Yeah.
And by the way,

2274
02:15:20.431 --> 02:15:23.580
we're going to impregnate your wife and kill your cancer inside them.
Oh yeah.

2275
02:15:23.610 --> 02:15:28.050
Everybody got killed.
Everybody got raped.
And that was normal.
That was life.

2276
02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:33.000
And people made it through that to some form of security where they started

2277
02:15:33.001 --> 02:15:37.770
thinking about rules and laws and how to force them and keep things civil.

2278
02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:42.390
Well,
yeah,
I think it just,
I think the fascinating thing is slavery.

2279
02:15:42.450 --> 02:15:47.450
Slavery was the order of the day and the leading philosophers and moral thinkers

2280
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:52.770
of our time from Jesus to the Buddha,
to Muhammad,

2281
02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:56.040
to Socrates,
and Aristotle to all of them never,

2282
02:15:56.340 --> 02:16:00.750
ever really spoke much about slavery,
about owning other human beings,

2283
02:16:00.751 --> 02:16:05.130
about selling someone's children.
That just was never really brought up.

2284
02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:09.630
And I mean,
it just wasn't,
you just see it.
It's like it was just what was done.

2285
02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:13.320
And then,
you know,
really started the abolitionist movement that they were,
they,

2286
02:16:13.710 --> 02:16:18.510
I mean the beginnings of the abolition of slavery worldwide,

2287
02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:22.950
you know,
did it?
No,
the British and the 18 hundreds really,
and you know,

2288
02:16:22.951 --> 02:16:25.650
did it in specifically Evangelical Christians,

2289
02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:29.950
the abolition movement was started by what you'd call,
you know,
fanatic,
you know,

2290
02:16:29.951 --> 02:16:30.460
Christians.

2291
02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:32.290
<v 1>But they were,
they were,
they were,</v>

2292
02:16:32.291 --> 02:16:37.291
they risked everything and convinced the crown to enforce a ban on slavery in

2293
02:16:38.111 --> 02:16:41.980
the high seas.
So if you were a British naval ship,

2294
02:16:42.670 --> 02:16:43.720
even if the Ottoman,

2295
02:16:43.721 --> 02:16:46.960
if there was a Turkish ship of the Ottoman ship over there and they had slaves,

2296
02:16:47.050 --> 02:16:52.050
the British were spent years and great costs at basically hanging slave traders,

2297
02:16:54.370 --> 02:16:57.870
freeing slaves,
all that stuff on the high seas.
It,
you know,

2298
02:16:57.880 --> 02:16:59.470
so even though they're obviously,

2299
02:16:59.471 --> 02:17:03.100
there was a lot of racism that went on the Brits and their navy,

2300
02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:08.330
we're the ones that,
uh,
began the abolition of,
of worldwide slavery.

2301
02:17:08.331 --> 02:17:11.510
It didn't allow it on the high seas.
Now,
how amazing is that?

2302
02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:13.330
Didn't take place until what?

2303
02:17:13.690 --> 02:17:17.500
18 1965 sir eight now listen,

2304
02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:20.500
well that's when it was a Boston America.
It was that abolished.

2305
02:17:20.590 --> 02:17:25.390
The all countries,
Britain abolished slavery I believe were earlier than America.

2306
02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:30.430
So we were 1865 or 1816 and another thing to remember is the United States has

2307
02:17:30.431 --> 02:17:33.100
been a country with slavery longer than it's been a country without.

2308
02:17:33.670 --> 02:17:38.030
So that gives you an idea of a recent,
that is,
okay.
Stop and think about that.

2309
02:17:38.031 --> 02:17:43.030
Yeah.
That number.
1865 seems so recent now.

2310
02:17:43.090 --> 02:17:46.150
It used to,
when I was a kid,
it felt like it was forever ago.

2311
02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:49.180
I know when I was like five years old,
I thought about slavery.

2312
02:17:49.210 --> 02:17:52.510
I thought about it as being like eons and eons in the past.

2313
02:17:52.570 --> 02:17:56.920
Do you know what book?
I just read it and it's,
it's the,
it is without,

2314
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:57.970
besides the Bible,

2315
02:17:58.390 --> 02:18:02.800
a lot of arguably one of the most influential books ever written in the 19th

2316
02:18:02.801 --> 02:18:07.450
century.
What uncle?
Tom's cabin.
Whoa.
Yeah.

2317
02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:12.620
I realized I hadn't read it.
And,
um,
well,
I mean I think that the,

2318
02:18:12.630 --> 02:18:17.590
it's Harriet Beecher Stowe and,
and I think the legend is that Lincoln said,

2319
02:18:17.591 --> 02:18:20.440
so you're the little woman that wrote this book that started this great war

2320
02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:24.760
because she,
she put this,
she had never actually,
she was from the north,

2321
02:18:24.761 --> 02:18:29.290
but she interviewed fugitive slaves and people who,
you know,
he used to be.

2322
02:18:30.250 --> 02:18:32.530
And if you read that book,
man,
it was,

2323
02:18:32.531 --> 02:18:36.400
it puts such a face on what slavery,
the brutality.

2324
02:18:36.401 --> 02:18:39.850
But it was really about in this country or anywhere where you could take a

2325
02:18:39.851 --> 02:18:40.810
woman's child,

2326
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:45.670
eight year old and you get some money and it's the story where the slave trade,

2327
02:18:45.671 --> 02:18:47.800
it goes well.
Well by the kid,
he's,
he,

2328
02:18:47.801 --> 02:18:50.810
I could fetch a good price for him down south and we'll,

2329
02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:54.430
we'll take him when his mom ain't there.
I'm going to go have a go do the chores.

2330
02:18:54.431 --> 02:18:58.800
And when she comes back,
you know,
otherwise it's all kinds of hemming and hawing.

2331
02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:02.530
And they had slave brokers who would come in and go,
look,

2332
02:19:02.531 --> 02:19:07.360
you're plantation is in debt.
You got to start selling some of your slaves.

2333
02:19:07.361 --> 02:19:10.510
Now,
I'm not going to take those guys,
but that,
that woman she's got,

2334
02:19:10.930 --> 02:19:14.630
she's got those two healthy looking boys and the,

2335
02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:18.940
and you would sell them and she could do nothing about it.
That was the reality.

2336
02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:20.590
And,
and uncle Tom's cabin,

2337
02:19:20.830 --> 02:19:24.850
controversial book because of the way they describe my uncle Tom is a simple 10

2338
02:19:24.851 --> 02:19:28.100
and a negro.
But I'll tell you what it did,

2339
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:28.970
<v 2>is she,</v>

2340
02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:34.000
she made you realize in technicolor with a human face just exactly how horrible

2341
02:19:35.121 --> 02:19:39.550
it was and what happened to the women who would have to see their children's

2342
02:19:39.551 --> 02:19:43.780
sold in front of them and they couldn't do anything.
Blah,
blah,
blah.
But,
but uh,

2343
02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:47.690
that's on the blah,
blah,
blah.
It was,
it was,
it was for many people.

2344
02:19:47.691 --> 02:19:51.740
What galvanized the north to say,
we can't have,
this is crazy.

2345
02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:55.940
Cast slavery.
How crazy is it?
That wasn't 200 years ago.
I know.

2346
02:19:56.780 --> 02:20:00.910
I know.
That wasn't even 200 years ago.
I know,
man.
That's what,
you know,

2347
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:05.950
that joke that I have about the president being like we became a nation in 1776

2348
02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:11.720
people lived to be 100 that's three people going now that's real easy thrill.
We,

2349
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:15.230
we are,
since we are infants and something,

2350
02:20:16.170 --> 02:20:20.990
we're in the process of this thing where we're figuring out life what's fair,

2351
02:20:20.991 --> 02:20:24.340
what's right,
how to run shit,
and we're,

2352
02:20:24.490 --> 02:20:28.700
we're doing it based on this idea that someone had already got it dialed in.

2353
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:32.900
Whether it's through the constitution or whether it's through the democratic

2354
02:20:32.901 --> 02:20:35.180
system or whether an educational system,

2355
02:20:35.181 --> 02:20:36.850
all the different systems that we have that there,

2356
02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:39.260
they're perfect and they're in place and they're ready to rock and there've been

2357
02:20:39.530 --> 02:20:43.190
rock solid for generation after Gen.
Wait a minute.
How long have you been around?

2358
02:20:43.250 --> 02:20:47.300
I know in the,
wait a minute.
Hold on.
Set.
That's it.
Oh Wow.

2359
02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:51.310
So what did they do before that?
What they do?
We know if they do the book,

2360
02:20:51.770 --> 02:20:56.510
when did they have the ability to print?
Yeah.
Okay.
That was like what,

2361
02:20:56.511 --> 02:20:59.600
500 years ago.
What was the fucking,
when was the printing press?

2362
02:20:59.601 --> 02:21:01.760
May in the 14 hundreds if I couldn't Berg.

2363
02:21:02.030 --> 02:21:05.940
But then I didn't really take hold until the 16th sense.

2364
02:21:05.941 --> 02:21:08.720
So imagine having everything you've read,

2365
02:21:08.810 --> 02:21:11.390
someone has to write with their fucking hand.

2366
02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:16.280
You have no idea if it's correct.
You have no idea if they're telling the truth.

2367
02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:20.570
It is writing it.
Yeah.
It's not for years and years and years.

2368
02:21:20.670 --> 02:21:24.140
And that's probably the main reason why they probably had to establish higher

2369
02:21:24.141 --> 02:21:28.310
schools of learning.
Well the scribes writing this,
hold on.
What are you doing?

2370
02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:31.880
Yeah.
The stuff that you're writing,
how do I know it's true?
What's your method?

2371
02:21:31.970 --> 02:21:35.830
Yeah,
right.
When they would write down and there are very people that could,

2372
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:38.780
it was usually the priests and there's a book called how the Irish saved

2373
02:21:38.781 --> 02:21:42.320
civilization.
And it's about how the scribes,
how the the,
the,

2374
02:21:42.321 --> 02:21:46.070
the Irish priests wrote down all the knowledge.

2375
02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:49.160
They wrote it down in books and they carried it with them.

2376
02:21:49.161 --> 02:21:53.810
So it's like this whole story of how the libraries had to be painstakingly

2377
02:21:53.811 --> 02:21:54.644
imitated.

2378
02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:59.720
And then the printing press in the 1400 1445 or whatever,

2379
02:21:59.721 --> 02:22:02.070
and Gutenberg,
uh,
invent,

2380
02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:05.600
he was a watchmaker and invented this thing called the printing press and nobody

2381
02:22:05.601 --> 02:22:10.040
really used it.
But then you could,
like,
you could,
people could disseminate ideas.

2382
02:22:10.250 --> 02:22:11.150
It was like the Internet,

2383
02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:15.560
you have an idea and all of a sudden instead of having one book for,
you know,

2384
02:22:15.770 --> 02:22:16.603
50 miles,

2385
02:22:16.730 --> 02:22:21.730
you could print out paper and make multiple copies and send them out dining

2386
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:24.800
room.
And then all of a sudden a guy named Martin Luther goes,

2387
02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:28.140
if I have the Bible,
what do I need these corrupt priests for?

2388
02:22:28.141 --> 02:22:31.200
What do I need to beat pledge allegiance to still see them.
Never Mentor.

2389
02:22:31.230 --> 02:22:34.620
Used to make those posters put them up.
Yeah,

2390
02:22:34.621 --> 02:22:39.210
the proclamations and in Bitburg Germany,
by the way,
this,

2391
02:22:39.211 --> 02:22:42.750
this guy was,
yeah,
but she ever listened to the Dan Carlin series on that.

2392
02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:45.330
I didn't.
Oh my God,
it's amazing.
Dan Carlin's.

2393
02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:49.560
He explained Lutherism explained the whole movement and how he got away with it

2394
02:22:49.561 --> 02:22:53.430
because he had a high public standing so they didn't prosecute him or sue them

2395
02:22:53.431 --> 02:22:58.431
or they figured out a way to translate the Bible where other people could read

2396
02:22:58.471 --> 02:23:00.360
it.
They couldn't speak Latin.
That's right.

2397
02:23:00.390 --> 02:23:03.990
They figured out a phonetic translation for it so that so that now you have,

2398
02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:06.360
so if you have the word of God,
what do I need?

2399
02:23:06.361 --> 02:23:10.110
The Protestant Catholic divide was about essentially,
wait a minute,

2400
02:23:10.410 --> 02:23:13.860
I don't need to place these to this giant institution called the Vatican with

2401
02:23:13.861 --> 02:23:17.880
all the money and the costumes.
What if I just have the Bible and I do it?

2402
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:20.070
Jesus said,
because I can read it right here.

2403
02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:21.900
All of a sudden now you're a protestant.

2404
02:23:22.650 --> 02:23:25.170
That was what everybody was scared about.
I mean,

2405
02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:30.990
must have been the most horrific thing about the religious power back then.

2406
02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:35.400
Like Rome had armies,
right?
Yeah,
they,
this was,

2407
02:23:35.401 --> 02:23:40.401
this was like when Gingiss Khan was roaming the earth and running through Russia

2408
02:23:40.831 --> 02:23:44.640
and Asia and Eurasia.
They,
the Rome was like,

2409
02:23:44.641 --> 02:23:47.130
they were thinking about going to battle with these people.

2410
02:23:47.250 --> 02:23:51.120
The Mongols like the Rome had armies.
Yeah.
The pope had wives.

2411
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:56.750
This was like really in a lot of ways was almost in an ancient way.

2412
02:23:58.501 --> 02:24:03.300
Like a similar position to that the United States has now in terms of the whole

2413
02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:08.250
world.
Right.
I'm so high now.
Yeah,
of course you are.
I'm sorry,

2414
02:24:08.251 --> 02:24:10.830
but what was,
what was that you gave me because I only took one hit.

2415
02:24:11.150 --> 02:24:15.420
It's marijuana.
It's a blunt.
Why am I in a tunnel?
It's good.
Good for you.

2416
02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:18.540
There's tobacco on the outside of it.
In marijuana.
In the insult your head.

2417
02:24:18.541 --> 02:24:21.150
Why is your heads so beautifully shiny?
There's a beauty to use.

2418
02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:25.830
I'm going to be honest with you.
I use a sinner.
You do moist dinner.

2419
02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:27.840
Well it looks cause I got you.

2420
02:24:28.110 --> 02:24:30.480
I got you a little nervous because you have a nice Patina.

2421
02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:34.950
It looks like a bespoke shoe.
Oh look,
a nice show.
See how I bring it back.

2422
02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:38.740
Bring it back.
Complicated Age,
Scott.
It's out now.

2423
02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:44.940
You can buy it everywhere.
Everywhere.
Amazon shit everywhere.

2424
02:24:44.941 --> 02:24:46.440
Wherever you get your content,

2425
02:24:46.441 --> 02:24:50.460
you get your joke jokes are you get your funding.

2426
02:24:50.490 --> 02:24:55.460
There is 100 million comedy specials out right now.
God,
what?
No.

2427
02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:58.830
Yeah.
I don't know what the number is,
but I'm going to say it's 100 million.

2428
02:24:58.870 --> 02:25:02.640
Still a rare,
it's going to count them all.
Yeah.
It's still a rare fraternity.

2429
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:03.800
Yeah,
it's rev attorney,

2430
02:25:03.810 --> 02:25:07.260
but it's interesting how many of us there are today as opposed to the days of

2431
02:25:07.261 --> 02:25:11.810
Yore.
You know,
my question is how much material they bill real love.

2432
02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:13.590
You know what I'm saying?
Some of them do you know,

2433
02:25:13.630 --> 02:25:17.400
is God damn hilarious right now is Sebastian.

2434
02:25:17.401 --> 02:25:19.170
Not that it's not always hilarious,

2435
02:25:19.650 --> 02:25:23.070
but he's got some new material that he was dealing at the Improv last night.

2436
02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:26.890
Oh my God,
dude,
he's so funny.
So funny.

2437
02:25:26.980 --> 02:25:30.340
He's hilarious.
He's just got his own groove.

2438
02:25:30.370 --> 02:25:35.290
Like we're talking about Theo von earlier,
like he and Theo,
in my mind,

2439
02:25:35.291 --> 02:25:38.890
they're,
they,
they,
they,
they're very similar in that they're their styles,

2440
02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:42.910
way different.
Their materials way different,
but they have their own thing.

2441
02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:47.080
They have 100% their own things to bash and has his own thing.

2442
02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:52.360
It's like a music
and you love him.

2443
02:25:52.361 --> 02:25:55.570
So you count on him reacting to these things in a certain way.

2444
02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:59.320
It's as unique as like,
you know,
Christopher Walken,
it was all his,
you know,

2445
02:26:00.130 --> 02:26:04.210
he's in his zone right now.
You know Sebastian is in his zone,

2446
02:26:04.211 --> 02:26:09.090
sold out for seat four shows at Madison Square Garden.
Damn,

2447
02:26:09.130 --> 02:26:13.930
that's four sold out seats.
This is amazing for four.

2448
02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:18.730
That's like 18,000 seats a show.
That's nuts.
Nuts.
Yeah.

2449
02:26:19.210 --> 02:26:23.020
It's gotta be some money.
He's a beast is,
I'm sure there's money in it,

2450
02:26:23.021 --> 02:26:27.900
but the point is like he's in that sweet spot of his career.
Yeah.
You know,

2451
02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:33.250
that's in a way why I still have faith in the American system because he was a

2452
02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:37.000
waiter for nine years.
Yeah.
He was just a smart,

2453
02:26:37.250 --> 02:26:41.120
easy going dude who's easy to love Italian.

2454
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:46.270
Yeah.
It's got a lot of that are so fun to watch on state.

2455
02:26:46.271 --> 02:26:48.490
I don't want to say what he's talking about and I don't want to ruin any of it

2456
02:26:48.491 --> 02:26:52.310
cause you know his stuff hasn't even,
it's on paper.

2457
02:26:52.311 --> 02:26:56.560
I would never do it justice.
You have to see him in front of you.

2458
02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:00.280
He's funny man.
The same thing I say about Theo.

2459
02:27:00.490 --> 02:27:05.230
Theo is in this rare place right now.
You know,
like he's on stage and he's like,

2460
02:27:05.231 --> 02:27:09.100
you just start smiling when you see him.
He's his hypnosis game is on point.

2461
02:27:09.370 --> 02:27:12.920
Oh it was phenomenal.
I told him today on the podcast he did veteran kid.

2462
02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:14.880
I was like,
you're an original man.

2463
02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:19.230
He's not beating yourself up for himself up every comic.

2464
02:27:19.250 --> 02:27:21.370
Does Brian know every comic does.

2465
02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:25.720
I just stopped doing it at 50 to be with this Sam Harris App.
Nah,

2466
02:27:25.721 --> 02:27:27.430
I just decided I got tired of 'em.

2467
02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:31.450
I've realized I've been doing my best and I got myself here.
Yeah,
I mean,

2468
02:27:31.451 --> 02:27:36.070
you know,
well come on,
there's like a two thing going on,
right?

2469
02:27:36.071 --> 02:27:37.960
There's two things simultaneously going on.

2470
02:27:38.830 --> 02:27:43.830
There's one that you know you want to do your best and so you look at everything

2471
02:27:44.681 --> 02:27:47.890
you do and you go,
I think I could've done that better.
God Damn it.

2472
02:27:47.891 --> 02:27:51.790
Why did I do it like this?
Like fuck,
what is that about?
Like what's this about?

2473
02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:55.390
Why did I do it like that?
Why not ha rework that,
redo this.

2474
02:27:56.620 --> 02:28:00.220
But then there's the other part that has to be like,
look,
why are you doing this?

2475
02:28:00.670 --> 02:28:03.970
Like you're doing this because you enjoy it.
Do you enjoy it?
Okay,

2476
02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:08.440
you're going to feel gross about anything that doesn't work out well.

2477
02:28:08.530 --> 02:28:10.120
Everything that you do that doesn't work out well,

2478
02:28:11.050 --> 02:28:13.150
just don't be a bitch about it.
Just get over it.

2479
02:28:13.151 --> 02:28:18.151
There's a certain self indulgence involved in dwelling on your mistakes that it

2480
02:28:18.551 --> 02:28:22.160
becomes almost like a self pity thing.
You got to there.
There's

2481
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.510
<v 1>a strength in a discipline in learning how to go.
Okay,
are fucked up.
Did you,</v>

2482
02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:30.500
did you ever read Martha Graham's letter,
the great,

2483
02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:34.610
the mother of modern dance?
She wrote a letter to Agnes.

2484
02:28:34.611 --> 02:28:36.860
What do you think when you asked me that question?

2485
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:42.500
Timely and mother of modern dance.
It's timely though,

2486
02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:48.350
I'm sure like a,
but it's still funny.
I know because I'm,

2487
02:28:48.351 --> 02:28:51.500
I'm asking you about fucking,
how do you know about this?

2488
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:55.850
What is this woman's name again?
I'll show you.

2489
02:28:56.480 --> 02:28:59.540
Her name is Martha Graham.
She's the great,
I'm going to just,

2490
02:28:59.541 --> 02:29:01.640
it's like a really short letter,
but she wrote this,

2491
02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:06.810
she was a great choreographer.
She created modern dance.
She was basically like,

2492
02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:10.330
it's not just,
uh,
there's not just ballet.
Let's,

2493
02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:13.760
how about just moving naturally and doing crazy shit.
Bring up Martha Graham.

2494
02:29:13.761 --> 02:29:17.900
She's,
you had 80.
She was dancing,
but she was that.
She's a giant.

2495
02:29:18.050 --> 02:29:21.680
She's an innovator.
She's a giant.
They'd be,
when you think of dance,

2496
02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:25.820
she'd might be the most famous,
one of the most famous names ever in dance.
Okay.

2497
02:29:26.060 --> 02:29:30.080
Whatever.
But she wrote this letter and I think you'll appreciate this.

2498
02:29:30.081 --> 02:29:33.080
It's really short.
There's a vitality,
a life force,

2499
02:29:33.081 --> 02:29:35.810
a quickening that is translated through you into action.

2500
02:29:35.811 --> 02:29:40.340
And because there is only one of you in all time,
this expression is unique.

2501
02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:44.600
If you block it,
it will never exist through any other medium.
And be lost.

2502
02:29:44.810 --> 02:29:49.490
The world will not have it and it has B and it is not your business to determine

2503
02:29:49.491 --> 02:29:53.780
how good it is now,
how valuable it is now,
how it compares to other expressions.

2504
02:29:53.930 --> 02:29:57.500
It's your business to keep it yours clearly and directly and keep the channel

2505
02:29:57.501 --> 02:30:00.320
open.
You don't even have to believe in yourself and your work.

2506
02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:04.520
You have to keep open and aware of directly of the urges that motivate you.

2507
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:09.710
Keep the channel open.
No artist is pleased.
There was no satisfaction,

2508
02:30:09.711 --> 02:30:14.630
whatever.
At any time there was only a queer divine dissatisfaction,

2509
02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:19.850
a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others.

2510
02:30:19.930 --> 02:30:22.370
To him.
That's beast shit.
How about that?

2511
02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:26.120
That's on the money ain't then as the old woman,
that's her.
That's her.

2512
02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:29.540
She was doing this.
Nobody understood.
What will you send me that?
Yes,

2513
02:30:29.650 --> 02:30:31.340
cause I'm so high,
I'm not going to remember it.

2514
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:36.740
So mom came here are really into what she's doing here,
but appreciate her words.

2515
02:30:38.090 --> 02:30:40.580
It's like I feel like you shouldn't have showed me this video.
Now,

2516
02:30:40.581 --> 02:30:42.400
this wasn't a time when they were only doing it,

2517
02:30:42.410 --> 02:30:44.840
like she was doing the craziest shit.
This is how a dance,

2518
02:30:44.841 --> 02:30:45.920
if I really hurt my back,

2519
02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:51.680
isn't like 1943 if I'm not mistaken,

2520
02:30:51.681 --> 02:30:56.660
when through the video people were probably as a 1943 people were probably

2521
02:30:56.661 --> 02:31:01.661
struggling then for freedom from the orthodoxy struggling to express themselves

2522
02:31:02.871 --> 02:31:04.220
in different ways.
You know,

2523
02:31:04.221 --> 02:31:07.340
that's one of the more interesting things about standup is that it's indicative

2524
02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:08.270
or it's um,

2525
02:31:09.280 --> 02:31:13.010
it's a representative of the time in which it's performed in,

2526
02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:17.210
like they were a little windows in time to how people behaved and thought,

2527
02:31:17.211 --> 02:31:20.100
and there was some shit that people did

2528
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:24.900
<v 2>just a 10,
15,
20 years ago that you just can't do now.
Right.</v>

2529
02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:28.020
It's like,
it's not,
it's not an,
it's not possible.
It's not,

2530
02:31:28.021 --> 02:31:32.310
it's not in the public's a menu list anymore.
Right.
You know,

2531
02:31:32.730 --> 02:31:36.040
but back then it was normal.
It's like you,

2532
02:31:36.090 --> 02:31:40.380
you can and some stuff just isn't funny anymore.
It's weird.

2533
02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:44.430
Like some of the Lenny Bruce stuff,
man,
he was for the time,

2534
02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:46.770
he was groundbreaking.
Right.
He just like,

2535
02:31:46.771 --> 02:31:48.600
nobody had seen anything like this before.

2536
02:31:48.601 --> 02:31:53.190
A guy who was talking straight and true about real social issues and making them

2537
02:31:53.191 --> 02:31:56.010
funny on stage and he says,
you know,

2538
02:31:57.250 --> 02:32:02.010
handsome looking Jewish fellow with beautiful hair.
And he just had a look.

2539
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:06.660
Just disturbing.
It's comedy.
Shook people up.
Yeah.
But it was,

2540
02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:11.750
there was no way that you and I can put ourselves back into the minds of people

2541
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:18.240
that lived in the 1950s when Lenny Bruce was doing this.

2542
02:32:18.540 --> 02:32:20.840
There's no way we could put ourselves there.
Right.
We,

2543
02:32:20.850 --> 02:32:25.850
we are tainted forever by technology and innovation and the way that it's the

2544
02:32:26.731 --> 02:32:29.470
way that interaction I think is the big one right there.

2545
02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:32.160
As soon as people started being able to exchange information with each other,

2546
02:32:32.161 --> 02:32:36.250
I know,
you know,
whether it's through television and then through,
you know,

2547
02:32:36.260 --> 02:32:40.890
radio and television and television shows and then Internet and the more they

2548
02:32:40.891 --> 02:32:41.850
express themselves,

2549
02:32:41.851 --> 02:32:46.140
the more they've sort of figured out patterns of behavior that are acceptable.

2550
02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:50.780
Yeah.
But I wonder at times whether or not,
I think standup has,

2551
02:32:50.781 --> 02:32:53.460
is having a renaissance but like music and things.

2552
02:32:53.461 --> 02:32:55.950
I don't think we're living in a time of genius.
Are We?

2553
02:32:55.951 --> 02:32:59.550
Or do I not know enough about some great shit that's being made?

2554
02:32:59.580 --> 02:33:01.510
There's just so much that's being made,
right.

2555
02:33:01.560 --> 02:33:03.690
Black keys are always putting out great shit.

2556
02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:07.980
Gary Clark Jr has an amazing new album.
It's amazing.
I love him.

2557
02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:12.630
It's so good.
He's uh,
he's got such a signature guitar sound man.

2558
02:33:12.670 --> 02:33:17.310
His fucking guitar sound is like,
I love that style of,

2559
02:33:17.610 --> 02:33:20.550
you know,
he's got,
he did a,
um,
uh,

2560
02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:26.060
him and honey honey did a show together one night in downtown La Tam and a

2561
02:33:26.581 --> 02:33:30.180
recorded some event and put it up on my Instagram and they were doing,

2562
02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:33.840
I saw my brothers midnight rider.
Yeah.
See if he could find that.

2563
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:39.330
It was a phenomenal,
crazy man.
She was reading the lyrics off her phone.
I,

2564
02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:40.710
she didn't even know the lyrics to the song.

2565
02:33:40.890 --> 02:33:45.140
She had to go and get it and she was singing in real time while she's ringing.

2566
02:33:45.141 --> 02:33:47.580
Yeah,
I saw that.
I know why she's reading rather.

2567
02:33:47.581 --> 02:33:50.670
And so he's doing midnight rider,

2568
02:33:50.671 --> 02:33:55.671
but he's doing it Gary Clark Jr style and it's fucking amazing.

2569
02:33:56.461 --> 02:33:57.810
One of the cools things about here it is.
Yeah.

2570
02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:05.180
<v 5>You see that's like,
that's his style.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

2571
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:13.490
Jerry Clark.
Oh look at that.

2572
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:25.543
Woo.

2573
02:34:26.820 --> 02:34:31.320
<v 2>He's a killer.
He ever see Stevie Ray Vaughn to new trial.
There's a video.</v>

2574
02:34:31.321 --> 02:34:34.760
Never saw him live,
but I almost got to drive them live.

2575
02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:37.280
I drove Jeff back when I was,
uh,

2576
02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:40.970
when I was a limo driver almost got to drive Stevie Ray Vaughan.

2577
02:34:40.980 --> 02:34:43.110
I was thinking I was that he gets to drive Steve.
Very wow.

2578
02:34:43.290 --> 02:34:44.550
But he won't take limos.

2579
02:34:44.850 --> 02:34:49.350
He would only take cabs to wanted to talk to the cab driver.
Yup.
Man.

2580
02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:54.370
The way he treats people.
Well he does with a guitar.
It's just,

2581
02:34:54.420 --> 02:34:59.420
he was performing with Jeff Beck and all of his people were in the limos man and

2582
02:34:59.431 --> 02:35:03.360
he went into fucking cab to him.
Dan,

2583
02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:08.220
he was legit as fuck special man.
It was crazy to me.

2584
02:35:08.221 --> 02:35:11.220
Was that Gary Clark Jr he,

2585
02:35:11.221 --> 02:35:16.221
Gary Clark Jr that song while still having it be clearly that song.

2586
02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:21.420
So cool.
But it was like damn ain't know.
It was so cool,
man.
Due to be there live.

2587
02:35:21.450 --> 02:35:25.560
And it was like 12 o'clock at night on Tuesday in downtown La.

2588
02:35:25.770 --> 02:35:29.190
There was only maybe a hundred people in the room and Suzanne,

2589
02:35:29.250 --> 02:35:32.440
Suzanne Santo from honey.
Honey.
She's so talented,
man.

2590
02:35:32.441 --> 02:35:36.270
She looks at the fact that she could read that your voice is insane.

2591
02:35:36.570 --> 02:35:40.980
She's reading that off of her phone and singing it so crazy.
Yeah,

2592
02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:43.980
but Stevie Ray Vaughan,
we can't put any of this music up.
Hope.

2593
02:35:43.981 --> 02:35:46.560
Don't Yank us off the phone.
If I,
if I gave you a,

2594
02:35:46.770 --> 02:35:49.290
if I told you that you would have,
if you would,

2595
02:35:49.350 --> 02:35:54.350
could trade a deep knowledge and practice of music over your knowledge of

2596
02:35:54.661 --> 02:35:58.620
martial arts,
would you take it right now?
Fuck no,
no,
no.
It really,

2597
02:35:58.980 --> 02:36:01.950
why would I do that?
You would rather be a better,

2598
02:36:01.980 --> 02:36:06.420
a great fighter than an amazing guitar.
Yes.
Yeah.
I don't know how I feel.

2599
02:36:06.430 --> 02:36:10.110
I love the arts.
I don't have to make it.
No,

2600
02:36:10.111 --> 02:36:13.650
but I can't play at all.
And I'll listen to Gary all day.

2601
02:36:13.651 --> 02:36:16.270
I'll listen to this podcast.

2602
02:36:16.271 --> 02:36:20.310
You're going to Joe Rogan experience because of my obsession with Jimi Hendrix.

2603
02:36:20.430 --> 02:36:24.060
Right?
This is why I did.
I mean,
it's why I need,
I stole it from Jimmy Hendrix.

2604
02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:28.470
Right.
I love music,
but I don't have any talent.
No,
I got none.

2605
02:36:28.471 --> 02:36:32.280
I'm not no desire,
nothing.
You don't have to fucking make movies,
man.

2606
02:36:32.460 --> 02:36:36.180
You don't have to be a painter.
You know?
Tailored boss made this.

2607
02:36:36.181 --> 02:36:39.500
Mitzi look at that watch over us in the studio.
I don't want to,
I don't.

2608
02:36:39.630 --> 02:36:42.460
I don't have to paint.
No.
Do you get to paint?
I agree.
Do you do,

2609
02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:47.340
who do you find hope?
I'm not giving up martial arts for nub.
Nothing.

2610
02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:51.930
No.
No Way.
No.
It helps me so much.
It's so,

2611
02:36:51.931 --> 02:36:54.020
it's so important for me to do too.

2612
02:36:54.030 --> 02:36:59.030
Just to have the ability to get out a hundred percent of aggression and be able

2613
02:36:59.641 --> 02:37:04.500
to hit a bag and just get into a flow,
smoke a joint,
and then hit a bag.

2614
02:37:04.501 --> 02:37:07.800
You never do that.
I don't.
I'm so high right now.

2615
02:37:07.801 --> 02:37:09.360
Last thing I'd want to do is punch somebody.

2616
02:37:09.810 --> 02:37:13.410
You might be interested in day two of the 50th anniversary of Woodstock.

2617
02:37:13.470 --> 02:37:16.650
Did you hear that they're doing it of all?
No.
What are they doing?
Well,

2618
02:37:16.651 --> 02:37:21.320
the lineup just got announced in day two has got Gary Clark Surgical and the

2619
02:37:21.321 --> 02:37:23.540
black keys.
Holy Shit.
And,

2620
02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:29.020
and David Crosby and chance the rapper and the grateful dead John Mayer.

2621
02:37:29.391 --> 02:37:34.070
Who knows?
Wow.
Hmm.
That's a fucking line up,
right?

2622
02:37:34.071 --> 02:37:37.400
Their sons Sturgill Simpson and the black keys.

2623
02:37:37.700 --> 02:37:41.750
That's two of my top 10.
It's so much music.

2624
02:37:41.751 --> 02:37:45.800
What's amazing about music man,
is that they're,
they're still making it.

2625
02:37:46.210 --> 02:37:49.220
It's like everyone's still making music.
So it's not like there's,

2626
02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:52.780
the database just gets bigger.
It's not like stuff goes away.
Right.

2627
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:57.620
You bring back old Donna summer shit.
You know,
like dude,
I have,

2628
02:37:57.621 --> 02:38:01.850
um,
what does that,
uh,
sitting yet,

2629
02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:04.250
Mahalo down,
pay bad,

2630
02:38:06.370 --> 02:38:11.050
bad man songs that I think it's nowhere to run.
I don't think you're right.

2631
02:38:12.310 --> 02:38:16.220
Um,
I got some playlists here thinking this,
but okay.

2632
02:38:16.250 --> 02:38:19.060
Allman brothers or James Brown,
like you'd go,

2633
02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:21.170
you'd go back in time when you listened to that,

2634
02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:22.790
you listened to James Brown song.

2635
02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:25.640
It's not just that you're listening to the James Brown,

2636
02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:30.800
you're listening to a time capsule from 1963 or whatever it was.

2637
02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:35.630
He so astonishing.
James Brown,
he was amazing.
Oh,

2638
02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:39.620
like that I,
when I hear Zeplin and I hear Jan's man,
I never get,

2639
02:38:40.100 --> 02:38:43.610
I never lose my shock at how good they were,
how unique they were.
Yeah,

2640
02:38:43.611 --> 02:38:46.760
know Zeppelin was incredible.
There's the only thing that taints zipline is this.

2641
02:38:46.930 --> 02:38:51.770
I know allegations of plagiarism,
which seemed to be totally true.
I know,

2642
02:38:51.771 --> 02:38:55.180
I've heard the songs.
You can do that side by side where you're like,
Tam,

2643
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:57.080
you stole those rifts.
Yeah,
that's rough.

2644
02:38:58.070 --> 02:39:01.730
It's unfortunate because the end result is fucking incredible.

2645
02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:04.640
Like it's still so great that the immigrant song,

2646
02:39:04.730 --> 02:39:09.140
one of the best workout songs of all time.
I know

2647
02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:16.560
so crazy come from the land of the ice and snow with a midnight sun in the

2648
02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:21.410
hotsprings blow.
How much credit do they,

2649
02:39:21.411 --> 02:39:24.680
I mean did it,
should they have at the,
I'm not trying to disparage it at all,

2650
02:39:24.681 --> 02:39:27.590
but like they should get a lot of credit for how good they were still.

2651
02:39:27.591 --> 02:39:30.080
They were still the greatest.
They were definitive there.

2652
02:39:30.081 --> 02:39:32.800
The definitive heavy metal.
They're so good.
Bandit Ball.

2653
02:39:32.810 --> 02:39:35.360
There's no doubt that they're so good.
See the thing,

2654
02:39:35.361 --> 02:39:39.400
is it every song?
I don't know.
You know,

2655
02:39:39.710 --> 02:39:41.210
I don't know how every band does it.

2656
02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:44.090
Every song was probably constructed differently.
Putting in a lot of cases,

2657
02:39:44.810 --> 02:39:47.370
there's a lot of people contributing to the song.
You know,

2658
02:39:47.390 --> 02:39:52.310
the drummer has an idea and the singer has an idea and the guitar player has

2659
02:39:52.311 --> 02:39:54.860
these rifts he's trying out and they're trying to figure out the best way to do

2660
02:39:54.861 --> 02:39:56.630
the song.
It's a collaborative effort.

2661
02:39:57.500 --> 02:40:01.370
It's no doubt that the collaboration was fucking phenomenal.
The question is,

2662
02:40:01.371 --> 02:40:02.450
was it consensual?

2663
02:40:02.510 --> 02:40:05.090
Like how many of these people were collaborating and didn't know it.

2664
02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:10.300
So that's what happens if you're plagiarizing it seems like it's okay and you

2665
02:40:11.421 --> 02:40:13.800
know,
maybe they just thought that band's going to go away.

2666
02:40:13.810 --> 02:40:16.980
No one's going to care about them anymore cause we're OLED motherfucking Zeplin.

2667
02:40:17.100 --> 02:40:20.130
That's possible too.
Because before the Internet,

2668
02:40:20.131 --> 02:40:22.120
that kind of would have been the case,
you know,

2669
02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:25.710
no one but now we recognize still are taking sign it,
it doesn't belong to you.

2670
02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:30.390
You definitely are.
So in my opinion,
you have to buy that from the person.
Yes.

2671
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:32.190
Give them credit.
Yes,

2672
02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:36.540
but there's no way you can discount the fact that they were motherfuckers when

2673
02:40:36.541 --> 02:40:37.374
they were on top.

2674
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:41.040
When Robert Plant would stand on that fucking stage with his shirt open.

2675
02:40:41.370 --> 02:40:44.520
I mean he's the,
what's one of the weirdest things,

2676
02:40:44.521 --> 02:40:47.670
like what they think about that change in history,
right?

2677
02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:52.820
Go from 1950 to 1969 go 19 years and you see,

2678
02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:57.690
you go from people that looked like Hank Williams,
Sr two,

2679
02:40:57.691 --> 02:41:02.460
a Guy Robert Plant who apparently was wearing the blouses or dresses or tee

2680
02:41:02.461 --> 02:41:06.840
shirts that the girl he had the night before at Warren.

2681
02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:09.350
Do you know that that's what you'd wear on stage?
That's correct,
sir.

2682
02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:13.130
That's what I hear.
So probably fucked his way.
His shirts,

2683
02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:15.550
he always worked girl shirts that were too small for him.

2684
02:41:15.710 --> 02:41:17.550
When you go to OEC is hog in his pants.

2685
02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:21.630
He always had his hog pressed to the side.
Yeah.
The,
the,
the,
every,

2686
02:41:21.631 --> 02:41:26.100
every heavy metal band in the 80s poison,

2687
02:41:26.101 --> 02:41:30.360
you name it.
Uh,
whatever.
Motley crew,
they all had a blonde lead singer,

2688
02:41:30.620 --> 02:41:35.140
but that was cause their hero is Mr Robert Plant?
No,
he's a beast.

2689
02:41:35.460 --> 02:41:39.510
He's wearing a girl's shirt.
Oh my God.
That's amazing.
Yeah,

2690
02:41:39.930 --> 02:41:42.750
that's amazing.
That's sure.
It barely fits him.
Damn right.

2691
02:41:42.810 --> 02:41:46.410
All of so many of those pictures where he was,
what a crazy life.

2692
02:41:46.411 --> 02:41:49.050
That guy let look at it.
I don't,
you know,

2693
02:41:49.710 --> 02:41:53.130
I don't think any one of us will ever be able to understand.

2694
02:41:53.310 --> 02:41:56.100
Even even if you became like the new led Zepplin,

2695
02:41:56.101 --> 02:42:00.840
you'll never understand what it's like to be led Zepplin in the 70s in the 70s

2696
02:42:00.860 --> 02:42:05.860
what like imagine if you today became the new gigantic auto fucking

2697
02:42:07.291 --> 02:42:10.830
multi-country rock.
Doesn't matter too many people watching you.
Well,

2698
02:42:10.831 --> 02:42:14.280
it's not just that too many people watching you and there's a lot of you.

2699
02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:18.600
You got to think back when Robert Plant was Robert Plant where the royalty,

2700
02:42:18.730 --> 02:42:20.400
you were literally like a king.
Yeah.

2701
02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:23.250
You had the who you had rolling stones had helped him.
John,

2702
02:42:23.251 --> 02:42:27.900
yet people yet people but maybe have 30 yeah,
you might have 30 yeah,

2703
02:42:28.050 --> 02:42:32.730
30 big name artists.
Maybe.
Maybe,
maybe,
maybe,
but it's true.

2704
02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:37.260
Maybe a hundred let's get crazy a hundred you got pink Floyd.
You got the WHO.

2705
02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:40.740
When you think about the Beatles,
obviously CDC.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2706
02:42:40.741 --> 02:42:44.130
You got all sorts of shit.
You've got a lot,
a lot going on back then.
You know,

2707
02:42:44.310 --> 02:42:48.810
of course you have Hendrix,
Joplin,
Janis Joplin,
the doors.

2708
02:42:49.270 --> 02:42:52.140
Yeah,
man,
you got a lot of shit.
And then you've got the weird ones,

2709
02:42:52.141 --> 02:42:54.270
the mamas and the Papas.
Amazing band.

2710
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:58.230
It wasn't just some weird shit that went on with that family.
Yeah.

2711
02:42:58.231 --> 02:43:01.350
But also heroin and cocaine kind of killed all that whole,

2712
02:43:01.351 --> 02:43:04.320
that whole music scene.
Yeah.
There's a lot of that.
That's the problem.

2713
02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:07.020
It's sort of starts it up and then it poisons it.
Well,

2714
02:43:07.050 --> 02:43:09.240
psychedelics and we'd probably good for your music.

2715
02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:11.070
When you get into cocaine and heroin,

2716
02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:15.820
your music is dying.
Don't panic.

2717
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:20.050
You don't get it that it's bad for you.

2718
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:22.940
But I think it's,
there's,

2719
02:43:23.050 --> 02:43:28.050
it can't be a coincidence that so many people that love heroin made amazing

2720
02:43:28.211 --> 02:43:33.040
music beforehand though.
So,
so a lot of forehand.
Yeah.
Look at Lou Reed.

2721
02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:37.720
Any of them who got into heroin,
their music stopped.
Lou Reed was always,

2722
02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:40.470
even Hendrix and Jim Morrison,

2723
02:43:40.471 --> 02:43:43.990
I mean a lot of the songs that Hendricks was riding me,
he died at 27.

2724
02:43:44.470 --> 02:43:46.140
So that was a relatively new,

2725
02:43:46.270 --> 02:43:51.070
his musical development I think was done less with,
you know,
maybe,
maybe,

2726
02:43:51.071 --> 02:43:52.510
uh,
psychedelics,

2727
02:43:52.511 --> 02:43:57.410
but I don't think heroin played a factor until later on in his life.
So,
um,

2728
02:43:57.430 --> 02:44:01.450
it's hard to say,
you know,
no,
I know he was arrested in Toronto with heroin.

2729
02:44:01.451 --> 02:44:05.500
I don't know the whole history of is I don't buy that time.
He's so famous.

2730
02:44:05.501 --> 02:44:09.040
He had already written those songs that got them there.
You know,
maybe,
I mean,

2731
02:44:09.041 --> 02:44:12.200
I don't know when he started using heroin or why,
you know,

2732
02:44:12.370 --> 02:44:16.120
I don't think heroin makes you more,
um,
uh,

2733
02:44:16.180 --> 02:44:18.760
more artistic or more successful at all.

2734
02:44:18.761 --> 02:44:21.730
But I think what happens is you have very talented people that have a substance

2735
02:44:21.731 --> 02:44:25.290
abuse problem.
You know,
that's what Steven killed king said.
He said,
I,

2736
02:44:25.291 --> 02:44:28.390
I'm a great writer,
but I don't remember writing Cujo yeah,

2737
02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:31.630
my alcohol didn't make me a better writer.
I'm a really imaginative,

2738
02:44:31.631 --> 02:44:34.780
talented writer who happens to have a substance abuse problem.

2739
02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:39.520
And ask a bit of it.
Yes and no.
Yes and no because yes,

2740
02:44:39.610 --> 02:44:41.800
he is unbelievably talented.
Yes.

2741
02:44:41.801 --> 02:44:44.050
He's an amazing writer is one of my personal favorites.

2742
02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:46.900
I mean I probably read more Stephen King books in any other fiction author,

2743
02:44:47.470 --> 02:44:52.470
but the stuff that he wrote when he was doing drugs was hard core shit.

2744
02:44:53.290 --> 02:44:57.630
He wrote the shining and Cusco and the Tommy desires,
one of the best.

2745
02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:00.250
He wrote all sorts of wicked books,

2746
02:45:00.251 --> 02:45:05.251
men where there's just evil and tensions and ruthless actions and shocking

2747
02:45:06.011 --> 02:45:10.450
scenes.
And the fact it was a coincidence he was doing coke.

2748
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:13.780
It's just a coincidence he was drunk.
No,
I think I don't leave.

2749
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:17.420
I wrote the books though.
I think what he did,
and no one's saying that,
look,

2750
02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:19.930
vitamin C doesn't make a person,
right.
It's these are,

2751
02:45:19.931 --> 02:45:24.931
these are tools to squeeze the most out of your imagination while suppressing

2752
02:45:25.330 --> 02:45:27.060
any sort of,
uh,

2753
02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:32.820
any sort of societal handcuffs he might've put on yourself because of the

2754
02:45:35.140 --> 02:45:37.690
horrific notions.
Like he said,

2755
02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:41.590
he would say things in his book where you would go,
whoa.

2756
02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:44.740
Like you would have to take a step back.
Like,
where the fuck what?

2757
02:45:44.770 --> 02:45:48.550
What kind of fucking person thinks this up?
What kind of person?

2758
02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:52.810
I'll tell you what kind of person,
a guy who's drunk as fuck doing coke,

2759
02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.270
who's also a great writer.

2760
02:45:55.510 --> 02:46:00.510
It's not that it is not capable of writing that stuff and digging into is,

2761
02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:05.350
I'm not saying that I think you probably could have achieved the exact same

2762
02:46:05.351 --> 02:46:08.760
results on the Nache.
Yeah,
because he,
Steven motherfuck.
Okay.

2763
02:46:08.780 --> 02:46:13.780
Might've his mind from all over are also positive possible rather that that

2764
02:46:15.171 --> 02:46:19.720
stuff is rocket fuel.
It's rocket fuel for your,

2765
02:46:19.930 --> 02:46:23.900
your,
your physical energy,
your anger,
your moods,

2766
02:46:23.901 --> 02:46:28.410
your inhibitions dissolve and it might open up the pathway.

2767
02:46:28.411 --> 02:46:32.810
Did that for picking door of demon rape that you didn't want to get to hear him?

2768
02:46:32.811 --> 02:46:33.560
I cannot be.

2769
02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:37.520
Comes to like it gives you a scene in a Stephen King book gives you courage.
Oh,

2770
02:46:37.521 --> 02:46:39.500
what the hell is that?
Cemeteries came out,

2771
02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:44.390
what is it that just brought up maybe remade it today or last week or something

2772
02:46:44.391 --> 02:46:48.860
and it goes out week or two.
Yeah.
Is it a comedy?
Definitely not.
I heard it.

2773
02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:52.670
I heard it's really good.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh,
John Lithgow is,
I've got to go kids.

2774
02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:54.200
Okay.
It's always good.
You gotta go.

2775
02:46:54.350 --> 02:46:58.290
I gotta go close it down Brian,

2776

2777

thank you for having the number one comedy special on the planet Earth.

2778
02:47:07.461 --> 02:47:11.390

All right,

Love you.
Always good to hang with you.

2785
