1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.220
Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:02.790
Jay Leno,

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.350
thank you very much for doing this man.

4
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.600
Thanks.

5
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.610
Thanks for having me.

6
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.533
I appreciate it.

7
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.680
Your your place is the most impressive thing that I've ever seen.

8
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:13.140
Someone on your garage.

9
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.140
I shouldn't say garage cause everybody thinks it's a garage.

10
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.980
You're Rod,

11
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.510
you have 12 garages,

12
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.780
12 giant warehouse buildings filled with the most amazing cars I've ever seen in

13
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:24.810
my entire life.

14
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.710
A couple amazing.

15
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.590
A lot of them are just the old cars that I like that are kind of fun.

16
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.110
I have a good story if guys got a good story about it.

17
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.880
I like how you tried to downplay it,

18
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.200
but I'm just telling you why.

19
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.220
Why is it as a fellow car nut you nearly of your proportion,

20
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.620
but I was blown away that that place is insane.

21
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.011
Well yeah,

22
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:41.280
your,

23
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.450
your videos up right now.

24
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:43.050
People love it.

25
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.630
It's almost a 200,000 hits so,

26
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.050
but thank you very much for having me.

27
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.030
I really appreciate it.

28
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:47.820
It was a lot of fun.

29
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.241
It was a,

30
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:48.841
it was really cool.

31
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:52.140
It was cool to be a passenger in my car and have you drive it around somebody

32
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:53.190
else beat the crap out of your car.

33
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.120
What's more fun than that?

34
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.260
How did you get started with such an insane collection?

35
00:00:58.261 --> 00:00:59.340
Like what did you start out with?

36
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.800
And I used to work at car dealerships when I was a kid.

37
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.150
I worked at a Ford dealership.

38
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.610
I was in charge of the odometer.

39
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:07.830
Recalibrations that was my area really?

40
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.371
Well you know what?

41
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:09.840
You too back in the old days,

42
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:13.050
like a guy would bring your car in and had the boss would say,

43
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.670
I take it back and just turn back to this phenomenon.

44
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.513
Okay.

45
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.550
I met one guy came in with like a 64 Chevy and it had like 92,000 miles.

46
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.140
So he's making this deal for his new Ford,

47
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:25.381
you know,

48
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:27.470
Blah Ba ba and went back there with the drills,

49
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.341
spinning it back.

50
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:29.930
You know,

51
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.870
it's fun it with a drill.

52
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.220
So the guy comes out,

53
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.691
he goes that,

54
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:33.030
no,

55
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.390
no,

56
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.230
give me my car back.

57
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:35.340
Cut Now.

58
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.551
Well,

59
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:37.500
that was cars going at 50,000 miles on it.

60
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.550
And he drove away and he went around the block and he came back with a big smile

61
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:44.580
on his face because he knew we had the dealership because he said,

62
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.140
and they gave him what he wanted because we had already turned the clock back so

63
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.260
you could have caught him and busted him like,

64
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.481
no,

65
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:51.691
no.

66
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:54.000
He's not like a federal crime known now.

67
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.260
It is not caught him.

68
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:55.441
I mean,

69
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:56.274
he could have caught you.

70
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.970
Yeah.

71
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.310
Back in the day that's used car dealers.

72
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.150
It was horrible.

73
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:00.984
It was terrible.

74
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.303
I was like,

75
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.031
I was a kid.

76
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:03.301
I was like,

77
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:03.870
really?

78
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.630
This is what they do.

79
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.180
Okay.

80
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.013
Yeah.

81
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.980
What does the worst thing you ever saw them do?

82
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.390
Worst thing.

83
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.223
Well,

84
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.200
well,

85
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.421
you know,

86
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:12.450
you used to have stuff.

87
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.710
You want the undercoating.

88
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.753
Okay.

89
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.180
Tony Bells undercoating and they put the car in the rack and we take some black

90
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:19.014
paint.

91
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.960
Just spray underneath.

92
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.490
Just know like cheap black Rustoleum paint and then tell people as an

93
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:25.980
undercoating,

94
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.670
oh,

95
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.503
it's just,

96
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.051
yeah,

97
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:28.410
the carb.

98
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.610
This has really been cleaned up.

99
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.710
Like the scene from Fargo Copeland,

100
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.603
they charged him with it.

101
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.823
That's my favorite.

102
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.000
See what he's buying the car and went to the old couple and they're just yelling

103
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:39.470
at him.

104
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.140
A hilarious,

105
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.420
so you started off just working on cars,

106
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.780
working in dealerships and then somewhere along the line I started collecting

107
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:46.614
them.

108
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.510
Well I realize I'm never going to have any nice cars working at a car

109
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:52.200
dealership.

110
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.600
You know,

111
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.790
this only became a comedian.

112
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.080
So I became a comedian.

113
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:57.690
So I thought that seemed like a good way to make money at the time.

114
00:02:57.691 --> 00:02:58.524
And it was,

115
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.423
yeah,

116
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.870
you're so in your element when you around cars and when you do that show,

117
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.740
it's so different.

118
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:06.670
And you know,

119
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:06.931
and,

120
00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:08.800
and I said this with all due respect,

121
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.300
you are a great host of the tonight show.

122
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.770
You're a comic,

123
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.281
you know,

124
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:15.040
talking to like dopey celebrities.

125
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.401
Yeah.

126
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:17.110
I mean there are some really interesting ones,

127
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.370
but then there's like me,

128
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:18.730
right?

129
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.260
Yeah,

130
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.750
yeah.

131
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.490
But then they're were like this really like reality stuff and people like,

132
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:27.070
you probably never saw that coming either when you first started hosting.

133
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:27.904
The tonight show,

134
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.110
there weren't reality stars.

135
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:30.070
They didn't exist.

136
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.611
Yeah,

137
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.390
that's true.

138
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.800
But you know,

139
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:34.330
I really enjoyed it cause I like people,

140
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:35.410
I like talking to people,

141
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.260
but a lot of times you don't really talk to the person.

142
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.640
You talked to the publicist.

143
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.570
I remember one time we had a this ice skater on I,

144
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.021
oh,

145
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:44.651
she's famous.

146
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:46.880
She was in the Olympics and then like 10 years old,

147
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.040
she was in playboy magazine.

148
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.380
Like she hadn't done anything for 10 years and she's in playboy.

149
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.510
So we've got a call from playboy.

150
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.900
Uh,

151
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.240
would you put so and so and okay.

152
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:55.421
Yeah,

153
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:57.430
she was America's sweetheart and now she's naked.

154
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:57.731
Okay.

155
00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:59.290
That could be an interesting second guessed.

156
00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.561
Okay,

157
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:00.394
fine.

158
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.750
So she comes in and her your tastes.

159
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.271
Mr [inaudible],

160
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:05.104
can I speak to you?

161
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.220
We are not mentioning the playboy article.

162
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.581
I go,

163
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:10.330
really?

164
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.160
Why don't you take your client and go home?

165
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:12.994
Okay.

166
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.100
I can get a comic here in four minutes.

167
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.680
This,

168
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.220
this is why your client is here.

169
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:20.530
You called us because you're naked in playboy.

170
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.513
Okay.

171
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.463
Hilarious.

172
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.900
We or will we are not mentioning what you're here for.

173
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.171
Right,

174
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:27.004
exactly.

175
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.581
Exactly.

176
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:28.141
I mean that,

177
00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:29.440
that would happen all the time.

178
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.070
Just publicists would get mad because you,

179
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.890
yeah,

180
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.780
well the manipulation of the image,

181
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.130
it's really not that possible anymore because the internet kind of all comes

182
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:39.740
out.

183
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.160
You know,

184
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.960
it doesn't,

185
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.201
you know,

186
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:45.580
in the old days when you watch old shows with John and you see stars come out

187
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.650
and they would just make these horrible fashion mistakes,

188
00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:49.091
so whatever,

189
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:52.360
cause they dress themselves or that now everybody has handlers.

190
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:53.021
You don't do this,

191
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:54.010
you don't do that.

192
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.881
Don't talk about the,

193
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:55.121
Oh no,

194
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:56.170
don't talk about that.

195
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.921
You know,

196
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.510
it's so it gets a little a,

197
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.850
it's not quite as loose as it used to be.

198
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.860
So you think that,

199
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.290
oh,

200
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.950
because of handlers and publicists and things along those lines,

201
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.860
everybody is,

202
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.180
is handled by somebody now or don't do this.

203
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:10.301
No,

204
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:10.760
don't kill.

205
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.000
Don't give your actual opinion on.

206
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.200
It's just say that we love everyone,

207
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:14.441
you know,

208
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:15.400
whatever it might be.

209
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.800
Did you ever think about going back to do a talk show on another network?

210
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.550
It never even occurred to me.

211
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:21.791
You know,

212
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:23.380
you can't make lightening strike twice.

213
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.330
When we did the tonight show,

214
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.250
we had a good crew,

215
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.680
I had a lot of stuff left over from Johnny in terms of um,

216
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.520
uh,

217
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.780
editing facilities,

218
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.980
all those kinds of stuff.

219
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.980
And when you try and recreate that again,

220
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.740
it costs you twice as much with half the budget.

221
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.491
I mean,

222
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:44.170
our sending hall is a good buddy of mine.

223
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:46.780
And when our scenario went to do his show again,

224
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.370
his hands were tied.

225
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.230
They gave him no budget,

226
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.131
you know,

227
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:52.060
I mean God bless him.

228
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:53.530
He made it work as best he could.

229
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:54.970
But like for example,

230
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.880
when a guest would come out from a TV show,

231
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.590
the band couldn't even play the theme song to the TV show because they didn't

232
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:04.790
have money for music rights.

233
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.950
So he just had to plan like porn music,

234
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.343
you know what I mean?

235
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.890
Just little things like that you don't even think about.

236
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.581
You know,

237
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.241
those are,

238
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.740
that's where the cost comes.

239
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:16.730
Get any music rights,

240
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:17.211
getting this,

241
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:18.044
getting that.

242
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.500
Uh,

243
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.071
so no,

244
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:20.750
I never thought about going to do it again.

245
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.130
I did it for 22 years,

246
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.911
you know,

247
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:25.490
it was number one when I got it was number one when I left.

248
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.680
That was perfect for me.

249
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.371
How many,

250
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:29.031
you know this,

251
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:30.650
you're in the fight came how many fighters?

252
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:31.820
They're tamp there champ.

253
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:33.980
The champ that come out of retirement,

254
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.210
they get their ass kicked.

255
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.770
You know,

256
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:37.111
you,

257
00:06:37.111 --> 00:06:38.690
you can't make it strike twice.

258
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.430
Well with boxing and ends really bad with,

259
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.050
you know,

260
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.110
fighting a lot of times it ends really bad for a lot of the great ones.

261
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:46.310
It's the saddest thing in the world.

262
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.930
Functioning always ends bad.

263
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:50.210
Did you ever see requiem for a heavyweight?

264
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.381
Yeah,

265
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:55.340
we talked about in the video my all time favorite movie,

266
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.451
Anthony Quinn,

267
00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:57.950
just the greatest actor.

268
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.360
And he goes in,

269
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:00.530
if you haven't seen this movie,

270
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:04.220
you got to get it because it's got Cassius clay in and not Muhammad Ali,

271
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.390
Cassius clay.

272
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.340
And,

273
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.050
and he plays mountain Rivera and he,

274
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.750
he was ranked fifth heavyweight in the world,

275
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.500
you know,

276
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.410
back in the 50s and movie takes place in the early sixties.

277
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.810
And he's still fighting.

278
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.950
And he goes for a job that an employment agency,

279
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.310
like it's a dishwasher and it's this heartbreaking when you go,

280
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:26.480
that was number five.

281
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.350
I was number five in the world and the woman looks at him like,

282
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.330
wow,

283
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.030
what?

284
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.241
Oh,

285
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:32.510
it's,

286
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.280
it's just a gut wrenching scene.

287
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:35.390
And you realize it's,

288
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.080
it must be awful to be in a profession where there's only one number one.

289
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.531
Like,

290
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:41.300
some people think you're funny.

291
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:42.260
Some people that got and funny,

292
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:43.240
some people use sex,

293
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.581
some people,

294
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:44.120
like I said,

295
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.780
fine.

296
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.740
It's all subjective.

297
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:46.220
There's only,

298
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.210
there's not one comedian and everybody else's ranked below.

299
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.961
It's one of you,

300
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:51.440
like,

301
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.060
you know,

302
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.490
uh,

303
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.010
but to be in a game like fighting where the,

304
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.220
where it's so,

305
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.103
uh,

306
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.213
what a wonderful,

307
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.351
oh hell,

308
00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:02.450
I'll call you back later.

309
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:03.410
I'm doing a podcast.

310
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:04.244
Sorry.

311
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.561
Oh,

312
00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:05.394
sorry about that.

313
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.580
I'd love to live TV.

314
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.673
Um,

315
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.740
uh,

316
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.573
it,

317
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.410
it must be tough to be in a field with,

318
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.311
cause that's it.

319
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:14.144
You're the only guy.

320
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:14.841
Yeah.

321
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:15.950
And your whole,

322
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.240
the whole purpose of it is to dish out destruction and someone's going to dish

323
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:21.020
it out to you.

324
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.660
And along the way you're taking some and before you know what your body just

325
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:24.680
doesn't function the same way.

326
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:24.831
And He,

327
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:26.000
my dad was a prize fighter.

328
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.833
That's what he did.

329
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.370
How did he retire?

330
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.121
Well,

331
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:32.010
I mean he eventually sold and she'll move.

332
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:33.230
And then the insurance company,

333
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.071
you know,

334
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:35.180
my dad grew up in,

335
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:39.770
in New York and during the depression and I never know how far my dad got in

336
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:40.071
school.

337
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:41.090
He'd never actually tell us,

338
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:41.810
you know,

339
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.160
but I know he quit and he became a prize fighter for awhile and then he became a

340
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:47.840
salesman cause he's pretty good with kids.

341
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:50.150
So we would always watch the fights together.

342
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:51.800
That was something my dad and I was did.

343
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.263
Wow.

344
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.140
Did he ever try to get you to do it?

345
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.371
Well,

346
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:56.671
yeah.

347
00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:57.930
We played around a little bit with it,

348
00:08:57.931 --> 00:08:59.190
but it was just not my,

349
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:00.024
I don't have that.

350
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.370
I don't have that killer instinct.

351
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.640
I don't hit the guy in the face and then I get in if you know,

352
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.140
it just,

353
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.630
it was,

354
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.740
it was not me.

355
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.821
It was not me.

356
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:12.600
I had a couple of fights when I was a teenager and it was like,

357
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.703
Oh man,

358
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.220
you know,

359
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.400
there's nothing like getting your ass kicked to put things in perspective.

360
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.031
You know,

361
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:21.330
most people have never had the crap beat out of them.

362
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.880
And when you've had that happen to you a couple of times,

363
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.210
you begin to appreciate the art of negotiation.

364
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.200
You know what I mean?

365
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.610
I,

366
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.440
the number of people I meet in this town,

367
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:31.571
they go,

368
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:32.370
let me tell you something.

369
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.660
If I ever see that guy,

370
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.410
I'm going to kick.

371
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:34.561
No,

372
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:35.011
you're not.

373
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:37.860
You're not going to kick his ass because look at you and look at him.

374
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:38.101
Okay.

375
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:39.210
He's a street guy.

376
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.530
You went to La d.

377
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:40.771
Dot.

378
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:41.604
College.

379
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.870
He just knows stuff.

380
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:43.710
You don't know.

381
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.390
It's not gonna happen,

382
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:46.260
but they have this,

383
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.330
they never had the crap kicked out of them,

384
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:51.270
so they just have this attitude that just makes me laugh.

385
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:51.631
Yeah.

386
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:54.540
I think it's healthy for every man to get punched in the face at least once in

387
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:55.080
his life.

388
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.840
Just to get humility a little bit.

389
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.460
I think you need to get knocked out.

390
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.790
I got knocked out a couple of times and I would see the cartoons where they see

391
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:05.970
stars and I'd go,

392
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:06.510
well,

393
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.343
that's kind of silly.

394
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:07.951
No,

395
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:09.720
you actually see stars.

396
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.370
I saw twinkling.

397
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.080
I saw twinkling things.

398
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.400
It's just like the cartoon.

399
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:15.480
I remember going down,

400
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:15.990
I was going,

401
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.501
Oh man,

402
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:18.510
this is just like the current dude when I hit the floor.

403
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.350
Yeah.

404
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.310
There's a lot of people,

405
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:24.060
especially in Hollywood that think that fighting is like a movie.

406
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.500
Like you could just piss to whip somebody.

407
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:25.770
Yeah.

408
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.670
That always drove me crazy.

409
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:28.470
We just whacked a guy over the head and they just,

410
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.590
they go out and they wake up in the head.

411
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.490
But other than that,

412
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:33.210
fine.

413
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.470
Well the funny thing about movies is whether you're the good bug,

414
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:37.891
good guy,

415
00:10:37.891 --> 00:10:38.724
the bad guy,

416
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.760
the punches always thrown from the perspective of the person throwing the punch.

417
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.460
I've never seen a movie where the punch is coming at you.

418
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:48.270
You know what I mean?

419
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.860
So it's all is over the shoulder.

420
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.860
So as a viewer you're always throwing the punch.

421
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:53.903
That always makes,

422
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.600
I want to see a movie where the punches coming and hitting you in the face while

423
00:10:57.601 --> 00:10:59.380
you're sitting there in the theater.

424
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.110
You don't really get that.

425
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:01.710
But yeah.

426
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.250
Well you can see the sparks and the w.

427
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.920
What happens when the punches hit your face and get the light show?

428
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.900
That's my favorite thing about these superhero movies.

429
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:10.980
You see the superhero,

430
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.400
he punches a car and the car fulls up like an accordion and then he punches the

431
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:17.970
other superhero and the guy goes,

432
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.913
oh,

433
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.500
oh man.

434
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:19.651
Yeah.

435
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:20.101
Well No,

436
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:20.401
I didn't.

437
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:22.150
His face get crushed like the card.

438
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.680
That's it.

439
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.720
I don't quite understand because it's a movie.

440
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:25.380
Jaylen moves.

441
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.220
Not Real life.

442
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:26.801
Exactly.

443
00:11:26.801 --> 00:11:27.110
It just,

444
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.040
just a little escape.

445
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:29.250
Sort of like the tonight show.

446
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.080
You left on top like that.

447
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:35.790
That is rare that someone leaves.

448
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:36.300
Number one.

449
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.530
It usually they want to keep you around.

450
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.880
Everybody left the tonight show.

451
00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:39.481
It was number one.

452
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:40.201
Steve on the left,

453
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:42.660
one is the number one Jack Paar left and it was number one.

454
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:43.591
Johnny left one.

455
00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:45.880
It was number one I left was number one.

456
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.970
Do you miss it at all?

457
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:48.780
No.

458
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.400
No.

459
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.221
You had your time.

460
00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:51.054
You enjoyed it.

461
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.291
I love doing it.

462
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:53.124
You know this,

463
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.160
there's a point in your life where at my age I shouldn't have to know all the

464
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:58.150
Jaycees music.

465
00:11:58.151 --> 00:11:58.984
Okay.

466
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.651
You know what I mean?

467
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:00.221
I'm sorry.

468
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:00.641
I don't,

469
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:05.641
I can't pretend to know common and a con everybody's music.

470
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:06.611
I just don't,

471
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:06.880
it's,

472
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.271
you know,

473
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:12.010
knows how he brought up a lot of black guys that I grew up in the era of Paul

474
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.760
Simon and Marvin Gaye and all of those guests mall.

475
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.350
My,

476
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.430
it's more my era.

477
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.390
You know when you're 20 when you're 42 when you're talking to the 25 year old

478
00:12:20.391 --> 00:12:21.280
super model.

479
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.821
Oh,

480
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:22.570
it's sexy.

481
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.180
When you 64 you don't like the creepy old guy.

482
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.630
Right,

483
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:25.990
right.

484
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.621
No thank you.

485
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:27.400
I'm sorry.

486
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.310
I mean it's true.

487
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.920
So where do you go to school?

488
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:30.161
You know,

489
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:31.210
I wasn't going to say to you,

490
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.333
okay,

491
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.960
I'm like 40 years older than you are.

492
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.890
What am I going to say to you?

493
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:36.431
You know,

494
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:38.650
so you just have to know when it's time to step aside,

495
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.663
but you are,

496
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.960
do your demeanor,

497
00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:42.950
your what?

498
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.230
Your excitement level,

499
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.220
how natural is when you're doing your car show is very different and I think

500
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:49.054
people would,

501
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.310
I think there's two Jay Leno's,

502
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:53.140
there's the Jay Leno that host the tonight show,

503
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:54.520
which is a great entertainer.

504
00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:55.600
You're a great interviewer,

505
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.500
but then there's you in your element when you're hosting Jay's garage.

506
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.870
I enjoyed being around show business as opposed to being immersed in it.

507
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.733
Like to me,

508
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.540
Charlie Sheen's a friend of mine,

509
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.040
I enjoy every time another hookup pushes want to Charlie's Mercedes off

510
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:12.910
Mulholland drive.

511
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:13.930
I get a kick out of it.

512
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:14.440
Like everybody,

513
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.700
I don't want to beat Charlie.

514
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.530
I don't want to live that life body by enjoy hearing about it and observing

515
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:21.880
Charlie when he comes to this show,

516
00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:22.241
Charlie,

517
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:22.721
how you doing,

518
00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:23.570
man Jay,

519
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.910
or whatever it might be.

520
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.920
So the tonight show was great that way.

521
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.690
I didn't have to actually be there.

522
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.640
I could be a part of it without being a part of it right now,

523
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.120
because it's not really,

524
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:35.710
I'm not really a party guy.

525
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.910
I'm not a drug guy.

526
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.320
I'm not an alcoholic guy,

527
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.040
you know?

528
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.150
It's just not what I do.

529
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:42.010
I enjoy observing it.

530
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.630
Whereas with cars,

531
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.860
it's what I really do.

532
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.251
Cars,

533
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:46.084
motorcycles.

534
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.320
I really just,

535
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:48.820
so I am immersed in that.

536
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.620
Whereas with show business,

537
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.150
I enjoy being around it.

538
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:52.780
You know,

539
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.650
probably the difference.

540
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.000
But you still do standup,

541
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.530
so you're still on the road all the time.

542
00:13:56.531 --> 00:13:57.590
I love doing stand up.

543
00:13:57.591 --> 00:13:58.424
That's the greatest.

544
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.340
But still you're still in showbizness.

545
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.761
Oh yeah,

546
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:01.770
I'm still in showbizness.

547
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.290
Yeah,

548
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:03.460
but you're not in that show.

549
00:14:03.461 --> 00:14:04.030
But as the CEO,

550
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.690
it's like comics will think of standup as being very different than all the

551
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:08.910
other aspects of Showbiz.

552
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:09.161
Well,

553
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:12.010
it is different than all the other aspects of show business because it's the

554
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:15.190
only one where you don't need any other aspects of show business.

555
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:15.641
I mean,

556
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:17.950
I got started when I was in Boston.

557
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.070
I would go into bars with a $50 bill and I,

558
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.590
I would say I'm a comedian.

559
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.440
We don't hire comedians.

560
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.250
I ain't go look,

561
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.270
here's 50 bucks,

562
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.010
let me go on the state to tell some jobs.

563
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:27.850
If people leave,

564
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.970
you keep my 50 if I do,

565
00:14:29.971 --> 00:14:30.071
oh,

566
00:14:30.071 --> 00:14:31.030
can it get some last?

567
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.080
Give me my money back.

568
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.251
All right,

569
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:35.500
costs me about $300 he'll the long run.

570
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.720
But for the most part it was either,

571
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:38.480
yeah,

572
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:38.711
kid,

573
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:39.071
you were funny.

574
00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:39.791
Here's your money back,

575
00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:40.120
but you know,

576
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.070
don't we don't really do,

577
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.370
or oh,

578
00:14:42.371 --> 00:14:42.910
that was okay.

579
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:43.360
Yeah,

580
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.171
come back Wednesday,

581
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:44.741
come back Wednesday.

582
00:14:44.741 --> 00:14:45.574
We got to,

583
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.230
back then they had hootenanny nights.

584
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:49.450
It was folk singers stop you warm machine,

585
00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:49.661
you know,

586
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:50.860
all those kinds of songs and,

587
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.760
and they put a comic on,

588
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:53.594
in between.

589
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.490
And that's the one thing about comedy.

590
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:57.560
You can take it and do it anywhere.

591
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:58.370
I mean,

592
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.640
we both know actors that are great that are funny,

593
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.290
but if a TV show gets canceled or the movies no good or the director,

594
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:06.740
yeah,

595
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.780
it's like they're at a work,

596
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.810
they can't go down to a bar and pass the hat and tell jokes or even negotiate a

597
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:16.430
salary.

598
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.260
It's,

599
00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:17.900
you know,

600
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.520
so comedy is different because it's self sustaining hootenanny night.

601
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.761
Yeah.

602
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:23.840
That's what he used to call him boss,

603
00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:24.731
nanny not,

604
00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:25.091
yeah.

605
00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:25.370
Yeah.

606
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.160
Wow.

607
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.070
So you really did that.

608
00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:28.461
You would go,

609
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:30.830
was that your idea to put a $50 bill on the ballot?

610
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:31.723
Because that's,

611
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.631
you know,

612
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.160
I was lucky when I started,

613
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.050
I had never met another comic.

614
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.460
I didn't know anything about show business.

615
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.530
You're not going to know,

616
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:38.811
you know,

617
00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:40.280
you know your Boston here from Ellen,

618
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.510
from Boston rather.

619
00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:43.670
And I remember the neighbor lady saying to me,

620
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:43.881
you know,

621
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:45.000
you can't be a comedian.

622
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.340
I should find that was a comedian.

623
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.480
That's the way it is out there.

624
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:48.920
Unless you Fado is the comedian,

625
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:49.340
you can't,

626
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.173
you can't be one,

627
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.110
they won't let you do it,

628
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:51.561
you know?

629
00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:51.891
And I thought,

630
00:15:51.891 --> 00:15:53.180
well it doesn't make any sense.

631
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.070
So I used to just go around bars and places like that and in Boston and I

632
00:15:58.071 --> 00:15:59.210
thought I was doing pretty good,

633
00:15:59.270 --> 00:15:59.690
you know,

634
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:00.560
I really wasn't.

635
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.810
But to me I thought it was pretty good.

636
00:16:02.811 --> 00:16:07.130
I got my start at a place called Lenny's on the turnpike and route one near

637
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:07.710
Saugus.

638
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:12.260
I know I used to play and he's all the time and Lenny made me kind of the house

639
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:15.020
comments and I got to work with miles Davis,

640
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:17.090
Mose Allison and all the great jazz artist.

641
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.950
Wow.

642
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:18.120
Yeah,

643
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.800
that's pretty cool.

644
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.800
That's where a giggles is and Sagas goes out there and a pizza place.

645
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:24.860
Princess Pizza.

646
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.220
Yeah,

647
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.950
I mean like Clark's joint makes me laugh.

648
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.820
Lenny Clark's brothers,

649
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.350
I love money.

650
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.110
Clark to the funniest guy.

651
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.010
He really,

652
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.410
and a true Boston comedian.

653
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.160
Yeah.

654
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.300
I never consider myself a Boston comedian because I was born in New York and I

655
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:45.830
moved to Boston and I was like 10 like my family moved there in [inaudible] 59

656
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.160
and we're still the new people I know people,

657
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.200
but Leno's they came here in 59.

658
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.500
You know the other people who have been there since [inaudible] 41 right,

659
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:55.210
exactly.

660
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:55.551
You know,

661
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:56.330
so they're,

662
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:56.601
you know,

663
00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:58.000
they're the relatively new people.

664
00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.000
Did you,

665
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.890
do they have open mic nights back then?

666
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.911
No,

667
00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:03.530
there was no such thing as open mind.

668
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.740
This is before comedy clubs.

669
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.490
Comedy clubs didn't exhibit.

670
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.230
Did you start?

671
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.730
I started in 1969.

672
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.930
Wow.

673
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.400
And I used to work strip joints.

674
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:14.181
I used to work,

675
00:17:14.181 --> 00:17:15.014
uh,

676
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.710
you know,

677
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.490
you remember the combat zone and bar.

678
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.680
I used to work all those strip joints.

679
00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:22.340
I worked,

680
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.190
I remember I teamed up with two strippers,

681
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:30.191
literally pagan and I need a man that was her name and they were like 40 years

682
00:17:31.731 --> 00:17:33.350
old and they were like,

683
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.050
they weren't prostitutes.

684
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:37.490
They were,

685
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.080
they were working class women,

686
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:43.370
Big Boston women with short hair that would wear wigs.

687
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.600
And like,

688
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.340
we would drive out to Fort Devins,

689
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:47.480
do a show for the soldiers,

690
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.940
they'd be there with drills and then,

691
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.610
you know,

692
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.710
power tools and they'd put,

693
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.160
and she put together this,

694
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.091
this,

695
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:54.924
uh,

696
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:55.590
what do you call that?

697
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.550
Clear plastic.

698
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.541
They have plexiglass,

699
00:17:57.541 --> 00:17:58.800
plexiglass bathtub,

700
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.750
and she would take a bath,

701
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.030
you know,

702
00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:01.863
like a stripper,

703
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.340
you know,

704
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.240
and so,

705
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:03.810
and,

706
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:08.810
and they were tough women and I was like 19 and they were like 40 and one day

707
00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:12.400
we're out there doing a show and she's in the bath,

708
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:12.750
you know,

709
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:13.590
doing those kinds of stuff.

710
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.510
And I'm on stage just telling jokes.

711
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:16.344
That's so and so.

712
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.423
And some guy,

713
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.050
it's just Todd's heckling me.

714
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.210
And I remember she gets out of the bath tub,

715
00:18:21.211 --> 00:18:21.661
walks over,

716
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:22.590
grabs the guy by neck,

717
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.120
punches him in the face,

718
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:25.020
breaks the guys,

719
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.640
knows the guy goes down,

720
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.900
the crowd is cheering,

721
00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:28.180
she goes,

722
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.250
you need to catalog.

723
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.720
And then she gets back in the tub.

724
00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:30.841
It's,

725
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:32.070
that's doing all the integration.

726
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:32.910
I mean,

727
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.230
it was hilarious.

728
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.280
It was hilarious.

729
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:36.750
It was a great,

730
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.590
it was a great time.

731
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:39.150
And they were really nice women.

732
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.470
They weren't hookers,

733
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:41.491
you know,

734
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:46.290
these are the women that back then being a typist or secretary,

735
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:50.130
that's really what was available to you as a woman if you were not a college

736
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:51.180
educated woman,

737
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:51.571
you know,

738
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:53.250
or a waitress or something like that.

739
00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:54.240
So that's what they did.

740
00:18:54.241 --> 00:18:54.720
They,

741
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.130
they had the car with their,

742
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:56.551
you know,

743
00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:58.080
stripper and Cigna on the side.

744
00:18:58.081 --> 00:18:59.700
I need a man and you know,

745
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.270
that kind of adult up picture of themselves painted on the fender and we just

746
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:04.200
drive around and,

747
00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:07.950
and I would mc and introduced the girls and they would come out and do their

748
00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:08.221
act,

749
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:08.371
you know,

750
00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:10.710
but they're very protective of me cause I was like a kid.

751
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:11.680
Yeah,

752
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:11.950
it was,

753
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.170
it was really fun.

754
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.300
That's gotta be cool memory.

755
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:16.621
And I'm like,

756
00:19:16.621 --> 00:19:21.480
that is so much more difficult than the standard sign up at the open mic night.

757
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.980
I started in 88.

758
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.461
It was just,

759
00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:24.390
they had to have stitches,

760
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:25.410
whatever it open Mike night,

761
00:19:25.411 --> 00:19:25.861
you go there,

762
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:27.510
you sign up and you know,

763
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:29.700
you'd get on three or four weeks.

764
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.690
How many boom is fairly new.

765
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.053
Um,

766
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:33.923
family knew.

767
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.500
I mean,

768
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.400
when I started,

769
00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:36.234
I used to go to the,

770
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:40.140
I went to the Improv in New York in 69 and the Improv,

771
00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:41.430
them bud blow was say,

772
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:43.200
okay for singers then you,

773
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.070
because it was all Broadway singers.

774
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.130
That's all the way.

775
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.020
There really wasn't a lot of people,

776
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:53.710
the one to be comedians because most comedians in the mid to late sixties were

777
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.530
middle aged Jewish guys.

778
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.700
Like Rodney Allan King a,

779
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.880
the first new young comics were like Robert Klein,

780
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.470
Richie prior,

781
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.071
uh,

782
00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:05.904
George Carlin,

783
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.750
don't forget Richie prior we used to call him Richie.

784
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:10.584
I knew Richie,

785
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.181
Richie,

786
00:20:12.181 --> 00:20:12.901
I've never heard him.

787
00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:14.020
He say Richie prior,

788
00:20:14.021 --> 00:20:17.370
you've got to remember in New York City up to about 66,

789
00:20:17.371 --> 00:20:18.390
67,

790
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.913
uh,

791
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.870
you've got what they call a cabaret card,

792
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:23.340
which was the license.

793
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.780
You had a license to be an entertainer and if you use the full load of word on

794
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:28.530
stage,

795
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.520
a cop could come in,

796
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.331
pull your license,

797
00:20:30.331 --> 00:20:31.080
tear it up.

798
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.980
You didn't work.

799
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.360
You could not work.

800
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:38.510
Lenny Bruce really helped break that because Lenny went to trial for,

801
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:39.571
you know,

802
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.170
for that.

803
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:40.651
That's what he,

804
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:41.670
that's what he was arrested for.

805
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:42.720
He's just doing his act.

806
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.381
You know,

807
00:20:43.381 --> 00:20:44.460
he used to do a bit about,

808
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:45.200
uh,

809
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.560
if you don't like black women who,

810
00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:47.770
who would you rather have sex with?

811
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:48.490
Lena Horne

812
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.181
<v 1>or Kate Smith.</v>

813
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:49.320
Well,

814
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:54.320
Kate Smith was an enormous woman at the time and it was a funny joke and oh,

815
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:55.721
that's solid.

816
00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.580
That's a racist or that's whatever.

817
00:20:57.581 --> 00:20:58.414
You can't do that.

818
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.200
And I remember a cop pulled his license and he went to court.

819
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.110
He eventually won and they did away with the whole cabaret license thing.

820
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:09.340
So most comedians were middle aged Jewish guys and talked about that.

821
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.480
<v 0>The kids today with the long,</v>

822
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:10.731
you know what,

823
00:21:10.731 --> 00:21:13.760
I have so long to patch it to a damn tight to tell you that these kids,

824
00:21:13.761 --> 00:21:14.840
they look like a Jack Deck,

825
00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:16.150
like a jelly smelled like a John.

826
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:16.620
He's hippies.

827
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.090
I'll tell you.

828
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.960
And that was what it does.

829
00:21:17.961 --> 00:21:18.740
What guys did,

830
00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.470
nobody talks

831
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.540
<v 1>stream of consciousness.</v>

832
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.350
Nobody did what?

833
00:21:22.351 --> 00:21:22.890
Uh,

834
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.420
what Richie and,

835
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.180
and,

836
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:25.501
and,

837
00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:26.700
and George Carlin.

838
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.880
I remember George when George was just a straight stand up and then he became

839
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.460
the hippy dippy weatherman.

840
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.240
And then he,

841
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.770
he had this radical change to the George Carlin we know now,

842
00:21:37.771 --> 00:21:38.604
but he was,

843
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.920
the judge used to be in a comedy team actually.

844
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.300
Really with who?

845
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:42.751
With,

846
00:21:42.751 --> 00:21:43.584
um,

847
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.330
ah,

848
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.600
I,

849
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:44.930
I'm,

850
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.140
it's the name just escapes me,

851
00:21:46.141 --> 00:21:46.974
but uh,

852
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:47.700
I forgot.

853
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.430
But yeah,

854
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.660
<v 0>I've seen some of his early,</v>

855
00:21:49.661 --> 00:21:50.494
early stuff.

856
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.750
It's fascinating to look at him because he was such,

857
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.890
such a different guy.

858
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.141
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

859
00:21:54.141 --> 00:21:56.420
The fascinating one is also Rodney.

860
00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:01.990
Cause before Rodney had the no respect Hook because Rodney was Jack Roy for

861
00:22:03.231 --> 00:22:04.064
years.

862
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.030
Jack Roy,

863
00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:05.360
he was,

864
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.193
that's his real name.

865
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:06.530
Uh,

866
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.550
Rodney worked,

867
00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:08.743
uh,

868
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.680
and he couldn't make it and then he became an aluminum siding salesman.

869
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.150
Uh,

870
00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.000
and then he came back at age 44 is Rodney Dangerfield.

871
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.110
Rodney had a muse by the name of Joe Answers.

872
00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.140
Joe Ansys was one of those guys who was not a comedian himself,

873
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.890
cause he was too shy.

874
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.360
But it was really funny.

875
00:22:29.361 --> 00:22:30.021
He was a guy.

876
00:22:30.021 --> 00:22:33.770
All the Comedians love to hang out with because he would do table comedy.

877
00:22:33.771 --> 00:22:34.041
You know,

878
00:22:34.041 --> 00:22:38.180
you'd sit in there for four or five comics that it to canter's type place or a

879
00:22:38.181 --> 00:22:41.000
Deli at two in the morning and he would just riff and all,

880
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.750
all the comics of just sit there with pens and pencils calmed me down because he

881
00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:45.440
was so funny.

882
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.273
But he couldn't,

883
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.740
he couldn't physically bring himself to get on state.

884
00:22:48.741 --> 00:22:49.580
He just couldn't do it.

885
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:50.370
And He,

886
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:50.660
I,

887
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.600
he was a guy that hell.

888
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:52.850
I remember Rodney,

889
00:22:52.851 --> 00:22:53.510
uh,

890
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:58.510
used to do bits and when you hear one of his earlier,

891
00:22:58.551 --> 00:23:01.400
he's got a funny one about being an airline pilot where he says,

892
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.243
uh,

893
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.500
this is Rodney's joke,

894
00:23:03.501 --> 00:23:03.891
not mine.

895
00:23:03.891 --> 00:23:04.670
I was like,

896
00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:04.801
well,

897
00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:05.330
he says,

898
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.831
Hey folks,

899
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:08.330
you're looking at them with her left side of the plane and you could see the

900
00:23:08.331 --> 00:23:09.320
empire state building.

901
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.200
I look out the right side of the plane in New Jersey.

902
00:23:12.201 --> 00:23:15.440
There you can see the remains of flight four 18,

903
00:23:15.441 --> 00:23:18.230
which crashed in a fiery ball in that field over there.

904
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:19.281
Bob,

905
00:23:19.281 --> 00:23:20.210
you are with me on that one.

906
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:20.420
Why?

907
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.150
You know,

908
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.040
and I met with that,

909
00:23:23.041 --> 00:23:24.590
but all always used to make me laugh when he did that.

910
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.070
And then suddenly riding to became the hollow with the one line of guy.

911
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.650
But before that he was like a traditional comedic.

912
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.790
<v 0>So how much time did he take off in between coming back?</v>

913
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.350
It was like 10 years,

914
00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:35.730
right?

915
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.181
<v 1>Easy.</v>

916
00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:36.391
Yeah.

917
00:23:36.391 --> 00:23:37.680
He raised the family.

918
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.210
What I knew was a good guy.

919
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.740
I don't know if he ever really quick,

920
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.710
I mean he quit hitting it hard.

921
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.770
He was selling the Loma signing and doing all that kind of stuff.

922
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.730
Having a group.

923
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.481
What a great story.

924
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:51.590
How about regular job?

925
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:56.060
That's why everybody uses aluminum siding is sort of the bad job because it's a

926
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:56.930
job Rodney had,

927
00:23:56.931 --> 00:23:57.201
you know?

928
00:23:57.201 --> 00:23:58.070
But yeah,

929
00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:01.220
Rodney was a great story and I mean truly funny guy.

930
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.900
<v 2>And the fact that he came back at 44 and just became an</v>

931
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:05.810
<v 1>icon.</v>

932
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.260
Yeah.

933
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.093
Yeah.

934
00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:07.550
As a,

935
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.960
it's really an amazing story.

936
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.111
Well,

937
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:11.390
sometimes you have to grow into your act.

938
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.590
You know,

939
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.580
when you're 19 or 20 and you're a fresh faced kid,

940
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.620
you don't look like the no respect.

941
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.340
You know,

942
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.960
Rodney needed to grow into that.

943
00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:21.141
You know,

944
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:22.150
like I tell you,

945
00:24:22.151 --> 00:24:22.790
you know what the,

946
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.200
you know what the hangdog look and the tie that's too tight and the cheap shirt

947
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.900
with buttons,

948
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.340
it looked like he choked to death.

949
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:28.911
I mean,

950
00:24:28.911 --> 00:24:31.520
it was a great growing of the great comedy persona.

951
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.700
<v 2>I used to work at great woods in Mansfield.</v>

952
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.001
You know what,

953
00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:36.200
that is a show.

954
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:36.690
Yeah.

955
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.920
I was a security guard out there and I got to see a lot of acts.

956
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.440
I can see Cosby out there and Kinison.

957
00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:44.191
And,

958
00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:44.311
uh,

959
00:24:44.311 --> 00:24:45.061
when I was working,

960
00:24:45.061 --> 00:24:45.390
I got,

961
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.260
I got to see Rodney,

962
00:24:46.261 --> 00:24:46.711
and this was when,

963
00:24:46.711 --> 00:24:49.260
when Rodney was in his complete,

964
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.980
not give a fuck state,

965
00:24:50.981 --> 00:24:51.450
right.

966
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.100
Where he wore a bathrobe.

967
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.380
That's what he would go on stage with the bathroom.

968
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.600
So Rodney was backstage and,

969
00:24:57.601 --> 00:24:57.781
uh,

970
00:24:57.781 --> 00:24:58.051
you know,

971
00:24:58.051 --> 00:25:01.380
I'm working in the backstage area and you get to see Rodney,

972
00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:01.850
like there's,

973
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.150
the door was open to his dress room.

974
00:25:03.151 --> 00:25:04.290
Rodney's hanging out back there,

975
00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:04.831
walking around,

976
00:25:04.831 --> 00:25:07.020
pacing slippers on bathrobe,

977
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.180
nothing on underneath it open.

978
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:09.660
Yeah,

979
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.321
I can give a fuck.

980
00:25:10.321 --> 00:25:12.330
He's got a Dick like a horse.

981
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:12.890
Right.

982
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.430
And he's just allegedly,

983
00:25:14.431 --> 00:25:15.264
I didn't see it,

984
00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:16.410
but it was like,

985
00:25:16.411 --> 00:25:16.771
I was like,

986
00:25:16.771 --> 00:25:17.700
look at this guy.

987
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.170
Like this guy really knows it.

988
00:25:19.171 --> 00:25:21.000
Like some people will pretend to not give a fuck.

989
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.380
This guy really didn't give a fuck.

990
00:25:22.381 --> 00:25:27.150
His hair was all crazy and he would go on stage with the bathrobe and I couldn't

991
00:25:27.151 --> 00:25:27.940
believe it.

992
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.700
I was 19 at the time.

993
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.930
<v 1>Rod Rodney let me live in his,</v>

994
00:25:31.931 --> 00:25:32.620
uh,

995
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.120
it,

996
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.600
it danger fields and night club.

997
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:39.130
There was a storage closet in the back and I lived in there for a couple of

998
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:39.190
weeks.

999
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.641
Really?

1000
00:25:39.641 --> 00:25:39.941
Yeah.

1001
00:25:39.941 --> 00:25:41.480
They're just a cotton there and you,

1002
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:41.920
you know,

1003
00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.390
with piles of Sangria,

1004
00:25:43.391 --> 00:25:43.691
whatever,

1005
00:25:43.691 --> 00:25:44.720
they got to sit and it just,

1006
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.720
all the liquor and that's where I stay.

1007
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.130
You lived in danger fields?

1008
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:50.890
That's where I slept.

1009
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.180
Slept,

1010
00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.630
wander the streets during the day.

1011
00:25:52.631 --> 00:25:53.020
But yeah.

1012
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.160
Wow.

1013
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.710
I worked at club a lot when I first moved to New York.

1014
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.630
New York was an interest.

1015
00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.061
You know,

1016
00:25:58.061 --> 00:26:01.120
it's funny that when I was just getting started,

1017
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:06.220
those were the last days of the old mob clubs.

1018
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.280
They don't really have mob run joints anymore,

1019
00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.650
but those were really,

1020
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.750
really scary.

1021
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:19.210
I remember I worked a club once and the guy come up stage and then he said,

1022
00:26:19.211 --> 00:26:19.331
hey,

1023
00:26:19.331 --> 00:26:19.961
you're a funny kid.

1024
00:26:19.961 --> 00:26:22.300
And he put a hundred dollar bill in my pocket,

1025
00:26:22.301 --> 00:26:22.900
you know?

1026
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.290
And I said,

1027
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:23.601
oh,

1028
00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:24.011
well thank you.

1029
00:26:24.011 --> 00:26:25.870
So now I know I appreciate it as no,

1030
00:26:25.871 --> 00:26:26.231
please,

1031
00:26:26.231 --> 00:26:26.471
you know,

1032
00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:28.850
give it to the church or donation or something like that.

1033
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.050
He goes,

1034
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:29.130
no,

1035
00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:29.211
no,

1036
00:26:29.211 --> 00:26:30.040
you can take it.

1037
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:30.371
I said,

1038
00:26:30.371 --> 00:26:30.491
no,

1039
00:26:30.491 --> 00:26:31.110
no,

1040
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.530
no,

1041
00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:32.351
I can't do that.

1042
00:26:32.351 --> 00:26:33.151
I really didn't earn it.

1043
00:26:33.151 --> 00:26:33.461
Thank you,

1044
00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:35.080
but please give it to maybe a waitress.

1045
00:26:35.081 --> 00:26:36.040
And then he said to me,

1046
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.061
you know,

1047
00:26:37.061 --> 00:26:38.080
you're pretty smart.

1048
00:26:38.081 --> 00:26:39.880
You don't take money from people like me.

1049
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:40.930
That's very smart.

1050
00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.100
Nobody's going to bother you.

1051
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:42.810
I said,

1052
00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:43.441
okay,

1053
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:44.190
thank you sir.

1054
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.870
And I realized early on,

1055
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:50.250
the guys that got in trouble with the guys that wanted to hang with the mob guys

1056
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:50.881
and the mob guys,

1057
00:26:50.881 --> 00:26:51.070
hey,

1058
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.180
hey,

1059
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:51.760
do us a favor.

1060
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.010
Deliver this package to the hotel.

1061
00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:53.310
We,

1062
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.491
yeah,

1063
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:53.670
sure.

1064
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:53.911
Okay,

1065
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:54.600
now they're screwed.

1066
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.433
Now they're in.

1067
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.150
I remember once years ago,

1068
00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:57.810
my wife,

1069
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.890
why would I went to New York and I was working the Westchester premier theater

1070
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:04.050
and there was a guy named Jimmy the weasel fratty.

1071
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.460
You ever hear that name Jimmy?

1072
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:07.020
The weasel was look great man.

1073
00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:07.440
Yeah.

1074
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:07.950
Anyway,

1075
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.260
so these two guys museum,

1076
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.094
Mr Leno's,

1077
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.480
Mr Lenos is on the,

1078
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.811
you know,

1079
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:13.920
this is raw code as well.

1080
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:14.754
Okay.

1081
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.540
And my wife was like,

1082
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:15.630
oh,

1083
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:16.520
these guys carry,

1084
00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:16.860
you know,

1085
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:17.693
so that's the way.

1086
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.650
So we're in the back of his Cadillac,

1087
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:20.484
you know.

1088
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:22.680
So I'm teasing my wife and I just kind of whispered her,

1089
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:23.670
I didn't think the guys get him.

1090
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.480
And I said,

1091
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:24.751
you know,

1092
00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:26.180
and if I go into the city tonight,

1093
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.600
I think I'm going to need a piece.

1094
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:28.260
And this guy goes,

1095
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:28.680
oh,

1096
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.490
Mr Police,

1097
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:30.390
he takes a gun out.

1098
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.451
He throws it in the bag.

1099
00:27:31.451 --> 00:27:31.621
It was,

1100
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:32.370
please take down one.

1101
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:32.610
I said,

1102
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:32.761
<v 0>no,</v>

1103
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:33.420
I was looking at,

1104
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:33.600
no,

1105
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.140
not please.

1106
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.190
There's no numbers on it.

1107
00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:37.620
Just you don't need to do not the wooded when you're true.

1108
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:38.120
Just Jordan,

1109
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.880
the trash,

1110
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.091
you know?

1111
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:39.900
If you don't use it all,

1112
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.733
you're just throw it away.

1113
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.251
I said,

1114
00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:41.791
I don't really know.

1115
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:42.270
Please.

1116
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.300
I assist a,

1117
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:43.861
okay,

1118
00:27:43.861 --> 00:27:44.221
thank you.

1119
00:27:44.221 --> 00:27:47.220
Now I got this gun and my wife was just like sweat bullets.

1120
00:27:47.221 --> 00:27:47.820
She's like,

1121
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:48.360
we're where?

1122
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.410
What have you got me to?

1123
00:27:49.411 --> 00:27:50.244
Where are we here?

1124
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:50.490
What?

1125
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:50.720
I mean,

1126
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.600
it worked out okay,

1127
00:27:51.601 --> 00:27:53.430
but is it was just just funny.

1128
00:27:53.431 --> 00:27:53.791
You know,

1129
00:27:53.791 --> 00:27:54.624
just odd.

1130
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.021
Well,

1131
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:56.430
they ran Vegas.

1132
00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.420
They ran night clubs in New York.

1133
00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.293
Holly,

1134
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.050
how did Al that die?

1135
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:01.860
What happened?

1136
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.070
Cooperations collaborations or mean or nasty or does it not?

1137
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:06.670
Oh,

1138
00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:07.410
then,

1139
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.011
oh wait,

1140
00:28:08.011 --> 00:28:08.370
wait,

1141
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:08.671
wait,

1142
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:09.000
wait.

1143
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.631
At least a mob.

1144
00:28:09.631 --> 00:28:11.830
You got a free drink once in a while you got to go.

1145
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:12.790
Did you lose the grant?

1146
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.120
I me at the restaurant,

1147
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:15.241
go,

1148
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:15.471
whatever.

1149
00:28:15.471 --> 00:28:16.304
But no.

1150
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.460
What's the corporations come in?

1151
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:18.294
That was the end of that.

1152
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.370
That'd be a bizarre time to come up.

1153
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.520
It was really sad.

1154
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.980
You know what's really funny?

1155
00:28:22.981 --> 00:28:24.080
It's like you always see

1156
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.530
<v 1>is on TV,</v>

1157
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:29.820
but when you're confronted by true psychopaths,

1158
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.040
it is unbelievable.

1159
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:32.911
You know,

1160
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:33.200
I,

1161
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.033
um,

1162
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.300
well I told the story with Jerry one son,

1163
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:37.230
his community and coffee,

1164
00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:38.430
but I didn't hear it.

1165
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:39.150
Okay,

1166
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:39.750
I get it.

1167
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.840
I got a call one day from a Sinatra.

1168
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.101

1169
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:44.240

1173
00:28:47.881 --> 00:28:48.241
When is it,

1174
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:50.550
he gives me the day and I said,

1175
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.413

1181

I'm opening for them on that day.

1182
00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.850

1183
00:28:59.851 --> 00:29:00.684
but I can't do it.

1184
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.740
Oh,

1185
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.101

1186
00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:02.310

1187
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.610

1189
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:09.120
I get a call from Sinatra's agent,

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.080

00:29:10.291 --> 00:29:11.310
we call it a holiday house.

1193
00:29:11.311 --> 00:29:12.150
They said they don't need you.

1194
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.540
I don't need you all right.

1195
00:29:15.541 --> 00:29:16.470
Guess I'm going to Chicago.

1196
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:21.300
So I go to Chicago and it's this Italian.

1197
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:23.520
I'm not going to use any real names because if people are still around,

1198
00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.700
so it's doing this thing instead of golf course.

1199
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.750
And they say to me,

1200
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.760
listen to as a priest here,

1201
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:30.301
so can you,

1202
00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:31.350
so keep your act,

1203
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.750
you know,

1204
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.583
glean anything.

1205
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.060
I said,

1206
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:33.301
okay,

1207
00:29:33.301 --> 00:29:34.134
fine.

1208
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.360
So I got up when I do my little active find,

1209
00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:36.631
thank you.

1210
00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:36.991
Applause,

1211
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:37.860
applause to sit down.

1212
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.920
So this gangster guy gets up,

1213
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.350
you know,

1214
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.130
he goes on a welcome Y'alls to this,

1215
00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:43.973
uh,

1216
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.960
you notice his place and wasn't going to say,

1217
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:47.801
Oh shit,

1218
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:48.071
I forgot.

1219
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:48.904
I was going to say.

1220
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:49.841
And when he said Shit,

1221
00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:50.674
the priest went

1222
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.500
like this.

1223
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:53.921
The guy goes,

1224
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:54.754
wow,

1225
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.833
hey fuck,

1226
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.850
you got your 10 grand and a fucking bag.

1227
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.240
It just goes crazy on his gut

1228
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.060
and the place is just,

1229
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.673
everybody's just,

1230
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.990
just frozen with fear.

1231
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.361
This guy,

1232
00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:09.490
he's just like crazy and the priest is like,

1233
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.740
he's holding this bag with the 10 grand and you know,

1234
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:14.450
and then he sits now son,

1235
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.861
I'm sitting.

1236
00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:15.551
Then the guy come late,

1237
00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:16.384
Jay came in,

1238
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:16.661
he goes,

1239
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:17.530
let me ask you something.

1240
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.431
You know,

1241
00:30:18.431 --> 00:30:18.951
stolen,

1242
00:30:18.951 --> 00:30:19.210
right?

1243
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:19.391
I said,

1244
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:19.481
why?

1245
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:21.370
I don't know him that you rocky just come out.

1246
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:23.800
This is 1976 that I said,

1247
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:24.401
I don't know him.

1248
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:24.821
I mean,

1249
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:25.654
I met him,

1250
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.961
you know,

1251
00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:28.750
we asked them to do this dinner is benefit today.

1252
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:29.584
And he said No.

1253
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:30.843
He said No.

1254
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.900
And I said,

1255
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:32.590
well,

1256
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.940
I mean maybe he was busy.

1257
00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.840
He scratch screaming at me.

1258
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:38.390
I go,

1259
00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:39.011
you're right.

1260
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:41.170
I'm sure I'm fine.

1261
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.273
He goes up,

1262
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.263
he goes up,

1263
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:43.991
this is,

1264
00:30:43.991 --> 00:30:44.261
come on,

1265
00:30:44.261 --> 00:30:45.100
let's play some golf.

1266
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:45.610
Honestly,

1267
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:46.443
I don't really play golf,

1268
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.333
play golf.

1269
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:52.180
He's an hour and golf carts and my point in this golf cart and we drive out to

1270
00:30:52.181 --> 00:30:57.181
about the 12th hole and we get to the 12th hole and there are these kind of 50

1271
00:30:57.551 --> 00:30:58.960
60 year old prostitutes,

1272
00:30:58.961 --> 00:31:01.630
topless with leopard skin print,

1273
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.770
mini skirts,

1274
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.790
handing out drinks.

1275
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:06.610
It was like the craziest day of my life.

1276
00:31:06.611 --> 00:31:10.210
But this guy was like a true psycho criminal.

1277
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.800
I mean just one of those guys like a scene from Goodfellas.

1278
00:31:12.801 --> 00:31:13.540
They're just killing it.

1279
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:13.721
You know,

1280
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:16.510
I always loved movies where somebody threatened someone like,

1281
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:16.660
oh,

1282
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.680
you're not going to kill me Bob,

1283
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.390
cause I know you're not the kind of guy.

1284
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.080
No,

1285
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.411
no,

1286
00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:21.244
they will kill you.

1287
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.173
They will kill you.

1288
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.980
And they've just really made me laugh.

1289
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.060
Is that guy still alive?

1290
00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.100
I he may still be alive.

1291
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:28.023
Really?

1292
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:28.620
Nah,

1293
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.381
this is a while ago.

1294
00:31:29.381 --> 00:31:31.420
He's probably dead by now because he was an old guy then.

1295
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:33.190
It seems like you're kind of like,

1296
00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:34.210
that's not going to make it.

1297
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:35.020
I'll tell you.

1298
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:35.401
I'll tell you is,

1299
00:31:35.401 --> 00:31:37.530
and I know he made it through the teammates.

1300
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:38.810
Wow.

1301
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:39.850
It just hilarious.

1302
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.360
You know,

1303
00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.420
so you don't really have those.

1304
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.180
I'm sure you have to still have those guys,

1305
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:44.591
but very,

1306
00:31:44.591 --> 00:31:45.424
very rarely.

1307
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.930
They're not Italians anymore.

1308
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.570
They've moved on to other ethnic Russian,

1309
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.010
and that's how the ethnic group,

1310
00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:51.970
I'm not going to say anything.

1311
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:52.901
Well,

1312
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:53.800
there's always one,

1313
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.580
one uh,

1314
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.430
organized crime group that sort of dominates the market.

1315
00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.120
Yeah,

1316
00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:58.361
that's,

1317
00:31:58.361 --> 00:31:58.690
yeah,

1318
00:31:58.690 --> 00:31:58.911
it's,

1319
00:31:58.911 --> 00:31:59.550
it's,

1320
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.130
it just,

1321
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.560
it's just really odd.

1322
00:32:02.561 --> 00:32:03.160
It was just,

1323
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.540
it was a fun time to be a comedian because you had to weave your way through for

1324
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:06.641
the,

1325
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:06.860
you know,

1326
00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.380
more amps.

1327
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.213
Then the comic,

1328
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.180
I heard his name.

1329
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:09.370
Yeah.

1330
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.203
He used to be on the,

1331
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.070
on the Dick Van Dyke show I'm going to show.

1332
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:12.490
Yes.

1333
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:13.323
Yeah.

1334
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.900
Well he got famous because he was Al Capone's favorite comedian.

1335
00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.000
Al Capone would always come in to see him.

1336
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:19.600
Wow.

1337
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.160
So Al would put him in Al like Al Capone would put him in his clubs.

1338
00:32:24.161 --> 00:32:25.060
And that's how Maury,

1339
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.270
Maury really got famous because Al Capone loved him.

1340
00:32:28.271 --> 00:32:29.230
Thought he was hilarious.

1341
00:32:29.231 --> 00:32:30.064
You know?

1342
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.350
But imagine if you don't make Al Capone laugh.

1343
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.080
A lot of pressure.

1344
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:35.410
Yeah.

1345
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.243
Hilarious.

1346
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:38.370
But he's like,

1347
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:38.860
well we got,

1348
00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.421
we start on this.

1349
00:32:39.421 --> 00:32:40.280
Cause the comedy clubs,

1350
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.380
there weren't comedy clubs.

1351
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:44.840
There were just either jazz clubs.

1352
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:44.931
See,

1353
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:49.160
jazz clubs are great for Comedians because jazz audience is,

1354
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:49.994
listen,

1355
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.740
rock clubs were bad.

1356
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.760
And during the late sixties comedy was kind of,

1357
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:57.411
it wasn't,

1358
00:32:57.411 --> 00:32:58.760
it was the Vietnam War.

1359
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.830
College kids were very serious.

1360
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:01.663
You know,

1361
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.840
everybody do those little place where the stage is dark and when you'd like to

1362
00:33:05.841 --> 00:33:07.040
flashlight and under your Chin,

1363
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.400
stop your war machine click and they'd turn it off and then the guy would run to

1364
00:33:10.401 --> 00:33:11.360
another part of the stage.

1365
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.080
Please stop your war machine clicking through.

1366
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:13.401
You know,

1367
00:33:13.401 --> 00:33:15.140
it was all this conceptual kind of,

1368
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:18.020
so comedy was really on the back burner.

1369
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.460
It really took prior and Carlin,

1370
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.950
Robert Klein and those guys to make it really pop again for young people.

1371
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.270
What was it before that?

1372
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:26.751
I mean when,

1373
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:27.650
when were the first,

1374
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.510
they say that Mark Twain was probably the first recognize standup comedian

1375
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.940
because he used to do these monologues and readings of his war.

1376
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.351
Oh sure,

1377
00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:36.620
sure.

1378
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.510
And he would do them in front of a live audience.

1379
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.240
People would laugh.

1380
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.030
We don't stand up is like jazz.

1381
00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:43.310
It's a uniquely American art form.

1382
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:44.870
Like when you go to England,

1383
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.520
ups over there maybe come out in a dress and they sing a song to do a skit or

1384
00:33:49.521 --> 00:33:50.390
they do a little dance.

1385
00:33:50.391 --> 00:33:52.010
I mean now they have American style stand up.

1386
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.150
But the idea of,

1387
00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.660
I always liked comics would look like normal people,

1388
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:57.921
but were funny.

1389
00:33:57.921 --> 00:34:01.130
I was never a fan of the wacky props to the crazy hat.

1390
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:02.720
Like Johnny Carson,

1391
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.360
prior Cosby Kline Carlin's.

1392
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.260
These guys look like regular guys you see on the street.

1393
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.220
And then when they talked,

1394
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:10.850
oh my God,

1395
00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:11.601
they were really,

1396
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:12.434
really funny.

1397
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.900
Those?

1398
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:17.570
Is that something that really came later because most standup came out of

1399
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:18.171
Vaudeville.

1400
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:19.004
We had to,

1401
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.410
that's what my mother used to say to me all the time when I got to,

1402
00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:21.591
I did.

1403
00:34:21.591 --> 00:34:22.220
You know,

1404
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.080
no one wants someone that's funny all the time.

1405
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.560
Why don't you just thinking a little song and then you'd do a little dance and

1406
00:34:27.561 --> 00:34:28.394
then you tell a joke.

1407
00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:28.701
I go,

1408
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:28.971
okay,

1409
00:34:28.971 --> 00:34:29.211
mom.

1410
00:34:29.211 --> 00:34:29.871
That's great advice.

1411
00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:30.141
Thanks.

1412
00:34:30.141 --> 00:34:30.974
I really appreciate that.

1413
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.060
That's what they used to do,

1414
00:34:32.061 --> 00:34:32.331
right?

1415
00:34:32.331 --> 00:34:32.481
Yeah.

1416
00:34:32.481 --> 00:34:33.320
That's what they used to do.

1417
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:34.820
That's so bizarre.

1418
00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:37.340
It's so crazy that it happened in your lifetime.

1419
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:37.821
I mean,

1420
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:41.240
you went from doing those original clubs to being around,

1421
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:41.661
I mean,

1422
00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:43.460
you regularly work with a comedy and Magic Club,

1423
00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:45.020
which is like one of the biggest clubs in the country,

1424
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.350
and I've been every Sunday since 78 and when you're not there,

1425
00:34:48.351 --> 00:34:48.920
I've been there.

1426
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.461
Yeah,

1427
00:34:49.461 --> 00:34:49.680
it's,

1428
00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:49.941
it's,

1429
00:34:49.941 --> 00:34:50.390
it's,

1430
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:50.631
you know,

1431
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:51.260
I like it.

1432
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:56.260
I liked that club because it's the best mainstream audience club.

1433
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.791
You know,

1434
00:34:58.791 --> 00:35:00.320
the Hollywood clubs a great,

1435
00:35:00.321 --> 00:35:01.820
but it winds up being cliquey.

1436
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.750
You're doing,

1437
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:07.070
you know you're doing 20 minutes on a little shop on Melrose that may be a half

1438
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.140
a dozen people know about and the audience is hysterical and the rest of the

1439
00:35:09.141 --> 00:35:09.500
world's going.

1440
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.690
When you know you've got gotta,

1441
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.020
you've got to have a broader appeal and when you go to the comedy Magic Club,

1442
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.010
a lot of that audience is overnight is from the airport.

1443
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.940
They missed the plane,

1444
00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:20.241
whatever,

1445
00:35:20.241 --> 00:35:21.440
the standard of local hotel,

1446
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:21.711
oh,

1447
00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:22.580
let's go see what this is.

1448
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.170
So you got people from all over the country.

1449
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:24.831
Yeah,

1450
00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:25.641
it's a great place.

1451
00:35:25.641 --> 00:35:25.941
Anyway,

1452
00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:27.800
just Mike Lacey is just such an awesome guy.

1453
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:28.491
He's a great guy.

1454
00:35:28.491 --> 00:35:31.190
He's probably the best club one of there is one of the best of all time.

1455
00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:32.360
He's just such a sweetheart.

1456
00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.650
Just they just,

1457
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.770
it's like a trickles down from the top to the bottom.

1458
00:35:36.771 --> 00:35:37.890
All the people that work there.

1459
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.510
<v 2>It's an amazing spot.</v>

1460
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.840
But you were there for like the,

1461
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.500
do you see the Mooney movie Lenny with Dustin Hoffman and planning Bruce when

1462
00:35:46.501 --> 00:35:46.891
he,

1463
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:51.090
they show the early days of Lenny's comedy where he used to work with strippers

1464
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:54.600
and all these different acts and then tell a few jokes and be like an MC

1465
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:55.331
<v 1>honey Harlow.</v>

1466
00:35:55.331 --> 00:35:57.010
I think that he married his chipper.

1467
00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.090
You know,

1468
00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:58.990
it's interesting.

1469
00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.510
Dustin Hoffman's one of the greatest actors,

1470
00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.850
but I never bought that.

1471
00:36:03.851 --> 00:36:05.710
He was a stand up.

1472
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:06.371
You know,

1473
00:36:06.371 --> 00:36:11.371
standup is so uniquely different from acting when people act like a stand up,

1474
00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:12.431
you know,

1475
00:36:12.431 --> 00:36:14.110
I'm anxious to see Mike apps now.

1476
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.850
I heard it's going to play Richie prior.

1477
00:36:15.851 --> 00:36:18.520
It's be interesting to see because he's a comic,

1478
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.800
so he understands how that works.

1479
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.070
Actors tend to watch themselves when they're onstage.

1480
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:24.933
By that I mean,

1481
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:25.720
how do I look?

1482
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.410
I hear noodle am I come in where it's comics just perform.

1483
00:36:29.411 --> 00:36:33.760
They don't really care if their face looks funny or whatever it is.

1484
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.081
You a comic,

1485
00:36:35.081 --> 00:36:36.250
you just forming,

1486
00:36:36.251 --> 00:36:36.640
you know,

1487
00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.740
so an actors play comedians.

1488
00:36:38.741 --> 00:36:41.180
It never quite works for me as well as a comedian planet.

1489
00:36:41.181 --> 00:36:41.590
It can be done.

1490
00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:41.771
<v 2>Well,</v>

1491
00:36:41.771 --> 00:36:44.980
the worst example is the punchline with Tom Hanks and Sally fields.

1492
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:45.490
That's,

1493
00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:46.330
I didn't see that one,

1494
00:36:46.331 --> 00:36:46.961
but I heard about it.

1495
00:36:46.961 --> 00:36:47.794
Don't know.

1496
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:48.933
Save yourself.

1497
00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.860
It's one of those movies where you watch it.

1498
00:36:50.861 --> 00:36:51.041
You Go,

1499
00:36:51.041 --> 00:36:52.300
what the fuck am I looking at?

1500
00:36:52.301 --> 00:36:53.710
I'm looking at an optical illusion.

1501
00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:55.750
There's something behind the scenes here that's not really,

1502
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:56.560
it's not,

1503
00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.820
they're not really doing standup,

1504
00:36:57.821 --> 00:36:59.290
but the people are laughing hard.

1505
00:36:59.410 --> 00:36:59.741
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1506
00:36:59.741 --> 00:37:02.080
it it because it's hard to write jokes.

1507
00:37:02.081 --> 00:37:04.630
There's nothing harder than writing jokes.

1508
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.100
That's what I hate about.

1509
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:07.960
Cause whenever you watch a movie as a standup,

1510
00:37:07.961 --> 00:37:09.220
and I like a TV,

1511
00:37:09.221 --> 00:37:09.990
show it off.

1512
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.380
<v 2>So I said to him on Thursday and then the audience goes to layer.</v>

1513
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:14.580
It's not all right.

1514
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:15.630
The whole joke.

1515
00:37:15.631 --> 00:37:15.871
Okay.

1516
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:18.090
They always do that because it's hard.

1517
00:37:18.091 --> 00:37:19.180
It's hard writing Joe.

1518
00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:19.801
Not only that,

1519
00:37:19.801 --> 00:37:23.760
but a real comic is not going to want to write jokes for an actor.

1520
00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:25.110
Like if you have a good joke,

1521
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:26.190
you're writing a good juggler.

1522
00:37:26.191 --> 00:37:27.330
I'm gonna keep this one for me.

1523
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:28.160
Exactly.

1524
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:28.771
Fucking shitty.

1525
00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:29.970
One of the Tom Hanks over here.

1526
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.810
Exactly.

1527
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:31.643
Exactly.

1528
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:32.731
So you,

1529
00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:36.540
you saw the boom though in the 80s cause there was a big boom in the 80s.

1530
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:39.810
I came along like I caught the crest.

1531
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.290
I was,

1532
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.670
I was there when,

1533
00:37:41.671 --> 00:37:42.810
when I started out people are like,

1534
00:37:42.811 --> 00:37:43.121
wow,

1535
00:37:43.121 --> 00:37:45.330
I should have started out in 84 84.

1536
00:37:45.331 --> 00:37:45.960
It was amazing.

1537
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.580
I started in [inaudible] 88 and it was just like I,

1538
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.220
in Boston in particular,

1539
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:51.960
it was a pretty magical time.

1540
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.470
<v 1>It was a magical time.</v>

1541
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.333
Uh,

1542
00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:55.480
it was also,

1543
00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:58.031
you know,

1544
00:37:58.031 --> 00:38:03.031
to me you have a lot of people now that rush to the middle and then stay there

1545
00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:09.700
for 20 years and never quite get because you know,

1546
00:38:09.701 --> 00:38:10.810
I sound like an old guy here,

1547
00:38:10.811 --> 00:38:12.610
but when I started you had to work clean.

1548
00:38:12.611 --> 00:38:15.490
I mean it's really easy to take a clean joke and make it dirty.

1549
00:38:15.491 --> 00:38:19.480
It's almost impossible to take a really funny dirty joke and make it clean.

1550
00:38:19.481 --> 00:38:19.890
It just,

1551
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.070
it doesn't work.

1552
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.790
And when the punchline is some fall out of word,

1553
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.020
what do you do with that?

1554
00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:26.831
What do you go with it?

1555
00:38:26.831 --> 00:38:30.670
You can't take it past a certain point if you're trying to get on television.

1556
00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:31.751
Well,

1557
00:38:31.751 --> 00:38:34.930
if you trying to get on television and you're trying to get any corporate work,

1558
00:38:34.931 --> 00:38:36.220
you this two Americas,

1559
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:37.054
there really are.

1560
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.320
There's one over here and one over here and if you can have a foot in both of

1561
00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:42.154
them,

1562
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.540
you can do really well.

1563
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:44.471
For example,

1564
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:45.820
most corporate dates,

1565
00:38:45.821 --> 00:38:46.900
we'll pay you

1566
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:53.490
10 weeks worth of comedy club salaries in one night if you can just work clean

1567
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:54.670
and,

1568
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.630
and by working clean,

1569
00:38:55.631 --> 00:38:58.540
I just mean no four letter words and you can talk politics,

1570
00:38:58.541 --> 00:38:59.710
you can do whatever you want,

1571
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:04.980
but the number of comics that can't get past a certain point because they hit

1572
00:39:05.321 --> 00:39:06.040
that wall,

1573
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:06.311
you know,

1574
00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:08.910
they rush right up to it and it's,

1575
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.480
it's like horse power.

1576
00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:12.310
It's like being an athlete.

1577
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.140
Plenty of guys can play football.

1578
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.020
How many can get it past that certain,

1579
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:17.351
you know,

1580
00:39:17.351 --> 00:39:19.000
the average athlete is what?

1581
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:21.410
One in 10,000 and the average superstars,

1582
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:26.230
what one and two or 300,000 and if you want to be that superstar,

1583
00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:27.010
you've got to work.

1584
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.130
You've got to appeal to a more of a mass audience.

1585
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.540
That's an interesting way of looking at it.

1586
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.990
A lot of people would disagree and they would say that all they want to do is do

1587
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:37.780
the best comedy or the best art that they can come up with.

1588
00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:41.020
And it's not necessarily something that a corporation is going to want a

1589
00:39:41.021 --> 00:39:41.380
highway.

1590
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.213
I'm not saying but what,

1591
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.080
no,

1592
00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.320
I think you're missing my point.

1593
00:39:44.321 --> 00:39:48.040
What I'm saying is what most people do is they want to play the audience where

1594
00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:49.300
they get the best laugh.

1595
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:50.440
Okay.

1596
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.430
I just go,

1597
00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:52.930
I just do colleges.

1598
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.510
I just do hip little cool places.

1599
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:56.650
You know,

1600
00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:57.483
I,

1601
00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:02.380
a couple of times I booked myself into oral Roberts University ones just to see

1602
00:40:02.381 --> 00:40:05.320
if I could play the Gig just as a challenge,

1603
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.340
just as a challenge,

1604
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:07.930
like setting up for a triathlon.

1605
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.001
And it is,

1606
00:40:09.001 --> 00:40:09.834
it is.

1607
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.713
And you know,

1608
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:11.270
you know,

1609
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:12.970
a perfect example of that was,

1610
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.230
uh,

1611
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.520
when Richie prior was getting ready to do is live in the sunset strip

1612
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:20.730
movie.

1613
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:21.700
Movio stand up.

1614
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:26.920
I asked them could I follow Richie every single night and Richie would go up for

1615
00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:27.850
90 minutes,

1616
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.730
just blow the room out at the comedy store.

1617
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.740
I mean people falling down.

1618
00:40:32.741 --> 00:40:34.480
I mean it was the greatest thing we've ever seen.

1619
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.740
And then I would go on and I realized at that point instead of having an hour's

1620
00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:39.790
worth of funding material,

1621
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:45.220
I had about 18 minutes because I was following the greatest comic in the world.

1622
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:48.460
And my good stuff was okay,

1623
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:50.910
my okay stuff was in my,

1624
00:40:50.911 --> 00:40:52.390
and stuff was terrible.

1625
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:56.230
But if you just play rooms where everybody laughs at everything you say,

1626
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:57.670
you never get any better.

1627
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:58.240
You know?

1628
00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.160
I remember Robin Williams once said to me,

1629
00:41:00.161 --> 00:41:00.401
he said,

1630
00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:01.450
I'm going to do some stuff tonight.

1631
00:41:01.451 --> 00:41:03.250
We watch it and okay.

1632
00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.510
And they laid that this was the height of Mork and Mindy Lane Gentlemen,

1633
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.210
Robin Williams.

1634
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:07.810
Oh,

1635
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:08.260
the crowd.

1636
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.580
And no matter what Robin said,

1637
00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.050
hilarious.

1638
00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.320
And Robin came off and he said any of that new stuff?

1639
00:41:14.321 --> 00:41:14.630
Funny?

1640
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:15.130
I said,

1641
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:15.400
Eh,

1642
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.330
not really.

1643
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.951
Well it wasn't,

1644
00:41:17.951 --> 00:41:20.200
it wasn't because they were reacting to Robin.

1645
00:41:20.201 --> 00:41:21.034
The phenomenon.

1646
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.640
I mean,

1647
00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.830
obviously Robin could put a twist on it.

1648
00:41:23.831 --> 00:41:26.090
I'm not putting down Robin's a tuner and I'm just saying I know,

1649
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.570
but he knew after listening to it,

1650
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.400
which part of it really was funny,

1651
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:31.270
what wasn't.

1652
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.000
So the idea of eyeballs on one

1653
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.521
<v 0>of those people.</v>

1654
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:35.450
If you're a comic,

1655
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.410
you should be able to play any type of audience.

1656
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:40.671
If you're a fighter,

1657
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:42.620
you should be able to fight anybody.

1658
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.220
Right now,

1659
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.120
I only flight tall,

1660
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:44.990
skinny black guys.

1661
00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:45.200
No,

1662
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:45.320
no,

1663
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.070
no,

1664
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.400
no,

1665
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.180
no.

1666
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.740
You should be able to play any kind of room.

1667
00:41:49.741 --> 00:41:51.050
So whenever I hear comics say,

1668
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.550
well I don't do that,

1669
00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:53.420
or you know,

1670
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:54.320
people are people,

1671
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.190
you know that.

1672
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.660
That's pretty much what it is.

1673
00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:57.621
Yeah,

1674
00:41:57.621 --> 00:41:58.041
there's a,

1675
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:00.580
there's definitely like clicks in la live.

1676
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:04.280
There's people that only like to do alternative rooms and you know,

1677
00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:08.000
which are much more accepting of very bland.

1678
00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:08.943
It's fine.

1679
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.891
Hey,

1680
00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:10.970
I'm not putting it down.

1681
00:42:10.971 --> 00:42:12.500
There's nothing wrong with that.

1682
00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.300
But when you don't make it,

1683
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.130
you can't blame it on,

1684
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.120
well,

1685
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.590
the IRS on people go,

1686
00:42:18.591 --> 00:42:18.801
well,

1687
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:20.330
this audience was really stupid.

1688
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:20.871
No,

1689
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:21.501
they're not.

1690
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:22.340
They're not stupid.

1691
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.200
You just didn't get your point across.

1692
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.741
You know,

1693
00:42:24.741 --> 00:42:28.950
a lot of comedians want to impress an audience with how much they know now

1694
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:29.720
itself.

1695
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.351
They'll say,

1696
00:42:30.351 --> 00:42:30.531
ah,

1697
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:32.330
the anthropomorphic tendencies.

1698
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:32.901
You know,

1699
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:35.120
why don't you just say you have a nice hot dogs are like,

1700
00:42:35.121 --> 00:42:36.230
people act like humans.

1701
00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:36.501
Okay,

1702
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:37.520
now I know what you're talking about.

1703
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:37.820
Okay.

1704
00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.710
If you don't know what anthropomorphic means,

1705
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.030
the job's not going to work.

1706
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.850
But you want to impress everybody how smart you are by throwing out

1707
00:42:43.851 --> 00:42:44.630
anthropomorphic.

1708
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.871
You know,

1709
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:46.610
comedians sometimes always have,

1710
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:47.600
um,

1711
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.150
an underlying thing they want to get some point across.

1712
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.850
I remember a comedian was another,

1713
00:42:51.851 --> 00:42:54.080
the tonight show once and his opening line was,

1714
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:54.861
you know,

1715
00:42:54.861 --> 00:42:56.720
I'm a Liberal Democrat and I said to him,

1716
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.063
don't open.

1717
00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:58.230
Why,

1718
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.540
don't just do the material.

1719
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:03.770
We will figure out your politics within a minute and a half of your set.

1720
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.180
But when you say to yourself,

1721
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.230
here's what I am,

1722
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.360
you've already lost half the crowd.

1723
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.290
I mean,

1724
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.380
I don't think most people could figure out my politics from the monologue

1725
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:16.370
because I tried to humiliate and degrade everybody equally.

1726
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:17.720
So one night,

1727
00:43:17.721 --> 00:43:18.010
oh,

1728
00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:19.370
I know you and your Republican friends,

1729
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.990
well Linda,

1730
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.350
you and your democratic buddies.

1731
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:21.430
Oh,

1732
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.060
hope you're happy what you said about Mr. Bush.

1733
00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:23.480
You know,

1734
00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.480
so that was the perfect thing when I got complaints on both sides.

1735
00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:30.680
What you were doing back then to buy by going to these different bars,

1736
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.860
you kind of had to have a bulletproof act.

1737
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.460
He kind of had to have an act that would work on virtually any kind of a club.

1738
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:38.541
Yeah,

1739
00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:39.770
that's what you tried to do.

1740
00:43:39.771 --> 00:43:40.011
I mean,

1741
00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:40.791
it didn't always work.

1742
00:43:40.791 --> 00:43:42.650
I'm not making this all was worried,

1743
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.260
but she kind of had to formulate something.

1744
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:49.010
And the real trick was when you get famous somewhere,

1745
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.180
get the hell out of there.

1746
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:50.901
I mean,

1747
00:43:50.901 --> 00:43:54.140
I knew so many great comics in Boston that were really funny,

1748
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.750
but their material was all about what happens in Boston.

1749
00:43:57.751 --> 00:44:00.830
And then they go to Connecticut or New York and it didn't work.

1750
00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.250
They don't,

1751
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.061
it doesn't work.

1752
00:44:02.061 --> 00:44:02.571
So to me,

1753
00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:03.560
once I realized,

1754
00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:04.460
Oh,

1755
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.020
I'm getting kind of a name for me here.

1756
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:08.060
I've got to go someplace where nobody knows who I am.

1757
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.960
And then I would go to the next place and start all over again.

1758
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.230
That's amazing that you knew that though at the time you could feel it,

1759
00:44:15.231 --> 00:44:19.640
you know old view 2021 and you see it already figured that out.

1760
00:44:19.641 --> 00:44:23.000
When you're talking 21 you know this comics are inherently lazy.

1761
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.650
They go to when the laughs,

1762
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:25.910
I'm just gonna play that room.

1763
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.380
You know I do better there.

1764
00:44:27.381 --> 00:44:27.950
They,

1765
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:28.611
they know me.

1766
00:44:28.611 --> 00:44:29.810
They like my stuff there.

1767
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:31.890
But why don't you go to the room where you suck?

1768
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:32.100
Because

1769
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.040
<v 1>if you can get big laughs in the room where you suck right now,</v>

1770
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:36.360
you have two rooms you can go to.

1771
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.440
Now you've got three.

1772
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:38.723
I mean,

1773
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:42.380
I saw the pride myself on being able to play any kind of Gig.

1774
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:43.583
What's the Gig?

1775
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.513
This Bible,

1776
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.630
the only,

1777
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:50.630
the only one that was really bad was I did a Christian farmers and I realized,

1778
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.621
Oh my God,

1779
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:55.610
things I wouldn't even thought the least bit objectionable were Gel.

1780
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.481
Just horrible.

1781
00:44:56.481 --> 00:44:56.740
My rent.

1782
00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:57.181
Okay.

1783
00:44:57.181 --> 00:44:57.511
I'm like,

1784
00:44:57.511 --> 00:44:58.620
what do you remember?

1785
00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.121
Oh,

1786
00:44:59.121 --> 00:44:59.490
I,

1787
00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:00.323
yeah,

1788
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.410
what was I talking to?

1789
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.320
Just Christian farmers.

1790
00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:03.550
Yeah.

1791
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:04.560
That was the audience,

1792
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:04.951
you know,

1793
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:06.140
it was just a,

1794
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:09.840
I can't remember what the jokes were,

1795
00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:10.291
but just,

1796
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:11.124
you know,

1797
00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.580
and he couldn't do a joke about masturbation,

1798
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:14.221
anything,

1799
00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:14.611
you know,

1800
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:17.000
just things that were normal everyday.

1801
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.630
Now that was horrible that,

1802
00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.071
that one,

1803
00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:20.904
I misread it.

1804
00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.100
<v 2>I notice in Boston when I started doing road gigs that I had all this great</v>

1805
00:45:25.101 --> 00:45:29.270
material that I could use in town that was a local stuff about like say girls

1806
00:45:29.271 --> 00:45:33.410
from revere with their crazy hairdos curls from revere.

1807
00:45:33.411 --> 00:45:34.730
We're known for having these,

1808
00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:36.110
what we call bulletproof hair.

1809
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:40.190
They would have fucking sprayed hair that was like a mile high.

1810
00:45:40.191 --> 00:45:44.330
It was like this crazy time in the 80s where they had these giant hairdos.

1811
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:44.720
Yeah.

1812
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.170
And I would,

1813
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:47.810
it was a great bit in town and Boston.

1814
00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:48.321
I would do that bit.

1815
00:45:48.321 --> 00:45:49.154
It would kill,

1816
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.210
I would go to Connecticut.

1817
00:45:50.211 --> 00:45:51.840
It would just die a vicious hall.

1818
00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:52.760
You're talking about this,

1819
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:55.640
my best pitch ever worked at Beach Kolmar and over here?

1820
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:57.081
No,

1821
00:45:57.081 --> 00:45:57.620
I never,

1822
00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.453
I don't think

1823
00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.390
<v 1>just clothes.</v>

1824
00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:03.170
I worked at place back in the early seventies.

1825
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:03.641
And,

1826
00:46:03.641 --> 00:46:04.310
uh,

1827
00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:05.240
I remember the guy said to me,

1828
00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:05.391
hey,

1829
00:46:05.391 --> 00:46:06.224
when you come in,

1830
00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.540
don't worry your best clothes,

1831
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:09.170
what?

1832
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:11.000
It just don't wait your best clothes.

1833
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.600
I go,

1834
00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.433
why?

1835
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:14.730
I kind of forgot it.

1836
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:15.893
So I,

1837
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.330
I want my best clothes.

1838
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.671
All right?

1839
00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:21.430
So I'm on stage and I realized that people in the front road,

1840
00:46:21.431 --> 00:46:24.680
they'd smoked the cigarettes down to the butt and then they flick an action,

1841
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.573
you know?

1842
00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:28.670
So I'm on stage once and one lands on my shoulder,

1843
00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:29.923
you know,

1844
00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.910
and I don't see it,

1845
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:34.970
but I hear as I'm setting the joke up,

1846
00:46:34.971 --> 00:46:36.260
I hear people laughing and I go,

1847
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.441
oh,

1848
00:46:36.441 --> 00:46:37.520
I'm doing pretty good.

1849
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:38.383
And I look up,

1850
00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:42.200
I look at my jackets on fire because this guy had flicked a cigarette,

1851
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:43.610
it caught fire.

1852
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:45.230
And then the guy said to me afterwards,

1853
00:46:45.231 --> 00:46:46.550
I told you about the way a good clothes.

1854
00:46:46.551 --> 00:46:46.821
I said,

1855
00:46:46.821 --> 00:46:46.970
Don,

1856
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:47.210
right,

1857
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:48.140
I'll do that next time.

1858
00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.100
It just made me laugh.

1859
00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.280
Jesus Christ.

1860
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.133
So it was funny.

1861
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:54.070
<v 2>Joey Cole had told me he was doing pips in Brooklyn once.</v>

1862
00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:54.791
And,

1863
00:46:54.791 --> 00:46:55.150
uh,

1864
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:58.480
there was a guy that was sitting in the front row that kept telling them,

1865
00:46:58.481 --> 00:46:59.590
fuck you,

1866
00:46:59.591 --> 00:47:00.011
fuck,

1867
00:47:00.011 --> 00:47:01.000
I fucking hate you.

1868
00:47:01.001 --> 00:47:01.660
You're not funny.

1869
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.690
And then you'd show him his gun that you lift up his shirt and show him his gun.

1870
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:05.321
And then,

1871
00:47:05.321 --> 00:47:05.620
you know,

1872
00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:05.890
Joe,

1873
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:06.730
you know Joey Cole,

1874
00:47:06.731 --> 00:47:06.880
it,

1875
00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:07.471
they know Joey.

1876
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:07.960
I put Joe,

1877
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:08.780
he's a sweetheart.

1878
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:09.071
He's like,

1879
00:47:09.071 --> 00:47:09.551
hey,

1880
00:47:09.551 --> 00:47:09.941
how are,

1881
00:47:09.941 --> 00:47:10.540
Ya know,

1882
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.950
he's like real like high energy,

1883
00:47:11.951 --> 00:47:12.970
real happy guy.

1884
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:15.550
And this guy just showing him his gun and saying,

1885
00:47:15.551 --> 00:47:16.384
fuck you.

1886
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:17.021
<v 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1887
00:47:17.021 --> 00:47:19.030
there's just things that you don't.

1888
00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.490
I had so many nights,

1889
00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.770
I had so many nightmare gigs.

1890
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:29.760
One of my worst was a opening for Tom Jones for two every night in Vegas was two

1891
00:47:30.971 --> 00:47:31.804
weeks.

1892
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:37.210
So I get there the army night and I walk out and there were 300 women or maybe

1893
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:39.490
350 women in the Tom Jones fan club.

1894
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:45.060
And they bought tickets to every show and they had assigned seats.

1895
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:49.840
So I walk out the first night and then I see these 300 women in the first 10,

1896
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:50.740
15 rows.

1897
00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:51.630
Uh,

1898
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:52.810
there's a dinner show then.

1899
00:47:52.811 --> 00:47:53.470
So it wasn't,

1900
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.580
it wasn't theater seating like,

1901
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.410
no.

1902
00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.243
Okay.

1903
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.730
I do my hack and I do.

1904
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:58.833
Okay,

1905
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.800
terrible.

1906
00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.760
Not real good.

1907
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:01.623
Okay.

1908
00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:07.050
I got the second night and the same women are in the same seats and it,

1909
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.590
I'm doing the same act.

1910
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:10.323
I get nothing.

1911
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.010
Okay.

1912
00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:14.240
<v 0>By show nine it's like,</v>

1913
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:15.103
hey Mary,

1914
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.681
hey sue,

1915
00:48:15.681 --> 00:48:16.260
how are you doing?

1916
00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.093
I go,

1917
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.570
it's the same 300 women every single month.

1918
00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.950
And in their mind,

1919
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:26.700
you see me being onstage is less time that Tom's doing right now.

1920
00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.171
They don't get,

1921
00:48:27.171 --> 00:48:28.820
the concept is an opening act,

1922
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:34.170
<v 1>but the most humiliating part was I come off stage and I'm like,</v>

1923
00:48:34.171 --> 00:48:34.301
God,

1924
00:48:34.301 --> 00:48:35.090
this is awful.

1925
00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:38.240
And I walk out through the front and this girl goes,

1926
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.021
hey,

1927
00:48:39.021 --> 00:48:39.854
great show.

1928
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:40.220
I said,

1929
00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:40.700
oh,

1930
00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.330
thank you.

1931
00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.460
She looks at me like I said,

1932
00:48:43.461 --> 00:48:43.821
thank you.

1933
00:48:43.821 --> 00:48:44.690
Thank you very much.

1934
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:46.371
I said,

1935
00:48:46.371 --> 00:48:47.204
how are you good.

1936
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.020
I see I'm to get a bite.

1937
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:50.390
Sure.

1938
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.860
Okay.

1939
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.830
So I'm talking to this girl for a few minutes and she's,

1940
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.230
I see she's getting a patient,

1941
00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:54.440
you know,

1942
00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.273
tapping.

1943
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:55.841
She said,

1944
00:48:55.841 --> 00:48:56.260
look,

1945
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.093
uh,

1946
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:59.500
we going upstairs or what are not,

1947
00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:00.773
what?

1948
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.971
<v 0>Well,</v>

1949
00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.950
I realized she was a hooker work in the room,

1950
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:03.960
but she said,

1951
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.601
good show.

1952
00:49:04.601 --> 00:49:06.190
I thought she'd seen the show.

1953
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:06.941
She just said,

1954
00:49:06.941 --> 00:49:08.500
good show to anybody that walked out.

1955
00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:09.040
I said,

1956
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.161
Oh,

1957
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:10.060
you didn't see the shelf?

1958
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:10.640
No.

1959
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.200
Well you,

1960
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:11.500
I said,

1961
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:11.621
Oh,

1962
00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:12.454
I'm the guy.

1963
00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.413
Oh,

1964
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:14.261
you know,

1965
00:49:14.261 --> 00:49:14.551
I like what?

1966
00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:14.711
I'm like,

1967
00:49:14.711 --> 00:49:15.940
I don't want to buy a hooker.

1968
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:17.000
I just like,

1969
00:49:17.001 --> 00:49:17.831
you're wasting my time.

1970
00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:19.360
And then she stomps out and that whole thing,

1971
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:20.530
the whole coffee shop like a little,

1972
00:49:20.531 --> 00:49:21.364
the guy couldn't again.

1973
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:22.480
How bad is that guy?

1974
00:49:22.481 --> 00:49:23.540
That hooker walked down on it,

1975
00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:24.240
so it's,

1976
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.070
it's a horrible,

1977
00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:25.510
it's just,

1978
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:26.380
what year was this?

1979
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:26.621
Oh,

1980
00:49:26.621 --> 00:49:27.910
76 yeah.

1981
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.220
I would love to go back in time to those days.

1982
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.091
God,

1983
00:49:31.091 --> 00:49:33.070
I would love to go back just to see what it was like.

1984
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:33.521
Well,

1985
00:49:33.521 --> 00:49:35.410
there wasn't really any different than now.

1986
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:35.771
I mean,

1987
00:49:35.771 --> 00:49:37.290
you're on stage with a microphone.

1988
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.170
It really wasn't

1989
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.290
<v 1>okay.</v>

1990
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:40.490
<v 0>A whole lot different.</v>

1991
00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.120
I mean,

1992
00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.100
the culture must have been so different.

1993
00:49:43.101 --> 00:49:44.240
The culture was different.

1994
00:49:44.241 --> 00:49:44.571
You know,

1995
00:49:44.571 --> 00:49:46.020
Freddy Prince was a good friend of mine.

1996
00:49:46.021 --> 00:49:46.930
Do you remember for any pants?

1997
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.110
Right in front of,

1998
00:49:48.111 --> 00:49:50.690
used to stay with me when he worked the playboy Chico and the man,

1999
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.660
<v 1>when the men played the Playboy Club in Boston,</v>

2000
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.670
and they are the playboy.

2001
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.770
He had to do six shows a night.

2002
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:58.900
You had the penthouse in the playroom.

2003
00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.120
And I remember I had to,

2004
00:50:01.121 --> 00:50:03.100
there was a singer and I had,

2005
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.170
I would open and then she would take her band to come upset and it would pass in

2006
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:11.620
the hallway and she'd be carrying these drum sets because the musicians,

2007
00:50:11.621 --> 00:50:12.720
they don't have to move around and drove.

2008
00:50:12.721 --> 00:50:16.390
Singer has to move the drums and big sweat stains under her arms and she'd be in

2009
00:50:16.391 --> 00:50:17.740
tears by the fourth show.

2010
00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:19.690
She just looked like she'd been beat up.

2011
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:20.680
But anyway,

2012
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:25.680
Freddy's onstage and he's talking about Nixon and he said,

2013
00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.130
I think the joke he said that President Nixon,

2014
00:50:28.131 --> 00:50:28.490
whatever,

2015
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:28.671
blah,

2016
00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:29.810
blah blah in this guy.

2017
00:50:29.811 --> 00:50:30.441
And you wanted to say,

2018
00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:31.460
you watch your mouth,

2019
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:32.360
you know,

2020
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:32.831
it's a Predator,

2021
00:50:32.831 --> 00:50:33.664
the United States.

2022
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.720
And Fred,

2023
00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.400
uh,

2024
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.233
what did he said?

2025
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.011
Uh,

2026
00:50:37.011 --> 00:50:38.060
Nixon doesn't

2027
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:40.970
something through something.

2028
00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:41.804
He sucks.

2029
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:41.991
Well,

2030
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:43.250
this guy takes out a gun.

2031
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.711
That's fine.

2032
00:50:44.711 --> 00:50:45.800
It over Freddy's head,

2033
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:46.130
you know,

2034
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:49.730
he's a shooting into the car and the whole club just hits the ground,

2035
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:50.181
you know,

2036
00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:50.750
just,

2037
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:53.840
just crazy stuff that really doesn't happen a whole lot anymore.

2038
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:54.790
Where was this?

2039
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:55.623
<v 2>What club was this?</v>

2040
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:57.251
Boston.

2041
00:50:57.251 --> 00:50:57.760
Wow.

2042
00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.000
Yeah.

2043
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:58.750
Yeah.

2044
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:59.830
Jesus Christ.

2045
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:01.490
<v 1>Play fight clubs are actually great.</v>

2046
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.271
You know,

2047
00:51:02.271 --> 00:51:03.440
people may exist anymore.

2048
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.753
They still do.

2049
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.021
But you have no,

2050
00:51:06.021 --> 00:51:06.860
I give him credit.

2051
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:08.570
He was the first guy.

2052
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.021
No,

2053
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:12.320
he was the first guy to let blacks walked through the front door,

2054
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:14.120
that club and play in the club.

2055
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:15.350
Get Gregory,

2056
00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:16.730
Louie Armstrong,

2057
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.690
all these acts.

2058
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.880
He treated them as equals,

2059
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.070
which today you think was no,

2060
00:51:22.071 --> 00:51:22.910
in the old days,

2061
00:51:22.911 --> 00:51:24.650
black performance had to go in through the kitchen.

2062
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:25.731
Half always.

2063
00:51:25.731 --> 00:51:29.020
You came in through the front door and you were treated with respect.

2064
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:30.920
If anybody's said anything racial and got nature,

2065
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.000
you've got thrown out of the club.

2066
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.690
So he was really sort of a pioneer and being,

2067
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.170
uh,

2068
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.720
you know,

2069
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.330
equality for performance.

2070
00:51:38.331 --> 00:51:39.200
So I always,

2071
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.990
I mean I've done a million Hugh Hefner jokes is everybody has,

2072
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.060
but um,

2073
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.420
I always give him credit for that.

2074
00:51:44.421 --> 00:51:44.691
He was a,

2075
00:51:44.691 --> 00:51:45.680
he was really great that way.

2076
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.111
<v 2>Well,</v>

2077
00:51:46.111 --> 00:51:46.591
he certainly,

2078
00:51:46.591 --> 00:51:49.050
he's always been on sort of the cutting edge socially.

2079
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.200
I know certain scenes.

2080
00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.253
<v 1>No,</v>

2081
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:54.060
no,

2082
00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:55.810
it just seems like it's kind of silly,

2083
00:51:55.811 --> 00:51:56.440
but yeah,

2084
00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.273
but back in the day,

2085
00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.100
<v 2>well it's a hard gig to hold on to,</v>

2086
00:51:59.250 --> 00:51:59.461
you know,

2087
00:51:59.461 --> 00:52:02.400
he was at the Disneyland recently and uh,

2088
00:52:02.401 --> 00:52:02.821
I was,

2089
00:52:02.821 --> 00:52:03.390
uh,

2090
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.631
you know,

2091
00:52:03.631 --> 00:52:04.111
Disneyland,

2092
00:52:04.111 --> 00:52:07.110
they give you that VIP pass if you're a famous person,

2093
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.820
you had to go through the exits.

2094
00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:09.121
Right,

2095
00:52:09.121 --> 00:52:09.270
right.

2096
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:10.620
I didn't know about that back then.

2097
00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.491
And so he,

2098
00:52:11.491 --> 00:52:11.820
uh,

2099
00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.490
had gotten into the ride before,

2100
00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:14.730
you know,

2101
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:15.780
he hadn't gotten to the line,

2102
00:52:15.781 --> 00:52:17.760
they just sort of walked him into the back door.

2103
00:52:17.761 --> 00:52:21.360
So all of a sudden he was there with like this captain's hat on with these two

2104
00:52:21.361 --> 00:52:22.310
girls that just had their,

2105
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:24.180
their faces spray painted on.

2106
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.021
And I was like,

2107
00:52:25.021 --> 00:52:27.270
this is the oddest thing that this guy does.

2108
00:52:27.271 --> 00:52:28.560
It's just so odd.

2109
00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:29.260
Yeah.

2110
00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.230
It does seem fun.

2111
00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.440
So old.

2112
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.880
And yet he's still hanging around.

2113
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.730
I'm like trying to piece it together for like the next hour.

2114
00:52:35.731 --> 00:52:39.620
Like does he enjoy this still or is this just like a publicity angle?

2115
00:52:39.621 --> 00:52:39.721
Okay.

2116
00:52:39.721 --> 00:52:39.980
Okay.

2117
00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:40.330
<v 1>Funny Story.</v>

2118
00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:41.790
Back in [inaudible] 76,

2119
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:43.140
uh,

2120
00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:47.580
Schwartzenegger and I get invited to have 25th anniversary party.

2121
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:51.340
A comfortable mentioned drew and so arm,

2122
00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:55.320
like I knew Arnold and Arnold was enormous then he was like twice the size he is

2123
00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:57.690
that the hanging around.

2124
00:52:57.691 --> 00:52:58.170
And uh,

2125
00:52:58.170 --> 00:52:59.080
I have says to me,

2126
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.600
Jerry,

2127
00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.310
would you like to have lunch with the girls with the girls?

2128
00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.173
I said,

2129
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:03.601
sure,

2130
00:53:03.601 --> 00:53:04.081
that'd be great,

2131
00:53:04.081 --> 00:53:04.914
Ms Definition.

2132
00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:06.383
So I,

2133
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.900
I go into this dining room and it's a beautiful mansion,

2134
00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:11.490
but it looks like a frat house.

2135
00:53:11.491 --> 00:53:11.821
You know,

2136
00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.790
it's all the wood is chipped in dented.

2137
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:14.624
And when the parties,

2138
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.410
there's a big long table,

2139
00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.273
no chairs,

2140
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.860
about a half a dozen of the playboy bunnies hanging around,

2141
00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:20.231
you know,

2142
00:53:20.231 --> 00:53:20.971
in street clothes.

2143
00:53:20.971 --> 00:53:21.804
I was,

2144
00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:26.930
and this Butler guy walks in with the biggest bucket of Kentucky fried chicken

2145
00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:29.640
I'd ever seen it look like a trashcan.

2146
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:33.420
You just puts it down and all the girls dive in and grab a piece of chicken.

2147
00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:33.721
I said,

2148
00:53:33.721 --> 00:53:34.081
really?

2149
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:34.680
This is the

2150
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.910
<v 2>and playboy and lifestyle.</v>

2151
00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:36.690
This is,

2152
00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:37.080
wow.

2153
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:37.913
Pretty cool.

2154
00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:41.190
Just od a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

2155
00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:44.970
Like a garbage can full of feeds him like the way you would feed chickens.

2156
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:48.020
Feed my own checkout serious.

2157
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.760
I'll just put the food out and they all just,

2158
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:51.613
there you go.

2159
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:53.761
That's a,

2160
00:53:53.761 --> 00:53:55.260
that's a weird place.

2161
00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.180
They,

2162
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:57.630
if you go by the grotto,

2163
00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.400
they still have the old phones.

2164
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:00.410
Like the whole been there.

2165
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:01.263
Yeah.

2166
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:02.690
<v 1>A buddy of mine went there.</v>

2167
00:54:02.691 --> 00:54:03.410
This is like,

2168
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:04.430
it sounds like an old joke,

2169
00:54:04.431 --> 00:54:05.264
but it's a funny story.

2170
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:06.441
So he goes,

2171
00:54:06.441 --> 00:54:08.660
he's never been before and it's like really nervous.

2172
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:12.710
So he's walking down by the grotto and he sees a couple of girls naked in the

2173
00:54:12.711 --> 00:54:13.041
pool.

2174
00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:14.360
So he hides behind a tree

2175
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:18.010
<v 2>and he's watching and he's watching them die.</v>

2176
00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.850
He's watching him and he saw narrows.

2177
00:54:20.851 --> 00:54:22.560
He takes out a cigarette smoking

2178
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:24.110
<v 1>and security walks up,</v>

2179
00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:24.631
grabs and goes,

2180
00:54:24.631 --> 00:54:25.080
hey,

2181
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:25.790
no smoking.

2182
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:26.623
Huh?

2183
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:28.650
<v 2>He just thought he'd get busted.</v>

2184
00:54:28.651 --> 00:54:28.801
No,

2185
00:54:28.801 --> 00:54:30.000
he got busted for smoking.

2186
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:31.110
It just made me laugh.

2187
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:32.100
That is pretty funny.

2188
00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:32.953
Just so stupid.

2189
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:33.290
The,

2190
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:34.380
I was there for a,

2191
00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:35.214
I hosted him.

2192
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:38.010
It was either marijuana policy project or normal,

2193
00:54:38.011 --> 00:54:38.870
I can't remember who a,

2194
00:54:38.871 --> 00:54:39.421
who had about,

2195
00:54:39.421 --> 00:54:40.290
I hosted this,

2196
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:40.991
this,

2197
00:54:40.991 --> 00:54:41.190
uh,

2198
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:42.300
event that they had there,

2199
00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:43.740
a fundraising event.

2200
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:47.990
And it was just very strange to be around the grotto and just to,

2201
00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:49.203
to be in this place.

2202
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:52.650
It just to think of all the things that have happened in that place out of odd,

2203
00:54:52.651 --> 00:54:52.951
you know,

2204
00:54:52.951 --> 00:54:54.390
you've got a lot of old guys,

2205
00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:54.840
guys,

2206
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.450
guys my age now and girls are going,

2207
00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.350
oh look what James Francisco's gave me.

2208
00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:58.561
Oh,

2209
00:54:58.561 --> 00:54:59.371
it's a beautiful ring.

2210
00:54:59.371 --> 00:54:59.581
You know,

2211
00:54:59.581 --> 00:55:00.031
whatever it is.

2212
00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:02.940
Just some old movie star from the 80s you know,

2213
00:55:02.941 --> 00:55:03.560
hilarious.

2214
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.590
Just hanging on,

2215
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:05.880
trying their best.

2216
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:06.841
Well,

2217
00:55:06.841 --> 00:55:07.830
if you're still in the game,

2218
00:55:07.831 --> 00:55:09.610
every now and then a pitch comes your way that you can,

2219
00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:10.110
right?

2220
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:10.943
That's right.

2221
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:12.660
Low hanging fruit.

2222
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.780
So when you're in your day,

2223
00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:16.440
when you,

2224
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.440
when you started out doing these strange clubs and you know,

2225
00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:21.420
Hootenanny's and all and all that jazz,

2226
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.960
how long was it before the comedy club came around?

2227
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:25.621
How was that?

2228
00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:26.640
How was that received?

2229
00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:29.930
<v 1>Comedy Club came around the beginning of the eighties.</v>

2230
00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.160
Um,

2231
00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:32.240
probably

2232
00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.320
<v 2>so like right when I,</v>

2233
00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.350
I started in 88 so when they were talking about like 84,

2234
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.380
that was really when it kind of really started out with

2235
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:41.490
<v 1>the peak and then it then,</v>

2236
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:42.211
cause you know,

2237
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:45.720
the comedy clubs in the 80s probably paid more money than they do now.

2238
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:46.410
Really?

2239
00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:46.611
Yeah.

2240
00:55:46.611 --> 00:55:47.101
Oh yeah.

2241
00:55:47.101 --> 00:55:48.240
And then they realized,

2242
00:55:48.241 --> 00:55:49.170
they realized,

2243
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:49.890
oh,

2244
00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:51.600
there's a million comics,

2245
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.370
we don't have to pay these guys anything.

2246
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.660
And then the price went way down by the bay.

2247
00:55:56.661 --> 00:55:58.170
50% dropped way,

2248
00:55:58.171 --> 00:56:02.100
way off because in the early days there weren't that many comedians and really

2249
00:56:02.101 --> 00:56:03.210
weren't when I was,

2250
00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:04.171
when I,

2251
00:56:04.171 --> 00:56:05.004
uh,

2252
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:06.390
went to New York,

2253
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.410
go to the Improv,

2254
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:12.930
there may be three comedians and like 10 singers on the audition night.

2255
00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:14.820
Now everybody wants to be a comedian.

2256
00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:15.630
But by then,

2257
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:18.660
back then it really was not what it is now.

2258
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:21.530
<v 2>What was it about comedy that just drew you to it?</v>

2259
00:56:21.531 --> 00:56:23.620
Because it seems like that is not an path.

2260
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:26.170
Back then it seemed like there's no direct route.

2261
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:26.531
Like,

2262
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:28.150
now you can go to the comedy store,

2263
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:30.190
you sign up for potluck night and you know,

2264
00:56:30.191 --> 00:56:31.450
if you go enough nights in a row,

2265
00:56:31.451 --> 00:56:32.560
you're eventually going to get on stage.

2266
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:33.030
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2267
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.121
Uh,

2268
00:56:33.121 --> 00:56:33.770
you know,

2269
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.901
uh,

2270
00:56:33.901 --> 00:56:34.531
for me,

2271
00:56:34.531 --> 00:56:36.180
I was dyslexic as a kid,

2272
00:56:36.181 --> 00:56:41.181
so I really wasn't good at anything except just talking and bullshitting or

2273
00:56:41.371 --> 00:56:42.204
whatever it might be.

2274
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:43.890
And I,

2275
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:44.701
you know,

2276
00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:45.270
I,

2277
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:48.000
I used to like to watch comedians on TV and I thought,

2278
00:56:48.001 --> 00:56:50.940
well this might be a fun thing to try and do.

2279
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:52.770
And that's pretty much what I did.

2280
00:56:52.771 --> 00:56:52.981
I mean,

2281
00:56:52.981 --> 00:56:53.940
when I got started,

2282
00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:58.970
I went to Emerson College and I took a course and I took speech courses cause

2283
00:57:00.121 --> 00:57:01.710
you had to give a talk at the end.

2284
00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:06.060
And what I used to do was I would memorize like a George Carlin routine.

2285
00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.830
I would never say it out loud.

2286
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:09.210
I would memorize it in my head.

2287
00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:09.571
I would say,

2288
00:57:09.571 --> 00:57:09.721
okay,

2289
00:57:09.721 --> 00:57:10.740
I'm going to go on a few minutes.

2290
00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:12.510
And I would do his routine.

2291
00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:13.920
And then as soon as they hit the stage,

2292
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:16.110
I would slip into my own experiences.

2293
00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:16.771
Like,

2294
00:57:16.771 --> 00:57:17.311
I remember he,

2295
00:57:17.311 --> 00:57:17.630
uh,

2296
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:18.463
he had the class,

2297
00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.920
he had the class clown album.

2298
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:21.690
So I would recite his jokes.

2299
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:23.100
And then when I hit the stage,

2300
00:57:23.101 --> 00:57:23.934
I would say,

2301
00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:24.241
you know what,

2302
00:57:24.241 --> 00:57:24.841
I always a kid.

2303
00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:26.010
I was also a class clown.

2304
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.940
And then I would,

2305
00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:29.970
I would tell funny stories or whatever it was about mine,

2306
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:34.050
but I used his rhythm as the infant is to get me into it.

2307
00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:34.341
I mean,

2308
00:57:34.341 --> 00:57:36.240
I never did any of George's material,

2309
00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:38.760
but it just worked for me as a way to,

2310
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:39.750
it's kind of a,

2311
00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:40.950
uh,

2312
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:41.430
you know,

2313
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:42.630
we can get you started.

2314
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.790
Yeah.

2315
00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:43.950
It's like when he married a long time,

2316
00:57:43.951 --> 00:57:44.900
you watch porn first.

2317
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:45.763
You know,

2318
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:47.551
when I was,

2319
00:57:47.551 --> 00:57:48.240
uh,

2320
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.590
working at Boston Globe,

2321
00:57:49.591 --> 00:57:50.700
I used to deliver the globe.

2322
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:51.350
And,

2323
00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:51.600
uh,

2324
00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.021
I would,

2325
00:57:52.021 --> 00:57:52.350
uh,

2326
00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:55.470
go to the places where I would pick up the papers.

2327
00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:57.150
And there was a bunch of guys,

2328
00:57:57.151 --> 00:57:57.984
it was guy named,

2329
00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:58.843
uh,

2330
00:57:58.850 --> 00:57:59.100
God,

2331
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:02.820
I forget his name was an Indian gentleman who was actually a pharmacologist in

2332
00:58:02.821 --> 00:58:03.400
India.

2333
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:03.980
Right.

2334
00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.800
<v 2>Get a license for it in America.</v>

2335
00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:06.910
So he's working as a,

2336
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.120
as a paper guy at the Boston Globe were really bright guy.

2337
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.450
Right.

2338
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:10.961
And uh,

2339
00:58:10.961 --> 00:58:11.171
you know,

2340
00:58:11.171 --> 00:58:13.480
he would talk to me about American culture and stuff like that.

2341
00:58:13.481 --> 00:58:14.021
And I asked him,

2342
00:58:14.021 --> 00:58:16.750
you ever heard of Sam Kinison how's obsessed with Candice?

2343
00:58:16.751 --> 00:58:17.584
And back then,

2344
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:20.620
this is like 86 before ever started doing comedy.

2345
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:21.580
And uh,

2346
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.120
I would,

2347
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.040
I would do like a Kennison bit for him.

2348
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.330
And uh,

2349
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:26.180
he was crying.

2350
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:30.300
I was doing a bit about Sam Kinison at a bit about dog psychologists know.

2351
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:31.241
He goes,

2352
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:31.570
ah,

2353
00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:31.901
he goes,

2354
00:58:31.901 --> 00:58:33.430
I'd like to get in on some of that money.

2355
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.941
He goes,

2356
00:58:33.941 --> 00:58:34.121
yeah,

2357
00:58:34.121 --> 00:58:35.830
what are you having a problem with sparky?

2358
00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:36.201
Yeah.

2359
00:58:36.201 --> 00:58:36.551
Spark.

2360
00:58:36.551 --> 00:58:37.060
He's not a,

2361
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.200
he's not acting himself.

2362
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.831
Oh,

2363
00:58:38.831 --> 00:58:39.551
I'll take care of it.

2364
00:58:39.551 --> 00:58:40.900
And it takes him into the Fred's of all,

2365
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:42.100
you're a fucking dog.

2366
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:43.160
Oh.

2367
00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:43.993
Yet,

2368
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.210
<v 1>you know,</v>

2369
00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:46.720
he was a funny person.

2370
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:47.650
Horrible guy.

2371
00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:48.720
Yeah.

2372
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.200
He's mean nasty guy.

2373
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.720
Seems like it.

2374
00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.451
And near the end,

2375
00:58:52.451 --> 00:58:54.520
he was pulling guns on people and well,

2376
00:58:54.521 --> 00:58:55.160
there was a youth

2377
00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:59.410
<v 2>be a bullet hole at the comedy store and the belly room sign that for whatever</v>

2378
00:58:59.411 --> 00:58:59.681
reason,

2379
00:58:59.681 --> 00:59:01.330
some asshole decided to repair.

2380
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:05.680
I was so fucking mad and I hadn't been there in seven years and I came back and

2381
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:05.870
the,

2382
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:07.120
the sign was fixed like a,

2383
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:08.590
what did you do?

2384
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:09.790
What did you do?

2385
00:59:09.791 --> 00:59:10.960
That wasn't bad.

2386
00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:12.400
It was history.

2387
00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:13.950
<v 1>I can't remember if I was,</v>

2388
00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:15.110
I,

2389
00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.310
I'm not sure if I put him on the tonight show first.

2390
00:59:17.311 --> 00:59:21.530
He was how I was guest hosting and I had Sam on a one time,

2391
00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.753
um,

2392
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.830
he might've been on before that I'm not,

2393
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:25.371
I can't,

2394
00:59:25.371 --> 00:59:25.461
I,

2395
00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:27.440
so I'm not going to try and take credit for that.

2396
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:28.580
But you know,

2397
00:59:28.581 --> 00:59:30.500
he was truly funny,

2398
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.380
but just really dark.

2399
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:34.453
I mean,

2400
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:35.960
just nasty.

2401
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.823
I mean,

2402
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:38.900
we're just like how sal,

2403
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:40.700
um,

2404
00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:43.670
young comic in the hall back just rip them.

2405
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:45.043
I mean,

2406
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:47.900
way crueler than it needed to be.

2407
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:49.040
I mean it was,

2408
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:50.930
and he was brilliant,

2409
00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:51.291
you know,

2410
00:59:51.291 --> 00:59:53.300
but it's like when Sam died,

2411
00:59:53.301 --> 00:59:54.350
it was like,

2412
00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:59.420
that's almost how he had to go out because he was so,

2413
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:00.081
like,

2414
01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:02.870
he had that hilarious bit about necrophilia and then one,

2415
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.160
nothing funnier.

2416
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.490
Yeah.

2417
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:05.120
Okay,

2418
01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.320
so what's your next bit?

2419
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:07.243
Okay.

2420
01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.830
If you have a thing about scoring dead people,

2421
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.460
what is,

2422
01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.590
what's more outrageous than this?

2423
01:00:12.591 --> 01:00:12.940
I know,

2424
01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:13.120
right?

2425
01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:13.271
You know,

2426
01:00:13.271 --> 01:00:16.220
he kept trying to top himself and is able to do it,

2427
01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.293
you know?

2428
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:17.900
Uh,

2429
01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:22.130
but it just got so crazy and then it's that thing where you start believing your

2430
01:00:22.131 --> 01:00:25.790
own publicity instead of just showing up as a comic.

2431
01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:29.720
You're not have an entourage and everything you say is funny,

2432
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:30.531
you can't,

2433
01:00:30.531 --> 01:00:30.831
you know,

2434
01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:31.970
is a calming perspective.

2435
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:32.061
Yeah.

2436
01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:33.350
You've got to be able to say to people,

2437
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.670
is this really funny?

2438
01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:35.760
And you know,

2439
01:00:35.761 --> 01:00:36.230
no,

2440
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.971
it's not that good,

2441
01:00:36.971 --> 01:00:37.460
man.

2442
01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:37.851
Okay,

2443
01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:38.151
thanks.

2444
01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:38.560
Like why does,

2445
01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.351
and about Robin,

2446
01:00:39.351 --> 01:00:40.370
you had to be able to,

2447
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:43.160
to ask people that question.

2448
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:44.900
That's why Steve Martin Quinn,

2449
01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:46.961
<v 2>Steve Martin,</v>

2450
01:00:46.961 --> 01:00:47.050
yeah.

2451
01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:50.080
When he talked about in his book that he's just got to a point where just

2452
01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:51.910
everything he said was funny and it just,

2453
01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:53.110
he knew it was wrong.

2454
01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:53.891
<v 1>He was a great guy.</v>

2455
01:00:53.891 --> 01:00:56.470
Steve is the one that brought Johnny and to see me at the time.

2456
01:00:56.471 --> 01:00:56.980
Really?

2457
01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:57.460
Yeah.

2458
01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.110
And I was always very grateful for that.

2459
01:00:59.170 --> 01:00:59.620
You know,

2460
01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.550
I love Steve Martin.

2461
01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:00.791
Oh,

2462
01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:01.624
he's a great guy,

2463
01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:02.860
great guy and,

2464
01:01:02.861 --> 01:01:03.760
and uh,

2465
01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:05.200
intelligent guy,

2466
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:06.220
thoughtful guy.

2467
01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.593
Um,

2468
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:12.580
really looks at it analytically from an artist's perspective.

2469
01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:13.414
He's really,

2470
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:14.141
you know,

2471
01:01:14.141 --> 01:01:15.010
he's one of those guys,

2472
01:01:15.011 --> 01:01:15.431
like I said,

2473
01:01:15.431 --> 01:01:17.500
like Johnny who looks like a normal person,

2474
01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:20.520
but they just think unusual and think funny.

2475
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.840
<v 2>Kennison is my favorite example that I use to young comics when I talk about</v>

2476
01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.171
like,

2477
01:01:25.171 --> 01:01:26.610
you got to stay the course.

2478
01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.420
Like you can't,

2479
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.560
like once you make it,

2480
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.960
it's even more hard because once you make it,

2481
01:01:30.961 --> 01:01:34.650
then people require things of you and you have to look at yourself as

2482
01:01:34.651 --> 01:01:37.140
objectively and analytically as you,

2483
01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:38.280
you look at the whole world.

2484
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.410
Kennison was brilliant in my opinion.

2485
01:01:40.411 --> 01:01:41.610
He was like one of the best ever,

2486
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:46.670
if not the best ever in 1986 and then by 1989 he was a fucking shell of himself

2487
01:01:47.461 --> 01:01:49.710
and was barely acceptable.

2488
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:53.950
<v 1>It was that case of all comics like to have some sort of open wound,</v>

2489
01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:59.610
alcoholic drug addict too straight to gay to something so they have an excuse

2490
01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:02.080
when it doesn't get a laugh.

2491
01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:02.471
Hey,

2492
01:02:02.471 --> 01:02:06.100
I did pretty good considering I was stoned and it was pretty funny cause I was

2493
01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:11.101
drinking all day before we went on to say they always need a reason why it

2494
01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:13.120
didn't work if it didn't work.

2495
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:17.230
And so consequently you get to that point where that crutch gets bigger and

2496
01:02:17.231 --> 01:02:18.064
bigger and bigger.

2497
01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:19.203
You know,

2498
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:19.990
the idea is

2499
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:21.810
<v 0>to try and put that stuff aside.</v>

2500
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:23.630
It's a lot of discipline.

2501
01:02:23.631 --> 01:02:24.301
Being a comic,

2502
01:02:24.301 --> 01:02:25.350
you really have to,

2503
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:28.110
you can't believe your own publicity.

2504
01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:30.240
See I'm a huge believer in low self esteem.

2505
01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:34.200
I think it's because when you have low self esteem,

2506
01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:36.810
you don't imagine automatically think you have the smartest one in the room.

2507
01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:37.500
You know,

2508
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.950
you just shut up and maybe listen and take some advice and whatever and work

2509
01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:41.251
harder.

2510
01:02:41.251 --> 01:02:41.821
But you know,

2511
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:42.870
actors and criminals,

2512
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:45.360
there's high self esteem and the long haul,

2513
01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.233
the

2514
01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:47.760
true,

2515
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.900
every criminal will tell you,

2516
01:02:48.901 --> 01:02:49.141
you know,

2517
01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:50.940
something that the cops hadn't come,

2518
01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.650
that would have been the greatest robber.

2519
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.981
You know,

2520
01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:55.120
they all have a reason why there's a,

2521
01:02:55.121 --> 01:02:57.030
it's always somebody else's fault,

2522
01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:57.721
you know?

2523
01:02:57.721 --> 01:02:59.700
And that's the thing Sam had that Sam,

2524
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:02.760
you worked at the crutch got bigger and bigger and he's,

2525
01:03:02.761 --> 01:03:04.050
he got funnier and funnier.

2526
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:08.400
You needed more drugs and more whatever to two because all that's,

2527
01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:10.590
that's why the third showed in work man.

2528
01:03:10.591 --> 01:03:11.670
Cause I was so high.

2529
01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:12.271
Oh okay.

2530
01:03:12.271 --> 01:03:13.200
It wasn't Sam's fault,

2531
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:13.980
he was too high,

2532
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:14.813
you know?

2533
01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:16.070
Does that make any sense to,

2534
01:03:16.071 --> 01:03:16.351
you know,

2535
01:03:16.351 --> 01:03:16.990
it does.

2536
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:20.730
And I also think he was so caught up in partying that he never really sat down

2537
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:21.564
and wrote anymore.

2538
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:22.441
Well again,

2539
01:03:22.441 --> 01:03:24.120
that's the same,

2540
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.380
we're saying the same,

2541
01:03:25.381 --> 01:03:26.400
call it partying,

2542
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.050
call it whatever you want.

2543
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:28.913
You know,

2544
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.270
the real trick to being a comedian is,

2545
01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.173
is it's,

2546
01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.320
it's focused.

2547
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.640
It's a genetic flaw that makes you a comedian.

2548
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:37.320
It's not nothing,

2549
01:03:37.321 --> 01:03:37.740
right?

2550
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.730
It's not a plus.

2551
01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:39.564
It's a negative.

2552
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.961
I mean,

2553
01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:42.480
if you happen to live in the time of the Crusades,

2554
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:43.951
who's a soldier?

2555
01:03:43.951 --> 01:03:44.251
Megan,

2556
01:03:44.251 --> 01:03:45.120
all the men left,

2557
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.020
kill him.

2558
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:46.853
All right?

2559
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:48.540
You know,

2560
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.420
we just happen to live in a time when comedy is advantageous,

2561
01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:54.390
but if you're a soldier and this guy is hysterical and men are all laughing and

2562
01:03:54.391 --> 01:03:54.870
then I pick it,

2563
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:55.703
kill that guy,

2564
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:56.030
boom,

2565
01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:56.610
they kill it.

2566
01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:57.031
There you go.

2567
01:03:57.031 --> 01:03:57.630
Simple as that.

2568
01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:01.260
Or You'd be the gesture for the king until he decided to cut your head off and

2569
01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.010
further.

2570
01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:03.510
There's a pressure gauge right there.

2571
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.160
No,

2572
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.300
but see that that was,

2573
01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:06.750
you know,

2574
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:09.950
I remember years ago when I started the tonight show,

2575
01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:12.150
there were other guests hosts on opposite me,

2576
01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:14.970
not guess what other shows.

2577
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.983
And I remember,

2578
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.340
and I go home every night and I'd write,

2579
01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:19.860
and I remember one time I turned on the news and I saw one of the hosts at a

2580
01:04:19.861 --> 01:04:20.491
Laker game.

2581
01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:20.740
I'm like,

2582
01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.573
Oh,

2583
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:23.790
you're not going to have a monologue tomorrow night.

2584
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:28.440
I know he's not because I'm writing jokes and he's been at the Laker game all

2585
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.230
night and when I watched his monologue and the next night,

2586
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.000
the person didn't have any material.

2587
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:34.380
I mean he got through it,

2588
01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:35.010
but it,

2589
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:35.850
it wasn't Chris,

2590
01:04:35.851 --> 01:04:36.750
but wasn't sharp.

2591
01:04:36.751 --> 01:04:37.530
You know,

2592
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:40.170
you'd have to focus that discipline is really,

2593
01:04:40.171 --> 01:04:43.800
it's ironic in a way because what makes you a comic in the first place?

2594
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.101
Usually?

2595
01:04:44.101 --> 01:04:46.280
Cause you're fucked off in school and you were the class clown.

2596
01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:47.280
You didn't have any discipline.

2597
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:47.951
That was me.

2598
01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:48.120
Yeah.

2599
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.360
I was meeting to Jay has the ability but does not apply himself.

2600
01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.233
Exactly.

2601
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:53.761
Verbatim.

2602
01:04:53.761 --> 01:04:55.550
I bet you can go across the board,

2603
01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:55.921
Richard,

2604
01:04:55.921 --> 01:04:56.491
Jenny,

2605
01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:58.260
you know Dave Shabbat every fucking comic.

2606
01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.250
Then we'd have the same thing.

2607
01:04:59.251 --> 01:04:59.510
Yeah.

2608
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.911
I mean,

2609
01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:02.940
I remember my mother was called into school once with the guidance counselor and

2610
01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:03.500
I'm sitting there,

2611
01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.720
the guidance counselors and my mother.

2612
01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:07.350
Have you ever thought of taking Jay at a school?

2613
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:07.861
My Mom said,

2614
01:05:07.861 --> 01:05:08.280
why?

2615
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:08.671
And he said,

2616
01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:09.030
well,

2617
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:09.481
you know,

2618
01:05:09.481 --> 01:05:10.830
education is not for everyone.

2619
01:05:10.831 --> 01:05:11.220
I'm going,

2620
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:11.581
hello,

2621
01:05:11.581 --> 01:05:14.880
I'm in the room because we'll show you worked at Mcdonald's after school,

2622
01:05:14.881 --> 01:05:15.091
right?

2623
01:05:15.091 --> 01:05:15.181
Well,

2624
01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:17.770
they have an excellent program with that Mcdonnell University.

2625
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:19.660
You learn to make change and run the register.

2626
01:05:19.661 --> 01:05:19.871
I go,

2627
01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:20.030
no,

2628
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.710
you know I'm not,

2629
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:21.940
I'm not that bad.

2630
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:22.660
You know,

2631
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:23.830
Jesus Christ,

2632
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:24.821
hilarious.

2633
01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:25.654
Teachers don't,

2634
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:28.030
I don't know if they understand or they don't understand,

2635
01:05:28.031 --> 01:05:30.670
but when you set an example like that for a kid,

2636
01:05:30.671 --> 01:05:31.900
you put it in front of them like that.

2637
01:05:31.901 --> 01:05:32.734
They're not going to,

2638
01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:35.530
they should drop off and take a trade or something like that.

2639
01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:35.891
Actually,

2640
01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:37.060
I credit one of my teachers,

2641
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:37.721
Mrs Hawks,

2642
01:05:37.721 --> 01:05:39.880
I had just teach her and she pulled me aside one day and she said,

2643
01:05:39.881 --> 01:05:40.061
you know,

2644
01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:40.960
you're not a very good student,

2645
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:42.850
but I see you in class.

2646
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.520
I see you in the hallway and you see it'd be telling jokes and people.

2647
01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:45.971
She says,

2648
01:05:45.971 --> 01:05:50.170
why don't you write some of these stories down and I'll give you credit English

2649
01:05:50.171 --> 01:05:52.630
class and you can read them to the class.

2650
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:53.320
And I said,

2651
01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:53.550
oh,

2652
01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:54.940
it was the first time my life,

2653
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.010
I really enjoyed doing a homework.

2654
01:05:57.011 --> 01:05:59.430
I went out and I wrote the story out and that's it.

2655
01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:00.520
And they change the line.

2656
01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:04.120
They rewrote it and I realized I'd spent like two hours work on the homework

2657
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:04.600
assignment.

2658
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.200
I normally would just spend 10 minutes on.

2659
01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.710
And when I went to school in the next day and I read it,

2660
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.300
I want it got laughs.

2661
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:11.051
She said,

2662
01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:11.321
okay,

2663
01:06:11.321 --> 01:06:11.891
I'll give you a credit.

2664
01:06:11.891 --> 01:06:12.790
I'll give you a knife for that.

2665
01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.673
I went,

2666
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.081
oh,

2667
01:06:14.081 --> 01:06:14.510
thank,

2668
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:19.150
I mean this was a teacher taking something I could use in the real world.

2669
01:06:19.151 --> 01:06:19.361
You know,

2670
01:06:19.361 --> 01:06:19.780
I'm not,

2671
01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:20.531
I'm dyslexic,

2672
01:06:20.531 --> 01:06:21.610
I'm not going to use Algebra.

2673
01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:22.720
I'm never gonna use Algebra.

2674
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:25.120
But this teacher saw something where she said,

2675
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.780
okay,

2676
01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.201
and you know,

2677
01:06:26.201 --> 01:06:27.880
I set up a scholarship for her and I,

2678
01:06:27.881 --> 01:06:29.800
and she passed away fairly young breast cancer.

2679
01:06:29.801 --> 01:06:30.790
But um,

2680
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.630
it was,

2681
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:34.540
it was just great because I had never really thought about,

2682
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.171
you know,

2683
01:06:35.171 --> 01:06:35.921
you grew up in Andover,

2684
01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:36.581
Massachusetts.

2685
01:06:36.581 --> 01:06:39.940
I'm thinking about being a kid and you think about working in the factory or

2686
01:06:39.941 --> 01:06:40.510
something.

2687
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:41.470
And I thought,

2688
01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:41.951
oh,

2689
01:06:41.951 --> 01:06:46.600
it was the first time in my life I had used comedy and it got me something.

2690
01:06:46.601 --> 01:06:47.381
I got an a.

2691
01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:48.790
I know I never got a day,

2692
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.590
but I got an a on this paper,

2693
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:51.200
you know.

2694
01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:51.521
Oh,

2695
01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:52.240
okay.

2696
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:52.960
So then I,

2697
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.980
that's how I started.

2698
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.390
That's really what got me going.

2699
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:56.830
I used to draw cartoons.

2700
01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:57.910
That's how I got into it.

2701
01:06:57.970 --> 01:07:01.840
I used to draw cartoons and my teacher's like doing sex acts with other students

2702
01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:05.500
like pet or see now you'd be sent to prison.

2703
01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:07.901
Like visual.

2704
01:07:07.901 --> 01:07:09.610
I didn't show like genitals,

2705
01:07:09.611 --> 01:07:09.971
but you know,

2706
01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:13.590
I showed like I was in Boise,

2707
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
we went to boy scout camp when I was kid and I think it was camp on way in New

2708
01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:19.810
Hampshire.

2709
01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.610
I went to camp in New Hampshire as a boy scout.

2710
01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:22.120
Okay.

2711
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:22.541
Okay.

2712
01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:25.210
Well we had a camp counselor,

2713
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:26.051
Mr. Butler,

2714
01:07:26.051 --> 01:07:26.884
I think his name was,

2715
01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:28.930
and this is like cub scouts.

2716
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:33.930
It's like nine 10 11 and if you did something wrong for punishment,

2717
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:40.170
you had to stack rocks and build the wall in front of Mr Butlins cabin nude.

2718
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:41.230
Okay.

2719
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.970
Oh Geez.

2720
01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:42.631
We go by him.

2721
01:07:42.631 --> 01:07:43.080
He laughed.

2722
01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:43.913
I looked at Billy,

2723
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:45.200
cause when you know,

2724
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.420
when you're nine and 10 you just,

2725
01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.440
you don't realize though is getting married.

2726
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.230
I don't think that ever happened,

2727
01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:51.060
but it was mostly,

2728
01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:51.520
and,

2729
01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.960
and Mr. Butler would sit there with his pipe and just kind of sit in the rocking

2730
01:07:55.961 --> 01:07:56.794
chair and you know,

2731
01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.510
it was probably Christ.

2732
01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.190
It's probably eight years later,

2733
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:02.800
I'm on like route for 95 going through Worcester.

2734
01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:03.973
Oh wait a minute.

2735
01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:06.670
I mean it never occurred to me because you know,

2736
01:08:06.671 --> 01:08:08.920
when you're a kid is just skinny dipping all that.

2737
01:08:08.921 --> 01:08:10.270
You're not thinking anything like that.

2738
01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:11.021
It just,

2739
01:08:11.021 --> 01:08:11.351
yeah.

2740
01:08:11.351 --> 01:08:14.470
So it never occurred to you that Mr. Butler is probably a pervert.

2741
01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:14.780
No,

2742
01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:15.613
no.

2743
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.420
But once you got older you realized,

2744
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.900
Oh yeah,

2745
01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:19.010
you meet a few perverts.

2746
01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:19.221
You Go,

2747
01:08:19.221 --> 01:08:21.110
this is not a normal punishment,

2748
01:08:21.111 --> 01:08:21.500
sir.

2749
01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.340
I rest my case.

2750
01:08:23.650 --> 01:08:25.940
What was about Kennison that was so mean.

2751
01:08:25.941 --> 01:08:28.520
Like what was it when you saying he's just a nasty person?

2752
01:08:28.521 --> 01:08:29.060
I know,

2753
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.110
you know Carla Bows,

2754
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:31.100
a friend of mine,

2755
01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.390
he must have some stories.

2756
01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:32.571
Oh,

2757
01:08:32.571 --> 01:08:33.800
he's got a horrible story.

2758
01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.920
Child turned out to be kinisons child.

2759
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:41.820
Kennison was banging his best friend's wife behind his back and it's,

2760
01:08:41.821 --> 01:08:42.830
it's terrible.

2761
01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:43.190
I mean,

2762
01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:46.580
and I don't know what is relationship like is like with the child,

2763
01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:48.260
you need any other stories,

2764
01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:49.803
you know?

2765
01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:50.121
I mean,

2766
01:08:50.121 --> 01:08:51.560
it's not the child's fault.

2767
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.850
It's,

2768
01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:56.240
I would like to think that I would be man enough to recognize it's not the

2769
01:08:56.241 --> 01:08:59.930
child's fault and not punish the child for it and just still treat the child

2770
01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:00.764
like it's my child,

2771
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.360
especially since Kennison is dead,

2772
01:09:02.361 --> 01:09:03.100
but he,

2773
01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:03.350
you know,

2774
01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:07.160
he had been paying alimony and child support for this for the longest time and

2775
01:09:07.161 --> 01:09:10.520
it's just what a betrayal to this friend.

2776
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.851
Okay.

2777
01:09:10.851 --> 01:09:11.001
Well,

2778
01:09:11.001 --> 01:09:12.200
there you answered your own question.

2779
01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:13.063
What's the next question?

2780
01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:14.301
Yeah,

2781
01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:14.950
that's not good.

2782
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:15.450
Yeah.

2783
01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:18.460
But I had heard that they did some wife swapping and shit back then too.

2784
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.570
I Dunno about that complicated.

2785
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:23.330
I just knew it was just kind of a nasty,

2786
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.370
just me is,

2787
01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:26.750
it's interesting because that,

2788
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:30.860
that guy just sort of changed what comedy was for a little bit.

2789
01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:33.041
Good.

2790
01:09:33.041 --> 01:09:33.590
It was an,

2791
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:36.440
it was a truly unique style.

2792
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:39.170
Nobody else had worked like that ever.

2793
01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:39.891
I mean,

2794
01:09:39.891 --> 01:09:43.160
just as Rodney had a style and Robin had a style,

2795
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.720
a Kennison had a style.

2796
01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:48.410
No one has had come along before or since.

2797
01:09:48.411 --> 01:09:53.090
Really with that energy that drains to it to,

2798
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:54.230
it was an anger.

2799
01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:55.700
Obviously they came from,

2800
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:58.880
I don't know whether abuse or religious and tolerance,

2801
01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:00.350
whatever it was when he was a kid.

2802
01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:01.880
But did you ever read his brother's book?

2803
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:02.870
My brother Sam?

2804
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:03.381
No,

2805
01:10:03.381 --> 01:10:06.680
I didn't read the book or the bill wrote a book and it's a really good book and

2806
01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:07.670
it's really objective.

2807
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.181
It's really,

2808
01:10:08.181 --> 01:10:10.010
it's not like a fluff piece.

2809
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:11.870
And he said that Sam got hit by,

2810
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:12.890
I think it was a car,

2811
01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:16.250
a truck when he was young boy and it was never the same again.

2812
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:19.970
And head injuries oftentimes lead to like very impulsive,

2813
01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:21.860
radically different behavior.

2814
01:10:21.861 --> 01:10:23.090
That would certainly be the case there.

2815
01:10:23.091 --> 01:10:23.300
Yeah.

2816
01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.090
I mean he was impulsive and in radical,

2817
01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:26.750
you know,

2818
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:27.590
but like you say,

2819
01:10:27.591 --> 01:10:28.041
it's,

2820
01:10:28.041 --> 01:10:28.611
it's a,

2821
01:10:28.611 --> 01:10:32.780
it's a bit like that animal with a horn grows out and eventually curves and

2822
01:10:32.781 --> 01:10:34.790
grows back into its own head and it goes crazy.

2823
01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:37.310
I mean that's Kinda like what Sam was,

2824
01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:42.311
I mean like 84 85 86 nothing bigger by the early nineties.

2825
01:10:42.411 --> 01:10:43.280
It was uh,

2826
01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:44.781
it was pretty,

2827
01:10:44.781 --> 01:10:45.430
it was,

2828
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:48.830
I got to see me live after his HBO special,

2829
01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:51.530
like almost immediately after and he didn't really have material.

2830
01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:51.850
Right.

2831
01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:52.371
He like,

2832
01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:56.180
he had all that HBO stuff that he couldn't really do anymore because everybody

2833
01:10:56.181 --> 01:10:56.721
had seen it.

2834
01:10:56.721 --> 01:10:57.750
So now he was one,

2835
01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.660
one of the first realizations that like,

2836
01:10:59.661 --> 01:11:00.494
wow,

2837
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.600
wrote this whole act for 10 years,

2838
01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.110
you know,

2839
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:04.160
worked for 10 years,

2840
01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:05.030
honed my act,

2841
01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:05.780
developed this,

2842
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.613
this killer.

2843
01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.500
That's why you don't do HPL specials.

2844
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:10.730
You don't do any specialists.

2845
01:11:10.731 --> 01:11:11.360
Yeah.

2846
01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.193
Why is that?

2847
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:14.040
Because I to know where my act

2848
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:14.873
<v 1>is all the time.</v>

2849
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:15.900
What does that mean?

2850
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.531
But by that,

2851
01:11:16.531 --> 01:11:18.360
I mean if you want to see it,

2852
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.130
I will come to where you are and do it.

2853
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.560
There's nothing more annoying to me.

2854
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:22.230
People say,

2855
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:22.471
Hey,

2856
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:25.440
I just saw so and so special and it didn't seem that funny.

2857
01:11:25.441 --> 01:11:25.681
I said,

2858
01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:26.340
where do you watch it?

2859
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:26.450
I,

2860
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:27.180
my iPhone.

2861
01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.541
Okay.

2862
01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:28.380
You know something.

2863
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:33.030
Watching it on your iPhone by yourself is not going to make you laugh.

2864
01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.570
Okay.

2865
01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:34.321
It's not the same.

2866
01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:38.400
You know the difference between looking in the window of a nightclub and hearing

2867
01:11:38.401 --> 01:11:41.040
it and being on the other side of the window and being in the room,

2868
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.230
that energy and gulfs you.

2869
01:11:43.231 --> 01:11:43.591
I mean,

2870
01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:44.580
it's part of it.

2871
01:11:44.581 --> 01:11:46.050
If you're willing to pay attention,

2872
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.240
I'll come to where you are and I'll do it.

2873
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.990
Okay.

2874
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:50.460
I like piecemeal work,

2875
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:51.091
right?

2876
01:11:51.091 --> 01:11:51.451
Joke,

2877
01:11:51.451 --> 01:11:52.051
tell joke,

2878
01:11:52.051 --> 01:11:52.710
get check.

2879
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:54.540
That's pretty much the way my life is.

2880
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:55.191
The idea.

2881
01:11:55.191 --> 01:11:55.651
I mean,

2882
01:11:55.651 --> 01:11:57.810
I remember we had a comic on the tonight show once.

2883
01:11:58.230 --> 01:11:58.710
He said,

2884
01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:00.350
oh my HBO specials brand this week.

2885
01:12:00.351 --> 01:12:00.750
Can you,

2886
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:01.920
can you plug it?

2887
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:02.251
I said,

2888
01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:02.550
yeah.

2889
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:03.383
Okay.

2890
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.811
He says,

2891
01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:04.830
and I'm going on the road.

2892
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:05.101
I said,

2893
01:12:05.101 --> 01:12:06.270
what material are you doing on the road?

2894
01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:06.600
Well,

2895
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.040
they all do a lot of stuff from the special.

2896
01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.030
I said,

2897
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.391
you know,

2898
01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:11.100
it's going to be the next time.

2899
01:12:11.101 --> 01:12:12.750
He came back like eight months later.

2900
01:12:12.751 --> 01:12:13.380
He was like,

2901
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:13.801
oh my God,

2902
01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:14.670
you were right people.

2903
01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:15.750
I just heard that.

2904
01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:19.410
I heard that crap last night because people watched the special before they come

2905
01:12:19.411 --> 01:12:19.891
see you,

2906
01:12:19.891 --> 01:12:20.720
they like you,

2907
01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:24.840
Oh let's watch a special then go see them and then they are so pissed that they

2908
01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:28.440
spent 50 bucks or whatever it is for a ticket that uh,

2909
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:29.220
now they,

2910
01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.120
now they hate you.

2911
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:30.960
You know,

2912
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:31.793
you.

2913
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.390
So to me,

2914
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:35.100
when you do one of those specials,

2915
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:38.910
you get probably a nickel of view,

2916
01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:40.680
maybe a penny of you.

2917
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:42.250
But when you do a live on an inch,

2918
01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:44.820
you're making 20 bucks,

2919
01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.060
50 bucks.

2920
01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.020
<v 0>But for a lot of comics,</v>

2921
01:12:47.021 --> 01:12:48.340
that's how they build an audience.

2922
01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:51.610
They build an audience by putting together an HBO special that somebody likes

2923
01:12:51.611 --> 01:12:52.900
and then they write a whole new act.

2924
01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:54.580
And then when someone comes out to see them,

2925
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:56.560
they'll see the new act that works.

2926
01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:57.371
<v 1>But you know,</v>

2927
01:12:57.371 --> 01:12:58.204
to me,

2928
01:12:58.330 --> 01:12:59.081
I always meet people,

2929
01:12:59.081 --> 01:13:02.500
say I'm writing a new hour and then I'd watch it and I go,

2930
01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.411
that's not an hour.

2931
01:13:03.411 --> 01:13:05.380
And that's about 16 minutes really.

2932
01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.393
Cause there's a lot of

2933
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:07.450
<v 0>uh Huh.</v>

2934
01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:08.270
And Ah,

2935
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:09.050
what else man?

2936
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:09.621
How y'all doing?

2937
01:13:09.621 --> 01:13:10.420
Everybody good?

2938
01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.510
You all good mood tonight?

2939
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.651
Hey,

2940
01:13:12.651 --> 01:13:13.121
how's that been in?

2941
01:13:13.121 --> 01:13:13.480
Hey man,

2942
01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.313
how you know,

2943
01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.340
<v 1>that's not,</v>

2944
01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:16.173
it's boom,

2945
01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:16.600
boom.

2946
01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.433
It's like,

2947
01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:18.610
it's like throwing punches

2948
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.540
<v 0>and especially old Boston style,</v>

2949
01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:21.131
awesome style.

2950
01:13:21.131 --> 01:13:22.760
It's very attack like Lenny Clarke.

2951
01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:23.653
That's what I mean.

2952
01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.171
I mean,

2953
01:13:24.171 --> 01:13:26.690
when you get something that works you,

2954
01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:27.920
but you got to build that,

2955
01:13:27.921 --> 01:13:28.420
right?

2956
01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:28.571
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2957
01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:29.500
But you can build it.

2958
01:13:29.501 --> 01:13:30.430
You can go,

2959
01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.560
you can do TV appearances,

2960
01:13:32.561 --> 01:13:34.030
you can do five minute bits.

2961
01:13:34.031 --> 01:13:38.560
You can do when people do something for a whole hour and they watch it,

2962
01:13:38.561 --> 01:13:38.970
boy,

2963
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:39.803
that's a lot.

2964
01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.151
I mean,

2965
01:13:40.151 --> 01:13:43.420
you give them a taste and then you come do it in person.

2966
01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:44.703
I mean,

2967
01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:46.720
I can only say what's worked for me.

2968
01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:47.501
I mean,

2969
01:13:47.501 --> 01:13:50.830
it works for me because I have jokes I wrote yesterday.

2970
01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:56.130
I have jokes I wrote 20 years ago and they both still work because a,

2971
01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.100
I know the last time I did this routine about,

2972
01:14:00.101 --> 01:14:03.340
this was 12 years ago when I was in this town.

2973
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.440
And the idea of any of those people being in the audience tonight,

2974
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:07.300
probably minimal.

2975
01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:08.020
You know,

2976
01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.450
if I walk on a stage,

2977
01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:10.750
it was just like,

2978
01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:11.170
I hate,

2979
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.000
I do.

2980
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:12.820
<v 0>Uh,</v>

2981
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.500
um,

2982
01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.570
a talk show appearance and the next night I haven't been to a club.

2983
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:19.870
I make sure not to do that material cause they just heard it yesterday.

2984
01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:20.350
Right.

2985
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:24.460
So the idea that anybody can call up stuff that I did at any time,

2986
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:28.300
unless you have new material every single day,

2987
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:29.680
it doesn't make sense.

2988
01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:32.440
I had this conversation with Ari Shaffir.

2989
01:14:32.441 --> 01:14:36.130
It's a good buddy of mine and colleague Greg Comedian and we were talking about

2990
01:14:36.131 --> 01:14:38.950
it and he said that when you work on old stuff,

2991
01:14:38.951 --> 01:14:40.090
if you keep old stuff,

2992
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.160
when you tighten it up or you keep,

2993
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:45.580
it keeps you from expanding as an artist and,

2994
01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:49.780
and making stuff that's more relevant to how you think right now.

2995
01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:51.640
That might be something to that,

2996
01:14:51.641 --> 01:14:53.470
but it also keeps your famous.

2997
01:14:54.230 --> 01:14:55.530
It also gets to the point where people go,

2998
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:56.870
well I walked in and uh,

2999
01:14:57.610 --> 01:15:00.700
it was a tough room in the crowd was talking and boy he got him.

3000
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:01.870
You know,

3001
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:03.220
again we're talking about,

3002
01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:07.840
I'm talking about playing hard ticket rooms where people go,

3003
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:09.080
who is this guy?

3004
01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:09.460
What does that,

3005
01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:10.293
I never seen him.

3006
01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.640
When you like when you play Jersey,

3007
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:14.320
when you played the Jersey shore,

3008
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.840
you've got 70 year old guys,

3009
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:18.040
you got teenagers,

3010
01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:18.970
you got grandmothers,

3011
01:15:18.971 --> 01:15:21.040
you got long shoreman,

3012
01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:21.750
you get sale,

3013
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:24.190
you got every conceivable type of crime.

3014
01:15:24.450 --> 01:15:25.780
You know when you were a comedy club,

3015
01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:28.360
your plants essentially to the same person.

3016
01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:28.780
Right?

3017
01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.910
They all think alike and feel like,

3018
01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:32.170
I mean to me,

3019
01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:33.970
I mean I like when I do,

3020
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:36.730
I always gear my Joe some jokes about men,

3021
01:15:36.731 --> 01:15:37.511
some about women.

3022
01:15:37.511 --> 01:15:42.511
So to me I love playing a racially and gender diverse crowd.

3023
01:15:43.271 --> 01:15:44.104
I hate,

3024
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:45.850
it's all guys.

3025
01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.140
That's the worst I hate.

3026
01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.430
Oh what's all women?

3027
01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:51.180
I like it because it keeps everybody honest.

3028
01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.690
The audience polices itself,

3029
01:15:52.691 --> 01:15:53.230
you know,

3030
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:54.600
you do a job about Amanda Juggle,

3031
01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.460
but I wouldn't do it and that's what works for me.

3032
01:15:57.610 --> 01:15:58.443
So to me,

3033
01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:01.000
I think what he's saying is probably true.

3034
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:05.410
I'm just talking about making a living when you have to go somewhere and do the

3035
01:16:05.411 --> 01:16:06.244
job,

3036
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:08.260
you know the down and dirty part of it.

3037
01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:09.070
Okay.

3038
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:12.250
There's the fun part is show business and then there's a part where you got to

3039
01:16:12.251 --> 01:16:13.084
go to work.

3040
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.020
Listen to this.

3041
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.670
It's the b'Nai B'rith society.

3042
01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.070
They're hiring your next Wednesday,

3043
01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.430
then give me 1000 bucks.

3044
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:19.323
Okay,

3045
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.280
you've got to go there and knock that crowd out.

3046
01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:21.551
I mean,

3047
01:16:21.551 --> 01:16:22.420
that's what you gotta do.

3048
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:25.360
And you think that doing special somehow or another takes away from no,

3049
01:16:25.361 --> 01:16:27.040
I don't think specialists or it takes away from that.

3050
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.053
I mean,

3051
01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:28.361
look,

3052
01:16:28.361 --> 01:16:29.500
I'm just talking about me.

3053
01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:29.680
No,

3054
01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:29.831
no,

3055
01:16:29.831 --> 01:16:30.101
I know.

3056
01:16:30.101 --> 01:16:32.170
That's why I'm curious because you're one of the few guys,

3057
01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:32.681
one of the,

3058
01:16:32.681 --> 01:16:34.670
I consider you a great comment and you've been doing,

3059
01:16:34.671 --> 01:16:34.960
if I'm,

3060
01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.531
everybody does,

3061
01:16:35.531 --> 01:16:36.430
you've been doing it forever,

3062
01:16:36.610 --> 01:16:38.920
but there's very little of your work out there.

3063
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.560
I think there's a showtime that I watched from,

3064
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.340
like would you did a showtime special on?

3065
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:46.510
And I get back in the day and I got that and I burned the master,

3066
01:16:46.511 --> 01:16:47.380
but somehow those account,

3067
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:49.143
um,

3068
01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:51.370
but that's the opposite of what most people do.

3069
01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.710
Most people constantly want to put out new stuff.

3070
01:16:53.711 --> 01:16:55.990
Carlin put out a new hour every year.

3071
01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:56.711
Don't forget it.

3072
01:16:56.711 --> 01:16:56.861
See,

3073
01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:59.920
I was fortunate I had a platform every night on the tonight show.

3074
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.320
I had to do 14 minutes every single night.

3075
01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.400
Okay,

3076
01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.480
so you write 14 and then it's probably 11 or 12 by the time it hits here.

3077
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:10.130
So I didn't need to do special cause

3078
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.700
<v 1>I had a little tiny bit of something out every single day.</v>

3079
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:16.060
A little bit of an advertisement for people to come see it.

3080
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:17.990
And so that's what worked for me.

3081
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:19.520
And before I had that,

3082
01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:22.310
I made sure I did Merv Griffin,

3083
01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:23.144
Mike Douglas,

3084
01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:25.650
and every four to six weeks I would do let them in.

3085
01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.770
And that's how I kept it out there.

3086
01:17:27.771 --> 01:17:29.470
Just give them a little bit of a taste.

3087
01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.860
And when they come to your town,

3088
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:31.861
they're not sticky.

3089
01:17:31.861 --> 01:17:32.360
Yeah,

3090
01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.230
that is interesting because you are definitely seeing a lot of people today that

3091
01:17:36.231 --> 01:17:39.410
are watching stand up from a youtube clip that they're watching it on their

3092
01:17:39.411 --> 01:17:41.480
phone and it's just not going to be the same.

3093
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.811
Yeah,

3094
01:17:41.811 --> 01:17:42.321
it's not,

3095
01:17:42.321 --> 01:17:43.154
it's not the same.

3096
01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:44.750
You need to experience it.

3097
01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:45.110
I,

3098
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.611
you know,

3099
01:17:45.611 --> 01:17:46.444
live.

3100
01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:47.270
Yeah.

3101
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:49.490
It's frustrating to me when I,

3102
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.760
when people say they didn't think something was funny or they didn't think so,

3103
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:53.300
but oh,

3104
01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:55.190
I watched avatar and my iPhone.

3105
01:17:55.190 --> 01:17:56.000
I think it was that great.

3106
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:56.571
Well first of all,

3107
01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:57.770
it's a three d movie.

3108
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:59.930
You can't watch it on your iPhone.

3109
01:17:59.931 --> 01:18:00.560
Stop it.

3110
01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.370
You know,

3111
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:03.330
it's not supposed to be convenient.

3112
01:18:03.331 --> 01:18:06.410
It's comedy is supposed to be in a room that's a little uncomfortable.

3113
01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.570
It's just a little too cold.

3114
01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:10.740
You know all the elements that make up the ceiling.

3115
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:11.660
Yeah.

3116
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:11.781
Yeah.

3117
01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:13.070
We tried to do comedy in Hawaiian.

3118
01:18:13.071 --> 01:18:16.620
You're standing on stage and guys and sale fishes are going by and you know,

3119
01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.920
you know when the sun's out at midnight,

3120
01:18:18.921 --> 01:18:19.754
what are you doing?

3121
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:22.490
Did you ever do stand up in a really,

3122
01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:23.390
really big place?

3123
01:18:23.391 --> 01:18:24.470
Like a giant arena?

3124
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:25.060
Oh Shush.

3125
01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:25.311
You know,

3126
01:18:25.311 --> 01:18:26.210
I did the amphitheater,

3127
01:18:26.211 --> 01:18:28.820
I did all that stuff back in the 80s what do you think about that?

3128
01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.370
Like that seems to me like a,

3129
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:30.651
you know,

3130
01:18:30.651 --> 01:18:34.970
they do this odd ball comedy tour now and they're doing like 20,000 seat places

3131
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:36.283
and you know,

3132
01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:36.780
thought about it.

3133
01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:37.071
I was like,

3134
01:18:37.071 --> 01:18:37.251
man,

3135
01:18:37.251 --> 01:18:39.980
that seems like a lot of God damn people to do standup up for.

3136
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:41.150
Very strange.

3137
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:42.740
It depends what you like.

3138
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:44.203
For example,

3139
01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:49.210
I liked doing standup so I or drive to do ten two thousand seat rooms than one

3140
01:18:51.591 --> 01:18:52.940
20,000 seat row.

3141
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.630
Yeah,

3142
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:55.520
I mean because I like doing it.

3143
01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:57.020
It's fun to do.

3144
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.351
You know,

3145
01:18:57.351 --> 01:18:59.480
it's fun to tell jokes.

3146
01:18:59.481 --> 01:19:03.800
It's fun to see the person right there when you do those 20,000 seat things.

3147
01:19:03.801 --> 01:19:03.980
Okay.

3148
01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:08.150
If there's a light in your eye and you can hear laughs but it's,

3149
01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.190
you're not really experiencing it the same.

3150
01:19:10.191 --> 01:19:11.160
So it depends on,

3151
01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:14.600
I mean I know comics that just let him and was never comfortable in front of

3152
01:19:14.601 --> 01:19:15.240
live audience.

3153
01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:17.330
Dave was not funny as he is.

3154
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:19.010
He just didn't like doing standup.

3155
01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.380
It wasn't just,

3156
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.980
he didn't like me.

3157
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.620
I like it.

3158
01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:25.160
I like reaching out and having the audience.

3159
01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.950
And that's one of the tonight show really came alive for me when I redid the

3160
01:19:27.951 --> 01:19:28.581
studio in,

3161
01:19:28.581 --> 01:19:31.810
brought the audience right up close to me so I could touch hands with people are

3162
01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.200
going to that when I have something pal,

3163
01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:33.411
you know,

3164
01:19:33.411 --> 01:19:34.244
whatever it might be.

3165
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:36.080
So I like it.

3166
01:19:36.081 --> 01:19:38.120
I like the human contact.

3167
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.890
You know,

3168
01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:43.670
standup is probably the most basic form of human communication.

3169
01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:44.600
There's no,

3170
01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.730
with the exception of the microphone,

3171
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:47.953
that's it.

3172
01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:48.951
There's no trick.

3173
01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:49.850
There's no gimmick.

3174
01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.130
It's just humans interacting.

3175
01:19:52.131 --> 01:19:52.640
You know,

3176
01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:57.170
the other reason I like standup is people don't gather any more.

3177
01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:57.711
You know,

3178
01:19:57.711 --> 01:19:58.940
when I grew up in Andover,

3179
01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:02.630
once a month they would have the town meeting at the grange hall,

3180
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:03.351
which is dumb.

3181
01:20:03.351 --> 01:20:04.730
Was that sound in North Andover?

3182
01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.380
And the whole town would show up.

3183
01:20:06.381 --> 01:20:07.214
Nothing ever got,

3184
01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:12.530
but people gathered in a room and it was fun to experience a room full of people

3185
01:20:13.561 --> 01:20:15.000
laughing or reacting to something.

3186
01:20:15.001 --> 01:20:16.950
Now everybody taxes or sits,

3187
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.350
there's a social awkwardness of the iPhone.

3188
01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.510
But when you put people in a little room,

3189
01:20:21.511 --> 01:20:22.410
it's a little uncomfortable.

3190
01:20:22.411 --> 01:20:23.850
And he got on stage and he talked to him.

3191
01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.400
And that room is Roland with laughs.

3192
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:28.320
It's really the greatest thing in the world.

3193
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:29.250
It's unbelievable.

3194
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:30.021
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

3195
01:20:30.021 --> 01:20:30.680
I agree.

3196
01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:35.600
I think it's an amazing art form and it's the most fun for me to watch as well

3197
01:20:35.601 --> 01:20:36.231
as to do.

3198
01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:36.890
I love,

3199
01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:37.671
I love watching it.

3200
01:20:37.671 --> 01:20:40.730
I still love sitting in the back of the saw Tom Papa last night.

3201
01:20:40.731 --> 01:20:41.564
He was hilarious.

3202
01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.410
He was really good at,

3203
01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:42.660
no,

3204
01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:43.820
he's so funny.

3205
01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:44.751
And uh,

3206
01:20:44.751 --> 01:20:45.171
you know,

3207
01:20:45.171 --> 01:20:48.860
I got to sit in the back of the room after I got off stage and watch them at the

3208
01:20:48.861 --> 01:20:50.030
back of the comedy store and I'm like,

3209
01:20:50.031 --> 01:20:50.181
yeah,

3210
01:20:50.181 --> 01:20:52.760
I just still love it as an art form.

3211
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:53.390
<v 1>I mean,</v>

3212
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:55.250
to me it's like listening to music.

3213
01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:56.001
You know,

3214
01:20:56.001 --> 01:20:57.500
I met when I first met Letterman,

3215
01:20:57.501 --> 01:21:01.400
I didn't really know Dave and I saw him at the comedy store and Dave had a great

3216
01:21:01.401 --> 01:21:02.750
way to turn a phrase.

3217
01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:03.920
I remember he had a,

3218
01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:06.110
I don't do the joke justice.

3219
01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:06.531
He said,

3220
01:21:06.531 --> 01:21:11.531
I joke about you was talking about editorials on small town TV stations and we

3221
01:21:13.251 --> 01:21:17.480
at w whatever are diametrically opposed to the practice of using orphans as

3222
01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:19.790
yardage markers on public golf courses,

3223
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:20.683
something like that.

3224
01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:21.793
And I thought,

3225
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:23.420
I just liked the way he phrased it.

3226
01:21:23.421 --> 01:21:28.040
To me that's like listening to a James Taylor song just to weigh all those words

3227
01:21:28.041 --> 01:21:28.874
come together.

3228
01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.151
You know,

3229
01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:29.801
when Seinfeld,

3230
01:21:29.801 --> 01:21:31.060
he used to have a bit about uh,

3231
01:21:31.670 --> 01:21:33.300
going to the dodge them cars.

3232
01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.153
It's and,

3233
01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.550
and the hopeless father and son team and I,

3234
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:40.310
I like hopeless father and so I just liked the way they phrase things.

3235
01:21:40.311 --> 01:21:41.060
So to me,

3236
01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:42.530
listening to good comedy,

3237
01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:43.850
I can listen to it over and over.

3238
01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:44.501
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

3239
01:21:44.501 --> 01:21:44.830
no,

3240
01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:45.580
I agree.

3241
01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:45.780
Uh,

3242
01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:47.170
I love listening to,

3243
01:21:47.171 --> 01:21:47.410
uh,

3244
01:21:47.410 --> 01:21:50.860
the way certain people phrase things and like you were saying about how you

3245
01:21:50.861 --> 01:21:54.130
going on stage after listening and reciting Carlin in your head,

3246
01:21:54.490 --> 01:21:55.840
how it sort of helped you,

3247
01:21:55.841 --> 01:21:57.460
like get that rhythm and cadence.

3248
01:21:57.730 --> 01:21:57.941
You know,

3249
01:21:57.941 --> 01:21:58.601
a hundred Thompson,

3250
01:21:58.601 --> 01:21:59.231
you should do that.

3251
01:21:59.231 --> 01:22:00.820
He used to write the great Gatsby,

3252
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:01.900
he used to write it out.

3253
01:22:01.901 --> 01:22:02.170
Like,

3254
01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:06.190
I'll just copy the great Gatsby to sort of learn the rhythm of the words.

3255
01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:08.770
I think a lot of us have experienced,

3256
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:09.490
uh,

3257
01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:14.350
going on stage and sort of feeling like you're doing someone else's cadence and

3258
01:22:14.351 --> 01:22:15.184
rhythm.

3259
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:19.540
I caught myself once stent one time on stage at the comedy connection and I felt

3260
01:22:19.541 --> 01:22:21.820
like I was in the middle of doing Richard Jenny.

3261
01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:22.181
I was like,

3262
01:22:22.181 --> 01:22:24.840
I was being Richard Jenny while I was on stage.

3263
01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:25.150
I was like,

3264
01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:25.540
Ooh,

3265
01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.850
like I'm kind of stealing this guys.

3266
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:28.091
Oh,

3267
01:22:28.091 --> 01:22:29.350
he was the hilarious comic.

3268
01:22:29.351 --> 01:22:30.310
He's a terrific comic.

3269
01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:30.850
Richard.

3270
01:22:30.850 --> 01:22:32.060
He was one of the best that,

3271
01:22:32.061 --> 01:22:33.270
that people don't talk about.

3272
01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.780
He was one of those guys that sort of the guise of today maybe don't realize how

3273
01:22:37.781 --> 01:22:38.490
great that,

3274
01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:38.770
<v 1>yes,</v>

3275
01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:38.910
no,

3276
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:39.743
he really was.

3277
01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:41.131
Yeah.

3278
01:22:41.131 --> 01:22:44.640
He was a one of the best at taking a bit and stretching it out too.

3279
01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:45.001
I love,

3280
01:22:45.001 --> 01:22:46.110
it's been on gay marriage.

3281
01:22:46.111 --> 01:22:46.381
You know,

3282
01:22:46.381 --> 01:22:47.850
this was before gay marriage is legal,

3283
01:22:47.851 --> 01:22:48.684
obviously,

3284
01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:52.020
and he used to do a bit about how great it was for gay guys.

3285
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:52.710
Bob,

3286
01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:53.880
I'd love to marry you,

3287
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.100
but it's against the law.

3288
01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:57.080
That'd be,

3289
01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.100
I used to love what he did that it used to really make you laugh.

3290
01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:00.691
Look,

3291
01:23:00.691 --> 01:23:01.260
Steve,

3292
01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:01.831
I'd love to,

3293
01:23:01.831 --> 01:23:03.360
but it's against the law.

3294
01:23:03.361 --> 01:23:03.900
You know,

3295
01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.120
it was the perfect excused

3296
01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:06.880
<v 0>not to get married.</v>

3297
01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.880
It's against the law are hilarious and he would take a bit and stretch it out

3298
01:23:12.641 --> 01:23:13.421
over seven,

3299
01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:14.171
10 minutes.

3300
01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:14.441
I mean,

3301
01:23:14.441 --> 01:23:19.070
he would find every single nook and cranny that that could be explored.

3302
01:23:19.071 --> 01:23:19.451
The Guy,

3303
01:23:19.451 --> 01:23:21.940
but sort of insecure but very funny guy.

3304
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.863
He was troubled.

3305
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:23.081
Yeah.

3306
01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:24.310
He was trouble like Manny,

3307
01:23:24.311 --> 01:23:25.690
but so disciplined.

3308
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:26.290
Yeah.

3309
01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:27.550
Constantly working.

3310
01:23:27.551 --> 01:23:28.480
Constantly writing.

3311
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:29.790
Numasizing fell is like that.

3312
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.700
Very disciplined,

3313
01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:34.900
really rights and comes up with new stuff and you can see the difference too.

3314
01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:40.170
You can see the jokes come every six to nine seconds versus every 30 seconds or

3315
01:23:42.911 --> 01:23:43.331
some guy,

3316
01:23:43.331 --> 01:23:43.601
hey,

3317
01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:44.440
y'all good mood.

3318
01:23:44.441 --> 01:23:45.160
How y'all doing?

3319
01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:45.630
Yeah.

3320
01:23:45.630 --> 01:23:46.040
Woo.

3321
01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:48.010
That's how you get to the joke.

3322
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:48.411
Right,

3323
01:23:48.411 --> 01:23:48.641
right,

3324
01:23:48.641 --> 01:23:48.940
right.

3325
01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:49.773
Yeah.

3326
01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:50.370
Yeah.

3327
01:23:50.370 --> 01:23:53.890
That's that old school attitude to the people don't have a lot of attention.

3328
01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:54.470
They just,

3329
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:55.570
they don't have much time for this.

3330
01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:55.870
Right.

3331
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:56.030
Go,

3332
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.181
go,

3333
01:23:56.181 --> 01:23:56.301
go,

3334
01:23:56.301 --> 01:23:56.471
go,

3335
01:23:56.471 --> 01:23:57.100
go.

3336
01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.750
Seinfeld's one of the few guys at rivals.

3337
01:23:58.751 --> 01:23:59.860
You as a car collector too.

3338
01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:00.820
I'm not quite,

3339
01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:00.941
well,

3340
01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:01.780
he's a Porsche guy.

3341
01:24:01.781 --> 01:24:02.870
He just only Porsche.

3342
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:04.783
He has a thing.

3343
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:05.701
He's an expert now.

3344
01:24:05.701 --> 01:24:07.300
He's got some German self Mercedes,

3345
01:24:07.301 --> 01:24:07.660
but,

3346
01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:08.770
but he's a real expert.

3347
01:24:08.771 --> 01:24:09.640
He knows his stuff.

3348
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:10.120
Okay.

3349
01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:10.391
Yeah,

3350
01:24:10.391 --> 01:24:12.210
that comedians in cars getting coffee.

3351
01:24:12.211 --> 01:24:13.450
He's a very interesting show.

3352
01:24:13.451 --> 01:24:14.111
It's a great show.

3353
01:24:14.111 --> 01:24:15.190
It's really fun.

3354
01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:16.330
You know,

3355
01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:18.730
everybody tells you you can't do is a perfect example.

3356
01:24:18.731 --> 01:24:20.330
The Seinfeld show about nothing now.

3357
01:24:20.331 --> 01:24:23.870
No one's going to watch that biggest show of ever when he had this idea,

3358
01:24:23.871 --> 01:24:24.730
I would just drive around.

3359
01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:25.810
We just talk about whatever we want.

3360
01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:26.111
No,

3361
01:24:26.111 --> 01:24:26.291
no,

3362
01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:27.670
you got to have it all laid out for us.

3363
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:27.881
No,

3364
01:24:27.881 --> 01:24:28.511
you don't.

3365
01:24:28.511 --> 01:24:30.040
And he proved that you didn't need to.

3366
01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:30.581
Well,

3367
01:24:30.581 --> 01:24:32.680
that's what's going on with the Internet is that you don't,

3368
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:36.970
the idea that these producers and executives and directors have always had that

3369
01:24:36.971 --> 01:24:37.804
run networks,

3370
01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:39.820
that this is the only way to be entertaining.

3371
01:24:39.850 --> 01:24:42.120
They're wrong and it's just another way to be entertained.

3372
01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:42.791
But you watch,

3373
01:24:42.791 --> 01:24:44.770
it'll come full circle again and people go,

3374
01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:46.500
I'm sick of this free form stuff.

3375
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:47.410
I want something a little more,

3376
01:24:47.411 --> 01:24:47.741
you know,

3377
01:24:47.741 --> 01:24:48.574
so you just,

3378
01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:50.410
it's just the age of living.

3379
01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.530
Most people do this show and they make it about an hour,

3380
01:24:53.531 --> 01:24:55.660
maybe an hour and 20 before they have to take a leak.

3381
01:24:55.810 --> 01:24:56.130
Yeah,

3382
01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:56.591
you will click.

3383
01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:57.520
You're about right there.

3384
01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:57.791
No,

3385
01:24:57.791 --> 01:24:58.624
I don't need to take a leak.

3386
01:24:59.170 --> 01:25:00.350
I thought the show was an hour.

3387
01:25:00.450 --> 01:25:01.570
It's as long as you want it to be.

3388
01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:01.811
Oh,

3389
01:25:01.811 --> 01:25:02.644
we can end it right now.

3390
01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:03.910
I've got a meeting at one,

3391
01:25:03.911 --> 01:25:04.630
but let's,

3392
01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:05.530
let's wrap it up then.

3393
01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:05.921
Okay.

3394
01:25:05.921 --> 01:25:06.754
We'll wrap it up.

3395
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:07.690
Thank you very much.

3396
01:25:07.691 --> 01:25:08.310
Really appreciate.

3397
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.921
Thanks for having me.

3398
01:25:08.921 --> 01:25:09.190
I really,

3399
01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:10.600
anytime you ever want to come back again,

3400
01:25:10.601 --> 01:25:12.970
it would be more than honored to have you call me and I'm here.

3401
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.590
It was an honor to do your show.

3402
01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:15.520
I love your show.

3403
01:25:15.521 --> 01:25:16.570
Jay Leno's garage.

3404
01:25:16.571 --> 01:25:20.540
My episode is on this week with my 1965 corvette and a,

3405
01:25:20.541 --> 01:25:20.691
well,

3406
01:25:20.691 --> 01:25:24.910
it was an honor to gum and tour your facility on with the shovel and the a.

3407
01:25:24.911 --> 01:25:26.050
And the absolutely.

3408
01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:26.801
Absolutely.

3409
01:25:26.801 --> 01:25:27.071
Love you,

3410
01:25:27.071 --> 01:25:27.311
buddy.

3411
01:25:27.311 --> 01:25:27.571
Thank you.

3412
01:25:27.571 --> 01:25:28.404
I appreciate it.

3413
01:25:34.290 --> 01:25:35.123
<v 3>Alright.</v>

3414
