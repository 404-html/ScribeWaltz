<v Speaker 1>I work for the CIA protecting America.</v>

22
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.951

<v Speaker 1>he was just making it up,</v>

24
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>but he did it for the longest time.</v>

25
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy built them out of $1 million over a decade.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's like it's more in competence than it is anything.</v>

32
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It's more human Horesh behavior.</v>

33
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>It's greed than it is anything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You were really working on climate change.</v>

61
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>It was just getting mad cash.</v>

62
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Just bawling every night.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we have to allow a certain amount.</v>

71
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I am horrified by the gaping but we have to allow a certain amount.</v>

72
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>If we don't allow it,</v>

73
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>it's then we're going to lose a lot of the people that would be with us against</v>

74
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 1>this child.</v>

75
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>My job to measure the diameter of the gate because if it gets beyond a certain</v>

76
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

77
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>if we start getting ostrich like we've got to cancel the program.</v>
