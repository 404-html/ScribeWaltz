00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.030
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 2>so high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tap it and pull this sucker from your </v>

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

8
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate it.</v>

9
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I've watched a bunch of your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have listened to a bunch of your talks,</v>

11
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:23.840
<v Speaker 2>read a bunch of your work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting person.</v>

12
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 2>And this is a good time for a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you.</v>

13
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Things seem to be kind of scrambled a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

14
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:33.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little topsy turvy out there these </v>

15
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:33.821
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit crazy.</v>

16
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:36.230
<v Speaker 2>So you're a sex neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that an accurate description?</v>

17
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm a former</v>

18
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 3>academic sex researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

19
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:44.181
<v Speaker 3>my Phd's in sexual neuroscience research</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I work as a science journalist </v>

20
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 3>and a columnist.</v>

21
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 2>And why former</v>

22
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 3>because the climate and academia has </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed so much,</v>

23
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 3>like you mentioned how things are topsy </v>
<v Speaker 3>turvy,</v>

24
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 3>but that's pretty much how you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>describe academia nowadays.</v>

25
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 3>Even in the hard sciences.</v>

26
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

27
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 2>it's getting a little weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you attribute it to?</v>

28
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a combination of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a particular ideologies </v>

29
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.980
<v Speaker 3>coming in and taking over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've been there for awhile,</v>

30
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.710
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's at that they've reached</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream.</v>

31
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 3>I see it as political correctness </v>
<v Speaker 3>running a mock and I see it as </v>

32
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.841
<v Speaker 3>legitimate researchers not being able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak out because they've got enough on </v>

33
00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 3>their plate with their research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their teaching.</v>

34
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 3>They've got their students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

35
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:30.470
<v Speaker 3>they're super busy and then on top of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to deal with the mobbing</v>

36
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 3>that will inevitably happen if they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak out.</v>

37
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.600
<v Speaker 3>So things are kind of in favor right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the craziness.</v>

38
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.490
<v Speaker 2>But it's fascinating though as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>outsider to watch the craziness.</v>

39
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm glad I don't have to be in </v>

40
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.660
<v Speaker 2>school right now and deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to watch it from the outside,</v>

41
00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:48.460
<v Speaker 2>it's just so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

42
00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 2>In what way though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

43
00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:54.571
<v Speaker 2>because it's almost like there's a sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a delusional aspect to it,</v>

44
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.660
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

45
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 2>an agreed upon delusional aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

46
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 2>like the gender one in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gender is very strange right now.</v>

47
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

48
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's first of all the Lbgtq.</v>

49
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 2>I a what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Et cetera.</v>

50
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're adding more to it.</v>

51
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 2>They keep adding more yet to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>inclusive.</v>

52
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

53
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 2>something going on.</v>

54
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Focus is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

55
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

56
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

57
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I thought maybe we were down again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

58
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just.</v>

59
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 2>But gender in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I said about one of </v>

60
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.671
<v Speaker 2>the more bizarre things about today's </v>
<v Speaker 2>political climate is that people </v>

61
00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:43.831
<v Speaker 2>selectively agree with science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when it comes to client </v>

62
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:46.870
<v Speaker 2>climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everybody is like pro science,</v>

63
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:48.970
<v Speaker 2>like science all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the studies.</v>

64
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Even when they don't even understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies.</v>

65
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:56.161
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a famous and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get in trouble when you bring up </v>

66
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Tucker Carlson because people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

67
00:02:57.851 --> 00:02:59.910
<v Speaker 2>you're a target Carlson fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

68
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.240
<v Speaker 4>just as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to make.</v>

69
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 4>He made some very good points with Bill </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nye.</v>

70
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.860
<v Speaker 4>He had bill Nye on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about science and he </v>

71
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.860
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

72
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 4>if human beings are responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 4>climate change,</v>

73
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 4>what percentage?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the numbers like?</v>

74
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 4>Bill Nye really isn't a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a science.</v>

75
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would your personality,</v>

76
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 4>those immediate personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a guy who's a,</v>

77
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a promoter of science,</v>

78
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 4>but not really necessarily scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's.</v>

79
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.200
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't have long term study and </v>

80
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 4>research to climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just sort of on there in a slightly</v>

81
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 4>arrogant way saying things that I agree </v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

82
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 4>What I agree with is that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>are responsible,</v>

83
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 4>at least in part with climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what all the research points to,</v>

84
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 4>but when Tucker Carlson was pressing him</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it,</v>

85
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 4>he really didn't have any answers for </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

86
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 4>so it's one of those things where like </v>
<v Speaker 4>people on the left will blindly support </v>

87
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.180
<v Speaker 4>science in one way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that you or me?</v>

88
00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 4>Dang it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's me,</v>

89
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:00.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be very upset with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's me,</v>

90
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 4>but then when it comes to gender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you watch his show.</v>

91
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:09.770
<v Speaker 4>He's got this wacky show on Netflix </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're.</v>

92
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 4>They're singing songs about gender can </v>
<v Speaker 4>be fluid and gender could be.</v>

93
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 4>This is more than two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 4>There's more than two genders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which he didn't use to say.</v>

95
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 4>If you go back to one of his old.</v>

96
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.810
<v Speaker 3>I did see that there was another episode</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they clearly say that gender is </v>

97
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.810
<v Speaker 3>binary.</v>

98
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was like way back before all this </v>

99
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.121
<v Speaker 4>nuttiness staff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's influencing people who are in </v>

100
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:35.760
<v Speaker 4>the people are deciding instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>supporting science and supporting the </v>

101
00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:40.940
<v Speaker 4>research on actual human beings as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological organism.</v>

102
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.370
<v Speaker 4>Instead we're going with this bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 4>politically correct climate which </v>

103
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.311
<v Speaker 4>inclines people to this weird delusional</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking and as an outsider,</v>

104
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.590
<v Speaker 4>that's what's interesting to me to watch</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this scrambling,</v>

105
00:04:54.591 --> 00:04:56.660
<v Speaker 4>look at this weirdness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

106
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 3>it's hypocritical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It definitely is.</v>

107
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 3>And it's interesting to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean say the March for Science,</v>

108
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 3>I attended that not this past year but </v>
<v Speaker 3>the year before.</v>

109
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 3>So people are there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're super excited about science,</v>

110
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 3>pro science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think science is great.</v>

111
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 3>All this money should go into science </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you ask them,</v>

112
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're.</v>

113
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 3>So you're down for climate change being </v>
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

114
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:19.081
<v Speaker 3>but what about science?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now by the left and I asked so many </v>

115
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 3>people this while I was there because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was reporting on it for playboy.com</v>

116
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 3>and it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People get very uncomfortable.</v>

117
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.810
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to say anything about I </v>

118
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.181
<v Speaker 3>would consider myself to be a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but definitely liberals don't want to </v>

119
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:32.671
<v Speaker 3>think about themselves being science </v>
<v Speaker 3>deniers and when you look at how people </v>

120
00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 3>talk about gender now and biological sex</v>
<v Speaker 3>differences in the brain,</v>

121
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 3>even biology more generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get very defensive.</v>

122
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 3>They get angry almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if they find it threatening for some</v>

123
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't understand,</v>

124
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 3>and that's a big part of my work is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

125
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.240
<v Speaker 3>I think we can acknowledge that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts exist and that biological sciences</v>

126
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 3>legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that sexism is okay.</v>

127
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 3>We're not saying that women are inferior</v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything like that.</v>

128
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the big point about all this,</v>

129
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:03.581
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that we're not saying that anyone's </v>

130
00:06:03.581 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 4>inferior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're just not the same thing.</v>

131
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 4>This is what the big problem is to try </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>

132
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

133
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.400
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I certainly think we should all have </v>

134
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.701
<v Speaker 4>equal rights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're not equal in terms of what we </v>

135
00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:15.701
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're a different we're.</v>

136
00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 4>And it's not that we're not equal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one's better.</v>

137
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 4>It's just like saying a wolf is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>equal to achieve their fucking different</v>

138
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 4>things and males and females are </v>
<v Speaker 4>different things and this is,</v>

139
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 4>this is clear when you study us as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>organism,</v>

140
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a really bizarre conversation once</v>

141
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:38.411
<v Speaker 4>with a guy who's a professor or a former</v>
<v Speaker 4>professor and he was trying to deny that</v>

142
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.610
<v Speaker 4>there there's a difference between men </v>
<v Speaker 4>and women and one of the things I said,</v>

143
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

144
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 4>you get a dog.</v>

145
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 4>Do you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this a boy dog or a girl dog?</v>

146
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 4>And then he got real weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is really no answer to that.</v>

147
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a fucking boy dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want a boy dog,</v>

148
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a nonbinary dog?</v>

149
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 4>Like what is your dog?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might change.</v>

150
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 4>It's fine to Milo your dog gender fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is gender fluid?</v>

151
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.120
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this idea that you can be one </v>

152
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.551
<v Speaker 4>gender one day and another gentleman the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other day or it might cycle through the </v>

153
00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:12.851
<v Speaker 4>day or doesn't your mix of both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems like if it was anything else,</v>

154
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 4>you would have to be fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

155
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:20.921
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything else you feel like if you </v>

156
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:20.921
<v Speaker 4>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well today I'm African,</v>

157
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:21.490
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow I'm Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

158
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>today I'm tall tomorrow.</v>

159
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm short today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Pixie tomorrow,</v>

160
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 4>but what else like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody is.</v>

161
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to call it something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>gender fluid.</v>

162
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.990
<v Speaker 4>Everyone is a mix of male and female.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have people that are maybe more </v>

163
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 4>typically masculine and feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even still there,</v>

164
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there are many people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are 100 percent one way or the other </v>

165
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:42.730
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

166
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 4>what does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

167
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:47.570
<v Speaker 4>people are clearly more masculine than </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people,</v>

168
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:49.480
<v Speaker 4>but does that mean that the people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

169
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 4>let's pick a person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Nye.</v>

170
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean he's not a man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's clearly a man.</v>

171
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 4>He's clearly a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not a Lebron James,</v>

172
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 4>but he's a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

173
00:07:58.581 --> 00:07:59.090
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

174
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.120
<v Speaker 4>there's obviously a spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I almost feel like that way of </v>

175
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.211
<v Speaker 4>thinking is more old fashioned because </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all about being progressive and </v>

176
00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 4>open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think if someone is a man,</v>

177
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:12.911
<v Speaker 4>but it's maybe more female typical to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say that this person has a different </v>

178
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:15.500
<v Speaker 4>category of gender or that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>mail,</v>

179
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 4>to me that's more stereotypical.</v>

180
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.570
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's not progressive to say if </v>

181
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:22.570
<v Speaker 4>you're a mix of both,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must be something different.</v>

182
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not necessarily a mix of both,</v>

183
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:29.651
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just have a different hormonal </v>

184
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 4>profile are different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a different body types.</v>

185
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 4>Different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean people vary so much that.</v>

186
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think having some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>categories to say,</v>

187
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a male and this is a female.</v>

188
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.540
<v Speaker 4>It seems like pretty beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean although we vary so widely inside</v>

189
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:52.661
<v Speaker 4>those categories to pretend that those </v>
<v Speaker 4>categories don't exist just seems so </v>

190
00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:56.651
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would never do that with any other </v>

191
00:08:56.651 --> 00:08:56.651
<v Speaker 4>organism and it's a lot work to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see</v>

192
00:08:56.651 --> 00:09:01.130
<v Speaker 3>these companies going in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to be more and with the </v>

193
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 3>times I guess are there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is gender neutral now and I'm</v>

194
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:07.041
<v Speaker 3>thinking all of that money and time is </v>
<v Speaker 3>being wasted when I don't think that </v>

195
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:08.370
<v Speaker 3>does anything for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for women or sexism.</v>

196
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.480
<v Speaker 3>If you changed instead of addressing </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone by ladies and gentlemen,</v>

197
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 3>you say people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that really gonna stop sexism.</v>

198
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 3>It just makes people mad because then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to change the way they talk.</v>

199
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I put a story on twitter the other day </v>
<v Speaker 2>about people that are raising their kids</v>

200
00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:24.520
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

201
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

202
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.250
<v Speaker 3>calling them babies instead of babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oftentimes.</v>

203
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.760
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is that like her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just.</v>

204
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I think it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For some parents that's coming from a </v>

205
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.361
<v Speaker 3>good place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they obviously want the best for </v>

206
00:09:40.361 --> 00:09:42.071
<v Speaker 3>their kids and they don't want to limit </v>
<v Speaker 3>the kid in terms of what they might be </v>

207
00:09:42.071 --> 00:09:46.061
<v Speaker 3>interested and I think because the media</v>
<v Speaker 3>is telling them if you let girls play </v>

208
00:09:46.061 --> 00:09:46.910
<v Speaker 3>with dolls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's terrible and they're going to end</v>

209
00:09:46.911 --> 00:09:47.600
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

210
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.190
<v Speaker 3>not having any sort of prospects when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they grow up in terms of their jobs or I</v>

211
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:53.660
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a terrible thing to be female.</v>

212
00:09:53.661 --> 00:09:58.661
<v Speaker 3>Typical nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean like you mentioned is </v>

213
00:09:58.661 --> 00:10:01.631
<v Speaker 3>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to dictate what your kids </v>

214
00:10:01.631 --> 00:10:03.311
<v Speaker 3>play with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in other cases I think it's </v>

215
00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:03.311
<v Speaker 3>parents that want to be special.</v>

216
00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also weird because if your son is </v>

217
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 2>trans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's totally fine for him to be female.</v>

218
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:13.191
<v Speaker 2>Typical like it's celebrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have a trans son and he </v>

219
00:10:13.191 --> 00:10:17.361
<v Speaker 2>likes wearing lipstick and short skirts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and prints and around then he's </v>

220
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:21.591
<v Speaker 2>fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a boy in New York and </v>

221
00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:25.641
<v Speaker 2>there was this whole thing about he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the youngest ever drag queen and and </v>

222
00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:26.370
<v Speaker 2>everybody's going crazy and people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry about it,</v>

223
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

224
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:33.201
<v Speaker 2>Some people were angry and saying he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>being exploited by his parents and some </v>

225
00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:37.431
<v Speaker 2>people thought it was wonderful that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid was so expressive when he's so </v>

226
00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:37.750
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then other people say,</v>

227
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I had a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

228
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very sexualized.</v>

229
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:46.191
<v Speaker 2>Like how is this any different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's in a beauty pageant like </v>

230
00:10:46.191 --> 00:10:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Jon Benet Ramsey type situation when </v>
<v Speaker 2>were really young.</v>

231
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:52.650
<v Speaker 3>If it was a little girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would be up in arms sexist and </v>

232
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.010
<v Speaker 3>that it's the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that little boy,</v>

233
00:10:54.011 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know that he's trans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that he just likes to like,</v>

234
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.460
<v Speaker 3>like a man who's a drag queen is just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

235
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.220
<v Speaker 3>It's usually gay men who likes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

236
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.040
<v Speaker 3>like an extreme form of femininity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love drag Queens,</v>

237
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.400
<v Speaker 3>but I think that little boy is likely </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to grow up to be a gay boy.</v>

238
00:11:09.401 --> 00:11:14.401
<v Speaker 3>If you have a little boy who says he's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>girl and you see a lot of these trans </v>

239
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:17.641
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were left alone and they didn't </v>

240
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:20.371
<v Speaker 3>transition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would likely research shows they </v>

241
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:20.470
<v Speaker 3>would grow up to be gay men is.</v>

242
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

243
00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent for freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

244
00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:27.880
<v Speaker 2>so I'm 100 percent for you being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever you want to do.</v>

245
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.890
<v Speaker 2>The real question becomes when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are Trans and young,</v>

246
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of this is going to pass and </v>

247
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:44.611
<v Speaker 2>how much of this are you going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>from ever passing because you're going </v>

248
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:45.190
<v Speaker 2>to inject your body filled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>hormones,</v>

249
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:50.460
<v Speaker 2>like are you giving yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity just to decide to become a </v>

250
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 2>gay man versus become a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you be happier either or.</v>

251
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 4>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very tricky,</v>

252
00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 3>but you can't even have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation because that's considered </v>

253
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.790
<v Speaker 3>transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it is is homophobic though that you</v>

254
00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:04.610
<v Speaker 3>can consider that some of these kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>just might be gay children.</v>

255
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

256
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.000
<v Speaker 4>but then the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The gender fluid one.</v>

257
00:12:08.001 --> 00:12:13.001
<v Speaker 4>I was reading this article about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who varies by the day and like in </v>

258
00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:16.790
<v Speaker 4>the day like he'll have periods of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stress will switch over to a woman.</v>

259
00:12:16.791 --> 00:12:21.380
<v Speaker 4>There was actually a radiolab podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they interviewed a person that has</v>

260
00:12:21.381 --> 00:12:26.381
<v Speaker 4>the same issue and the person was </v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly abnormal in the way they </v>

261
00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:32.831
<v Speaker 4>communicated and the way they thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like you were dealing with </v>

262
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:33.950
<v Speaker 4>some guy that you would trust with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>taxes.</v>

263
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:39.190
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like the dude was wacky and then </v>

264
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.041
<v Speaker 4>now he's a check and now he's back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a guy and so he actually </v>

265
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:45.641
<v Speaker 4>transitioned in mid conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like physically I didn't see it because </v>

266
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.990
<v Speaker 4>it's just listening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

267
00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:49.220
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's like,</v>

268
00:12:49.221 --> 00:12:50.180
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I'm Peter again.</v>

269
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:50.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see what you mean.</v>

270
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.170
<v Speaker 4>Not Wendy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi Wendy.</v>

271
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:54.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

272
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much of that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>indulgent.</v>

273
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want.</v>

274
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say I know how you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do want to say,</v>

275
00:13:03.801 --> 00:13:05.900
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you fucking crazy?</v>

276
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.340
<v Speaker 4>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are we just.</v>

277
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.800
<v Speaker 4>Are we just indulging crazy people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to be.</v>

278
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I do believe there are people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>trans.</v>

279
00:13:12.621 --> 00:13:17.621
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely believe that there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>women that really are wired the wrong </v>

280
00:13:17.781 --> 00:13:20.240
<v Speaker 4>way and they should be men and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>men that are wired the wrong.</v>

281
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.460
<v Speaker 4>It only makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It only makes sense.</v>

282
00:13:22.461 --> 00:13:27.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do also think there's people that </v>

283
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:31.031
<v Speaker 4>are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people that have legit mental </v>

284
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:34.160
<v Speaker 4>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're delusional and they're also very</v>

285
00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:37.670
<v Speaker 4>susceptible to influence and very </v>
<v Speaker 4>susceptible to,</v>

286
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone persuading them that they are </v>

287
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.790
<v Speaker 4>one thing or another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

288
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 4>it's those like heaven's gate cult </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who cut their balls off and wore </v>

289
00:13:48.951 --> 00:13:53.951
<v Speaker 4>the Nike's and decided to kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves when the comment was near </v>

290
00:13:53.951 --> 00:13:54.470
<v Speaker 4>number that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not normal.</v>

291
00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.860
<v Speaker 4>It's not normal for someone to be able </v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk to you any cutting your balls </v>

292
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.730
<v Speaker 4>off or putting on the purple sneakers or</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing yourself when the comments close</v>

293
00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 4>because there's a spaceship waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to take you to Xenu or </v>

294
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 4>wherever the fuck you going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

295
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.871
<v Speaker 4>That's not normal either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we know that people are subject to </v>

296
00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:14.501
<v Speaker 4>very irrational behavior under the </v>
<v Speaker 4>influence of other people's suggestions </v>

297
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:14.720
<v Speaker 4>or other people's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

298
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 4>persuasion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

299
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.010
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is a thing today where you have</v>

300
00:14:19.011 --> 00:14:23.120
<v Speaker 4>to wonder like how many of these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are legitimately trans,</v>

301
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 4>how many of these people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimately dealing with like a real </v>

302
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.961
<v Speaker 4>mental issue that's causing them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>shift from male to female and back </v>

303
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:35.921
<v Speaker 4>again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And why is it that we can't ask these </v>

304
00:14:35.921 --> 00:14:37.790
<v Speaker 4>questions because why is it that even </v>
<v Speaker 4>this question right now,</v>

305
00:14:37.791 --> 00:14:42.791
<v Speaker 4>I could be accused of being transphobic </v>
<v Speaker 4>for asking how many of these people are </v>

306
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:42.890
<v Speaker 4>ill?</v>

307
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well both of us were going to be accused</v>

308
00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:46.740
<v Speaker 3>of transphobia after this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

309
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would agree with that.</v>

310
00:14:48.181 --> 00:14:53.181
<v Speaker 3>I do think that gender dysphoria is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon and I do have a lot of </v>

311
00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:55.700
<v Speaker 3>empathy for people who are suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think for adults,</v>

312
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 3>they should be allowed to transition if </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they decide to do,</v>

313
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 3>if that's something that will help them </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel better.</v>

314
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.540
<v Speaker 3>My issues with the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

315
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's appropriate for </v>

316
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:07.560
<v Speaker 3>children to be transitioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can talk a bit more about why,</v>

317
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.930
<v Speaker 3>but I think in terms of the pathology </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect,</v>

318
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 3>I think for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because gender is so trendy right now,</v>

319
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:17.230
<v Speaker 3>and in the past you might have seen this</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of pathology manifests in a </v>

320
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:21.521
<v Speaker 3>different way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now because everyone is saying is </v>

321
00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:21.521
<v Speaker 3>the way to express,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

322
00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:23.480
<v Speaker 3>I think people also see a fever problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your life.</v>

323
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.960
<v Speaker 3>They think it's gender related,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so say with some of the personality </v>

324
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 3>disorder and people like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>

325
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.280
<v Speaker 3>they like to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

326
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.700
<v Speaker 3>it's always about them and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity and their identity shifts a </v>

327
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.551
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this could very well be what it is </v>

328
00:15:39.551 --> 00:15:39.551
<v Speaker 3>and now they're being basically rewarded</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

329
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the issue,</v>

330
00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:45.541
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you're dealing with incredibly </v>

331
00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:48.091
<v Speaker 2>indulgent people which do exist and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they find this pathway to massive </v>

332
00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:49.850
<v Speaker 2>amounts of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

333
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:50.500
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

334
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I had to construct a bit to mock Caitlyn</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jenner,</v>

335
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.290
<v Speaker 2>but it was a very complicated bit like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to figure out how to do this.</v>

336
00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.230
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously this is nonsense and foolish,</v>

337
00:16:02.231 --> 00:16:04.930
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to appear cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what is the way to do this?</v>

338
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:10.170
<v Speaker 2>So my way was to mock myself mercilessly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and which is kind of true.</v>

339
00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:15.361
<v Speaker 2>Like I really do have three daughters </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I really do get brutalized in my </v>

340
00:16:15.361 --> 00:16:16.090
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I really do think they chip away at</v>

341
00:16:16.091 --> 00:16:17.530
<v Speaker 2>my note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a joke,</v>

342
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.130
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all girly in my house.</v>

343
00:16:21.131 --> 00:16:23.500
<v Speaker 2>My fucking house is so girly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's girly.</v>

344
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.020
<v Speaker 2>They're always talking about girly shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of hilarious.</v>

345
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.610
<v Speaker 2>But the joke was that if my manhood was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a mountain of marbles,</v>

346
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:35.670
<v Speaker 2>every day they take two marbles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just take one like you don't even </v>

347
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.980
<v Speaker 2>need these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

348
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.450
<v Speaker 2>what do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

349
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.720
<v Speaker 2>And then that I'm not going to go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Bruce Jenner,</v>

350
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 2>that one the one day that they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to concoct this whole thing </v>

351
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.851
<v Speaker 2>that they were demons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how they conjured up all that </v>

352
00:16:50.851 --> 00:16:53.341
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how else would they have hundreds </v>

353
00:16:53.341 --> 00:16:53.341
<v Speaker 2>of millions of dollars through no </v>
<v Speaker 2>discernible reason.</v>

354
00:16:53.341 --> 00:16:55.900
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you could like explain to</v>

355
00:16:55.901 --> 00:16:59.200
<v Speaker 2>someone how they made so much money if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't understand our culture.</v>

356
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.790
<v Speaker 2>It's totally irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

357
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:06.030
<v Speaker 2>So the idea was that that they did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why did it was I wanted to sort of </v>

358
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.110
<v Speaker 2>mock this thing that was happening where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a male Kardashians.</v>

359
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.680
<v Speaker 2>That's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who doesn't believe in gay marriage?</v>

360
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Who decides he's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I firmly believe he's trans.</v>

361
00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:24.091
<v Speaker 2>I'm not denying that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our obsession with it and rewarding </v>

362
00:17:24.521 --> 00:17:29.521
<v Speaker 2>him with ungodly amounts of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker won the gold medal in </v>

363
00:17:31.751 --> 00:17:33.040
<v Speaker 2>the decathlon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it?</v>

364
00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:34.630
<v Speaker 2>The calphalon was right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

365
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:39.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was on the cover wheaties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was a fucking us superstar </v>

366
00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.450
<v Speaker 2>athlete and then no attention after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

367
00:17:43.451 --> 00:17:46.600
<v Speaker 2>he was the whipping boy of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kardashians on their TV show.</v>

368
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:48.070
<v Speaker 2>They mocked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

369
00:17:48.071 --> 00:17:50.900
<v Speaker 2>here's this one with fucking talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your don't.</v>

370
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.910
<v Speaker 2>They mock rob a bit fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they go right to that.</v>

371
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.570
<v Speaker 2>He becomes a woman and now he is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>toast of the town.</v>

372
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.870
<v Speaker 2>He wins woman of the fucking year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a woman for six months and he wins </v>

373
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.580
<v Speaker 2>woman of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Wins Espn athlete of the year.</v>

374
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.510
<v Speaker 2>He has been an athlete in fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades since Nixon was president,</v>

375
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:13.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or Carter,</v>

376
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.360
<v Speaker 2>who was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way,</v>

377
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 2>this is madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where we're not treating this in</v>

378
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:25.521
<v Speaker 2>a balanced way where we are rewarding </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that instead of like,</v>

379
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.200
<v Speaker 2>because people are so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

380
00:18:28.201 --> 00:18:28.710
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

381
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.580
<v Speaker 2>they're so ready to proclaim the </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressiveness and so excited about it </v>

382
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:40.820
<v Speaker 2>that they instead of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of treating them as an equal,</v>

383
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.880
<v Speaker 2>they go completely the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are definitely not prejudice.</v>

384
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.490
<v Speaker 2>They're definitely not discriminating </v>
<v Speaker 2>against them,</v>

385
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.820
<v Speaker 2>but they're absolutely inflating what </v>
<v Speaker 2>this person is and,</v>

386
00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:59.610
<v Speaker 2>and they're making it a big giant deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're trans.</v>

387
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Like it's great to support people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to live in a world where </v>

388
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.260
<v Speaker 2>there's no racism at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could mock everyone equally.</v>

389
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my big problem with real racism.</v>

390
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:15.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of dummies in every race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta be real careful picking on</v>

391
00:19:15.751 --> 00:19:18.690
<v Speaker 2>some dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like specially if you're a white male,</v>

392
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 2>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white male oppressor.</v>

393
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.230
<v Speaker 2>You guys are the devil nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you look like me.</v>

394
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean I looked like the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a.</v>

395
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:32.511
<v Speaker 2>This is a real problem with like looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at things in a balanced perspective </v>

396
00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 2>because you're not allowed to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed.</v>

397
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Like even what you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said gender dysphoria,</v>

398
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's considered transphobic.</v>

399
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:45.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even say that anymore even </v>

400
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.711
<v Speaker 3>though that is a legitimate medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition because some people see it as </v>

401
00:19:47.171 --> 00:19:51.070
<v Speaker 3>you pathologizing being the way someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>feels,</v>

402
00:19:51.071 --> 00:19:56.071
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in my mind I don't think the issue </v>

403
00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:56.071
<v Speaker 3>is pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pathology,</v>

404
00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:56.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fine to acknowledge there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are certain things like any,</v>

405
00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.580
<v Speaker 3>any medical condition that causes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>distress and impairment.</v>

406
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the definition of a psychiatric </v>
<v Speaker 3>diagnosis,</v>

407
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.190
<v Speaker 3>so you should be able to recognize that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a bad thing.</v>

408
00:20:06.191 --> 00:20:11.191
<v Speaker 3>I think the bad thing is the stigma that</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes along with having a mental </v>

409
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:11.560
<v Speaker 3>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's what should be fought.</v>

410
00:20:11.561 --> 00:20:14.770
<v Speaker 3>It's the stigma aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not calling something a mental disorder.</v>

411
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.810
<v Speaker 3>If someone's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone's really suffering,</v>

412
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.100
<v Speaker 3>that's not a good thing.</v>

413
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

414
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:24.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also the denial of these conditions </v>

415
00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.100
<v Speaker 2>and the denial of the science behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>these conditions.</v>

416
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.400
<v Speaker 2>This is the issue with progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>people today is that there's certain </v>

417
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.000
<v Speaker 2>things where they embrace science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things where they deny it and in</v>

418
00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:38.010
<v Speaker 2>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender in particular seems to be so </v>

419
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.050
<v Speaker 2>hotly contested and I don't know when </v>
<v Speaker 2>this happened,</v>

420
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.480
<v Speaker 2>it seems to have happened right in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our face.</v>

421
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just came out of the ground,</v>

422
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.280
<v Speaker 2>like a plant that was growing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crack</v>

423
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.940
<v Speaker 5>now to let try to stomp it out and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>won't go away.</v>

424
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm wondering where the shit.</v>

425
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 5>Like I didn't see this coming and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fascinating to see.</v>

426
00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 5>I think feminism is part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The mainstream aspect of this really far</v>

427
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 5>left feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to call myself a feminist.</v>

428
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:09.901
<v Speaker 5>I don't anymore just because the things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people used to say feminism stood </v>

429
00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:12.010
<v Speaker 5>for like hating men being a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

430
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.230
<v Speaker 5>just don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

431
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 5>some of them do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say they hate men.</v>

432
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:22.261
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have friends who say my male friends </v>

433
00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:22.261
<v Speaker 5>who say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

434
00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:22.261
<v Speaker 5>my female friends said the men are </v>
<v Speaker 5>trash.</v>

435
00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 5>Is that normal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

436
00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 5>there's a woman that I know that's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>feminist that has on her,</v>

437
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her twitter account.</v>

438
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Speaker 5>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trust.</v>

439
00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:34.501
<v Speaker 5>No Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just openly proclaiming that if </v>

440
00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:35.380
<v Speaker 5>you're straight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good luck.</v>

441
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.350
<v Speaker 5>Good luck with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're saying trust.</v>

442
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:40.800
<v Speaker 5>No Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But imagine if you said about women,</v>

443
00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible thing.</v>

444
00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be,</v>

445
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 5>that'd be awful as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's acceptable to hate on men now.</v>

446
00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.970
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody criticizes misandry,</v>

447
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

448
00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:52.780
<v Speaker 5>it's not something that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that gets brought up.</v>

449
00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:54.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never even said that worked before.</v>

450
00:21:54.611 --> 00:21:57.430
<v Speaker 5>I've only written it and set it or </v>
<v Speaker 5>written it and heard it.</v>

451
00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

452
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:04.381
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think feminism at the core had some </v>

453
00:22:04.381 --> 00:22:06.721
<v Speaker 5>good aspects in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just gone off the rails more </v>

454
00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 5>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Equality has great aspects,</v>

455
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.500
<v Speaker 5>but I think the problem with any like </v>
<v Speaker 5>white power is obviously awful.</v>

456
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.810
<v Speaker 5>You say white power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you're,</v>

457
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:21.850
<v Speaker 5>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you mean is your racist against </v>

458
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:21.850
<v Speaker 5>other races.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're into white people,</v>

459
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.140
<v Speaker 5>but brown powers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

460
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:24.550
<v Speaker 5>Brown prides.</v>

461
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

462
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.670
<v Speaker 5>Nowadays they see it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

463
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.060
<v Speaker 5>Male pride is not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Okay,</v>

464
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.080
<v Speaker 5>but girl pride is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Girl power is okay.</v>

465
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking weird because you're.</v>

466
00:22:37.211 --> 00:22:39.250
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're generalizing.</v>

467
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:42.730
<v Speaker 5>You're lumping yourself into a group of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people just because you all have vaginas</v>

468
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:48.020
<v Speaker 5>and we don't all think the same,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the minute you as a woman say </v>

469
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.410
<v Speaker 5>something that goes against girl power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will descend on you.</v>

470
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen that too.</v>

471
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:57.120
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you're threatening the </v>

472
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.150
<v Speaker 5>collective agreed upon narrative and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

473
00:22:58.151 --> 00:23:01.420
<v Speaker 5>It's like you like the way girls treat </v>
<v Speaker 5>sluts.</v>

474
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:07.020
<v Speaker 5>Girls get very mad if a girl just </v>
<v Speaker 5>decides to have sex as many people as </v>

475
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:12.110
<v Speaker 5>she wants because then you're fucking up</v>
<v Speaker 5>this whole economy of controlling the </v>

476
00:23:12.701 --> 00:23:16.490
<v Speaker 5>narrative of when women decide to or </v>
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>

477
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.770
<v Speaker 5>Sex goes down that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is why prostitution's illegal.</v>

478
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.210
<v Speaker 5>I see both sides.</v>

479
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:23.440
<v Speaker 5>I see some women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I.</v>

480
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.680
<v Speaker 5>which I find interesting because I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's confusing for young women now who </v>

481
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.710
<v Speaker 5>are starting to date and they think I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't really want to have casual sex,</v>

482
00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:31.450
<v Speaker 5>but I'm being told that's what I should </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

483
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.790
<v Speaker 5>Is that what they're being told?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

484
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.850
<v Speaker 5>I think by whom?</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the media more like it's empowering </v>

485
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.910
<v Speaker 5>to go out and sleep with as many people </v>
<v Speaker 5>as you want and to be like a man,</v>

486
00:23:39.911 --> 00:23:44.911
<v Speaker 5>like if you look at college campuses and</v>
<v Speaker 5>how there's quite a bit of casual sex </v>

487
00:23:44.911 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 5>going on and I don't think that's</v>

488
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 2>for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think from an evolutionary perspective</v>

489
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:52.931
<v Speaker 2>to women don't like that as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to a friend of mine today </v>

490
00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:53.920
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

491
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:59.130
<v Speaker 2>who's in the military and he was saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's crazy about certain branches of </v>

492
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:03.281
<v Speaker 2>the military is you have like 100 men to</v>
<v Speaker 2>one women to one woman and one woman,</v>

493
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:11.020
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're deployed and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the pick of the litter and </v>

494
00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.041
<v Speaker 2>they'll just fuck her gang of dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same time I would never talked about.</v>

495
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:17.000
<v Speaker 2>I've never thought about it that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

496
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:18.300
<v Speaker 2>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

497
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.320
<v Speaker 2>well everybody just sort of agrees that </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody has this one girl that nobody is </v>

498
00:24:24.081 --> 00:24:28.640
<v Speaker 2>going to own her and that she can have </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex with as many guys as she wants to.</v>

499
00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was saying is like,</v>

500
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.770
<v Speaker 2>at least in his experience that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole dynamic of male female </v>

501
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:39.611
<v Speaker 2>relationships shift and these girls can </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically date as many of these guys </v>

502
00:24:40.291 --> 00:24:41.060
<v Speaker 2>that she wants.</v>

503
00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of interesting and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't shame her for that.</v>

504
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't because there's only one.</v>

505
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like they don't want her to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry at them too.</v>

506
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like I didn't talk to them about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

507
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:52.850
<v Speaker 2>We always spoke about it for like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

508
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:54.740
<v Speaker 2>but it was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of crazy.</v>

509
00:24:54.741 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I never even thought about that dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

510
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 2>That sort of a scenario where there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 men in one chick.</v>

511
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.840
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of men.</v>

512
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get sore and you'd be like </v>

513
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:07.930
<v Speaker 2>annoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really cute.</v>

514
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Let me alone and you're going to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much time does she have?</v>

515
00:25:10.461 --> 00:25:11.790
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much time does she have?</v>

516
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're in the military,</v>

517
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 2>you've got tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things you need to do.</v>

518
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the dynamics shift according to</v>

519
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.160
<v Speaker 2>like what is available and who's there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what kind of a culture you live in.</v>

520
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:34.030
<v Speaker 2>People adapt are very malleable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different climates and different </v>

521
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:38.201
<v Speaker 2>cultures and the way people treat sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't treat sex and this is when I </v>

522
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:43.451
<v Speaker 2>think what happens is people tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>react very aggressively or very strongly</v>

523
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.740
<v Speaker 2>when someone is doing something that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than the way they're doing </v>

524
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:56.051
<v Speaker 2>things because this would possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicate that there's another way or </v>

525
00:25:56.051 --> 00:25:56.970
<v Speaker 2>maybe their was wrong or maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

526
00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.650
<v Speaker 2>And especially when it comes to sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get very strange.</v>

527
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.980
<v Speaker 2>They do like when people find out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are in open relationships.</v>

528
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I have a good friend of mine who's in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>open relationship and it's so </v>

529
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.870
<v Speaker 2>fascinating to watch all the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have guys fuck your girlfriend,</v>

530
00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:16.871
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he asked to sort of discuss it and </v>

531
00:26:16.871 --> 00:26:16.871
<v Speaker 2>the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

532
00:26:16.871 --> 00:26:17.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not comfortable for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I enjoyed it.</v>

533
00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:22.571
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why do they have an open </v>

534
00:26:22.571 --> 00:26:22.571
<v Speaker 2>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

535
00:26:22.571 --> 00:26:22.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have to talk to them about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

536
00:26:22.571 --> 00:26:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's got bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>answers.</v>

537
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I think the main answer is he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck other people and she wants to fuck </v>

538
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.850
<v Speaker 2>other people and so they just decided to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it that way and they were together in</v>

539
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:34.070
<v Speaker 2>a monogamous relationship for for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile,</v>

540
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:39.130
<v Speaker 2>but I think I am correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they've been in an open </v>

541
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.580
<v Speaker 2>relationship longer than they were in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monogamous relationship with a for.</v>

542
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.260
<v Speaker 2>I would have to ask him I think</v>

543
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.740
<v Speaker 5>more than a year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe two years or something like that.</v>

544
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:48.600
<v Speaker 5>And then it's been like four years of </v>
<v Speaker 5>open.</v>

545
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 5>Open relationships are actually pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>common.</v>

546
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.560
<v Speaker 5>Consensual nonmonogamous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's one study that showed one in </v>

547
00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:57.560
<v Speaker 5>five Americans have actually tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's pretty common.</v>

548
00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.220
<v Speaker 5>Me Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm monogamous,</v>

549
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:01.710
<v Speaker 5>but I think people should do what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to do.</v>

550
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:06.711
<v Speaker 5>If it's consensual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think obviously having been a sex </v>

551
00:27:06.711 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 5>researcher and now someone who writes </v>
<v Speaker 5>about sex research for a living,</v>

552
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm very sex positive and I think a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the problems that we see in a lot of </v>

553
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.110
<v Speaker 5>the suffering and distress and issues </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people have in their lives could be</v>

554
00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:19.140
<v Speaker 5>solved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If our world was more sex positive,</v>

555
00:27:19.141 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Speaker 5>we could just talk about sex like </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything else,</v>

556
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.260
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The shame of it is the real problem and </v>

557
00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.721
<v Speaker 5>this is what I'm saying with that people</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're living a life that's </v>

558
00:27:29.721 --> 00:27:30.840
<v Speaker 5>different than the way they're living </v>
<v Speaker 5>their life,</v>

559
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:31.710
<v Speaker 5>they.</v>

560
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.380
<v Speaker 5>People get very aggressive about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same Way.</v>

561
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean sober.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People tend to get aggressive about </v>

562
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.581
<v Speaker 5>people enjoy drinking or people enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 5>smoking pot or taking mushrooms or </v>

563
00:27:43.581 --> 00:27:47.811
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get very shitty about it sometimes </v>

564
00:27:47.811 --> 00:27:48.480
<v Speaker 5>and it's because it's very polar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

565
00:27:48.481 --> 00:27:53.481
<v Speaker 5>very opposite of the way they're living </v>
<v Speaker 5>their life and they don't want to see </v>

566
00:27:53.481 --> 00:27:54.000
<v Speaker 5>anybody living their life in a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>different way,</v>

567
00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:55.530
<v Speaker 5>but also being happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think,</v>

568
00:27:55.531 --> 00:28:00.531
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not how I do it and this is </v>

569
00:28:00.531 --> 00:28:02.900
<v Speaker 5>contrary to my values,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you must be doing something wrong or </v>

570
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:02.950
<v Speaker 5>you need alcohol to get by.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you need?</v>

571
00:28:02.951 --> 00:28:03.900
<v Speaker 5>You need to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

572
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.250
<v Speaker 5>you don't need that drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want it.</v>

573
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.330
<v Speaker 5>I just have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I have a glass of wine,</v>

574
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.980
<v Speaker 5>I get happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's getting hurt here and what?</v>

575
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:15.981
<v Speaker 5>You're going to start doing heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you're going to wind up in the </v>

576
00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:15.981
<v Speaker 5>gutter.</v>

577
00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:17.460
<v Speaker 5>I've never have never been on heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never been in the gutter,</v>

578
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.200
<v Speaker 5>been alive for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing's happened.</v>

579
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.180
<v Speaker 5>Can be a bit of projection too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

580
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.810
<v Speaker 5>Someone who's dealt with substance </v>
<v Speaker 5>issues that the fear that you know,</v>

581
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.170
<v Speaker 5>it's very easy for someone else to fall </v>
<v Speaker 5>down the same hole.</v>

582
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.680
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's this thing that people living a</v>

583
00:28:31.681 --> 00:28:35.120
<v Speaker 5>different way is somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 5>threatening,</v>

584
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.080
<v Speaker 5>unacceptable and threatening to their </v>
<v Speaker 5>perceptions of what,</v>

585
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.870
<v Speaker 5>what you should be doing with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

586
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think,</v>

587
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is very unrelated to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hole,</v>

588
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.840
<v Speaker 5>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's what,</v>

589
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.040
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to gender,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's just this thing that </v>

590
00:28:55.111 --> 00:29:00.111
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people want things to be more easily </v>

591
00:29:00.111 --> 00:29:02.040
<v Speaker 5>explained than they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

592
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.740
<v Speaker 5>I could see that because it takes a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of work to actually go.</v>

593
00:29:04.741 --> 00:29:06.960
<v Speaker 5>So people who say that gender is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>social construct,</v>

594
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.130
<v Speaker 5>that's a good one.</v>

595
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.110
<v Speaker 5>Sounds very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love saying that.</v>

596
00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:15.220
<v Speaker 5>It's not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's infuriating because it's </v>

597
00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.070
<v Speaker 5>everywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this is what children are being </v>

598
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.111
<v Speaker 5>taught in school up in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're being taught in </v>

599
00:29:21.111 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Speaker 5>their curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's absolutely no truth to it at</v>

600
00:29:22.201 --> 00:29:27.201
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean if you read the scientific </v>

601
00:29:27.201 --> 00:29:29.990
<v Speaker 5>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you cannot come away from them saying </v>

602
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.100
<v Speaker 5>gender's a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's the argument for it if you were </v>

603
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.370
<v Speaker 5>arguing for it that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess the,</v>

604
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.050
<v Speaker 5>the idea is that women should be equal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And obviously as a woman,</v>

605
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 5>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so</v>

606
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.600
<v Speaker 3>any sort of subjugation of women must </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow be imposed by society because if</v>

607
00:29:46.601 --> 00:29:51.601
<v Speaker 3>we acknowledged that women are different</v>
<v Speaker 3>biologically in any way that's going to </v>

608
00:29:51.601 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 3>be used as justification why they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>deserve to be treated the same as men or</v>

609
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:56.110
<v Speaker 3>they're not as capable as men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>

610
00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.630
<v Speaker 4>different subjugation and why is </v>
<v Speaker 4>different incapable?</v>

611
00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.600
<v Speaker 4>Why is different</v>

612
00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:04.610
<v Speaker 3>in fairness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there has been a history of </v>

613
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.650
<v Speaker 3>there being sexism and say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with the whole Google memo thing and </v>

614
00:30:06.691 --> 00:30:10.320
<v Speaker 3>this idea that women are biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are different.</v>

615
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Not to say we're not as capable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if there are any sort of biological </v>

616
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.990
<v Speaker 3>correlates to what women find </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting,</v>

617
00:30:15.991 --> 00:30:20.991
<v Speaker 3>could that be extrapolated to capability</v>
<v Speaker 3>extrapolated to women should go back to </v>

618
00:30:21.121 --> 00:30:23.010
<v Speaker 3>the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The women aren't good at math,</v>

619
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.040
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I get why people don't like </v>

620
00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.520
<v Speaker 3>biological explanations for things I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>

621
00:30:29.521 --> 00:30:34.521
<v Speaker 3>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just a lot easier and it's </v>

622
00:30:34.521 --> 00:30:34.521
<v Speaker 3>a lazy way to just dismiss the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and say,</v>

623
00:30:34.521 --> 00:30:35.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't need to think about it.</v>

624
00:30:35.191 --> 00:30:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Nothing to see here.</v>

625
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing to see here.</v>

626
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:43.230
<v Speaker 4>But it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's clearly not true in terms of the </v>

627
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.011
<v Speaker 4>scientific research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there has to be some cognitive </v>

628
00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:50.860
<v Speaker 4>dissonance in order to accept that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to preach it and to say it and everybody</v>

629
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:55.861
<v Speaker 4>has to agree upon it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the reasons why I think </v>

630
00:30:55.861 --> 00:30:59.310
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any statements contrary to that get </v>

631
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:03.070
<v Speaker 4>aggressively attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is part of the reason why these</v>

632
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:06.840
<v Speaker 4>ideas are so supercharged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that there's,</v>

633
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:11.900
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an understanding that it's </v>

634
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.510
<v Speaker 4>horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when someone challenges it and </v>

635
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:17.581
<v Speaker 4>says it's Horseshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been living your whole life with </v>

636
00:31:17.581 --> 00:31:17.581
<v Speaker 4>this horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like a religious thing.</v>

637
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

638
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:23.521
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some people know what the truth </v>

639
00:31:23.521 --> 00:31:25.501
<v Speaker 3>is and they actively lie because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>think they're doing something good for </v>

640
00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:28.921
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they'll say gender is a social </v>

641
00:31:28.921 --> 00:31:28.921
<v Speaker 3>construct even though they know it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological.</v>

642
00:31:28.921 --> 00:31:31.150
<v Speaker 3>And I think people who are younger may </v>
<v Speaker 3>be going through school.</v>

643
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:36.151
<v Speaker 3>Now we're being taught there's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know the difference and actually </v>

644
00:31:36.151 --> 00:31:36.151
<v Speaker 3>believe it,</v>

645
00:31:36.151 --> 00:31:39.670
<v Speaker 4>but why would they aggressively attack </v>
<v Speaker 4>the scientific research that's contrary </v>

646
00:31:41.001 --> 00:31:42.110
<v Speaker 4>to that claim?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then?</v>

647
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.420
<v Speaker 3>You mean the people who don't know any </v>
<v Speaker 3>better?</v>

648
00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:50.020
<v Speaker 3>They actually believe that gender is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>social construct and these scientists </v>

649
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:50.540
<v Speaker 3>are just sexist and misogynistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want to keep women down,</v>

650
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.640
<v Speaker 4>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can get that if you didn't research </v>

651
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:55.640
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you didn't look into it,</v>

652
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:55.650
<v Speaker 4>but once you start looking into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

653
00:31:55.651 --> 00:31:56.730
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is weird,</v>

654
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.960
<v Speaker 4>but there's clearly.</v>

655
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you think people actually look into </v>
<v Speaker 3>it though?</v>

656
00:32:01.601 --> 00:32:04.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sense I get is they.</v>

657
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:09.230
<v Speaker 3>They find someone or some journalists </v>
<v Speaker 3>who has had some sort of decent sounding</v>

658
00:32:09.281 --> 00:32:14.281
<v Speaker 3>criticism of the literature and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>just pair it that I don't think they </v>

659
00:32:14.281 --> 00:32:14.281
<v Speaker 3>actually go and look at the studies.</v>

660
00:32:14.281 --> 00:32:15.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's part of.</v>

661
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:20.310
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely something to that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something to this </v>

662
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:21.820
<v Speaker 4>problem that human beings have where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

663
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:27.020
<v Speaker 4>They have an idea and that idea becomes </v>
<v Speaker 4>a part of their identity and then they </v>

664
00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.351
<v Speaker 4>start arguing for that idea and any </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument against that idea is an </v>

665
00:32:31.351 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 4>argument against them as a person </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're trying to win.</v>

666
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.230
<v Speaker 4>They're not necessarily looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>things in an objective way where they're</v>

667
00:32:39.231 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 4>detached</v>

668
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.710
<v Speaker 2>from the idea and studying it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

669
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Instead they're arguing to try to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a giant problem with </v>

670
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:53.471
<v Speaker 2>ideas and in yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes even more of a problem </v>

671
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 2>when it gets tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When these ideas are attached,</v>

672
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:02.590
<v Speaker 2>like climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly attached in denial to the right </v>

673
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:07.150
<v Speaker 2>in support to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this very strange tribal thing and </v>

674
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:12.850
<v Speaker 2>that also happens with gender and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>also like if you are in support of of </v>

675
00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:17.681
<v Speaker 2>women's rights and you are in support of</v>
<v Speaker 2>trans rights and Lbgtq and all that </v>

676
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:20.360
<v Speaker 2>jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're almost 100 percent going to be on</v>

677
00:33:20.361 --> 00:33:23.300
<v Speaker 2>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of those tribal things.</v>

678
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:28.420
<v Speaker 2>If you're pro choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're almost always going to be on the </v>

679
00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:28.420
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not,</v>

680
00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.360
<v Speaker 2>you find yourself in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one was.</v>

681
00:33:29.361 --> 00:33:31.730
<v Speaker 2>It was a Tammy Lauren.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get her confused with that.</v>

682
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Lauren southern girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those girls are interchangeable in some </v>

683
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:37.210
<v Speaker 2>strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those the,</v>

684
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.430
<v Speaker 2>the hot Republicans and Tomi Lahren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tomi Lahren,</v>

685
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.920
<v Speaker 2>she's pro choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got attacked.</v>

686
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Can Be can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be on this team,</v>

687
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.990
<v Speaker 2>you want to be on the main white girl </v>
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>

688
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 2>You can't be project you gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be prolife.</v>

689
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.940
<v Speaker 2>What about life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the baby's support debate?</v>

690
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.980
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying was like some </v>

691
00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.721
<v Speaker 2>ideas get locked into ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get locked into these tribal </v>

692
00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:06.311
<v Speaker 2>ideologies and gender is most certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those because people don't want </v>

693
00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 2>to be without a political home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

694
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good way of putting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you do say,</v>

695
00:34:11.511 --> 00:34:15.230
<v Speaker 2>say someone like Tommy Tommy who is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do I call it Tammy?</v>

696
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She in trouble.</v>

697
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Tomi Lahren will star in pro life film </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the break.</v>

698
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 2>The blaze fired her for being pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

699
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.280
<v Speaker 2>What if you're a pro choice conservative</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if you're a pro biology liberal,</v>

700
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of find yourself in a weird.</v>

701
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:38.021
<v Speaker 2>In between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's just fucking going the other </v>

702
00:34:38.021 --> 00:34:38.021
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going the other way.</v>

703
00:34:38.021 --> 00:34:39.950
<v Speaker 2>She's gonna start a film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a pro life film?</v>

704
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:44.530
<v Speaker 2>So ABC after school special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't have an abortion.</v>

705
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Have your baby.</v>

706
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

707
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got to get our ground back to </v>

708
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.071
<v Speaker 2>kicked off the team a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bio pic on the Roe vs Wade case </v>

709
00:34:57.071 --> 00:34:57.200
<v Speaker 2>starting Stacey Dash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

710
00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:02.350
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe she's playing a bad person in </v>

711
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.710
<v Speaker 2>that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Made it even more interesting.</v>

712
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many of those things are </v>

713
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:12.170
<v Speaker 2>just distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

714
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.470
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are so weird with their,</v>

715
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.710
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their tribal identities.</v>

716
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

717
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love when they go back and forth </v>

718
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.210
<v Speaker 2>and shift from one side or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love it when like,</v>

719
00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:28.360
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a former conservative scene.</v>

720
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:31.250
<v Speaker 2>The light or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be a liberal to the party.</v>

721
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Lost me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

722
00:35:33.141 --> 00:35:36.060
<v Speaker 2>And then they go hardcore on the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>side is weird because it's ever.</v>

723
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Then everything is not just a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>

724
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:42.090
<v Speaker 2>It's everything in alignment with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side to join a church.</v>

725
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Stopped doing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

726
00:35:45.301 --> 00:35:47.370
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>

727
00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a neuroscientist when something like </v>

728
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.271
<v Speaker 2>the Google memo comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are also a woman and you are also a </v>

729
00:35:56.401 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 2>woman who lost a person of color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>

730
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Are you as I work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're lighter than me?</v>

731
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a different color.</v>

732
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Am My a person of color telling then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the bolt.</v>

733
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.420
<v Speaker 2>You can be an honorary person of color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you that bad.</v>

734
00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:17.421
<v Speaker 2>But I'm Sicilian so there's somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My background got fucked by somebody who</v>

735
00:36:18.661 --> 00:36:23.661
<v Speaker 2>was darker for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know how that works because </v>

736
00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:28.191
<v Speaker 2>if I was Cuban I would look exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same and I definitely could be a person </v>

737
00:36:28.191 --> 00:36:32.551
<v Speaker 2>of color I think is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't stand that term for the record </v>

738
00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:34.110
<v Speaker 2>person of color because those of us who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not white,</v>

739
00:36:34.111 --> 00:36:39.111
<v Speaker 2>we don't all think the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we all get lumped in as having some </v>

740
00:36:39.111 --> 00:36:42.471
<v Speaker 2>sort of a wider conversation with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine about that who was </v>

741
00:36:42.471 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Mexican and he was talking about Latinos</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go,</v>

742
00:36:43.231 --> 00:36:48.231
<v Speaker 2>well you do know that Italian was one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original Latin languages,</v>

743
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.220
<v Speaker 2>like I am Latino.</v>

744
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.860
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what is Latino?</v>

745
00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Like you just thinking it was only </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish.</v>

746
00:36:55.021 --> 00:36:58.160
<v Speaker 2>That's not really the technical </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of it isn't Latinos?</v>

747
00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean am I correct about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

748
00:36:59.921 --> 00:37:03.720
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't emanate from a Latin language</v>
<v Speaker 2>think so I think so too,</v>

749
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like Italians had been so </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingrained in our culture.</v>

750
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.770
<v Speaker 2>They came over so long ago that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

751
00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:14.780
<v Speaker 2>my grandparents came here in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties so that that's a hundred years </v>

752
00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:14.820
<v Speaker 2>ago almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't count.</v>

753
00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:19.980
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't count anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not really discriminated against </v>

754
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.370
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jews used to be.</v>

755
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 2>It's what's interesting is if you follow</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing history,</v>

756
00:37:24.271 --> 00:37:27.150
<v Speaker 2>and I know you're a martial artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you follow boxing history,</v>

757
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:32.630
<v Speaker 2>the oppressed early immigrants are </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost always the best boxers at the </v>

758
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.920
<v Speaker 2>time and for awhile it was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish boxers,</v>

759
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Italian boxers.</v>

760
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

761
00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:40.640
<v Speaker 2>rocky Graziano and rocky Marciano and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these towns,</v>

762
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:45.240
<v Speaker 2>and then it became a Cubans and Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ricans and then it became,</v>

763
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.830
<v Speaker 2>well there was always blacks as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this like immigrants in particular,</v>

764
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:54.890
<v Speaker 2>Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Irish immigrants that early on </v>

765
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.680
<v Speaker 2>they were thought of as being some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lowliest of the low and now Irish </v>

766
00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.450
<v Speaker 2>people are 100 percent white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no one even thinks about it.</v>

767
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Of course they're white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean they're,</v>

768
00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.060
<v Speaker 2>they're just American Asian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soon we're going to be a hundred percent</v>

769
00:38:06.061 --> 00:38:08.010
<v Speaker 2>white basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

770
00:38:08.011 --> 00:38:11.400
<v Speaker 2>not of Harvard has anything to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to kick you guys out.</v>

771
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.680
<v Speaker 2>What is it about not trying to kick you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys out,</v>

772
00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:18.681
<v Speaker 2>but that is one of the weirder </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminations that is somehow or </v>

773
00:38:18.681 --> 00:38:22.071
<v Speaker 2>another slipped under the radar that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making it more difficult for </v>

774
00:38:22.071 --> 00:38:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Asians to get into Ivy League </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities because you guys do so </v>

775
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.390
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

776
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.390
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

777
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:29.520
<v Speaker 2>it's racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>

778
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.310
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think some of these people who are</v>

779
00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:35.040
<v Speaker 2>getting pats on the back for being </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive about being diverse,</v>

780
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I think they just don't</v>

781
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:40.060
<v Speaker 3>like us and now they have a politically </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptable way to do it.</v>

782
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 3>But why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would they not like Asians?</v>

783
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Know some people just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people are racist,</v>

784
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.370
<v Speaker 3>but is it that or is it that you guys do</v>
<v Speaker 3>too?</v>

785
00:38:48.371 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 3>Well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

786
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:49.570
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

787
00:38:49.571 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 3>we throw that whole narrative into </v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

788
00:38:51.521 --> 00:38:54.050
<v Speaker 3>this idea that if you're not white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must,</v>

789
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:54.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

790
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.760
<v Speaker 3>you can't be doing well in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't pull yourself up and get on </v>

791
00:38:59.760 --> 00:38:59.760
<v Speaker 3>with things.</v>

792
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that was the argument against the </v>

793
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Charles Murray Book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that book?</v>

794
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:05.380
<v Speaker 4>The bell curve?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

795
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:10.650
<v Speaker 4>One of the problems with that book is </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were showing the differences in </v>

796
00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:10.860
<v Speaker 4>ICU,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

797
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

798
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:17.101
<v Speaker 4>as it varies across different </v>
<v Speaker 4>geographical segments and across races </v>

799
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.240
<v Speaker 4>and if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that book is really a testament to the </v>

800
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 4>master race of Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for real,</v>

801
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Asians,</v>

802
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:33.300
<v Speaker 4>we do okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But genetically like Asian people seem </v>

803
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.280
<v Speaker 4>to be superior when it comes to Iq </v>
<v Speaker 4>according to that book.</v>

804
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.270
<v Speaker 3>I think we just work really hard in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

805
00:39:39.271 --> 00:39:41.220
<v Speaker 3>Puts a lot of emphasis on education.</v>

806
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:46.340
<v Speaker 4>Did you read the talent code?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really interesting book.</v>

807
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm finishing it up right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things about it is it's </v>

808
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.580
<v Speaker 4>sort of dismisses the idea of talent and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it shows.</v>

809
00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:56.420
<v Speaker 4>It goes into depth about all the D,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not dismisses it,</v>

810
00:39:56.421 --> 00:40:00.650
<v Speaker 4>but shows that it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some magic gift is bestowed upon people,</v>

811
00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.920
<v Speaker 4>but what it is is it shows all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathways that lead to the skill </v>

812
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.181
<v Speaker 4>developments that we considered talent </v>
<v Speaker 4>and discipline and hard work in </v>

813
00:40:10.181 --> 00:40:14.060
<v Speaker 4>particular discipline being a culturally</v>
<v Speaker 4>inforce thing,</v>

814
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Speaker 4>which it is with many Asians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I often talk about my friend junk sick </v>

815
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.970
<v Speaker 4>who when I was doing taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was on the US team while he was also </v>

816
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:29.150
<v Speaker 4>in his residency in medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sky was I fucking animal.</v>

817
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never met anybody in my life who </v>

818
00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:34.340
<v Speaker 4>worked as hard as him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He always looked exhausted.</v>

819
00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:34.800
<v Speaker 4>This is face all the time.</v>

820
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.990
<v Speaker 4>I just was always tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then would go to work like a fucking</v>

821
00:40:38.991 --> 00:40:43.550
<v Speaker 4>savage was inbetween studying for his do</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

822
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:48.080
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of a medical school and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>would put his backpack on,</v>

823
00:40:48.081 --> 00:40:51.890
<v Speaker 4>filled with books and run the stairs at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the university.</v>

824
00:40:51.891 --> 00:40:53.540
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

825
00:40:53.541 --> 00:40:54.680
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would,</v>

826
00:40:54.681 --> 00:40:55.970
<v Speaker 4>I would talk to them about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

827
00:40:55.971 --> 00:40:59.180
<v Speaker 4>because my parents were not like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and his parents were like,</v>

828
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.300
<v Speaker 4>my parents were hippies and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

829
00:41:02.301 --> 00:41:04.190
<v Speaker 4>do whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't care,</v>

830
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:06.890
<v Speaker 4>and his parents were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must be a doctor,</v>

831
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.280
<v Speaker 4>and he was like telling me about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of discipline that he grew up with </v>

832
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.450
<v Speaker 4>and that culturally enforced discipline </v>
<v Speaker 4>leads,</v>

833
00:41:14.451 --> 00:41:15.050
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

834
00:41:15.051 --> 00:41:15.560
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

835
00:41:15.561 --> 00:41:18.080
<v Speaker 4>many people to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas,</v>

836
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:23.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sort of latch key kids that I grew </v>

837
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:23.690
<v Speaker 4>up with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no.</v>

838
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.550
<v Speaker 4>There was no culturally enforced </v>
<v Speaker 4>discipline.</v>

839
00:41:25.551 --> 00:41:30.551
<v Speaker 4>You either developed it on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pursued something that you enjoyed </v>

840
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 4>and figured out how to become discipline</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you just weren't you.</v>

841
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.200
<v Speaker 4>But this thing that's in Asian cultures </v>
<v Speaker 4>is what's propelling them forward.</v>

842
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:44.450
<v Speaker 4>If you subscribe to all the different </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are being brought up in this</v>

843
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:46.400
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the talent code and it makes sense.</v>

844
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.390
<v Speaker 4>It only makes sense.</v>

845
00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.140
<v Speaker 3>I think it should be seen as a positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you know,</v>

846
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.160
<v Speaker 3>everyone is capable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a particular race or a </v>

847
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:55.830
<v Speaker 3>particular group of people that can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>

848
00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:01.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my issue with the whole thing with the </v>

849
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.871
<v Speaker 3>Harvard law students that why are Asians</v>
<v Speaker 3>being punished for doing well,</v>

850
00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.160
<v Speaker 3>essentially explained the lawsuit for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that don't.</v>

851
00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 3>So it turns out that for decades now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard has been discriminating against </v>

852
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:14.571
<v Speaker 3>Asians and requiring them to have higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>sat scores than people of other ethnic </v>

853
00:42:14.941 --> 00:42:17.280
<v Speaker 3>backgrounds in order to get the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance of admission.</v>

854
00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.740
<v Speaker 3>And then more recently it's been shown </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

855
00:42:19.741 --> 00:42:21.990
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Asians do well with sat scores.</v>

856
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:24.840
<v Speaker 3>They do all the extra curricular </v>
<v Speaker 3>activities.</v>

857
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:29.190
<v Speaker 3>So the only way that admissions </v>
<v Speaker 3>committees can actually penalize them is</v>

858
00:42:29.191 --> 00:42:32.820
<v Speaker 3>through writing their personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So seeing them as less likable,</v>

859
00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.560
<v Speaker 3>things like that because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjective and uh,</v>

860
00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:40.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it amazing that very few liberal </v>

861
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:40.610
<v Speaker 3>outlets I've covered this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

862
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:45.100
<v Speaker 3>the New York Times has been one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but outside of that it's been very few </v>

863
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:45.750
<v Speaker 3>and it's really disappointing and no one</v>
<v Speaker 3>has.</v>

864
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean I wrote about this for the Globe </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Mail and I was amazed.</v>

865
00:42:48.841 --> 00:42:50.700
<v Speaker 3>No one had heard about this story at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

866
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only that,</v>

867
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.770
<v Speaker 4>even when I was covering the New York </v>
<v Speaker 4>Times or burglar.</v>

868
00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.000
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

869
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.850
<v Speaker 4>Let's go on with our day dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in and out.</v>

870
00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:03.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if it was in about any other </v>

871
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.040
<v Speaker 4>subject or any other race or gender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's being discriminated against.</v>

872
00:43:06.171 --> 00:43:11.171
<v Speaker 4>I mean if it was discrimination against </v>
<v Speaker 4>black people in the same systematic way </v>

873
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.180
<v Speaker 4>or systemic way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be outrageous.</v>

874
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:15.530
<v Speaker 4>People go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

875
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:20.770
<v Speaker 4>and even more insane that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>it to the most successful people.</v>

876
00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:26.420
<v Speaker 4>The most successful in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>academics because that's the problem,</v>

877
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is helping society either.</v>

878
00:43:29.111 --> 00:43:31.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean if if I were not Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be saying the same thing.</v>

879
00:43:31.601 --> 00:43:36.601
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it makes sense to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are doing well and hold them </v>

880
00:43:36.601 --> 00:43:36.601
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

881
00:43:36.601 --> 00:43:40.981
<v Speaker 3>if you want your society to do well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the solution would be to help </v>

882
00:43:40.981 --> 00:43:40.981
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not doing as well.</v>

883
00:43:40.981 --> 00:43:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Don't penalize the people who are doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

884
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:45.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a fear of Asians.</v>

885
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:51.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm not bullshitting and one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been obsessed with this company </v>

886
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:55.200
<v Speaker 4>walway recently and what I got obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 4>with them for two reasons.</v>

887
00:43:55.201 --> 00:44:00.201
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I read an article about the </v>

888
00:44:00.201 --> 00:44:03.561
<v Speaker 4>superiority of the cell phones that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're producing that are not being </v>

889
00:44:04.171 --> 00:44:08.140
<v Speaker 4>accepted in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so then I started doing.</v>

890
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of a Dork when it comes to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>cell phones and technology.</v>

891
00:44:11.491 --> 00:44:14.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm very fascinated by them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I read a lot of articles about walway</v>

892
00:44:14.821 --> 00:44:19.440
<v Speaker 4>phones and they have these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>insane Leica cameras,</v>

893
00:44:19.441 --> 00:44:24.441
<v Speaker 4>a 40 megapixel lenses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three lenses on the front and 20 plus </v>

894
00:44:24.511 --> 00:44:28.920
<v Speaker 4>Megapixel selfie cameras and like really</v>
<v Speaker 4>intense technology.</v>

895
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.690
<v Speaker 4>Much more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much higher.</v>

896
00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 4>Like I think they have 500 gigabyte </v>
<v Speaker 4>storage capacity.</v>

897
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.590
<v Speaker 4>Four thousand milliamp batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they're superior battery.</v>

898
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:42.640
<v Speaker 4>It's a superior phone and I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at.</v>

899
00:44:42.641 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

900
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:43.950
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of crazy.</v>

901
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:49.070
<v Speaker 4>And then it turns out you can't sell </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in the United States and the </v>

902
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:53.000
<v Speaker 4>federal government's blocked these </v>
<v Speaker 4>carriers from having them and they're </v>

903
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.291
<v Speaker 4>saying it's because the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 4>government is involved in stealing </v>

904
00:44:57.291 --> 00:45:00.150
<v Speaker 4>information and hacking and all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>different stuff.</v>

905
00:45:00.151 --> 00:45:00.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

906
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.150
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe but,</v>

907
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:08.170
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's kind of fucking weird that you </v>

908
00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:08.170
<v Speaker 4>can't figure out whether or not a phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>is being used to like,</v>

909
00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:13.160
<v Speaker 4>how are these hackers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how these super genius people who </v>

910
00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.641
<v Speaker 4>program phones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't look at one of those phones </v>

911
00:45:16.641 --> 00:45:18.470
<v Speaker 4>and and figure out what it's doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's doing some magic or,</v>

912
00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.560
<v Speaker 4>or another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's stealing people's information and </v>

913
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:23.560
<v Speaker 4>there's no mechanism that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>detect.</v>

914
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.891
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's another reason why they are not </v>

915
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:29.721
<v Speaker 4>letting them know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm worried about is that they're </v>

916
00:45:29.721 --> 00:45:31.590
<v Speaker 4>scared that these companies which are </v>
<v Speaker 4>fanatical,</v>

917
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.980
<v Speaker 4>maniacal in a aggressive pursuit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominance in the cell phone markets and </v>

918
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.400
<v Speaker 4>technology in general are going to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and they're going to squash all </v>

919
00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:43.400
<v Speaker 4>these American companies.</v>

920
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:44.520
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much.</v>

921
00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:47.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is my own personal speculation,</v>

922
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:48.450
<v Speaker 4>but I'm looking at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

923
00:45:48.451 --> 00:45:51.150
<v Speaker 4>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much legitimacy.</v>

924
00:45:51.151 --> 00:45:54.000
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that because they're right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>worldwide.</v>

925
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:56.970
<v Speaker 4>I believe that the number three cell </v>
<v Speaker 4>phone manufacturer,</v>

926
00:45:56.971 --> 00:45:58.980
<v Speaker 4>I think it's Samsung,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apple,</v>

927
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.040
<v Speaker 4>and then walk away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't buy Huawei phones in </v>

928
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:04.060
<v Speaker 4>America and I'm wondering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

929
00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:09.810
<v Speaker 4>we're scared of the Chinese taking over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to try and get one of </v>

930
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 4>these phones anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did try to get one,</v>

931
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.190
<v Speaker 4>but what I've found out is they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

932
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.440
<v Speaker 4>they're not set up for the US market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The GSM phones and I'm on a CDMA </v>

933
00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.520
<v Speaker 4>network,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the GSM phones,</v>

934
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:24.840
<v Speaker 4>they using different bands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not using all the same bands.</v>

935
00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:29.100
<v Speaker 4>Like when you buy a phone from China,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's for the UK,</v>

936
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.800
<v Speaker 4>they don't use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you,</v>

937
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.200
<v Speaker 4>there's some places we would sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 4>coverage.</v>

938
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:39.320
<v Speaker 4>Say if you bought a and if you are a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cell phone genius out there and you'll </v>

939
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 4>listen to me butcher this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sorry,</v>

940
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.130
<v Speaker 4>but this is all I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's up?</v>

941
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Could you just use it with Wifi only and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not connected to the fuck would you do </v>

942
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:50.621
<v Speaker 2>that because you're in the Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost ended up talking about as a </v>

943
00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:50.621
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

944
00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:50.621
<v Speaker 2>but where's Wifi?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You driving your phone,</v>

945
00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:52.900
<v Speaker 2>your Wifi when you're driving your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you doing that?</v>

946
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Time Warner has wifi all over la if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have wifi problem with tracking you.</v>

947
00:46:57.021 --> 00:46:58.490
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely 100 percent.</v>

948
00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're driving in your car,</v>

949
00:47:00.831 --> 00:47:03.650
<v Speaker 2>you could be on Wifi and have your cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone service shut off.</v>

950
00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Cars also now have them built into their</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing too.</v>

951
00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:09.170
<v Speaker 2>There's those are cellular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your cellular logic.</v>

952
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.910
<v Speaker 2>It was just a question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't you also.</v>

953
00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:16.180
<v Speaker 2>But that's a cellular Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have to have a cellular </v>

954
00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:19.001
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like who would be your cellular </v>

955
00:47:19.001 --> 00:47:20.831
<v Speaker 2>provider?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're just connecting your phone </v>

956
00:47:20.831 --> 00:47:20.831
<v Speaker 2>to a Wifi thing and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different thing.</v>

957
00:47:20.831 --> 00:47:21.800
<v Speaker 2>BMW or Mercedes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

958
00:47:21.801 --> 00:47:24.380
<v Speaker 2>So whatever that is would be a local </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

959
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:26.810
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to be right next to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking car.</v>

960
00:47:26.811 --> 00:47:27.950
<v Speaker 2>You use your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's stupid.</v>

961
00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:33.280
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is the problem with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what our article that I read </v>

962
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.070
<v Speaker 2>does explaining the problem from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was one of those tech sites,</v>

963
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.010
<v Speaker 2>but it was saying that in certain places</v>
<v Speaker 2>with limited coverage,</v>

964
00:47:39.011 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 2>you probably would have no coverage with</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these phones.</v>

965
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Whereas it would work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

966
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:48.630
<v Speaker 2>if you were in New York or in Los </v>
<v Speaker 2>Angeles or Chicago or something like </v>

967
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.050
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you went to the boonies where you</v>

968
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:51.430
<v Speaker 2>might get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have verizon,</v>

969
00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 2>you probably could be able to text your </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends or get a phone call out,</v>

970
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:56.380
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't be able to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be a lot harder.</v>

971
00:47:56.381 --> 00:48:01.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not optimized for our </v>

972
00:48:01.381 --> 00:48:01.381
<v Speaker 2>networks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

973
00:48:01.381 --> 00:48:02.770
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it'll change or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not just keeps quashing them,</v>

974
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:08.340
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder did the problem is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe they think walway is connected </v>

975
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:11.000
<v Speaker 2>with the communist government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

976
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're completely integrated,</v>

977
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.270
<v Speaker 2>so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

978
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.670
<v Speaker 2>the separation of business and </v>
<v Speaker 2>government over there is.</v>

979
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:21.280
<v Speaker 2>It's very sketchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

980
00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fuck do I know?</v>

981
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder if there's a fear of Asian</v>

982
00:48:27.581 --> 00:48:30.200
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

983
00:48:30.201 --> 00:48:32.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean how could that be though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Samsung.</v>

984
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Samsung is everywhere.</v>

985
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:35.040
<v Speaker 5>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

986
00:48:35.041 --> 00:48:37.290
<v Speaker 5>they're going to come for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're coming for us right now.</v>

987
00:48:37.291 --> 00:48:38.400
<v Speaker 5>It's only a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

988
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:43.430
<v Speaker 5>who's they?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people who want equality of outcome </v>

989
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.430
<v Speaker 5>for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

990
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:49.250
<v Speaker 5>who are those people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people who are really into identity </v>

991
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.250
<v Speaker 5>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think,</v>

992
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:53.810
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't really think that's what was </v>

993
00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:54.090
<v Speaker 5>holding back Walway I thought it was the</v>
<v Speaker 5>government,</v>

994
00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:57.030
<v Speaker 5>the government was worried about them </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting too much money and power,</v>

995
00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.520
<v Speaker 5>but I guess if you're asking me in terms</v>
<v Speaker 5>of my,</v>

996
00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.270
<v Speaker 5>my view on things and in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where I would take it.</v>

997
00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.730
<v Speaker 5>So the equality of outcome people,</v>

998
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:10.890
<v Speaker 2>the reason why they're trying to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians or at least limit the number of </v>

999
00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Asians in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But does that have the opposite effect?</v>

1000
00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that make Asians work even </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder?</v>

1001
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.130
<v Speaker 2>And I mean if you keep them out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard,</v>

1002
00:49:21.131 --> 00:49:22.360
<v Speaker 2>they're just going to go to Yale,</v>

1003
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.660
<v Speaker 5>keep Medicare doesn't have numbers like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1004
00:49:25.661 --> 00:49:30.661
<v Speaker 5>So at Caltech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there're a lot of Asians there because </v>

1005
00:49:30.661 --> 00:49:30.661
<v Speaker 5>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1006
00:49:30.661 --> 00:49:31.000
<v Speaker 5>they don't discriminate so they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominate.</v>

1007
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.310
<v Speaker 5>So you use Caltech as a petri dish?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be like a controlled.</v>

1008
00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:34.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's wrong with that?</v>

1010
00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1011
00:49:41.851 --> 00:49:42.180
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1012
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:47.210
<v Speaker 2>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's wrong with certain cultures </v>

1013
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.210
<v Speaker 2>dominating?</v>

1014
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:48.390
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>

1015
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.110
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1016
00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:53.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you're asking me in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what people see as a problem,</v>

1017
00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:59.790
<v Speaker 5>I think because it looks as though other</v>
<v Speaker 5>groups are not getting a fair chance.</v>

1018
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.130
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make people feel good,</v>

1019
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:07.260
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it means that you're </v>

1020
00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.451
<v Speaker 5>acknowledging at some level that some </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are doing better than other </v>

1021
00:50:08.451 --> 00:50:08.820
<v Speaker 5>people and that makes some people </v>
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable.</v>

1022
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.820
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the participation trophy world,</v>

1023
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.520
<v Speaker 5>the equality of outcome world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:50:14.521 --> 00:50:15.720
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1025
00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:19.980
<v Speaker 5>But it's gone to a place where it </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes indefensible,</v>

1026
00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:25.310
<v Speaker 5>so instead of raise trying to raise up </v>
<v Speaker 5>people whose scores are lower and them </v>

1027
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 5>any an equal</v>

1028
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.160
<v Speaker 2>opportunity or take people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>impoverished areas with poor education </v>

1029
00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.360
<v Speaker 2>and give them more of a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what affirmative action was </v>

1030
00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:37.360
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Instead of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it from the top down.</v>

1032
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 2>You're going to many of these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are doing good,</v>

1033
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 2>we've got to squash it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will limit their ability,</v>

1034
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:48.710
<v Speaker 2>but how could they do that in good </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience?</v>

1035
00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:51.350
<v Speaker 2>That's what's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but did doing it from that perspective,</v>

1036
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:55.430
<v Speaker 2>doing it like looking at a race that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>super successful,</v>

1037
00:50:55.431 --> 00:51:00.431
<v Speaker 2>that is also a minority and saying too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them.</v>

1038
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:06.220
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think these people do think </v>

1039
00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.761
<v Speaker 5>they're doing something good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're doing it for the better of </v>

1040
00:51:09.761 --> 00:51:11.420
<v Speaker 5>society and for these other groups.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to see it too.</v>

1041
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.400
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever talked to someone about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

1042
00:51:13.401 --> 00:51:15.470
<v Speaker 5>That's pro discrimination against </v>
<v Speaker 5>Asians?</v>

1043
00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:20.540
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after I wrote that column for the Globe </v>

1044
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.720
<v Speaker 5>and Mail and number of people came out </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the woodwork to tell me how wrong I </v>

1045
00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.211
<v Speaker 5>was and there was some white,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some Asians do well to say don't let </v>

1046
00:51:26.391 --> 00:51:29.150
<v Speaker 5>yourself be used by the far right to </v>
<v Speaker 5>justify,</v>

1047
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:31.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking down other groups.</v>

1048
00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.320
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an interesting way of looking at </v>

1049
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:37.320
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.010
<v Speaker 5>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's one way that you could </v>

1051
00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:39.010
<v Speaker 5>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1052
00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:39.920
<v Speaker 2>was that way possible to look at it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't even make any sense.</v>

1053
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.840
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would the far.</v>

1054
00:51:41.841 --> 00:51:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the fire,</v>

1055
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Rachel hold of the superiority of Asians</v>
<v Speaker 2>in academics</v>

1056
00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:54.060
<v Speaker 5>because there are other racial groups </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they don't like or I guess they </v>

1057
00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.761
<v Speaker 5>disliked more than they dislike Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they'll use Asians as a way to </v>

1058
00:51:56.761 --> 00:51:58.720
<v Speaker 5>justify discrimination against those </v>
<v Speaker 5>other groups.</v>

1059
00:51:58.721 --> 00:52:00.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really buy that,</v>

1060
00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.120
<v Speaker 5>but that's an argument I've heard the </v>
<v Speaker 5>arguments sucks.</v>

1061
00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.250
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to sit down with someone with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that argument.</v>

1062
00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.100
<v Speaker 5>That's a stupid argument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That argument doesn't work.</v>

1063
00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:14.550
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I find the most sad is there are </v>

1064
00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:14.550
<v Speaker 5>Asians who are totally fine and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

1065
00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:18.601
<v Speaker 5>I'm willing to give up my spot for </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone else because I think diversity </v>

1066
00:52:18.601 --> 00:52:20.200
<v Speaker 5>is important and I think that someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>who needs friends,</v>

1067
00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:23.830
<v Speaker 5>you need friends so bad you willing to </v>
<v Speaker 5>say that,</v>

1068
00:52:23.831 --> 00:52:26.200
<v Speaker 5>but that's a virtue signaling thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of those.</v>

1069
00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.850
<v Speaker 5>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope it's purchasing the.</v>

1070
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.770
<v Speaker 5>It's not someone who actually thinks </v>
<v Speaker 5>that way.</v>

1071
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:35.270
<v Speaker 2>They could actually think that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people cut their balls off and </v>

1072
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:39.230
<v Speaker 2>killed themselves because they thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>the comment was coming in the spaceship </v>

1073
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.230
<v Speaker 2>is behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought that too.</v>

1074
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:41.850
<v Speaker 2>People think all kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think all kinds of things.</v>

1075
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is one of the main reasons why </v>

1076
00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.800
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to talk to you is that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>do think all kinds of things I want to,</v>

1077
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1078
00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to neuroscientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what's happening.</v>

1079
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.760
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1080
00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:01.020
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were saying something about the </v>

1081
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:01.020
<v Speaker 5>Google memo earlier though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1082
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:01.020
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

1083
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:01.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's A.</v>

1084
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:01.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had james on and you know,</v>

1085
00:53:01.621 --> 00:53:04.620
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of fucked now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't really have a home.</v>

1086
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.620
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have a place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean in terms of like,</v>

1087
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:12.360
<v Speaker 2>like politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically or in terms of having a job.</v>

1088
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:15.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's like almost hireable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1089
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's employed now,</v>

1090
00:53:17.881 --> 00:53:22.881
<v Speaker 2>but he was in this lawsuit with Google </v>
<v Speaker 2>and scientifically he has every point in</v>

1091
00:53:24.721 --> 00:53:26.370
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know</v>

1092
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.260
<v Speaker 4>if it's ever going to hold up in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>climate.</v>

1093
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:33.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I actually got a chance to talk to </v>

1094
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.711
<v Speaker 3>james as part of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a podcast wrong speak that I </v>

1095
00:53:35.711 --> 00:53:38.741
<v Speaker 3>host with Jonathan Kay and our first </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode was actually about James to and </v>

1096
00:53:38.741 --> 00:53:42.650
<v Speaker 3>his saga and basically how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I took away from that whole thing,</v>

1097
00:53:42.651 --> 00:53:47.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's been almost a year now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how the media could not get</v>

1098
00:53:47.901 --> 00:53:50.510
<v Speaker 3>it right and I feel that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>intentionally smeared him.</v>

1099
00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:55.540
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that people didn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>the science so that they very </v>

1100
00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.941
<v Speaker 3>intentionally said we don't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to get clicks or we want to </v>

1101
00:53:57.941 --> 00:54:01.130
<v Speaker 3>basically sacrifices man for our agenda.</v>

1102
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:03.540
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you and I don't think it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just the media.</v>

1103
00:54:03.541 --> 00:54:08.541
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the CEO of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it youtube that was saying that it </v>

1104
00:54:08.541 --> 00:54:10.670
<v Speaker 4>was promoting harmful gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>stereotypes?</v>

1105
00:54:10.671 --> 00:54:12.630
<v Speaker 4>Vp of Google put that statement out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1106
00:54:12.631 --> 00:54:13.560
<v Speaker 4>Other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1107
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:18.650
<v Speaker 4>but one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the women that ran youtube was </v>

1108
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:22.190
<v Speaker 4>talking about a two and the way she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>describing it was as if he was talking </v>

1109
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:23.700
<v Speaker 4>about women being inferior and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not what he said or somebody said,</v>

1110
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:28.790
<v Speaker 4>and not only that they neglected to to </v>
<v Speaker 4>promote the fact that it was at least a </v>

1111
00:54:29.731 --> 00:54:34.731
<v Speaker 4>page and a half of that memo was about </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to encourage women to be more active</v>

1112
00:54:35.611 --> 00:54:36.400
<v Speaker 4>in tech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.020
<v Speaker 4>This was not an anti woman scream.</v>

1114
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1115
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.730
<v Speaker 3>and I mean if you hear what he had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>save when I spoke with him,</v>

1116
00:54:43.731 --> 00:54:48.731
<v Speaker 3>he very much was for equality and very </v>
<v Speaker 3>much it was for men and women being </v>

1117
00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:50.270
<v Speaker 3>working together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1118
00:54:50.271 --> 00:54:55.271
<v Speaker 3>and it's not a misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's crazy that that's the </v>

1119
00:54:55.271 --> 00:54:55.271
<v Speaker 3>narrative that continues to go on now.</v>

1120
00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:59.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem is he actually started.</v>

1121
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:04.280
<v Speaker 4>He actually cited the studies that </v>
<v Speaker 4>showed why people choose different </v>

1122
00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:10.101
<v Speaker 4>professions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why people gravitate towards different </v>

1123
00:55:10.101 --> 00:55:11.490
<v Speaker 4>activities in different professions </v>
<v Speaker 4>based on gender.</v>

1124
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:16.440
<v Speaker 4>And these are actual studies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in inciting those studies,</v>

1125
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:21.470
<v Speaker 4>he cited something that's contrary to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this promoted narrative and that's where</v>

1126
00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:25.080
<v Speaker 4>he was shot down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hence the title of your podcast.</v>

1127
00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.030
<v Speaker 4>He did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Speak,</v>

1128
00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:27.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1129
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is,</v>

1130
00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:33.930
<v Speaker 3>the most important aspect of the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the things that people are </v>

1131
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:34.430
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some truth to it.</v>

1132
00:55:34.431 --> 00:55:36.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not just crazy loopy ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1133
00:55:36.951 --> 00:55:38.630
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's truth to it.</v>

1134
00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:41.000
<v Speaker 3>But for some reason we still can't say </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1135
00:55:41.001 --> 00:55:41.870
<v Speaker 3>And why is that?</v>

1136
00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:47.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with denial of any facts</v>

1137
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:54.130
<v Speaker 4>is that the people that are opposing you</v>
<v Speaker 4>now have evidence that you're alone,</v>

1138
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:59.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the problems with the left </v>

1139
00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:02.651
<v Speaker 4>and this really radical progressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior that's in denial of science is </v>

1140
00:56:02.841 --> 00:56:05.270
<v Speaker 4>now the right gets to look at the lab </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go,</v>

1141
00:56:05.271 --> 00:56:06.890
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are their fucking mind.</v>

1142
00:56:06.891 --> 00:56:10.130
<v Speaker 4>Why do you trust him about abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you trust him about this?</v>

1143
00:56:10.131 --> 00:56:11.720
<v Speaker 4>Why do you trust them about climate </v>
<v Speaker 4>change?</v>

1144
00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:16.550
<v Speaker 4>Clearly there loons and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is mean.</v>

1145
00:56:16.551 --> 00:56:19.790
<v Speaker 4>This is just weird toxic tribal </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>

1146
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I mean,</v>

1147
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:23.260
<v Speaker 3>how can you legitimately denied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're saying,</v>

1148
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:26.800
<v Speaker 3>men and women are different when you say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people stop listening,</v>

1149
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:31.630
<v Speaker 3>they do think you're a crazy person and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they miss the larger point because there</v>

1150
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:33.280
<v Speaker 3>are some people who will look at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

1151
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:34.420
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women are different.</v>

1152
00:56:34.421 --> 00:56:39.421
<v Speaker 3>That must mean women are not competent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of having this more nuanced </v>

1153
00:56:39.421 --> 00:56:41.110
<v Speaker 3>argument or discussion about we can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

1154
00:56:41.111 --> 00:56:42.940
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean women are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>competent.</v>

1155
00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:48.180
<v Speaker 3>They just simply say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to say that men and women are </v>

1156
00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:48.180
<v Speaker 3>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we,</v>

1157
00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:51.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not even speaking at the same </v>

1158
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:51.000
<v Speaker 3>level and in that case,</v>

1159
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.250
<v Speaker 4>well it's so foolish and we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's clearly differences between men </v>

1160
00:56:58.251 --> 00:57:01.150
<v Speaker 4>and women and there's clearly </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences inside genders.</v>

1161
00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:06.151
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's human beings very widely </v>
<v Speaker 4>and wildly and it's one of the more </v>

1162
00:57:06.151 --> 00:57:07.510
<v Speaker 4>interesting things about us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1163
00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:10.480
<v Speaker 4>it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fascinating thing because it's,</v>

1164
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:14.510
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing has got to go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to move around.</v>

1165
00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:16.790
<v Speaker 4>And the only way it moves around as if </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's different.</v>

1166
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.090
<v Speaker 4>If everybody just a block,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same shape,</v>

1167
00:57:20.091 --> 00:57:22.520
<v Speaker 4>the same density,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same size,</v>

1168
00:57:22.521 --> 00:57:24.500
<v Speaker 4>like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

1169
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just boring.</v>

1170
00:57:26.301 --> 00:57:28.160
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to have a competence </v>
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>

1171
00:57:28.161 --> 00:57:31.130
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to work like you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>soft and hard.</v>

1172
00:57:31.131 --> 00:57:34.070
<v Speaker 4>You need both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need something in between.</v>

1173
00:57:34.071 --> 00:57:39.071
<v Speaker 4>You need far extreme right to polarize </v>
<v Speaker 4>and activate the far extreme left.</v>

1174
00:57:39.981 --> 00:57:44.981
<v Speaker 4>I mean I really think you need a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>like trump to get people to be more </v>

1175
00:57:44.981 --> 00:57:46.340
<v Speaker 4>politically active and more socially </v>
<v Speaker 4>active.</v>

1176
00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:51.340
<v Speaker 4>I think in many ways he does the left of</v>
<v Speaker 4>service by providing this like </v>

1177
00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:55.750
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous figurehead of what's possible</v>
<v Speaker 4>with ego and greed and and and right </v>

1178
00:57:56.091 --> 00:58:00.710
<v Speaker 4>wing gone a muck Steve Bannon's and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>breitbarts and all that.</v>

1179
00:58:00.711 --> 00:58:05.711
<v Speaker 4>Stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stuff empowers the other side and the </v>

1180
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:09.581
<v Speaker 4>good thing about it is somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle is like a balanced healthy </v>

1181
00:58:09.581 --> 00:58:10.730
<v Speaker 4>society and hopefully we'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>achieve that someday.</v>

1182
00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:16.240
<v Speaker 4>But I mean this is the argument always </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you cannot have light without </v>

1183
00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.010
<v Speaker 4>dark and have good without evil and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pendulum is gonna Swing back,</v>

1184
00:58:19.011 --> 00:58:21.350
<v Speaker 4>hopefully just waiting for that to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

1185
00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:24.200
<v Speaker 4>It always does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to always do that.</v>

1186
00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:29.500
<v Speaker 4>I just would hope that with the amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of information that's available today </v>

1187
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:33.560
<v Speaker 4>that we can look at the actual studies </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are being done on gender,</v>

1188
00:58:33.561 --> 00:58:35.360
<v Speaker 4>on sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on biology,</v>

1189
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:40.600
<v Speaker 4>and don't look at it in terms of don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>quantify it in terms of the this side's </v>

1190
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:40.790
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

1191
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:42.070
<v Speaker 4>That's it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just look at it.</v>

1192
00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:46.880
<v Speaker 4>What fascinating differences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is amazing and it's interesting and</v>

1193
00:58:46.881 --> 00:58:51.881
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of dummies that are men </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a lot of dummies that are </v>

1194
00:58:51.881 --> 00:58:52.430
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just dummies and it doesn't have</v>

1195
00:58:52.431 --> 00:58:56.660
<v Speaker 4>anything to do with one gender being </v>
<v Speaker 4>superior or one gender being inferior.</v>

1196
00:58:56.690 --> 00:59:01.690
<v Speaker 4>It's just human beings have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>variability and there's a lot of </v>

1197
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:05.891
<v Speaker 4>different things that a lot of inputs </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you developing and becoming a 30 </v>

1198
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:11.770
<v Speaker 4>year old person that happens to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to this other 30 year old </v>

1199
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:12.650
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your path to get to wherever you are.</v>

1200
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:18.490
<v Speaker 4>There's so much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's influences in terms of your </v>

1201
00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:19.820
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your education,</v>

1202
00:59:19.821 --> 00:59:21.080
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life,</v>

1203
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.890
<v Speaker 4>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your loved ones,</v>

1204
00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:29.891
<v Speaker 4>your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so much that leads to you being </v>

1205
00:59:29.891 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 4>who you are today and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating to study that,</v>

1206
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 4>but only if you're allowed to actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it</v>

1207
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:40.390
<v Speaker 3>and be honest with you because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no point otherwise if you're just going </v>

1208
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:41.320
<v Speaker 3>to keep pumping out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like from a research perspective,</v>

1209
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:42.230
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go in,</v>

1210
00:59:42.231 --> 00:59:44.660
<v Speaker 3>the only scientists are going to look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff now.</v>

1211
00:59:44.661 --> 00:59:46.640
<v Speaker 3>The people who know what they're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to find in advance,</v>

1212
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to publish anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna upset the public.</v>

1213
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:54.370
<v Speaker 3>So in my mind there was no point to even</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that kind of research because that's </v>

1214
00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:54.370
<v Speaker 3>not actually science what you're doing.</v>

1215
00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:55.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really crazy,</v>

1216
00:59:55.381 --> 01:00:00.381
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets really crazy or </v>

1217
01:00:00.381 --> 01:00:02.691
<v Speaker 4>you're not even allowed to do certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of research or if you are doing </v>

1218
01:00:03.331 --> 01:00:04.980
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be categorized,</v>

1219
01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:06.270
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's all right.</v>

1220
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:07.560
<v Speaker 4>Or your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1221
01:00:07.561 --> 01:00:12.360
<v Speaker 4>you're conservative or you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1222
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're bad.</v>

1223
01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.330
<v Speaker 4>You're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Speak.</v>

1224
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1225
01:00:16.361 --> 01:00:21.361
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why did you decide to call your </v>

1226
01:00:21.361 --> 01:00:21.361
<v Speaker 3>podcast that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1227
01:00:21.361 --> 01:00:22.240
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a throwback to Orwell,</v>

1228
01:00:22.241 --> 01:00:27.241
<v Speaker 3>obviously in 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this idea that by controlling </v>

1229
01:00:27.241 --> 01:00:30.841
<v Speaker 3>language we can control the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can control how people think and what </v>

1230
01:00:30.841 --> 01:00:35.011
<v Speaker 3>reality is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I find interesting is with the </v>

1231
01:00:35.011 --> 01:00:38.641
<v Speaker 3>topics we covered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first episode we talked to James </v>

1232
01:00:38.641 --> 01:00:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Damore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>second episode we talked to Lindsay </v>

1233
01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.280
<v Speaker 3>Shepherd and looked at the whole what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened at Wilfrid laurier university.</v>

1234
01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the third one is rapid onset </v>

1235
01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:49.621
<v Speaker 3>gender dysphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So looking at this trend and adolescent </v>

1236
01:00:49.621 --> 01:00:53.191
<v Speaker 3>girls who come out as transgender even </v>
<v Speaker 3>though they've had no previous signs of </v>

1237
01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:54.370
<v Speaker 3>gender dysphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so with all of them,</v>

1238
01:00:54.371 --> 01:00:56.790
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these issues are all super taboo and all</v>

1239
01:00:56.810 --> 01:01:01.810
<v Speaker 3>these people have been mobbed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the case of rapid onset gender </v>

1240
01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:02.440
<v Speaker 3>dysphoria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the parents who are being called</v>

1241
01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Trans phobic for questioning is my </v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter really trends,</v>

1242
01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:07.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just trying to get at the truth.</v>

1243
01:01:07.451 --> 01:01:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to understand,</v>

1244
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:14.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it we can't talk about these </v>

1245
01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.991
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it we're in such a situation now </v>

1246
01:01:15.991 --> 01:01:15.991
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the response to any sort of,</v>

1247
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:21.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unpopular idea is to be mobbed into </v>

1248
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.700
<v Speaker 3>attack people and intimidate them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shut the conversation down.</v>

1249
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Like how do we stop that from happening?</v>

1250
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.370
<v Speaker 4>Explained rapid onset gender dysphoria </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm not really aware of that.</v>

1251
01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.620
<v Speaker 3>So it's this phenomenon that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing more recently.</v>

1252
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:36.730
<v Speaker 3>How recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably say in the last 10 years </v>

1253
01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:39.200
<v Speaker 3>there's been a switch though before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a referrals to gender clinics have kids </v>

1254
01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.290
<v Speaker 3>who are feeling that they are born the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite.</v>

1255
01:01:40.291 --> 01:01:45.291
<v Speaker 3>Sex was predominantly boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then suddenly there's been this </v>

1256
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:46.770
<v Speaker 3>explosion of girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you talk to the parents,</v>

1257
01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:48.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's interesting when,</v>

1258
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:49.800
<v Speaker 3>when you listened to the episode that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>

1259
01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:53.310
<v Speaker 3>their stories are so similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're literally identical.</v>

1260
01:01:53.311 --> 01:01:58.311
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their daughters have always been gender </v>

1261
01:01:58.311 --> 01:01:58.311
<v Speaker 3>typical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're always very girly girls.</v>

1262
01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:00.120
<v Speaker 3>They've never been gender dysphoric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go through puberty,</v>

1263
01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.330
<v Speaker 3>they develop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1264
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:06.360
<v Speaker 3>there's no problem there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then usually what happens is there's </v>

1265
01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.221
<v Speaker 3>some sort of Dunno educational session </v>
<v Speaker 3>at school or one of these girls,</v>

1266
01:02:09.871 --> 01:02:13.290
<v Speaker 3>their friends come out as trans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the daughter says,</v>

1267
01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:14.550
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a boy.</v>

1268
01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:19.740
<v Speaker 3>And so if you take that child to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional like therapist,</v>

1269
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 3>the therapist has to affirm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the therapist can question that.</v>

1270
01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:28.210
<v Speaker 3>And so you have these girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them have autism or they have </v>

1271
01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:30.981
<v Speaker 3>other mental health issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not getting treated for those </v>

1272
01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:30.981
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead they're being told,</v>

1273
01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:32.910
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to transition will help you.</v>

1274
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.340
<v Speaker 3>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not against adults transitioning.</v>

1275
01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:38.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's anyone's place to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell an adult what to do.</v>

1276
01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 3>And I think transitioning can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial,</v>

1277
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:42.780
<v Speaker 3>but you want this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone transitions,</v>

1278
01:02:42.781 --> 01:02:44.850
<v Speaker 3>you want it to actually help them feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1279
01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.730
<v Speaker 3>And for these girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the issue is not even about gender,</v>

1280
01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.010
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make sense for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>transition</v>

1281
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:53.890
<v Speaker 4>mother's rapid onset gender dysphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this typically females?</v>

1282
01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:54.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1283
01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:55.990
<v Speaker 3>almost all females.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would,</v>

1284
01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.350
<v Speaker 3>what is the cause of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's social contagion.</v>

1285
01:02:59.351 --> 01:03:04.351
<v Speaker 3>I think part of it is for some of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls they are a bit socially awkward </v>

1286
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:04.570
<v Speaker 3>and so when they come out as </v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender,</v>

1287
01:03:04.571 --> 01:03:07.210
<v Speaker 3>suddenly everybody loves them and wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to support them.</v>

1288
01:03:07.211 --> 01:03:09.070
<v Speaker 3>And I think as people should for trans </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1289
01:03:09.071 --> 01:03:11.320
<v Speaker 3>because obviously it's a difficult thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go through,</v>

1290
01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:16.650
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's an aspect of it that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people aren't talking about that kids </v>

1291
01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:19.000
<v Speaker 3>are coming out as transgender just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it gives them acceptance,</v>

1292
01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:24.110
<v Speaker 4>an extra reward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a reward in terms of the </v>

1293
01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:24.110
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1294
01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also I think for girls,</v>

1295
01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:28.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean puberty is not a fun time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puberty's not a fun time for anybody,</v>

1296
01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:32.110
<v Speaker 3>but for God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't go through puberty.</v>

1297
01:03:32.111 --> 01:03:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1298
01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:33.600
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

1299
01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.870
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1300
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.470
<v Speaker 4>for like I love when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1301
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.130
<v Speaker 4>it's harder for guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck would,</v>

1302
01:03:39.131 --> 01:03:40.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he never been a girl.</v>

1303
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.380
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone is kind of awkward and Lanky.</v>

1304
01:03:44.381 --> 01:03:45.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life is hard.</v>

1305
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 4>Life is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You being a person being a finite </v>

1306
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 4>organism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cleaning to a ball,</v>

1307
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:52.720
<v Speaker 4>it's spinning a thousand miles an hour </v>
<v Speaker 4>hurling through infinity.</v>

1308
01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:54.850
<v Speaker 4>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life's weird.</v>

1309
01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:00.120
<v Speaker 4>And then the fact that your biology </v>
<v Speaker 4>changes and you get inundated with </v>

1310
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:00.390
<v Speaker 4>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>

1311
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:05.530
<v Speaker 4>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the life that we live and then adapting </v>

1312
01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:05.860
<v Speaker 4>to culture and trying to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be accepted.</v>

1313
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.560
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that certainly plays a </v>
<v Speaker 4>part,</v>

1314
01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:13.800
<v Speaker 4>this rapid onset gender dysphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is this being treated like in terms </v>

1315
01:04:15.461 --> 01:04:19.510
<v Speaker 4>of like how's this being accepted in </v>
<v Speaker 4>academia?</v>

1316
01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:24.570
<v Speaker 4>How's it being discussed in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature and what are the </v>

1317
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:27.280
<v Speaker 4>recommendations for what to do about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>or to descriptions of what it is.</v>

1318
01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only been one study so far </v>

1319
01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.301
<v Speaker 3>that's been published because it is such</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new phenomenon and because it is so </v>

1320
01:04:34.301 --> 01:04:37.700
<v Speaker 3>hard to do this work because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people call it a myth pretty much</v>

1321
01:04:37.701 --> 01:04:41.960
<v Speaker 3>anything that counters the transgender </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative is considered hate speech.</v>

1322
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:47.170
<v Speaker 3>So as a researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you try to do any research on this </v>

1323
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:49.910
<v Speaker 3>issue that goes against what trans </v>
<v Speaker 3>activists say is acceptable,</v>

1324
01:04:49.911 --> 01:04:51.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get into trouble.</v>

1325
01:04:51.111 --> 01:04:53.720
<v Speaker 3>So no one wants to touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's been one study that did show,</v>

1326
01:04:53.721 --> 01:04:55.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with girls especially,</v>

1327
01:04:55.341 --> 01:04:59.120
<v Speaker 3>it's very much about being influenced by</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends within a peer group.</v>

1328
01:04:59.121 --> 01:05:04.121
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some crazy high number </v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the number of girls that </v>

1329
01:05:04.121 --> 01:05:04.130
<v Speaker 3>will come out as transgender one after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other,</v>

1330
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:06.190
<v Speaker 3>so it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1331
01:05:06.191 --> 01:05:11.191
<v Speaker 3>I mean I get why people find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people find it threatening because </v>

1332
01:05:11.191 --> 01:05:12.890
<v Speaker 3>it suggests that maybe trans people </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't really transgender,</v>

1333
01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the way they feel isn't </v>

1334
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.301
<v Speaker 3>legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of the way to treat there </v>

1335
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:20.140
<v Speaker 3>are these parents are at our last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1336
01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:25.141
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these girls are not getting treated for </v>

1337
01:05:25.141 --> 01:05:25.141
<v Speaker 3>the underlying condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was one parent we spoke to,</v>

1338
01:05:25.141 --> 01:05:30.120
<v Speaker 3>he saw nine mental health professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every single one said that your </v>

1339
01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.021
<v Speaker 3>daughter's not transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they couldn't go on the record as </v>

1340
01:05:34.021 --> 01:05:36.721
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think only one went on the record </v>

1341
01:05:36.721 --> 01:05:36.721
<v Speaker 3>of saying so because they're terrified.</v>

1342
01:05:36.721 --> 01:05:38.320
<v Speaker 4>They're terrified of losing their job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're terrified of being attack.</v>

1343
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:39.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1344
01:05:39.161 --> 01:05:44.161
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so interesting where you watched </v>

1345
01:05:44.161 --> 01:05:47.071
<v Speaker 4>the similarities between any group that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like is that feels that they're being </v>

1346
01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:54.751
<v Speaker 4>maligned or that are being very </v>
<v Speaker 4>defensive about their position and </v>

1347
01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:57.310
<v Speaker 4>trying to hold strong and aggressively </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacking people that are against it.</v>

1348
01:05:57.790 --> 01:06:02.790
<v Speaker 4>It in many ways this sort of behavior is</v>
<v Speaker 4>mirrored in the second amendment.</v>

1349
01:06:03.701 --> 01:06:08.701
<v Speaker 4>People like the people that are pro gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you tried any gun restrictions </v>

1350
01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:14.550
<v Speaker 4>or any gun legislation or any changes in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the laws of gun control,</v>

1351
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:18.470
<v Speaker 4>they aggressively go after it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1352
01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.210
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do whatever they can to keep things</v>

1353
01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:26.980
<v Speaker 4>the way they are now and show how much </v>
<v Speaker 4>positive benefits guns have and how,</v>

1354
01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:31.090
<v Speaker 4>how many people are saved by guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's this thing besides the gun,</v>

1355
01:06:31.091 --> 01:06:33.160
<v Speaker 4>take the gun out of it and it's this.</v>

1356
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:36.550
<v Speaker 4>It's the defense of the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like very committed.</v>

1357
01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>

1358
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.200
<v Speaker 4>They identify with being a person who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a gun nut or a gun supporter of Second </v>

1359
01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:42.970
<v Speaker 4>Amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1360
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:45.760
<v Speaker 4>freedom loving and I got a fucking eagle</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my back.</v>

1361
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:46.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of shit.</v>

1362
01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:51.961
<v Speaker 4>And it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this the same thing with trans </v>

1363
01:06:51.961 --> 01:06:51.961
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like anything against anything,</v>

1364
01:06:51.961 --> 01:06:53.620
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is impossible.</v>

1365
01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:58.830
<v Speaker 4>This thing that you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this rapid onset gender dysphoria being </v>

1366
01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:02.161
<v Speaker 4>autistic people that is transphobic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the and they get super hyper aggressive </v>

1367
01:07:02.161 --> 01:07:02.530
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of saying,</v>

1368
01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1369
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:05.960
<v Speaker 4>whoever this person is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're a trans person,</v>

1370
01:07:05.961 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 4>so saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1371
01:07:06.521 --> 01:07:10.180
<v Speaker 4>I am legitimately trans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but his entire po entirely possible that</v>

1372
01:07:10.181 --> 01:07:15.181
<v Speaker 4>there's a broad spectrum of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior and human thought and that some</v>

1373
01:07:15.671 --> 01:07:18.730
<v Speaker 4>of these people have a real issue and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could see the reward,</v>

1374
01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:23.731
<v Speaker 4>especially in today's climate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you look at today's climate was </v>

1375
01:07:23.731 --> 01:07:24.340
<v Speaker 4>that would be an interesting study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1376
01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:29.490
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the climate of today and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the support of trans people and the </v>

1377
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:35.610
<v Speaker 4>attacking of people that are transphobic</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the the overwhelming social benefit </v>

1378
01:07:38.381 --> 01:07:43.210
<v Speaker 4>of supporting trans people and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the rapid onset gender dysphoria</v>

1379
01:07:43.211 --> 01:07:46.300
<v Speaker 4>and see if they match up what you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

1380
01:07:46.301 --> 01:07:47.150
<v Speaker 4>Actually I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

1381
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:51.710
<v Speaker 3>majority of Trans People are not on </v>
<v Speaker 3>board with this whole across the board.</v>

1382
01:07:51.711 --> 01:07:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Everyone should just transition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's.</v>

1383
01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:58.460
<v Speaker 3>It's another case of the vocal minority </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying shutting down.</v>

1384
01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who dares to disagree,</v>

1385
01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:05.640
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some trans people get very upset if non </v>

1386
01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.790
<v Speaker 4>trans people talk about Trans people </v>
<v Speaker 4>were just hilarious.</v>

1387
01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:09.850
<v Speaker 4>Like what are we supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Supposed to just shut our mouths and let</v>

1388
01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:12.940
<v Speaker 4>you just run things like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to do.</v>

1389
01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.560
<v Speaker 4>Like the Scarlett Johannsen things </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating.</v>

1390
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:20.360
<v Speaker 4>She was going to play a trans woman in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie and people freaked out.</v>

1391
01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:21.530
<v Speaker 4>Trans Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

1392
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:26.710
<v Speaker 4>a trans man in a movie and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>freaked out that she is not trans and </v>

1393
01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:28.850
<v Speaker 4>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She has this part,</v>

1394
01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:34.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the same thing that happened </v>

1395
01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.671
<v Speaker 4>with Jeffrey tambor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeffrey tambor was accused of sexual </v>

1396
01:08:35.671 --> 01:08:36.800
<v Speaker 4>harassment by people in the set who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>trans,</v>

1397
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.960
<v Speaker 4>who were also very upset that he was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>star of a television show that was about</v>

1398
01:08:41.961 --> 01:08:44.690
<v Speaker 4>trans people and he's not trans and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were trans.</v>

1399
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.420
<v Speaker 4>I get where people are coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do because you know,</v>

1400
01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:47.700
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

1401
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.960
<v Speaker 4>I think representation is important to </v>
<v Speaker 4>some extent and so I can understand if </v>

1402
01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.390
<v Speaker 4>you are of a group that isn't being </v>
<v Speaker 4>represented in the media,</v>

1403
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:59.780
<v Speaker 4>how you would want that to change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1404
01:08:59.781 --> 01:09:04.781
<v Speaker 4>But you also looking at an alias actress</v>
<v Speaker 4>who would bring an incredible amount of </v>

1405
01:09:04.781 --> 01:09:07.660
<v Speaker 4>attention to your progressive project </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1406
01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:12.470
<v Speaker 4>it may very well change the tone of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way people accept trans people.</v>

1407
01:09:12.790 --> 01:09:14.540
<v Speaker 4>Like if it's portrayed in a positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>light,</v>

1408
01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.480
<v Speaker 4>it's entirely possible that it would </v>
<v Speaker 4>open up.</v>

1409
01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:22.700
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if people that are on the </v>

1410
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.251
<v Speaker 4>fence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might open up their heart and they </v>

1411
01:09:24.251 --> 01:09:24.251
<v Speaker 4>make them look at things differently and</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1412
01:09:24.251 --> 01:09:24.620
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1413
01:09:24.621 --> 01:09:27.170
<v Speaker 4>I see where this woman wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1414
01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:32.370
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she wanted to transition to be a man </v>

1415
01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:33.200
<v Speaker 4>because she was wired incorrectly or </v>
<v Speaker 4>wired to be a man.</v>

1416
01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.520
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't even say it incorrectly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe you could see her as a person</v>

1417
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:42.521
<v Speaker 4>now instead of just as a subject for </v>
<v Speaker 4>debate or as a career I would have,</v>

1418
01:09:45.771 --> 01:09:49.370
<v Speaker 4>is not with your appointment with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>point with the tokenization of people.</v>

1419
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:50.090
<v Speaker 4>So to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1420
01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:52.850
<v Speaker 4>if this is a trans role,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to find a trans person.</v>

1421
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:53.520
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1422
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.600
<v Speaker 4>same as with racial tokenization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we need to have a certain quota so </v>

1423
01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.660
<v Speaker 4>we need to have this many number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that fit this.</v>

1424
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:02.140
<v Speaker 4>That's my only issue because then people</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it and say,</v>

1425
01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.550
<v Speaker 4>you only pick this person because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their identity,</v>

1426
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.500
<v Speaker 4>not because of what they brought to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>table.</v>

1427
01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.710
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I could argue against that.</v>

1428
01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:13.340
<v Speaker 4>If you go back and look and like John </v>
<v Speaker 4>Wayne when he played gingiss con,</v>

1429
01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.850
<v Speaker 4>like what in the fuck was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1430
01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:19.040
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of those really goofy </v>
<v Speaker 4>ones like Charlie Chan.</v>

1431
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:21.650
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see the old school Charlie </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chan movies?</v>

1432
01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:24.170
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we can find Charlie Chan.</v>

1433
01:10:24.171 --> 01:10:26.810
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1434
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.210
<v Speaker 4>couldn't even get an Asian guy to play </v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlie Chan,</v>

1435
01:10:29.211 --> 01:10:30.230
<v Speaker 4>but the fuck is this.</v>

1436
01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:35.570
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe they didn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even try to make John Wayne </v>

1437
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:38.150
<v Speaker 4>look like he was Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1438
01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:43.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do you ever see that ad where you </v>

1439
01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:44.150
<v Speaker 4>see the native American?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1440
01:10:44.151 --> 01:10:48.520
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the guy who played the.</v>

1441
01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:53.740
<v Speaker 4>Kathleen did that motherfucker doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even look a little Chinese and he talked</v>

1442
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:58.790
<v Speaker 4>like a real stereotypical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like shitty Chinese accent.</v>

1443
01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a bit offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super Offensive.</v>

1444
01:11:00.891 --> 01:11:03.050
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was the sign of the Times.</v>

1445
01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.120
<v Speaker 4>And so what trans people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

1446
01:11:05.121 --> 01:11:07.070
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the same goddamn thing.</v>

1447
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:12.550
<v Speaker 4>This is just you're looking at in terms </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Chinese people were looking at in </v>

1448
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:14.490
<v Speaker 4>terms of our people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not being represented</v>

1449
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:18.630
<v Speaker 2>and you have someone playing us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that native American ad?</v>

1450
01:11:18.631 --> 01:11:23.631
<v Speaker 2>There was an ad where someone would </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw litter out of the car window and </v>

1451
01:11:23.631 --> 01:11:24.930
<v Speaker 2>the native American guy had a tear </v>
<v Speaker 2>running down his cheek.</v>

1452
01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:25.820
<v Speaker 2>I do remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1453
01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:29.720
<v Speaker 2>The Guy was Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't even a little bit of American.</v>

1454
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Will they do now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody listening?</v>

1455
01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Some people know because I didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a researcher.</v>

1456
01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go deep and investigate.</v>

1457
01:11:39.791 --> 01:11:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I would just read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1458
01:11:40.951 --> 01:11:42.240
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1459
01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for a lot of these issues at the</v>

1460
01:11:44.161 --> 01:11:45.930
<v Speaker 2>core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something valuable there.</v>

1461
01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I do get the concern and I am empathic </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that,</v>

1462
01:11:48.241 --> 01:11:50.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's to the point now where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like every little thing.</v>

1463
01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:52.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well people,</v>

1464
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:57.710
<v Speaker 2>this is the outrage culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were like super pumped to find </v>

1465
01:11:57.710 --> 01:12:00.891
<v Speaker 2>something that's outrageous and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>point fingers and attack and they love </v>

1466
01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:02.220
<v Speaker 2>it when people back down.</v>

1467
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so excited.</v>

1468
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:06.900
<v Speaker 2>So like when scarlet Johannson backed </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of that movie,</v>

1469
01:12:06.901 --> 01:12:09.000
<v Speaker 2>everybody got so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did it.</v>

1470
01:12:09.001 --> 01:12:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've fucking got her,</v>

1471
01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1472
01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:14.340
<v Speaker 2>but when people don't back down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get,</v>

1473
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:17.040
<v Speaker 2>they just give up or they get confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what to do,</v>

1474
01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.260
<v Speaker 2>but that's the thing I find when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't back down,</v>

1475
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 2>they go and they find someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll leave you alone.</v>

1476
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Do you see what happened to Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeselnik?</v>

1477
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:23.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

1478
01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.360
<v Speaker 2>They're attacking Anthony Jeselnik.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're attacking a bunch of people for </v>

1479
01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.030
<v Speaker 2>tweet jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After James Gunn got fired.</v>

1480
01:12:30.031 --> 01:12:35.031
<v Speaker 2>You Know James Gunn is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the guy who was the director of </v>

1481
01:12:35.031 --> 01:12:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Guardians of the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1482
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:40.580
<v Speaker 2>he had some really questionable tweets </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were jokes.</v>

1483
01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote some jokey joke things,</v>

1484
01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:49.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's like about pedophilia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was like a huge screen of </v>

1485
01:12:51.051 --> 01:12:52.610
<v Speaker 2>them copied and pasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1486
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking terrible.</v>

1487
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:56.730
<v Speaker 2>The problem is they're not funny in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>

1488
01:12:56.731 --> 01:13:00.210
<v Speaker 2>their jokes and they're really gross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but should he be fired for that?</v>

1489
01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:01.980
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a shitty joke teller.</v>

1490
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.200
<v Speaker 2>If you find out he's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pedophile,</v>

1491
01:13:04.201 --> 01:13:06.800
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's Disney in this.</v>

1492
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Today's climate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then they find that Anthony Jeselnik,</v>

1493
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:14.870
<v Speaker 2>the standup comedian has a bunch of also</v>
<v Speaker 2>offensive jokes and some of them about </v>

1494
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:19.131
<v Speaker 2>pedophiles and so they go and try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack him and Anthony Jeselnik rights.</v>

1495
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Looking through my twitter timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something along.</v>

1496
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.360
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking is like looking for a needle in </v>

1497
01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.250
<v Speaker 2>a needle store on customer appreciation </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1498
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:36.270
<v Speaker 2>So true waist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his whole fucking thing is his </v>

1499
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:38.250
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Anthony Jeselnik in particular,</v>

1500
01:13:38.251 --> 01:13:43.251
<v Speaker 2>I'm friends with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His whole thing is being ruthless and </v>

1501
01:13:43.251 --> 01:13:48.140
<v Speaker 2>super offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he had a show called the Jeselnik </v>

1502
01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.140
<v Speaker 2>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what he does.</v>

1503
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:52.770
<v Speaker 2>He set his character is he's an awful </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1504
01:13:52.771 --> 01:13:55.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the character and so they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave up.</v>

1505
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:57.530
<v Speaker 2>It's totally lost on people now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1506
01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.160
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't say things,</v>

1507
01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:00.180
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1508
01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:05.210
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for people to back down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're looking for people to get </v>

1509
01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:05.210
<v Speaker 2>scared and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1510
01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:07.950
<v Speaker 2>this is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to find a target and find a,</v>

1511
01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:13.010
<v Speaker 2>let's get him fired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get her fired kicker tagger off that </v>

1512
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.010
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

1513
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:16.930
<v Speaker 4>It's fun for them because as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hashtag air quotes activist.</v>

1514
01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:21.760
<v Speaker 4>What they're doing is they're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacking and there's probably some good</v>

1515
01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:23.170
<v Speaker 4>out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>

1516
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:28.350
<v Speaker 4>there's gotta be some good for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Out of real monsters getting arrested,</v>

1517
01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:30.850
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1518
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.880
<v Speaker 4>there's some good out of like the Harvey</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weinsteins and the bill cosby's the </v>

1519
01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.481
<v Speaker 4>world getting arrested and getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>busted and shutting down and we would </v>

1520
01:14:39.481 --> 01:14:43.771
<v Speaker 4>hope that other monsters in waiting </v>
<v Speaker 4>would not act out on their instincts </v>

1521
01:14:45.971 --> 01:14:50.971
<v Speaker 4>because of the fact they're worried </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the repercussions that you're </v>

1522
01:14:50.971 --> 01:14:53.371
<v Speaker 4>clearly seeing and that we would hope </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people that are behavior as a </v>

1523
01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:58.921
<v Speaker 4>culture shifts one way or another and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's gonna move as far away from </v>

1524
01:14:58.921 --> 01:15:03.631
<v Speaker 4>massage and he is possible and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's through the threat of </v>

1525
01:15:03.631 --> 01:15:06.421
<v Speaker 4>incarceration or shame or whatever it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that causes it to go the other way.</v>

1526
01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:13.040
<v Speaker 4>It's probably for the best as long as it</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't go as far as all men are pigs,</v>

1527
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:19.590
<v Speaker 4>all men are creeps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All men are trash and that's what we </v>

1528
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:20.770
<v Speaker 4>were talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when it gets to that place,</v>

1529
01:15:20.771 --> 01:15:22.150
<v Speaker 4>you got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is not.</v>

1530
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:23.560
<v Speaker 4>This is not a good place to be.</v>

1531
01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:27.510
<v Speaker 6>Well also if there is an allegation that</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's taken at face value right away,</v>

1532
01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:31.230
<v Speaker 6>because we do see unfortunately that </v>
<v Speaker 6>some of these allegations are false.</v>

1533
01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:37.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to be this whole idea of believe </v>

1534
01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:37.150
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1535
01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:37.790
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was okay.</v>

1536
01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:42.791
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean don't believe men because</v>
<v Speaker 4>some women lie and some men lives.</v>

1537
01:15:43.190 --> 01:15:45.530
<v Speaker 4>What about individuals?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about human beings?</v>

1538
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:48.710
<v Speaker 4>So if we're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what we were talking about earlier,</v>

1539
01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.720
<v Speaker 4>like white power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black power,</v>

1540
01:15:50.721 --> 01:15:53.280
<v Speaker 4>Brown power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well let's fucking human beings.</v>

1541
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.560
<v Speaker 4>As soon as we stopped looking at human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings as individuals and we just agree </v>

1542
01:15:58.881 --> 01:16:02.720
<v Speaker 4>that one group is good and one group is </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>

1543
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:04.730
<v Speaker 4>You've got some real discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

1544
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:04.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1545
01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:10.250
<v Speaker 6>Well you can't win in that way either </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you can't look whether you side </v>

1546
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.710
<v Speaker 6>with believe all victims are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe,</v>

1547
01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:12.360
<v Speaker 6>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe women or something like that,</v>

1548
01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:17.490
<v Speaker 6>if there's a Hashtag,</v>
<v Speaker 6>believe women believe so I believe </v>

1549
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:17.490
<v Speaker 6>survivors or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

1550
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:22.400
<v Speaker 6>and then or if you say you want due </v>
<v Speaker 6>process and women lie and you know that </v>

1551
01:16:22.801 --> 01:16:27.801
<v Speaker 6>side of the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think even both sides are equally bad </v>

1552
01:16:27.801 --> 01:16:27.801
<v Speaker 6>because you're not getting at the truth</v>

1553
01:16:27.801 --> 01:16:32.660
<v Speaker 4>or also in this weird slippery thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to human beings and truth </v>

1554
01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.340
<v Speaker 4>because it's so hard to tell who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling the truth.</v>

1555
01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:40.440
<v Speaker 4>If two people see something or you see a</v>
<v Speaker 4>car accident and one person says,</v>

1556
01:16:40.441 --> 01:16:45.441
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this lady ran the red light and slammed </v>

1557
01:16:45.441 --> 01:16:47.211
<v Speaker 4>into the car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the person right next to it </v>

1558
01:16:47.211 --> 01:16:47.211
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1559
01:16:47.211 --> 01:16:47.970
<v Speaker 4>she didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This other guy ran the red light and she</v>

1560
01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:50.250
<v Speaker 4>hit him and this.</v>

1561
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:55.570
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of subjectivity in terms </v>
<v Speaker 6>of like interpersonal relationships.</v>

1562
01:16:55.810 --> 01:17:00.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also a problem with just </v>

1563
01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:00.810
<v Speaker 4>describing things and language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In reality.</v>

1564
01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:05.250
<v Speaker 4>It's hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you're telling the </v>

1565
01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:06.871
<v Speaker 4>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know mean especially if it's </v>

1566
01:17:06.871 --> 01:17:06.871
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1567
01:17:06.871 --> 01:17:06.910
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I leave,</v>

1568
01:17:06.911 --> 01:17:09.590
<v Speaker 4>I go to the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I come back and Jamie says she,</v>

1569
01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.530
<v Speaker 4>she just call me a piece of shit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1570
01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:13.440
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like,</v>

1571
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:14.480
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well who's right?</v>

1572
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1573
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I literally don't have a mechanism to </v>
<v Speaker 4>detect who said what it is not possible.</v>

1574
01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:26.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So am I just going to believe women or </v>

1575
01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:30.101
<v Speaker 4>am I going to believe the individual or </v>
<v Speaker 4>am I going to try to like figure this </v>

1576
01:17:30.101 --> 01:17:30.620
<v Speaker 4>out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Am I going to do my detective work?</v>

1577
01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.360
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very tricky.</v>

1578
01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.440
<v Speaker 4>So when you're dealing with some certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>accusations when it comes to human </v>

1579
01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:37.970
<v Speaker 4>beings like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris hardwick things,</v>

1580
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.290
<v Speaker 4>a perfect example of that.</v>

1581
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:43.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was just reinstated yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 4>by AMC and um,</v>

1582
01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.640
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a weird one because she wrote </v>

1583
01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:51.881
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was an ex girlfriend that wrote </v>

1584
01:17:51.881 --> 01:17:51.881
<v Speaker 4>something about him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:17:51.881 --> 01:17:54.611
<v Speaker 4>I read that most clearly didn't tell the</v>
<v Speaker 4>truth about some aspects of their </v>

1586
01:17:54.611 --> 01:17:56.930
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She cheated on him and that's why he got</v>

1587
01:17:56.931 --> 01:18:01.931
<v Speaker 4>rid of her or broke up with her and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>he or she also said he was just terrible</v>

1588
01:18:02.031 --> 01:18:07.031
<v Speaker 4>boyfriend and he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then there's videos of her talking </v>

1589
01:18:07.031 --> 01:18:08.570
<v Speaker 4>about what an amazing boyfriend he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>while they were together,</v>

1590
01:18:08.571 --> 01:18:13.571
<v Speaker 4>about how we stayed with her in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hospital and slept by her bed and it's </v>

1591
01:18:13.571 --> 01:18:13.571
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's also.</v>

1592
01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.640
<v Speaker 4>She had a bunch of host of mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>illnesses that she described in their </v>

1593
01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.111
<v Speaker 4>video about like not being able to drive</v>
<v Speaker 4>down the street with the windows open </v>

1594
01:18:23.111 --> 01:18:26.501
<v Speaker 4>because she was worried that germs are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get in her car and some of </v>

1595
01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:26.540
<v Speaker 4>those she recovered from and some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them she didn't like.</v>

1596
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.440
<v Speaker 4>It's an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's another problem with people when</v>

1597
01:18:30.441 --> 01:18:32.840
<v Speaker 4>it comes to when they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1598
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:36.060
<v Speaker 4>they might not even be lying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just might be.</v>

1599
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:38.660
<v Speaker 4>They just might have a distorted </v>
<v Speaker 4>perception of reality.</v>

1600
01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:43.960
<v Speaker 4>That is another problem with human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings when it comes to any sort of </v>

1601
01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:44.260
<v Speaker 4>interaction between two people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially after</v>

1602
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:49.330
<v Speaker 3>breakup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the way that a person can view </v>

1603
01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:51.491
<v Speaker 3>the time they spent with someone can </v>
<v Speaker 3>very much change based on their current </v>

1604
01:18:51.491 --> 01:18:51.550
<v Speaker 3>situation or how that breakup.</v>

1605
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:52.980
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1606
01:18:53.050 --> 01:18:58.050
<v Speaker 4>but on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real problem though is what we were </v>

1607
01:18:58.050 --> 01:19:01.330
<v Speaker 4>saying is that human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult.</v>

1608
01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.450
<v Speaker 4>I can't read minds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't read minds.</v>

1609
01:19:04.451 --> 01:19:09.451
<v Speaker 4>You can't look into memories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're relying on a person's </v>

1610
01:19:09.451 --> 01:19:11.650
<v Speaker 4>description and then we have to rely on </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we know about them,</v>

1611
01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:12.490
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

1612
01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.080
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1613
01:19:13.090 --> 01:19:18.090
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we know about their ability to </v>

1614
01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:20.101
<v Speaker 4>describe things accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we know about their perceptions of </v>

1615
01:19:20.101 --> 01:19:21.420
<v Speaker 4>reality are delusions there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1616
01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:22.120
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1617
01:19:22.121 --> 01:19:23.530
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clarity.</v>

1618
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:26.860
<v Speaker 4>So fucking super tricky.</v>

1619
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1620
01:19:28.001 --> 01:19:29.950
<v Speaker 3>my rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I would say to people is,</v>

1621
01:19:29.951 --> 01:19:34.951
<v Speaker 3>unless you know the two people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can ever really know </v>

1622
01:19:34.951 --> 01:19:37.651
<v Speaker 3>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that case of say you leave and </v>

1623
01:19:37.651 --> 01:19:37.651
<v Speaker 3>Jamie tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said something about you,</v>

1624
01:19:37.651 --> 01:19:38.200
<v Speaker 3>you're probably going to go with Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1625
01:19:38.201 --> 01:19:38.890
<v Speaker 3>Because you know him.</v>

1626
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:41.190
<v Speaker 4>Sam is a little crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might.</v>

1627
01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.960
<v Speaker 4>I might go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1628
01:19:43.961 --> 01:19:48.961
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's for sure if I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and Jamie told me you did something </v>

1629
01:19:49.421 --> 01:19:51.010
<v Speaker 4>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would side with Jane,</v>

1630
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:56.410
<v Speaker 4>but even that's weird if I'm not there </v>
<v Speaker 4>or if I don't know.</v>

1631
01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:58.630
<v Speaker 4>If you say I didn't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1632
01:19:58.631 --> 01:20:03.631
<v Speaker 4>well maybe one day you'll be my best </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend and maybe one day Jamie turned </v>

1633
01:20:03.631 --> 01:20:04.810
<v Speaker 4>out to be a fucking psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1634
01:20:04.811 --> 01:20:07.830
<v Speaker 4>remember when we used to think was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's crazy,</v>

1635
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1636
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:09.780
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes with.</v>

1637
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:14.810
<v Speaker 3>I do empathize with some women who say </v>
<v Speaker 3>if this happens to the men and people </v>

1638
01:20:14.881 --> 01:20:15.720
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's a nice guy.</v>

1639
01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:16.800
<v Speaker 3>I know that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my buddy.</v>

1640
01:20:16.801 --> 01:20:18.630
<v Speaker 3>I've known him forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you didn't date him,</v>

1641
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:19.680
<v Speaker 3>so how do you know?</v>

1642
01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.090
<v Speaker 4>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1643
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:22.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>

1644
01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:25.620
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking tricky.</v>

1645
01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:28.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you ever seen that episode of black,</v>

1646
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:29.400
<v Speaker 4>do you ever watch Black Mirror</v>

1647
01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:34.840
<v Speaker 3>one episode?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everyone tells me how amazing this </v>

1648
01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.851
<v Speaker 3>show is and I think it is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I saw one episode that really </v>

1649
01:20:36.851 --> 01:20:36.851
<v Speaker 3>freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1650
01:20:36.851 --> 01:20:38.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the one about.</v>

1651
01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:43.660
<v Speaker 3>It was actually about a boy who was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pedophile and then he was being watched </v>

1652
01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:45.290
<v Speaker 3>and blackmailed creeped me out.</v>

1653
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.690
<v Speaker 4>I didn't watch that one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's one called crocodile.</v>

1654
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:53.750
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is easily the most disturbing </v>

1655
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:56.140
<v Speaker 4>episode of a television show I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>watched in my life and it,</v>

1656
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.250
<v Speaker 4>it has to do with technology that allows</v>
<v Speaker 4>people to read memories.</v>

1657
01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'll leave it at that.</v>

1658
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:06.470
<v Speaker 4>So no spoiler alerts here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but until it is fucking dark stays with </v>

1659
01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:10.800
<v Speaker 4>you after this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does this one's dark.</v>

1660
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I can't,</v>

1661
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:17.870
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will give too much away if I talk </v>

1662
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:18.150
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the concept is that you can,</v>

1663
01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:22.020
<v Speaker 4>they have a machine and they set this </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine up and through this machine they</v>

1664
01:21:22.021 --> 01:21:27.021
<v Speaker 4>can literally read your memories until </v>
<v Speaker 4>that happens.</v>

1665
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.480
<v Speaker 4>We really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1666
01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:35.130
<v Speaker 4>there's been things in my life where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked back on it and I had a perception</v>

1667
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.680
<v Speaker 4>and then I went to the place where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>grew up and I was like,</v>

1668
01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember it looking like this.</v>

1669
01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:41.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember this being so close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1670
01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.560
<v Speaker 4>the streets right here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is where the house is.</v>

1671
01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:48.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you have to kind of like remap </v>

1672
01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:48.920
<v Speaker 4>your memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

1673
01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:52.221
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got to clean these memories up and </v>

1674
01:21:52.221 --> 01:21:52.221
<v Speaker 4>try to figure out what's accurate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's not.</v>

1675
01:21:52.221 --> 01:21:52.221
<v Speaker 4>But then this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1676
01:21:52.290 --> 01:21:55.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm just talking about like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the neighborhood where I grew up in,</v>

1677
01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.170
<v Speaker 4>but what about your adding in emotions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you add again,</v>

1678
01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:03.230
<v Speaker 4>painful emotions because breakups and </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps suicidal thoughts and time going</v>

1679
01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:06.900
<v Speaker 4>by also time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1680
01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:12.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's been absolutely proven that </v>
<v Speaker 4>eye witness testimony is the least </v>

1681
01:22:12.930 --> 01:22:17.930
<v Speaker 4>accurate piece of evidence that any </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigator can ever use in terms of </v>

1682
01:22:18.031 --> 01:22:23.031
<v Speaker 4>like trying to figure out what happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the scene of a crime or anything </v>

1683
01:22:23.031 --> 01:22:26.700
<v Speaker 4>involving any sort of trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking hard with people's minds.</v>

1684
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:29.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean when we look at say the issue</v>

1685
01:22:29.201 --> 01:22:31.450
<v Speaker 3>with me too in the sexual assault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual harassment,</v>

1686
01:22:31.451 --> 01:22:36.451
<v Speaker 3>that I think also some people see this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they think I want to help this </v>

1687
01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:38.230
<v Speaker 3>person so they might reinterpret their </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation a way to say,</v>

1688
01:22:38.231 --> 01:22:40.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also want to help this person.</v>

1689
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

1690
01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:47.120
<v Speaker 4>there's clearly without doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>been a lot of unchecked sexual </v>

1691
01:22:49.351 --> 01:22:51.820
<v Speaker 4>harassment in the workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just I,</v>

1692
01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:56.900
<v Speaker 4>I've always said this and this is not to</v>
<v Speaker 4>say that men and women shouldn't work </v>

1693
01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:56.900
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm not saying that any stretch,</v>

1694
01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:58.500
<v Speaker 4>I just want to get that of way really </v>
<v Speaker 4>quick,</v>

1695
01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:03.860
<v Speaker 4>but when men and women do work together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're around each other all day and </v>

1696
01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:05.830
<v Speaker 4>people are sexually attracted to each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other and</v>

1697
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:11.130
<v Speaker 2>men are gross and it's just like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that I was having this conversation </v>

1698
01:23:11.201 --> 01:23:12.520
<v Speaker 2>with today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about that.</v>

1699
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you imagine being a girl and </v>

1700
01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:19.291
<v Speaker 2>working in an office and God's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you all the time and there was </v>

1701
01:23:19.291 --> 01:23:22.231
<v Speaker 2>saying stupid shit to you when you try </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get coffee and like we were talking </v>

1702
01:23:22.231 --> 01:23:23.910
<v Speaker 2>about gay guys and he was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever.</v>

1703
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:29.550
<v Speaker 2>When he was in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you have a problem with gay </v>

1704
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.550
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was really funny.</v>

1705
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:30.160
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1706
01:23:30.161 --> 01:23:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I would want to see if I was working </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a gay guy,</v>

1707
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I'd want them to like me because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way he tried to impress me and he'd do </v>

1708
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:38.830
<v Speaker 2>his job better and he'd be real nice to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and we were laughing about it,</v>

1709
01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:39.730
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1710
01:23:39.731 --> 01:23:43.390
<v Speaker 2>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you run a gay guy that was always</v>

1711
01:23:43.391 --> 01:23:48.391
<v Speaker 2>trying to fuck you and like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>touched your ass when you bent over to </v>

1712
01:23:48.391 --> 01:23:48.391
<v Speaker 2>pick up some paper or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1713
01:23:48.391 --> 01:23:53.341
<v Speaker 2>like that would get real annoying and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>your job relied on this guy liking you </v>

1714
01:23:54.911 --> 01:23:57.670
<v Speaker 2>and approving you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of women's jobs rely on,</v>

1715
01:23:57.671 --> 01:24:01.420
<v Speaker 2>creeps liking them and approving it gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking disgusting.</v>

1716
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:04.930
<v Speaker 2>That's the reality that many women have </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived with for decades.</v>

1717
01:24:05.190 --> 01:24:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1718
01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:07.930
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to shift.</v>

1719
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that the.</v>

1720
01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Even with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1721
01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:16.360
<v Speaker 2>the far reaching aspects of it were all </v>
<v Speaker 2>men are trash.</v>

1722
01:24:17.050 --> 01:24:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping it's the Ty's gonna just sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of settle back in and it's going to,</v>

1723
01:24:20.771 --> 01:24:25.771
<v Speaker 2>instead of being over this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to come back over this way </v>

1724
01:24:25.771 --> 01:24:29.191
<v Speaker 2>and just balance out in the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and we'll get a better </v>

1725
01:24:29.191 --> 01:24:29.191
<v Speaker 2>understanding of each other.</v>

1726
01:24:29.191 --> 01:24:29.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's my hope too,</v>

1727
01:24:29.611 --> 01:24:34.611
<v Speaker 6>and I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hope that there's not so much damage </v>

1728
01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:34.611
<v Speaker 6>done that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1729
01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:36.990
<v Speaker 6>fixable at that point because of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1730
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:42.010
<v Speaker 6>that you will see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel men nowadays are terrified </v>

1731
01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.430
<v Speaker 6>interact with women,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially in the workplace.</v>

1732
01:24:44.650 --> 01:24:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I think you should be careful anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all way too casual about </v>

1733
01:24:49.650 --> 01:24:53.401
<v Speaker 2>getting intimate with people and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been guilty of it myself and my life at </v>

1734
01:24:53.401 --> 01:24:57.421
<v Speaker 2>many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you should get to know </v>

1735
01:24:57.421 --> 01:24:57.421
<v Speaker 2>people a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The promise people are horny and they're</v>

1736
01:24:57.421 --> 01:24:57.421
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1737
01:24:57.421 --> 01:24:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get you.</v>

1738
01:24:58.301 --> 01:24:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh you gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1739
01:24:59.201 --> 01:25:00.280
<v Speaker 2>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1740
01:25:00.281 --> 01:25:01.690
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real problem.</v>

1741
01:25:01.691 --> 01:25:06.691
<v Speaker 2>And then you hook up with crazy people </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you have to keep working with them </v>

1742
01:25:06.691 --> 01:25:06.691
<v Speaker 2>after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:25:06.691 --> 01:25:10.741
<v Speaker 2>That's even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that have inter office </v>

1744
01:25:10.741 --> 01:25:10.741
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1745
01:25:10.741 --> 01:25:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I know people who work in offices where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky,</v>

1746
01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:14.290
<v Speaker 2>forbidden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're not allowed,</v>

1747
01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:16.210
<v Speaker 2>and then and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1748
01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:21.211
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if you fall in love with </v>

1749
01:25:21.211 --> 01:25:23.371
<v Speaker 2>someone in the office or if they're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect person for you got to quit your </v>

1750
01:25:23.371 --> 01:25:23.371
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1751
01:25:23.371 --> 01:25:27.590
<v Speaker 6>I don't like businesses imposing that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think people should be able to make </v>

1752
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:31.761
<v Speaker 6>those decisions be tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Decision never date anybody at work and </v>

1753
01:25:31.761 --> 01:25:33.330
<v Speaker 6>I say that well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't know.</v>

1754
01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:34.140
<v Speaker 6>Married?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1755
01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:34.770
<v Speaker 6>not married.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1756
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:37.420
<v Speaker 2>You have a boyfriend and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1757
01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:43.150
<v Speaker 2>What if you met a guy that you worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>with and he was fucking amazing and he </v>

1758
01:25:44.661 --> 01:25:49.661
<v Speaker 2>was single and you're single and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys just got along great and he was </v>

1759
01:25:49.701 --> 01:25:54.701
<v Speaker 2>respectful and he's intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's funny and he's interesting and you </v>

1760
01:25:54.701 --> 01:25:55.070
<v Speaker 2>liked doing things with them.</v>

1761
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:57.520
<v Speaker 6>There are lots of men in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who the fuck out of here?</v>

1762
01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.530
<v Speaker 6>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not true.</v>

1763
01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:04.720
<v Speaker 6>There are so many men in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why is it this one person work with is </v>

1764
01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:05.420
<v Speaker 6>the only one who's going to be a match </v>
<v Speaker 6>for me.</v>

1765
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:07.070
<v Speaker 6>He's the only one you've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like that.</v>

1766
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:08.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1767
01:26:08.421 --> 01:26:10.160
<v Speaker 6>but the thing is I'm very career </v>
<v Speaker 6>oriented,</v>

1768
01:26:10.161 --> 01:26:14.180
<v Speaker 6>so that could be part of why in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's Joel.</v>

1769
01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:19.260
<v Speaker 6>That's a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's racist to say that Asians are </v>

1770
01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:19.810
<v Speaker 6>determined,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in,</v>

1771
01:26:19.811 --> 01:26:24.811
<v Speaker 6>in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess I'm a little bit more risk </v>

1772
01:26:24.811 --> 01:26:26.921
<v Speaker 6>averse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not gonna jeopardize potentially </v>

1773
01:26:26.921 --> 01:26:27.110
<v Speaker 6>jeopardize my career over a person that </v>
<v Speaker 6>I meet that I like.</v>

1774
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:29.630
<v Speaker 2>What if he was wanting to quit his job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

1775
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:33.540
<v Speaker 6>then he just did what we could talk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we,</v>

1776
01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:38.560
<v Speaker 6>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna you're gonna quit your job </v>

1777
01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:38.560
<v Speaker 6>for a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1778
01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.450
<v Speaker 6>You fucking loser.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you gonna do if we have kids?</v>

1779
01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:40.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1780
01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1781
01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.530
<v Speaker 2>I see both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I see,</v>

1782
01:26:44.531 --> 01:26:49.531
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now imagine being a woman who works in </v>

1783
01:26:49.531 --> 01:26:50.410
<v Speaker 2>the office with this guy who's in love </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this woman.</v>

1784
01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:55.650
<v Speaker 2>And then they have a relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then all of a sudden her career starts </v>

1785
01:26:55.650 --> 01:26:55.650
<v Speaker 2>doing a little bit better.</v>

1786
01:26:55.650 --> 01:26:56.890
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know other women will.</v>

1787
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.440
<v Speaker 6>Women like me say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well wait,</v>

1788
01:26:58.441 --> 01:27:00.480
<v Speaker 6>we're not sleeping with people to get to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the top.</v>

1789
01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:01.500
<v Speaker 6>Is that fair?</v>

1790
01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the world of the actress.</v>

1791
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:08.140
<v Speaker 2>It is and that is the world of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>casting couch and this is the seat.</v>

1792
01:27:08.410 --> 01:27:13.410
<v Speaker 2>This is the not so secret aspect of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>casting couch that many,</v>

1793
01:27:16.301 --> 01:27:21.301
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people are aware of is that these </v>

1794
01:27:21.301 --> 01:27:23.821
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck some of these men and we're not </v>

1795
01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:26.071
<v Speaker 2>talking about rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about women who chose to </v>

1796
01:27:26.071 --> 01:27:28.170
<v Speaker 2>engage in willing full sex with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were fractional.</v>

1797
01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transactional stuff.</v>

1798
01:27:29.531 --> 01:27:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great way to put it.</v>

1799
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of women who I know who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are actresses who were approached for by</v>

1800
01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.160
<v Speaker 2>some certain types of men who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>producers or executives in certain ways </v>

1801
01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:45.510
<v Speaker 2>and they've said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then girls that they know said yes </v>

1802
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:46.430
<v Speaker 2>and their careers advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1803
01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:49.180
<v Speaker 2>and this was a thing where people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of it.</v>

1804
01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.900
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a power dynamic that exists when</v>

1805
01:27:52.901 --> 01:27:57.901
<v Speaker 2>there's a boss and then there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>underling is a person who's working for </v>

1806
01:27:58.211 --> 01:28:03.211
<v Speaker 2>that boss and whether it's a a producer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and an actress or whether it's a CEO and</v>

1807
01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:10.040
<v Speaker 2>an employee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they engage in some sort of a </v>

1808
01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:13.120
<v Speaker 2>transactional sexual relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes everyone fucking uncomfortable.</v>

1809
01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1810
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:18.750
<v Speaker 6>but how do you stop that you think?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it's the industry's job or </v>

1811
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:19.390
<v Speaker 6>where do you weed that out?</v>

1812
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I think corporations pretty much across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the board now,</v>

1813
01:28:22.171 --> 01:28:27.171
<v Speaker 2>just fire people when they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a recent CEO of some large </v>

1814
01:28:28.651 --> 01:28:33.651
<v Speaker 2>high profile company who had a step down</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was involved in a consensual </v>

1815
01:28:33.651 --> 01:28:35.610
<v Speaker 2>sexual relationship with somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember who that was?</v>

1816
01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:39.810
<v Speaker 2>It was real big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something super recent,</v>

1817
01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.790
<v Speaker 2>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no crime,</v>

1818
01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:45.180
<v Speaker 2>but it was consensual sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with someone who worked for</v>

1819
01:28:45.181 --> 01:28:47.380
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it Intel?</v>

1820
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Intel's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1821
01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:52.020
<v Speaker 2>that people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're around each other all day long.</v>

1822
01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

1823
01:28:52.831 --> 01:28:55.980
<v Speaker 2>If you go home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say if you work eight hours a day and it</v>

1824
01:28:55.981 --> 01:28:57.810
<v Speaker 2>takes you an hour to drive to work an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour,</v>

1825
01:28:57.811 --> 01:29:01.320
<v Speaker 2>drive home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking 10 hours and nobody eight</v>

1826
01:29:01.321 --> 01:29:02.940
<v Speaker 2>hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to make it right,</v>

1827
01:29:02.941 --> 01:29:06.270
<v Speaker 2>you were nine and 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like half the day's gone.</v>

1828
01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:08.340
<v Speaker 2>You get home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're exhausted,</v>

1829
01:29:08.670 --> 01:29:11.300
<v Speaker 2>you know your husband's exhausts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're staring each other,</v>

1830
01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.260
<v Speaker 2>you're together like three or four </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

1831
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:15.810
<v Speaker 2>You have a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to sleep,</v>

1832
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:18.060
<v Speaker 2>you get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd go do it again.</v>

1833
01:29:18.061 --> 01:29:23.061
<v Speaker 2>You're with those people at work more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you're even with the people that </v>

1834
01:29:23.061 --> 01:29:24.000
<v Speaker 2>you live with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that's really,</v>

1835
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:27.510
<v Speaker 2>and that's your waking hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time you get home,</v>

1836
01:29:27.511 --> 01:29:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you fucking tired and if you go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gym afterwards,</v>

1837
01:29:30.121 --> 01:29:31.950
<v Speaker 2>we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an hour and a half gone there.</v>

1838
01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:34.260
<v Speaker 2>You might see each other for an hour a </v>
<v Speaker 2>night now,</v>

1839
01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:39.500
<v Speaker 2>and especially if people are single,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously it's a little bit </v>

1840
01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:39.500
<v Speaker 2>easier for that to happen as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:43.290
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a big part of your social </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction mean how many people there.</v>

1842
01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Their social circle is primarily the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that they work with.</v>

1843
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Real common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1844
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:52.230
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1845
01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I think if it's a consensual </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

1846
01:29:54.091 --> 01:29:59.091
<v Speaker 2>there shouldn't be anything wrong there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can see how in this climate there </v>

1847
01:29:59.091 --> 01:30:01.380
<v Speaker 2>are all these other ways of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it being imposed on it.</v>

1848
01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:04.410
<v Speaker 2>So is that really consensual?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's someone who is your boss,</v>

1849
01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.650
<v Speaker 2>but then imagine say if you and Jamie </v>
<v Speaker 2>work together.</v>

1850
01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you guys had a consensual sexual </v>

1851
01:30:12.710 --> 01:30:12.720
<v Speaker 2>relationship and you both were on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same level.</v>

1852
01:30:12.721 --> 01:30:15.430
<v Speaker 2>You both in does not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like anybody has any power,</v>

1853
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.880
<v Speaker 2>but then you break up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1854
01:30:17.881 --> 01:30:22.881
<v Speaker 2>and then Jamie comes over to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a fucking asshole connection </v>

1855
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:28.310
<v Speaker 2>and then you come to me and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Jamie though he looks like a good </v>

1856
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.310
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you start dating him,</v>

1857
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:32.070
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking selfish prick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then leave that at home.</v>

1858
01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's definitely becomes a problem </v>

1859
01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:37.340
<v Speaker 2>in the workforce when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1860
01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:39.390
<v Speaker 2>you're not just friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friends is fine,</v>

1861
01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:41.640
<v Speaker 2>but when you start having sex with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

1862
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.770
<v Speaker 2>that's when things get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1863
01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:48.771
<v Speaker 2>Very few people are able to separate sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>and emotions with friendship.</v>

1864
01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few people.</v>

1865
01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:56.820
<v Speaker 2>That's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that's </v>

1866
01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:59.481
<v Speaker 2>admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these people that are willing to </v>

1867
01:30:59.481 --> 01:30:59.481
<v Speaker 2>have these open relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1868
01:30:59.481 --> 01:31:00.240
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can.</v>

1869
01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I know guys like hang out with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys who fuck their girlfriend.</v>

1870
01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:07.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

1871
01:31:07.290 --> 01:31:08.910
<v Speaker 2>you're a better man than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1872
01:31:08.911 --> 01:31:11.460
<v Speaker 2>some of them like that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if they're masochistic,</v>

1873
01:31:11.461 --> 01:31:15.840
<v Speaker 2>they liked the idea of they're a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>being having sex with another guy.</v>

1874
01:31:16.050 --> 01:31:17.490
<v Speaker 2>What you didn't want to use the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cook.</v>

1875
01:31:18.710 --> 01:31:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I like how you went with masochistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's a technical term.</v>

1876
01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can call them cooks.</v>

1877
01:31:24.690 --> 01:31:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Cook is compromised word though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1878
01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:31.140
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole other stuff that comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1879
01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets squirrely.</v>

1880
01:31:32.491 --> 01:31:37.491
<v Speaker 2>I thought it always meant that it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It always meant cuckold like you want to</v>

1881
01:31:37.951 --> 01:31:42.390
<v Speaker 2>watch men have sex with your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it got to where.</v>

1882
01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:44.040
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is what?</v>

1883
01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:46.990
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the Beta male?</v>

1884
01:31:46.991 --> 01:31:51.991
<v Speaker 2>The Beta male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's so many different versions </v>

1885
01:31:51.991 --> 01:31:54.111
<v Speaker 2>of it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become really freely tossed around </v>

1886
01:31:54.111 --> 01:31:56.190
<v Speaker 2>like a beach ball at a concert is </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing cukor around these days.</v>

1887
01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.530
<v Speaker 2>That's fine if that's what you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No judgment there.</v>

1888
01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's into being cuckolded yeah.</v>

1889
01:32:02.861 --> 01:32:05.200
<v Speaker 2>If that's what you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with that.</v>

1890
01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cook a man who is desperate for </v>

1891
01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:14.670
<v Speaker 2>acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>approval,</v>

1892
01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:14.670
<v Speaker 2>and affection from women.</v>

1893
01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's different.</v>

1894
01:32:17.690 --> 01:32:22.690
<v Speaker 2>This desperation has lead to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromise of his beliefs and values to </v>

1895
01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:26.420
<v Speaker 2>desecration of his dignity and self </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth and this inability to stand up for</v>

1896
01:32:26.421 --> 01:32:28.250
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This four Chan,</v>

1897
01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:33.251
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This and what he deserves as a human </v>

1898
01:32:33.251 --> 01:32:33.500
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Example,</v>

1899
01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.970
<v Speaker 2>loyalty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fidelity,</v>

1900
01:32:34.971 --> 01:32:37.820
<v Speaker 2>and honesty in a romantic relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1901
01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

1902
01:32:40.011 --> 01:32:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Look at the example they gave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>

1903
01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I know John's always wanted a </v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend,</v>

1904
01:32:44.061 --> 01:32:47.210
<v Speaker 2>but since him and Mary started dating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's become a cook.</v>

1905
01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:52.900
<v Speaker 2>She spends all of his money and flirts </v>
<v Speaker 2>openly without openly with other men.</v>

1906
01:32:53.090 --> 01:32:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I can tell it bothers him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's so afraid of losing her that he</v>

1907
01:32:57.141 --> 01:32:59.210
<v Speaker 2>doesn't say anything.</v>

1908
01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:00.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a cook.</v>

1909
01:33:02.130 --> 01:33:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a male feminist also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you went there.</v>

1910
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:08.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1911
01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:10.550
<v Speaker 2>That male feminist thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1912
01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I've known a few that were real creeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were fake creeps,</v>

1913
01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like on the side,</v>

1914
01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:18.780
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1915
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:20.870
<v Speaker 2>what they were doing was there</v>

1916
01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:22.880
<v Speaker 1>there</v>

1917
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:28.570
<v Speaker 2>posturing as an alternative to these men</v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't want monogamous relationships </v>

1918
01:33:30.651 --> 01:33:35.651
<v Speaker 2>or would break the woman's heart or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to compromise and bend to the </v>

1919
01:33:35.651 --> 01:33:39.521
<v Speaker 2>will of the woman and that they put </v>
<v Speaker 2>these women on a platform and worship </v>

1920
01:33:39.521 --> 01:33:43.631
<v Speaker 2>these women and I am the alternative and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the powerful alternative and these </v>

1921
01:33:43.631 --> 01:33:47.891
<v Speaker 2>men are assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they try to shit on those men </v>

1922
01:33:47.891 --> 01:33:48.590
<v Speaker 2>and take the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all it does is make those men appear</v>

1923
01:33:48.591 --> 01:33:51.260
<v Speaker 2>even more attractive to these women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secretly.</v>

1924
01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:55.130
<v Speaker 2>These men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these feminists men and these women have</v>

1925
01:33:56.060 --> 01:34:00.890
<v Speaker 2>these weird relationships where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work and they're never sexual or</v>

1926
01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:06.260
<v Speaker 2>sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The women aren't really sexually </v>

1927
01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:06.260
<v Speaker 2>attracted to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they withhold sex and it just.</v>

1928
01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:08.120
<v Speaker 2>It gets super weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

1929
01:34:08.121 --> 01:34:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I just generalized a lot about a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of people's relationships,</v>

1930
01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:14.470
<v Speaker 2>but what I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just</v>

1931
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.740
<v Speaker 1>it's they,</v>

1932
01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.540
<v Speaker 2>they don't run fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't pick things up.</v>

1933
01:34:19.541 --> 01:34:21.240
<v Speaker 2>They're not attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they tried it.</v>

1934
01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.110
<v Speaker 2>They're a little weasels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to find another way in.</v>

1935
01:34:23.690 --> 01:34:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1936
01:34:24.461 --> 01:34:29.461
<v Speaker 3>I think men who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all men who call themselves </v>

1937
01:34:29.461 --> 01:34:32.851
<v Speaker 3>feminists are male feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in that I think men who ascribed to </v>

1938
01:34:33.521 --> 01:34:36.730
<v Speaker 3>women being equal at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing and I think a lot of</v>

1939
01:34:36.731 --> 01:34:37.390
<v Speaker 3>guys will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1940
01:34:37.391 --> 01:34:39.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm feminists because they think that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right thing to do.</v>

1941
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the socially acceptable thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way we should be.</v>

1942
01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:45.580
<v Speaker 3>But then the ones who run around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1943
01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1944
01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:52.081
<v Speaker 3>really push it and make that their </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity and really sell themselves as </v>

1945
01:34:52.081 --> 01:34:53.500
<v Speaker 3>male feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were the guys I have an issue with</v>

1946
01:34:53.501 --> 01:34:58.501
<v Speaker 3>because like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're sneaky and they know what </v>

1947
01:34:58.501 --> 01:34:58.501
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not being honest.</v>

1948
01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can almost always tell you,</v>

1949
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.680
<v Speaker 2>you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1950
01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.890
<v Speaker 2>there they're a type,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1951
01:35:06.891 --> 01:35:08.810
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're an unattractive type.</v>

1952
01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:12.860
<v Speaker 2>They're not attractive to women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to try to figure out a way like,</v>

1953
01:35:12.861 --> 01:35:15.550
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it going to be the way you've got</v>

1954
01:35:15.551 --> 01:35:18.990
<v Speaker 2>to figure out a way to stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the way I'm going to just what?</v>

1955
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:20.600
<v Speaker 2>What are these women want to hear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to hear that.</v>

1956
01:35:20.630 --> 01:35:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say that egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1957
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:28.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who believes in equality is </v>

1958
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:30.701
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you establish your </v>

1959
01:35:30.701 --> 01:35:33.760
<v Speaker 2>proclaiming yourself to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in the opposite gender and </v>

1960
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:40.600
<v Speaker 2>more supportive of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then males and even though you are a </v>

1961
01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.290
<v Speaker 2>male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hm.</v>

1962
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:44.060
<v Speaker 2>That should be a red flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a giant red flag.</v>

1963
01:35:44.150 --> 01:35:46.970
<v Speaker 2>You should be into humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like people.</v>

1964
01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.520
<v Speaker 2>I like people I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay.</v>

1965
01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.470
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like people.</v>

1966
01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.750
<v Speaker 2>I like when they're Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice to me.</v>

1967
01:35:53.751 --> 01:35:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm nice to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like.</v>

1968
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to get discriminated </v>
<v Speaker 2>against in any way,</v>

1969
01:35:57.501 --> 01:36:02.501
<v Speaker 2>shape or form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to pretend that one </v>

1970
01:36:02.501 --> 01:36:03.260
<v Speaker 2>group is better than other groups except</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians when it comes to Harvard.</v>

1971
01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:05.720
<v Speaker 2>The crazy thing is with these guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1972
01:36:05.721 --> 01:36:10.721
<v Speaker 2>you see there's been a trend where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually have a lot to hide and they </v>

1973
01:36:10.721 --> 01:36:12.110
<v Speaker 2>usually are misogynistic and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually do abuse.</v>

1974
01:36:12.111 --> 01:36:17.111
<v Speaker 2>Women was the scary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what happens is there's a </v>

1975
01:36:17.111 --> 01:36:21.251
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of resentment that from </v>
<v Speaker 2>living this fake life and having these </v>

1976
01:36:22.971 --> 01:36:26.120
<v Speaker 2>fake beliefs and doing so just to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the approval of women,</v>

1977
01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when it doesn't work out,</v>

1978
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:29.900
<v Speaker 2>there's anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment,</v>

1979
01:36:29.901 --> 01:36:31.250
<v Speaker 2>and this is just.</v>

1980
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:37.390
<v Speaker 2>I think some guys put it on because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way of overcompensating for their own </v>

1981
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.550
<v Speaker 2>guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1982
01:36:37.551 --> 01:36:38.720
<v Speaker 2>that's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

1983
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a lot of different </v>

1984
01:36:43.810 --> 01:36:43.810
<v Speaker 2>reasons why men become feminists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>very few of them are good unless they're</v>

1985
01:36:43.810 --> 01:36:46.880
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their idea of what it means is different</v>

1986
01:36:46.881 --> 01:36:48.530
<v Speaker 2>than my idea what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My idea.</v>

1987
01:36:48.531 --> 01:36:50.480
<v Speaker 2>It means a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little sneaky fuck.</v>

1988
01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:52.490
<v Speaker 2>That's my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when I.</v>

1989
01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Because I've just seen so many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1990
01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:00.880
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure some bank robbers are really </v>

1991
01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.821
<v Speaker 2>romantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting poets who just decide this </v>

1992
01:37:03.821 --> 01:37:04.070
<v Speaker 2>is a great way to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be one,</v>

1993
01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:07.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of them are fucking criminals.</v>

1994
01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is like how I feel about male </v>

1995
01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.861
<v Speaker 2>feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm sure there's a bunch of them </v>

1996
01:37:14.861 --> 01:37:17.501
<v Speaker 2>out there that are really good guys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe through the influence of the </v>

1997
01:37:17.501 --> 01:37:22.121
<v Speaker 2>people that have been around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've chosen to identify as a male </v>

1998
01:37:22.121 --> 01:37:25.340
<v Speaker 2>feminist and this seems to be a good way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to show that they support women and even</v>

1999
01:37:25.341 --> 01:37:30.341
<v Speaker 2>if they have to support women over men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at women have been fucked over for </v>

2000
01:37:30.341 --> 01:37:30.530
<v Speaker 2>so long.</v>

2001
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm more than willing to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do it with good intentions.</v>

2002
01:37:33.230 --> 01:37:38.230
<v Speaker 2>That's entirely possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it are creepy little dudes </v>

2003
01:37:38.230 --> 01:37:40.520
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to get laid and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not attractive to women,</v>

2004
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:45.550
<v Speaker 2>so they try to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become attractive to women and they </v>

2005
01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:45.560
<v Speaker 2>don't have the confidence to just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2006
01:37:45.561 --> 01:37:48.290
<v Speaker 2>aren't we all equal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aren't we all just all humans are.</v>

2007
01:37:48.291 --> 01:37:53.291
<v Speaker 2>We're all different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're working on yourself to make </v>

2008
01:37:53.291 --> 01:37:53.291
<v Speaker 2>yourself more attractive to it instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of deceiving them.</v>

2009
01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:56.430
<v Speaker 2>One of my all time favorite tweets that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I read was the guy saying,</v>

2010
01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to describe myself as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist until women tell me that I'm </v>

2011
01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:04.791
<v Speaker 2>doing feminism correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like more feminist than regular </v>

2012
01:38:05.230 --> 01:38:06.420
<v Speaker 2>feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2013
01:38:06.421 --> 01:38:10.560
<v Speaker 2>so feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be a feminist to women.</v>

2014
01:38:10.561 --> 01:38:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Tell me I'm a feminist mistress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr [inaudible],</v>

2015
01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:15.120
<v Speaker 2>please tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

2016
01:38:15.330 --> 01:38:17.370
<v Speaker 2>That dude has got a ball gag on right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2017
01:38:17.371 --> 01:38:18.810
<v Speaker 2>He's like tightening a down.</v>

2018
01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:26.810
<v Speaker 2>He's putting himself in the shack also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's women like that too.</v>

2019
01:38:28.710 --> 01:38:33.710
<v Speaker 2>There's women that pretend to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys like that girl is always the </v>

2020
01:38:33.710 --> 01:38:37.971
<v Speaker 2>one of the guy's girl it though other </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys can tell when a male,</v>

2021
01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:43.820
<v Speaker 2>when a guy's not sincere about being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>male feminist and the same with girls </v>

2022

01:40:01.051 --> 01:40:02.380
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:05.190
<v Speaker 2>It was ugly to the way it went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like woo.</v>

2051
01:40:06.090 --> 01:40:08.620
<v Speaker 2>But that's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>

2052
01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.010
<v Speaker 2>People are always trying to find their </v>
<v Speaker 2>way in like,</v>

2053
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:17.030
<v Speaker 2>what's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's my way to get the most </v>

2054
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.100
<v Speaker 2>acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my way to get the most happiness my way.</v>

2055
01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:20.100
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fairly unrelated,</v>

2056
01:40:20.101 --> 01:40:22.430
<v Speaker 2>but not necessarily to what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

2057
01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:27.440
<v Speaker 2>about gender dysphoria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about some people choosing that as a </v>

2058
01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.580
<v Speaker 2>path to get a lot of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2059
01:40:29.581 --> 01:40:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I think there's many things that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>do to get a lot of attention.</v>

2060
01:40:32.671 --> 01:40:35.340
<v Speaker 2>There's things that people do to stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>out as typically unique,</v>

2061
01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:40.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like dye their hair pink or purple or </v>

2062
01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:43.251
<v Speaker 2>blue or wear certain things or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain piercings and just things that </v>

2063
01:40:43.291 --> 01:40:48.291
<v Speaker 2>people do to like get attention and fit </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and find their niche and just do </v>

2064
01:40:49.351 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 2>something where it makes them feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some clout in this community</v>

2065
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:54.880
<v Speaker 4>of humans.</v>

2066
01:40:55.010 --> 01:41:00.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It helps them find other people too who </v>

2067
01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:00.010
<v Speaker 6>are like them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2068
01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:00.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2069
01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:00.010
<v Speaker 4>And also like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2070
01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:02.570
<v Speaker 4>they're signaling to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all equal.</v>

2071
01:41:02.571 --> 01:41:04.250
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or we're all similar.</v>

2072
01:41:04.251 --> 01:41:06.320
<v Speaker 4>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all in this kind of clan.</v>

2073
01:41:06.321 --> 01:41:07.340
<v Speaker 4>We're outsiders,</v>

2074
01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.810
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's fascinating.</v>

2075
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:14.990
<v Speaker 6>And I'm all for that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm all for people finding each other </v>

2076
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:17.631
<v Speaker 6>and self expression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's only when it is having negative </v>

2077
01:41:17.631 --> 01:41:18.360
<v Speaker 6>implications for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when it's a problem.</v>

2078
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:19.230
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>

2079
01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:20.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2080
01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:20.820
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

2081
01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:22.670
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>

2082
01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:25.790
<v Speaker 4>when it's not just a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>finding each other,</v>

2083
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:31.030
<v Speaker 4>but a bunch of people looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people and attacking them for not </v>

2084
01:41:31.341 --> 01:41:36.341
<v Speaker 4>being similar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's one of the things people do </v>

2085
01:41:36.341 --> 01:41:36.830
<v Speaker 4>to sort of affirm their identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2086
01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:39.360
<v Speaker 4>You attack the people that oppose that </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity or</v>

2087
01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:42.170
<v Speaker 6>people that are different to people need</v>
<v Speaker 6>to do that though.</v>

2088
01:41:42.171 --> 01:41:44.590
<v Speaker 6>I wish they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they do so often</v>

2089
01:41:45.170 --> 01:41:50.170
<v Speaker 4>wonder like objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were from another planet and you </v>

2090
01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:50.710
<v Speaker 4>were watching these patterns take place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here you go,</v>

2091
01:41:50.711 --> 01:41:55.711
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This creepy little organism like this </v>

2092
01:41:55.711 --> 01:41:55.711
<v Speaker 4>weird thing that it does.</v>

2093
01:41:55.711 --> 01:41:56.790
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Going back to the transgender,</v>

2094
01:41:56.791 --> 01:41:57.990
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bullying.</v>

2095
01:41:57.991 --> 01:42:00.360
<v Speaker 6>I guess my issue with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2096
01:42:00.630 --> 01:42:03.990
<v Speaker 6>with all of that intimidation is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact that these kids are not getting the</v>

2097
01:42:03.991 --> 01:42:08.991
<v Speaker 6>help that they need.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so if we look at something like I </v>

2098
01:42:08.991 --> 01:42:10.380
<v Speaker 6>was saying earlier about if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little boy who says he's a girl,</v>

2099
01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.020
<v Speaker 6>he's likely going to grow up to be a gay</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2100
01:42:13.290 --> 01:42:18.290
<v Speaker 6>You can't say that now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so all of the scientific research </v>

2101
01:42:18.290 --> 01:42:19.590
<v Speaker 6>suggests that all the studies ever done </v>
<v Speaker 6>suggest that.</v>

2102
01:42:19.890 --> 01:42:24.890
<v Speaker 6>But you can't say that because it really</v>
<v Speaker 6>upsets transgender activists and so you </v>

2103
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:26.640
<v Speaker 6>have all these children now are </v>
<v Speaker 6>transitioning who I think in five,</v>

2104
01:42:26.641 --> 01:42:30.760
<v Speaker 6>10 years are going to regret it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isn't this sort of similar to what we're</v>

2105
01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:34.260
<v Speaker 6>talking about earlier is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>historically</v>

2106
01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:40.320
<v Speaker 4>trans people have been so discriminated </v>
<v Speaker 4>against that it shifted so hard the </v>

2107
01:42:42.541 --> 01:42:47.541
<v Speaker 4>other way that it's gone the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just when we were talking about in </v>

2108
01:42:47.541 --> 01:42:50.841
<v Speaker 4>terms of sexism and harassment in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>workplace and sexual harassment and </v>

2109
01:42:50.841 --> 01:42:55.331
<v Speaker 4>rape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so was so one sided that now it's </v>

2110
01:42:55.331 --> 01:42:59.601
<v Speaker 4>pushing the opposite way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I read a tweet once by this woman </v>

2111
01:42:59.601 --> 01:43:00.000
<v Speaker 4>had said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's an unpopular opinion,</v>

2112
01:43:00.001 --> 01:43:02.430
<v Speaker 4>and she was an editor of a magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2113
01:43:02.431 --> 01:43:06.300
<v Speaker 4>Here's an unpopular opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even remotely concerned with men</v>

2114
01:43:06.301 --> 01:43:11.301
<v Speaker 4>being falsely accused of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>harassment or assault and she was </v>

2115
01:43:11.301 --> 01:43:15.710
<v Speaker 4>attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bret Weinstein retweeted it and pointed </v>

2116
01:43:15.710 --> 01:43:20.271
<v Speaker 4>out how wrong this idea was and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy it is to to take allies who are </v>

2117
01:43:20.491 --> 01:43:25.491
<v Speaker 4>falsely accused of sexual harassment or </v>
<v Speaker 4>assault and not being concerned about </v>

2118
01:43:25.491 --> 01:43:26.030
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're,</v>

2119
01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:28.830
<v Speaker 4>you're only concerned with your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>gender and this is a.</v>

2120
01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:34.020
<v Speaker 4>This is a perfect example of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent person that's thinking in </v>

2121
01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:37.080
<v Speaker 4>this really crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>discriminatory way because in her mind,</v>

2122
01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:42.200
<v Speaker 4>her team had been fucked over so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>times that it's time to fuck over that </v>

2123
01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.070
<v Speaker 4>other team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we lose a couple of people,</v>

2124
01:43:44.071 --> 01:43:46.440
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we shoot some drones into some apartment</v>

2125
01:43:46.441 --> 01:43:49.530
<v Speaker 4>buildings and a few civilians die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least we got the terrorists.</v>

2126
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I mean I understand</v>

2127
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 3>that like the anger that comes with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2128
01:43:54.321 --> 01:43:56.090
<v Speaker 3>I think for the people who were the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>militant,</v>

2129
01:43:56.091 --> 01:43:58.430
<v Speaker 3>so not to say that have this particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

2130
01:43:58.431 --> 01:44:03.431
<v Speaker 3>but I think of women in particular who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are the most militant about this </v>

2131
01:44:03.431 --> 01:44:06.581
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they really just have been hurt </v>

2132
01:44:06.581 --> 01:44:06.650
<v Speaker 3>badly by men and it's a way for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>express that,</v>

2133
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:11.170
<v Speaker 4>but you can't say that no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These women that are angry about men,</v>

2134
01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:16.620
<v Speaker 4>that they've been hurt by men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now they discriminate against large </v>

2135
01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:19.600
<v Speaker 4>groups of men because of that pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do that,</v>

2136
01:44:19.601 --> 01:44:22.220
<v Speaker 4>like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a self hate or your.</v>

2137
01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:23.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>internalized misogyny,</v>

2138
01:44:25.090 --> 01:44:26.830
<v Speaker 3>which is sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2139
01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.270
<v Speaker 3>but you can't actually argue with it.</v>

2140
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Where does this balance out though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it balance out to a point in our </v>

2141
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:40.101
<v Speaker 4>children's future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our children's Children's future where </v>

2142
01:44:40.101 --> 01:44:43.581
<v Speaker 4>this is no longer a concern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like cannibalism is no longer a concern </v>

2143
01:44:43.581 --> 01:44:48.260
<v Speaker 4>or a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very slight concern where it's an </v>

2144
01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:48.260
<v Speaker 4>aberration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's a very,</v>

2145
01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:52.320
<v Speaker 4>very rare thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean is that's the ultimate goal,</v>

2146
01:44:52.321 --> 01:44:57.321
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that we reach a point in our society </v>

2147
01:44:57.321 --> 01:44:58.410
<v Speaker 4>where we do not care if someone's gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got care.</v>

2148
01:44:58.411 --> 01:45:01.680
<v Speaker 4>If you're a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do not care if you're a boy and we're</v>

2149
01:45:01.681 --> 01:45:06.681
<v Speaker 4>not mad if you're not attracted to us or</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that would be a wonderful thing,</v>

2150
01:45:07.171 --> 01:45:12.171
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we get to a point where people are </v>

2151
01:45:12.171 --> 01:45:12.171
<v Speaker 4>just comfortable in their own skin,</v>

2152
01:45:12.670 --> 01:45:17.670
<v Speaker 3>you mean this craziness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where is it eventually going to </v>

2153
01:45:17.670 --> 01:45:17.670
<v Speaker 3>leave?</v>

2154
01:45:17.670 --> 01:45:17.670
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean culturally across the board,</v>

2155
01:45:17.670 --> 01:45:20.660
<v Speaker 4>whether it's male versus female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's transverse a straight,</v>

2156
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:25.990
<v Speaker 4>all of this gay versus straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's progressive versus </v>

2157
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:30.610
<v Speaker 4>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love it if we got to this point </v>

2158
01:45:30.610 --> 01:45:34.220
<v Speaker 4>with all this chaos and calamity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>arguing back and forth.</v>

2159
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:37.370
<v Speaker 4>It would be fantastic if we can get to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>balance point.</v>

2160
01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2161
01:45:38.051 --> 01:45:43.051
<v Speaker 3>I agree and I do think we're coming up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that point because more and more I </v>

2162
01:45:43.051 --> 01:45:47.011
<v Speaker 3>see people are saying that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>okay with this in terms of the things I </v>

2163
01:45:47.201 --> 01:45:48.670
<v Speaker 3>write about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People reach out to me and say,</v>

2164
01:45:48.671 --> 01:45:50.170
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad you said that.</v>

2165
01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the response to wrong speak.</v>

2166
01:45:53.141 --> 01:45:58.141
<v Speaker 3>I really thought that people were going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to lose their minds in terms of the </v>

2167
01:45:58.141 --> 01:45:58.141
<v Speaker 3>things that we said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2168
01:45:58.141 --> 01:46:02.670
<v Speaker 3>it's been very positive feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think more people then you might </v>

2169
01:46:02.670 --> 01:46:06.200
<v Speaker 3>think are actually on board with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2170
01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:09.040
<v Speaker 3>wanting to come to a middle ground and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not okay with this.</v>

2171
01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:12.820
<v Speaker 3>The extreme craziness that we're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's a good sign.</v>

2172
01:46:12.850 --> 01:46:14.290
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of waiting it out.</v>

2173
01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:20.020
<v Speaker 4>I hope you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I hope that we understand why things</v>

2174
01:46:20.451 --> 01:46:25.451
<v Speaker 4>get extreme and that as human beings we </v>
<v Speaker 4>can look at it with compassion and say </v>

2175
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:29.600
<v Speaker 4>like you were saying like women that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>so angry against men,</v>

2176
01:46:30.370 --> 01:46:34.370
<v Speaker 4>it's not just because for no reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>something had to happen to them.</v>

2177
01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.290
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a friend and who's not an </v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive man,</v>

2178
01:46:39.710 --> 01:46:44.710
<v Speaker 4>and over the time that I knew him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he became more and more resentful to </v>

2179
01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:49.931
<v Speaker 4>women to the point where he would just </v>
<v Speaker 4>openly say fucked up misogynistic</v>

2180
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.640
<v Speaker 2>things about women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was weird to watch,</v>

2181
01:46:53.641 --> 01:46:58.641
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was one of those things where I was </v>

2182
01:46:58.641 --> 01:46:58.641
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2183
01:46:58.641 --> 01:47:00.951
<v Speaker 2>I see he associates women with paint in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He associates them with just wanting his</v>

2184
01:47:02.041 --> 01:47:05.490
<v Speaker 2>money or trying to fuck him over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is his perception.</v>

2185
01:47:05.491 --> 01:47:07.530
<v Speaker 2>This is how he looks at women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2186
01:47:07.531 --> 01:47:08.190
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2187
01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is sad,</v>

2188
01:47:10.471 --> 01:47:11.460
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that case,</v>

2189
01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:13.680
<v Speaker 2>women obviously not all women are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2190
01:47:13.681 --> 01:47:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Just like not all men are the men that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these women have encountered in life.</v>

2191
01:47:17.341 --> 01:47:20.100
<v Speaker 2>And you can't generalize from one person</v>
<v Speaker 2>to everybody.</v>

2192
01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:22.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

2193
01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:27.080
<v Speaker 2>But when we look at it with compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the hopefully the healthy people,</v>

2194
01:47:28.590 --> 01:47:32.790
<v Speaker 2>the people that aren't in that state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anger and resentment,</v>

2195
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:35.430
<v Speaker 2>that they look at it with compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

2196
01:47:35.490 --> 01:47:36.390
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2197
01:47:36.391 --> 01:47:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I see why this woman would write that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweet.</v>

2198
01:47:39.230 --> 01:47:42.840
<v Speaker 2>She's met a bunch of fucked up shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes,</v>

2199
01:47:42.930 --> 01:47:45.100
<v Speaker 2>probably male feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2200
01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:50.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that she doesn't need to be mobbed </v>

2201
01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:50.240
<v Speaker 5>over her tweet either</v>

2202
01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:50.240
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No men.</v>

2203
01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or man.</v>

2204
01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of shit.</v>

2205
01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:53.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2206
01:47:53.401 --> 01:47:54.810
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get where that's from.</v>

2207
01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:58.500
<v Speaker 2>I just think there's entirely too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict out there,</v>

2208
01:47:59.910 --> 01:48:00.210
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2209
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:05.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think our society almost thrives on </v>

2210
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.430
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say the media definitely thrives</v>

2211
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:07.750
<v Speaker 5>on it because if you're not angry and </v>
<v Speaker 5>upset about something,</v>

2212
01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:10.960
<v Speaker 5>what are people going to do mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at twitter,</v>

2213
01:48:11.690 --> 01:48:14.950
<v Speaker 5>social media to facebook's the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>because facebook,</v>

2214
01:48:14.951 --> 01:48:18.870
<v Speaker 5>those assholes are allowed to write </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking forever wraps,</v>

2215
01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:21.070
<v Speaker 5>paragraphs of bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like swear.</v>

2216
01:48:21.071 --> 01:48:24.180
<v Speaker 5>Do they have jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of these people I click on,</v>

2217
01:48:24.190 --> 01:48:27.940
<v Speaker 5>the more you click on the more thing and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then there's way more,</v>

2218
01:48:27.970 --> 01:48:32.970
<v Speaker 5>way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's just going to be a two </v>

2219
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:32.970
<v Speaker 5>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like six pages.</v>

2220
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:32.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

2221
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:33.100
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2222
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:38.430
<v Speaker 2>that is a real problem and I think one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the more unique things about twitter </v>

2223
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:40.870
<v Speaker 2>is that it limited you to 140 characters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then people complained.</v>

2224
01:48:40.871 --> 01:48:41.950
<v Speaker 2>So they gave you to 80.</v>

2225
01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:43.430
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's too much.</v>

2226
01:48:43.431 --> 01:48:47.090
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I can't read all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

2227
01:48:47.210 --> 01:48:47.890
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2228
01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:48.860
<v Speaker 5>as a comic,</v>

2229
01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:52.750
<v Speaker 2>1:40</v>
<v Speaker 2>was great because it made you really,</v>

2230
01:48:52.751 --> 01:48:55.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it made you really invest in the economy</v>

2231
01:48:55.661 --> 01:48:57.580
<v Speaker 2>of words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really had to make sure that you got</v>

2232
01:48:57.581 --> 01:49:02.581
<v Speaker 2>your point out as quickly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great for joke writing because you </v>

2233
01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:02.990
<v Speaker 2>can just set a Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh </v>
<v Speaker 2>Duh Duh Duh Duh.</v>

2234
01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:06.880
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good way to like really trim down</v>

2235
01:49:06.881 --> 01:49:11.881
<v Speaker 2>the fat and your jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a good way to express </v>

2236
01:49:11.881 --> 01:49:15.571
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the good things about </v>

2237
01:49:15.571 --> 01:49:18.241
<v Speaker 2>twitter is they have this thing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can reply to your tweet and then </v>

2238
01:49:18.241 --> 01:49:19.650
<v Speaker 2>reply to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reply to that thread.</v>

2239
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:22.210
<v Speaker 2>And they all fit in together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that,</v>

2240
01:49:22.450 --> 01:49:25.810
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like it sometimes because </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people just fucking drone on.</v>

2241
01:49:26.050 --> 01:49:27.390
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and on and on.</v>

2242
01:49:27.810 --> 01:49:28.900
<v Speaker 5>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2243
01:49:29.850 --> 01:49:34.850
<v Speaker 5>this is a first draft to edit this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bitch is too much nonsense in there.</v>

2244
01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.680
<v Speaker 5>You don't get that with your dms to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2245
01:49:38.681 --> 01:49:41.290
<v Speaker 5>People just send you a massive block of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't read them.</v>

2246
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:41.760
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

2247
01:49:42.090 --> 01:49:44.260
<v Speaker 5>I barely skim through my day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't.</v>

2248
01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 5>I follow too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the good is I get a</v>

2249
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:50.680
<v Speaker 2>lot of interesting things in my feed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the bad things.</v>

2250
01:49:50.681 --> 01:49:53.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll get 500 dms a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

2251
01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:56.060
<v Speaker 6>I saw someone wrote a tweet that said </v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

2252
01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:01.120
<v Speaker 6>if my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you don't like write two sentences </v>

2253
01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:01.120
<v Speaker 6>for the DM,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to read it.</v>

2254
01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:01.120
<v Speaker 6>And that was their pin tweet.</v>

2255
01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's aggressive.</v>

2256
01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I read as many as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't read them all.</v>

2257
01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:08.850
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:14.070
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you can't reply to everybody </v>

2259
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.070

<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you can't like,</v>

2262
01:50:15.731 --> 01:50:17.050
<v Speaker 6>like all of their stuff either.</v>

2263

<v Speaker 2>It's too many boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to read people's stuff.</v>

2265
01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:24.240
<v Speaker 2>It's just I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the time.</v>

2266
01:50:24.241 --> 01:50:29.241
<v Speaker 2>And also if you're running the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 2>encountering too much negativity and and</v>

2267
01:50:29.551 --> 01:50:32.350
<v Speaker 2>then also things that you disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want to like,</v>

2268
01:50:32.370 --> 01:50:33.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say that's bullshit.</v>

2269
01:50:33.841 --> 01:50:36.060
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell this guy.</v>

2270
01:50:36.150 --> 01:50:37.620
<v Speaker 2>This is what actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2271
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:41.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>

2272
01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to argue with people about </v>
<v Speaker 2>random facts or science or anything.</v>

2273
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:47.250

<v Speaker 6>But you've.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you been mobbed before?</v>

2276
01:50:50.311 --> 01:50:52.620
<v Speaker 6>You have what's been the worst?</v>

2277
01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the big ones was a about a trans </v>

2278
01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:57.900
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

2279
01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:02.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a hilarious one because I'm </v>

2280
01:51:02.251 --> 01:51:02.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys can kiss my fucking ass.</v>

2281
01:51:02.411 --> 01:51:04.960
<v Speaker 2>You're out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are out of your mind.</v>

2282
01:51:04.961 --> 01:51:09.961
<v Speaker 2>If you think that a man who has been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man for 30 years and has taken female </v>

2283
01:51:09.961 --> 01:51:13.720
<v Speaker 2>hormones for two is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put Brock Lesnar,</v>

2284
01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.730
<v Speaker 2>chop his dick off and put them in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dress.</v>

2285
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.760
<v Speaker 2>That guy's gonna Maul through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>women's heavyweight division like </v>

2286
01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:23.761
<v Speaker 2>nothing you've ever seen in your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're built different and it's </v>

2287
01:51:23.761 --> 01:51:26.380
<v Speaker 2>just a fact and then they want to tries </v>
<v Speaker 2>to argue that it's crazy and there are.</v>

2288
01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:31.700
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly standouts in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>women who are a much more muscular,</v>

2289
01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.790
<v Speaker 2>higher bone density,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly African American women have</v>

2290
01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:40.800
<v Speaker 2>very high bone density,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a different shape to their </v>

2291
01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:40.800
<v Speaker 2>hips.</v>

2292
01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:42.820
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the size of the hands,</v>

2293
01:51:42.821 --> 01:51:45.850
<v Speaker 2>the size of the shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are different.</v>

2294
01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:50.320
<v Speaker 2>That also the imprinting of years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of testosterone.</v>

2295
01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:54.490
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a great article by this.</v>

2296
01:51:54.491 --> 01:51:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm board certified endocrinologist who </v>
<v Speaker 2>went over all of the,</v>

2297
01:51:59.590 --> 01:52:04.590
<v Speaker 2>all the things that separate men from </v>
<v Speaker 2>women which should exclude them from </v>

2298
01:52:04.590 --> 01:52:09.301
<v Speaker 2>competing in combat sports against women</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this woman was called a transphobic </v>

2299
01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:13.430
<v Speaker 2>and she's a fucking endocrinologists </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot.</v>

2300
01:52:13.431 --> 01:52:16.420
<v Speaker 2>She's talking about the science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's also talking about the science of.</v>

2301
01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:19.240
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they talk about is how</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

2302
01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:21.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a trans woman.</v>

2303
01:52:21.071 --> 01:52:26.071
<v Speaker 2>Once they transitioned to being a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>there basically biologically almost </v>

2304
01:52:26.071 --> 01:52:26.080
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same as woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

2305
01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:28.000
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

2306
01:52:28.001 --> 01:52:32.410
<v Speaker 2>but the bone density is retained by </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking estrogen,</v>

2307
01:52:32.590 --> 01:52:36.160
<v Speaker 2>which is what the problem with women </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they have osteoporosis,</v>

2308
01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:38.650
<v Speaker 2>they they lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're losing estrogen,</v>

2309
01:52:38.651 --> 01:52:40.360
<v Speaker 2>they lose bone mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2310
01:52:40.450 --> 01:52:42.940
<v Speaker 2>the estrogen actually helps you retain </v>
<v Speaker 2>bone mass,</v>

2311
01:52:42.941 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 2>so when a man transitions to a woman and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then starts</v>

2312
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:51.040
<v Speaker 4>taking estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually helping retain the bone </v>

2313
01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:51.320
<v Speaker 4>mass that he would have lost by not </v>
<v Speaker 4>having testosterone,</v>

2314
01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.680
<v Speaker 4>and then on top of that reaction times </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Rita reaction times are several </v>

2315
01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:01.150
<v Speaker 4>tenths of a second faster in general for</v>
<v Speaker 4>women than they are for you or for men </v>

2316
01:53:01.150 --> 01:53:01.910
<v Speaker 4>rather than they are for even </v>
<v Speaker 4>professional athlete.</v>

2317
01:53:01.911 --> 01:53:06.911
<v Speaker 4>Women saw these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these variables that need to be </v>

2318
01:53:06.911 --> 01:53:10.811
<v Speaker 4>taken into consideration when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowing someone to do a sport and that </v>

2319
01:53:10.811 --> 01:53:11.690
<v Speaker 4>we're not just talking about bike </v>
<v Speaker 4>racing,</v>

2320
01:53:12.110 --> 01:53:16.230
<v Speaker 4>we're not talking about something where </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone noncontact.</v>

2321
01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:20.180
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the most contact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about fucking fighting.</v>

2322
01:53:21.850 --> 01:53:24.830
<v Speaker 4>There's there's benefits that certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>people have.</v>

2323
01:53:25.130 --> 01:53:26.860
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's physical attributes that pe,</v>

2324
01:53:27.230 --> 01:53:30.180
<v Speaker 4>there's variables inside the genders </v>
<v Speaker 4>right there.</v>

2325
01:53:30.190 --> 01:53:35.190
<v Speaker 4>There's some men that have gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical advantages over other men and </v>

2326
01:53:36.170 --> 01:53:39.790
<v Speaker 4>all of those are taking into you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2327
01:53:39.791 --> 01:53:40.670
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>

2328
01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:45.100
<v Speaker 4>like even playing field when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 4>even enter gender competition or,</v>

2329
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:47.450
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>male versus male competition.</v>

2330
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:50.720
<v Speaker 4>There's no real level playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the best we can do is say,</v>

2331
01:53:50.721 --> 01:53:52.750
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you guys got to be the same weight.</v>

2332
01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:54.290
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just make that,</v>

2333
01:53:54.330 --> 01:53:56.630
<v Speaker 4>make it the same weight and that's as </v>
<v Speaker 4>close as you can get.</v>

2334
01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:58.340
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even in that,</v>

2335
01:53:58.610 --> 01:54:00.790
<v Speaker 4>there's people that are just physically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just,</v>

2336
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:02.360
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

2337
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:05.480
<v Speaker 4>there's no getting around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be better athletes.</v>

2338
01:54:05.710 --> 01:54:07.790
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have better genetics.</v>

2339
01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:09.860
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing you do about that.</v>

2340
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:14.810
<v Speaker 4>But one thing we can do is we can keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>women from getting beaten up by men and,</v>

2341
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:18.290
<v Speaker 4>and men who transitioned to being women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you think that's fair,</v>

2342
01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:22.670
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking crazy and it's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't make any sense.</v>

2343
01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:27.760
<v Speaker 4>And the arguments for it are so shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there are so riddled with </v>

2344
01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:32.300
<v Speaker 4>progressive speak that they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretend that this is a woman.</v>

2345
01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:33.320
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not a woman.</v>

2346
01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:35.930
<v Speaker 4>This is a trans woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a male.</v>

2347
01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.280
<v Speaker 4>She has a y chromosome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She transitioned to being a female.</v>

2348
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:45.430
<v Speaker 4>Now she's a trans woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you choose to fight her and </v>

2349
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:47.480
<v Speaker 4>you're a woman and you know that she's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>trans woman,</v>

2350
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:50.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was not what was going on here.</v>

2351
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:55.100
<v Speaker 4>What was going on here was this woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>who used to be a man for 32 years,</v>

2352
01:54:55.460 --> 01:55:00.460
<v Speaker 4>transitioned to being a woman and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't tell anybody and thought to </v>

2353
01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.890
<v Speaker 4>different women who thought they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting a woman and got fucking smashed</v>

2354
01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:10.360
<v Speaker 4>watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like watching a man fight a </v>

2355
01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:10.360
<v Speaker 4>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was watching.</v>

2356
01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:10.550
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't like particularly.</v>

2357
01:55:10.551 --> 01:55:15.380
<v Speaker 4>She wasn't particularly skillful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like she had some unbelievable</v>

2358
01:55:15.381 --> 01:55:20.381
<v Speaker 4>background in judo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Rhonda Rousey or something like </v>

2359
01:55:20.381 --> 01:55:20.381
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2360
01:55:20.381 --> 01:55:23.440
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that he would just literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching a former man beat up women who </v>

2361
01:55:24.711 --> 01:55:29.390
<v Speaker 4>never had the the benefit of 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>plus of testosterone in their body.</v>

2362
01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:31.670
<v Speaker 4>What do you think the solution should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>then?</v>

2363
01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:35.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was fascinated by watching the mob</v>

2364
01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:37.010
<v Speaker 4>come after me for that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2365
01:55:37.590 --> 01:55:41.280
<v Speaker 4>this is adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was fascinating about it was,</v>

2366
01:55:42.230 --> 01:55:43.830
<v Speaker 4>here's something I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2367
01:55:43.831 --> 01:55:48.831
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a physio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a real expert in physiology or </v>

2368
01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:54.260
<v Speaker 4>endocrinology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a martial arts expert and I've </v>

2369
01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:56.280
<v Speaker 4>been doing it my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I know the difference I've.</v>

2370
01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:01.340
<v Speaker 4>I've trained with women world champions </v>
<v Speaker 4>and watch them get mauled by men who are</v>

2371
01:56:03.301 --> 01:56:05.640
<v Speaker 4>not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a fact,</v>

2372
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:08.250
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to striking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2373
01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:13.280
<v Speaker 4>there's more of a gap in Jujitsu or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gap rather closes in Jujitsu because </v>

2374
01:56:14.101 --> 01:56:17.820
<v Speaker 4>skill and technique take precedent over </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical strength,</v>

2375
01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:20.280
<v Speaker 4>but God dammit when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>striking,</v>

2376
01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:25.400
<v Speaker 4>you could get a man who's been doing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>for six months but just happens to have </v>

2377
01:56:25.410 --> 01:56:30.330
<v Speaker 4>a lot of fast twitch muscle fiber and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>just knows how to hit things hard and he</v>

2378
01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:31.500
<v Speaker 4>he'll fuck a woman up.</v>

2379
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:36.500
<v Speaker 4>It's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to kickboxing </v>

2380
01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:36.500
<v Speaker 4>and kicking and punching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so.</v>

2381
01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:41.300
<v Speaker 4>There's so many advantages and to to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that those advantages are immediately </v>

2382
01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:46.220
<v Speaker 4>cut out of the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you transitioned to being a </v>

2383
01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:49.521
<v Speaker 4>woman and within two years he should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to fight women in a cage and not </v>

2384
01:56:49.521 --> 01:56:49.530
<v Speaker 4>tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a woman.</v>

2385
01:56:49.531 --> 01:56:51.180
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is insanity.</v>

2386
01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:52.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that was the.</v>

2387
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:56.370
<v Speaker 4>That was the big mob that came after me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's interesting that in this,</v>

2388
01:56:56.510 --> 01:57:01.510
<v Speaker 4>because it is pitting people who would </v>
<v Speaker 4>call themselves feminist against </v>

2389
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:05.060
<v Speaker 4>transgender activists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically women are being lost in the </v>

2390
01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:08.571
<v Speaker 4>mix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can't say certain things like on </v>

2391
01:57:08.571 --> 01:57:10.630
<v Speaker 4>what planet would it be okay for someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is born male to fight a woman,</v>

2392
01:57:11.370 --> 01:57:16.370
<v Speaker 4>but in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this person who was born male </v>

2393
01:57:16.370 --> 01:57:17.480
<v Speaker 4>identifies as female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't call that into question it and</v>

2394
01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:20.460
<v Speaker 4>it also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a real problem in Texas,</v>

2395
01:57:20.610 --> 01:57:25.610
<v Speaker 4>the other way where they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they were doing as being prejudice </v>

2396
01:57:25.981 --> 01:57:30.981
<v Speaker 4>against trans people to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't let a girl transitioning </v>

2397
01:57:30.981 --> 01:57:32.550
<v Speaker 4>to being a boy wrestle with boys.</v>

2398
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:36.120
<v Speaker 4>They made her wrestle with girls while </v>
<v Speaker 4>she was taking testosterone.</v>

2399
01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:41.420
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys are out of your fucking mind </v>

2400
01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:43.580
<v Speaker 4>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not even recognizing that she </v>

2401
01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:46.071
<v Speaker 4>wants to compete with boys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a disadvantage for her or him.</v>

2402
01:57:46.351 --> 01:57:51.210
<v Speaker 4>Now let him compete with boys because </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a different thing,</v>

2403
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:53.970
<v Speaker 4>but then even then a lot of boys are </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

2404
01:57:53.971 --> 01:57:55.800
<v Speaker 4>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not taking testosterone.</v>

2405
01:57:55.801 --> 01:58:00.801
<v Speaker 4>I just have testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would have her testosterone is higher </v>

2406
01:58:00.801 --> 01:58:03.750
<v Speaker 4>than my testosterone because she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking exogenous testosterone.</v>

2407
01:58:03.751 --> 01:58:05.060
<v Speaker 4>This is kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2408
01:58:05.070 --> 01:58:06.740
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

2409
01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:09.960
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of new ground that's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on here.</v>

2410
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:14.990
<v Speaker 4>My concern as a martial arts expert is </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you are using ideology to push </v>

2411
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:22.500
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this progressive notion that,</v>

2412
01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:27.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a trans woman is exactly the same as a </v>

2413
01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:31.140
<v Speaker 4>woman and you're getting women beat the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck up because of it and this is what I</v>

2414
01:58:31.141 --> 01:58:34.260
<v Speaker 4>felt and this is what I saw and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't have to be hard for like a year</v>

2415
01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:35.400
<v Speaker 4>or two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it all went away.</v>

2416
01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:37.050
<v Speaker 4>What's the worst thing they said about </v>
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>

2417
01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I didn't read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't read it.</v>

2418
01:58:39.361 --> 01:58:40.890
<v Speaker 4>I read a little bit of it and then I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2419
01:58:41.010 --> 01:58:46.010
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really didn't even hurt my feelings </v>

2420
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:46.010
<v Speaker 4>because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is so stupid.</v>

2421
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:49.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know a woman who's got a hand </v>

2422
01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:50.170
<v Speaker 4>that looks like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find one,</v>

2423
01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:52.570
<v Speaker 4>find one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if I took estrogen,</v>

2424
01:58:52.571 --> 01:58:55.000
<v Speaker 4>I'd still have these and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>fair.</v>

2425
01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:56.530
<v Speaker 4>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

2426
01:58:56.590 --> 01:58:58.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what anybody says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not.</v>

2427
01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:00.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even a woman with big hands,</v>

2428
01:59:00.221 --> 01:59:03.220
<v Speaker 4>they're not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not like brock Lesnar's hands is</v>

2429
01:59:03.221 --> 01:59:05.560
<v Speaker 4>that there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a fucking difference.</v>

2430
01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:07.690
<v Speaker 4>There's a difference in the shape of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>jaw,</v>

2431
01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:12.700
<v Speaker 4>the difference in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's so many differences in men to</v>

2432
01:59:12.761 --> 01:59:17.761
<v Speaker 4>women and there's so many women that </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to be men that transition to being </v>

2433
01:59:17.761 --> 01:59:19.360
<v Speaker 4>women that are now dominating these </v>
<v Speaker 4>sports.</v>

2434
01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:22.780
<v Speaker 4>Are these women feel like they're being </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked over like weightlifting.</v>

2435
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:27.990
<v Speaker 4>There was this Australian weightlifter </v>
<v Speaker 4>who is a trans woman who's competing as </v>

2436
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:30.430
<v Speaker 4>a woman and his fucking breaking records</v>
<v Speaker 4>left and right.</v>

2437
01:59:30.431 --> 01:59:31.810
<v Speaker 4>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>

2438
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:33.120
<v Speaker 4>She's an inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2439
01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.450
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's a guy.</v>

2440
01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:38.700
<v Speaker 4>She used to be a guy and now she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>breaking these women's records.</v>

2441
01:59:38.710 --> 01:59:40.090
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing?</v>

2442
01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:41.370
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2443
01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:46.740
<v Speaker 4>But to play devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please do fox get beaten by Ashley Smith</v>

2444
01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:52.300
<v Speaker 4>because she sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really what it is.</v>

2445
01:59:52.330 --> 01:59:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Ashley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Evan Smith is good.</v>

2446
01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:56.350
<v Speaker 4>She's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She listened.</v>

2447
01:59:56.680 --> 02:00:01.680
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of women that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of men and women who are not taking </v>

2448
02:00:02.410 --> 02:00:06.010
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who would beat a lot of men.</v>

2449
02:00:06.190 --> 02:00:11.190
<v Speaker 4>And it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Germane to random me who,</v>

2450
02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:14.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a super high level.</v>

2451
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:19.830
<v Speaker 4>Women's MMA fighter is a 145 pound world</v>
<v Speaker 4>title beat.</v>

2452
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Holly Holm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She fought a man and a kickboxing bout,</v>

2453
02:00:23.351 --> 02:00:26.260
<v Speaker 4>knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because she's a fucking beast.</v>

2454
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:31.510
<v Speaker 4>She's really good and really technical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super strong and just much better than a</v>

2455
02:00:32.711 --> 02:00:37.360
<v Speaker 4>guy who wasn't on her level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's just super exceptional.</v>

2456
02:00:38.170 --> 02:00:42.540
<v Speaker 4>But there's also women who fought men </v>
<v Speaker 4>who were world champions who got knocked</v>

2457
02:00:42.541 --> 02:00:44.950
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who there was a woman from.</v>

2458
02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:49.930
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was a female boxer from Holland.</v>

2459
02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:51.760
<v Speaker 4>Her name escapes me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2460
02:00:51.761 --> 02:00:56.761
<v Speaker 4>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was a woman that they were always </v>

2461
02:00:56.761 --> 02:00:58.600
<v Speaker 4>trying to match her up with Christy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Martin back when Christy Martin,</v>

2462
02:00:58.601 --> 02:01:01.810
<v Speaker 4>the coal miner's daughter was a famous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God dammit.</v>

2463
02:01:02.050 --> 02:01:07.050
<v Speaker 4>Why can't I remember her name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she was an elite female boxer and </v>

2464
02:01:07.050 --> 02:01:09.220
<v Speaker 4>she got knocked out by a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was ugly.</v>

2465
02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:10.870
<v Speaker 4>And the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she knocked out,</v>

2466
02:01:10.871 --> 02:01:12.940
<v Speaker 4>the guy who knocked her out really </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't very good.</v>

2467
02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:16.630
<v Speaker 4>He just climbed her on the John and </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed her.</v>

2468
02:01:16.990 --> 02:01:21.990
<v Speaker 4>But it was disturbing to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but somehow wasn't disturbing with </v>

2469
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:21.990
<v Speaker 4>Jermaine to random.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knocked out the guy.</v>

2470
02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.110
<v Speaker 4>Then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2471
02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:25.980
<v Speaker 4>girl,</v>

2472
02:01:26.110 --> 02:01:31.110
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're always going to have people that </v>

2473
02:01:31.110 --> 02:01:32.320
<v Speaker 4>are higher level skill and Ashley Evan </v>
<v Speaker 4>Smith,</v>

2474
02:01:32.321 --> 02:01:37.321
<v Speaker 4>who's competed successfully in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's very tough and she beat Fox and </v>

2475
02:01:37.931 --> 02:01:39.260
<v Speaker 4>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2476
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:45.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm not against fallon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fox fighting women that want to fight </v>

2477
02:01:45.250 --> 02:01:45.250
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not against that.</v>

2478
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:50.410
<v Speaker 4>If they want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not against women fighting men to </v>

2479
02:01:50.410 --> 02:01:50.410
<v Speaker 4>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a man.</v>

2480
02:01:50.410 --> 02:01:52.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm not against people riding bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not against people bungee jumping.</v>

2481
02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:54.260
<v Speaker 4>I should be able to do whatever fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want,</v>

2482
02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.800
<v Speaker 4>but don't pretend that you're exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same as a biological woman.</v>

2483
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:02.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck do we have tests?</v>

2484
02:02:02.091 --> 02:02:03.530
<v Speaker 4>Then what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2485
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:04.310
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

2486
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:06.620
<v Speaker 4>What is a chromosome?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What our genetics,</v>

2487
02:02:06.650 --> 02:02:07.580
<v Speaker 4>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

2488
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Is it all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just going to give it all away for</v>

2489
02:02:11.121 --> 02:02:12.770
<v Speaker 4>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what about women?</v>

2490
02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:18.140
<v Speaker 4>Like what is this idea of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely progressive and and looking </v>

2491
02:02:18.471 --> 02:02:21.410
<v Speaker 4>at things and promoting equality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's wonderful.</v>

2492
02:02:21.411 --> 02:02:23.270
<v Speaker 4>But are you promoting equality for </v>
<v Speaker 4>women?</v>

2493
02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:25.760
<v Speaker 4>Like what about the women?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about a woman like you?</v>

2494
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:29.340
<v Speaker 4>What about a woman who's a slight thin?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do,</v>

2495
02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:31.610
<v Speaker 4>what are you supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much do you weigh?</v>

2496
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:34.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're very sad.</v>

2497
02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:37.720
<v Speaker 4>Let's pretend you're in the hundred and </v>
<v Speaker 4>five pound weight class.</v>

2498
02:02:38.090 --> 02:02:40.090
<v Speaker 4>Do you feel like you can compete with </v>
<v Speaker 4>100,</v>

2499
02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:41.690
<v Speaker 4>five pound man and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2500
02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:43.710
<v Speaker 4>that seems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems ridiculous,</v>

2501
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2502
02:02:44.991 --> 02:02:49.991
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me that we have to accept </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that there's some physical </v>

2503
02:02:49.991 --> 02:02:54.701
<v Speaker 4>differences when the consequences are </v>
<v Speaker 4>being gravely injured and this is what </v>

2504
02:02:54.741 --> 02:02:55.730
<v Speaker 4>martial arts are all about.</v>

2505
02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:00.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to hurt you and I shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have natural physical advantages that </v>

2506
02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:04.640
<v Speaker 4>come from having a y chromosome and 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>plus years of testosterone in my body.</v>

2507
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:08.120
<v Speaker 4>That just seems to be obvious to me and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't understand why,</v>

2508
02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:11.990
<v Speaker 4>but that was a hill that I was ready to </v>
<v Speaker 4>die on.</v>

2509
02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:14.120
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys can fuck off.</v>

2510
02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:19.150
<v Speaker 4>Good for you for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you see that they've kind of left </v>

2511
02:03:19.150 --> 02:03:19.150
<v Speaker 4>you alone now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2512
02:03:19.150 --> 02:03:22.660
<v Speaker 4>Because I do this because I [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 4>I can say things like this about it and </v>

2513
02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:25.340
<v Speaker 4>I think because it makes sense because </v>
<v Speaker 4>when other people hear about it that are</v>

2514
02:03:25.341 --> 02:03:26.450
<v Speaker 4>rational people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

2515
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:28.070
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's happening?</v>

2516
02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a guy.</v>

2517
02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:31.410
<v Speaker 4>She was a guy for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2518
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:35.180
<v Speaker 4>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the vast majority of people who even</v>

2519
02:03:35.181 --> 02:03:40.181
<v Speaker 4>support trans rights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including friends of mine who are trans </v>

2520
02:03:40.181 --> 02:03:41.000
<v Speaker 4>or with me on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

2521
02:03:41.001 --> 02:03:41.930
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

2522
02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:45.470
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard the term turf?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2523
02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:47.030
<v Speaker 4>my surf and turf</v>

2524
02:03:47.110 --> 02:03:48.990
<v Speaker 6>terp no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Turf is in t e R,</v>

2525
02:03:48.991 --> 02:03:51.160
<v Speaker 6>F is trans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exclusionary.</v>

2526
02:03:51.161 --> 02:03:56.161
<v Speaker 6>Radical feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this is a new slur that's being used </v>

2527
02:03:56.161 --> 02:03:59.581
<v Speaker 6>against women who will say trans women </v>
<v Speaker 6>or not women because they were not born </v>

2528
02:04:00.101 --> 02:04:00.490
<v Speaker 6>women,</v>

2529
02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:04.410
<v Speaker 4>trans exclusionary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>radical feminist</v>

2530
02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:08.450
<v Speaker 6>kind of be a turf in this situation </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you are advocating for women and</v>

2531
02:04:08.451 --> 02:04:12.950
<v Speaker 6>the safety of women and saying that </v>
<v Speaker 6>people who are born male but identify as</v>

2532
02:04:12.951 --> 02:04:15.920
<v Speaker 6>female are not the same as people who </v>
<v Speaker 6>are born female.</v>

2533
02:04:16.020 --> 02:04:21.020
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't mean that I'm </v>

2534
02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:21.020
<v Speaker 4>discriminatory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2535
02:04:21.490 --> 02:04:24.120
<v Speaker 4>it's a word that they use to try and </v>
<v Speaker 4>discredit you.</v>

2536
02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:26.400
<v Speaker 4>Good luck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have fun with that.</v>

2537
02:04:26.610 --> 02:04:30.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't care see this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing about this is I don't care</v>

2538
02:04:30.331 --> 02:04:35.331
<v Speaker 4>because I really don't have any hate in </v>
<v Speaker 4>my heart and I don't have any </v>

2539
02:04:35.331 --> 02:04:36.510
<v Speaker 4>discrimination in my heart like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think most of us do.</v>

2540
02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I speak for everybody.</v>

2541
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:38.940
<v Speaker 6>Some do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

2542
02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:40.270
<v Speaker 4>some do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

2543
02:04:40.271 --> 02:04:45.271
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure if you were Tryna look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a thousand people and 100 of</v>

2544
02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:46.960
<v Speaker 4>those people are a fucking asshole to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2545
02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:49.510
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna feel like a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2546
02:04:49.810 --> 02:04:52.310
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a trans person and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>

2547
02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:57.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen horrific things written to </v>

2548
02:04:57.420 --> 02:04:57.420
<v Speaker 4>trans people online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it,</v>

2549
02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:01.470
<v Speaker 4>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand that it's real </v>

2550
02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:02.761
<v Speaker 4>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I understand that you have to </v>

2551
02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:05.131
<v Speaker 4>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to appreciate who your actual </v>

2552
02:05:05.131 --> 02:05:08.551
<v Speaker 4>allies and people who are rational </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who actually care about you and </v>

2553
02:05:08.590 --> 02:05:11.980
<v Speaker 4>who disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On one very particular thing,</v>

2554
02:05:11.981 --> 02:05:13.990
<v Speaker 4>and this is the only place where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>disagree,</v>

2555
02:05:14.290 --> 02:05:17.650
<v Speaker 4>it's combat sports and it's because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>my area of expertise.</v>

2556
02:05:18.130 --> 02:05:21.970
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing it since I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't tell me that there.</v>

2557
02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:27.160
<v Speaker 4>There's not differences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've watched men and women fight my </v>

2558
02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:30.211
<v Speaker 4>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a difference and I know </v>

2559
02:05:30.211 --> 02:05:34.971
<v Speaker 4>that from talking to endocrinologist and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are experts in the human </v>

2560
02:05:35.171 --> 02:05:40.171
<v Speaker 4>anatomy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's just physiological </v>

2561
02:05:40.171 --> 02:05:40.171
<v Speaker 4>differences that are insurmountable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just are.</v>

2562
02:05:40.171 --> 02:05:42.520
<v Speaker 4>I've seen men and women hit the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very different thing.</v>

2563
02:05:42.550 --> 02:05:47.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I get where people are coming </v>

2564
02:05:47.550 --> 02:05:47.550
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the people who are upset by this because</v>

2565
02:05:47.550 --> 02:05:51.901
<v Speaker 6>I think by acknowledging someone that </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone was not born the sex that they </v>

2566
02:05:51.901 --> 02:05:52.420
<v Speaker 6>identify as.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like saying,</v>

2567
02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:54.250
<v Speaker 6>pointing out to them that they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>different,</v>

2568
02:05:54.670 --> 02:05:57.130
<v Speaker 6>but they are different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are different.</v>

2569
02:05:57.370 --> 02:06:02.370
<v Speaker 6>But I can see how that can be upsetting </v>
<v Speaker 6>for someone who identifies as the </v>

2570
02:06:02.370 --> 02:06:02.370
<v Speaker 6>opposite sex.</v>

2571
02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:05.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

2572
02:06:05.081 --> 02:06:08.980
<v Speaker 4>I can see how it's upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're short and you want to identify</v>

2573
02:06:08.981 --> 02:06:10.600
<v Speaker 4>as being tall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

2574
02:06:10.601 --> 02:06:13.420
<v Speaker 4>If I wanted to pretend that I was seven </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet tall and you'd be like,</v>

2575
02:06:13.421 --> 02:06:14.230
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your five eight,</v>

2576
02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:16.030
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you an asshole?</v>

2577
02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:18.640
<v Speaker 4>Why are you saying I'm a five eight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you are.</v>

2578
02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:22.390
<v Speaker 4>So if I say you're a trans woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means you're a born a man,</v>

2579
02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:25.330
<v Speaker 4>you have a y chromosome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like where's you're a piece of Shit,</v>

2580
02:06:25.870 --> 02:06:28.510
<v Speaker 4>how you point that out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what you are.</v>

2581
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:33.870
<v Speaker 4>It's not that you're negative or you are</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are dwarves are is that.</v>

2582
02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:39.090
<v Speaker 4>Is it evil to say that a dwarf is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dwarf or a little person and whatever,</v>

2583
02:06:39.130 --> 02:06:44.130
<v Speaker 4>whatever phrase you want to use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are we supposed to acknowledge that </v>

2584
02:06:44.130 --> 02:06:46.010
<v Speaker 4>there is an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if someone is born with a handicap,</v>

2585
02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:46.870
<v Speaker 4>are you supposed to.</v>

2586
02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:52.320
<v Speaker 4>Is that a fact?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you allowed to discuss it as a fact </v>

2587
02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:54.210
<v Speaker 4>if you have autism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my allowed to bring up the fact that you</v>

2588
02:06:54.211 --> 02:06:56.770
<v Speaker 4>are on the spectrum or am I supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>ignore it?</v>

2589
02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:58.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it discrimination?</v>

2590
02:06:58.541 --> 02:07:02.350
<v Speaker 4>If you talk about reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone has a deformity,</v>

2591
02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:07.360
<v Speaker 4>are you allowed to discuss it or is it </v>
<v Speaker 4>discrimination to discuss reality </v>

2592
02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:08.680
<v Speaker 4>because what are we doing with our </v>
<v Speaker 4>language?</v>

2593
02:07:08.681 --> 02:07:12.700
<v Speaker 4>What are we doing with the way we </v>
<v Speaker 4>describe the actual things that are that</v>

2594
02:07:12.701 --> 02:07:17.701
<v Speaker 4>exist in the world and if we're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>describing them in accurate terms </v>

2595
02:07:17.701 --> 02:07:21.640
<v Speaker 4>because we're trying to somehow another </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop people from getting hurt feelings,</v>

2596
02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:26.880
<v Speaker 4>what are these feelings based on these </v>
<v Speaker 4>delusional perceptions of reality and </v>

2597
02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:29.140
<v Speaker 4>why are we reinforcing these delusional </v>
<v Speaker 4>perceptions of reality?</v>

2598
02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:34.320
<v Speaker 4>Because it seems to me that this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>language in this kind of exclusionary </v>

2599
02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:34.620
<v Speaker 4>th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>th,</v>

2600
02:07:34.670 --> 02:07:35.150
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2601
02:07:35.151 --> 02:07:36.700
<v Speaker 4>the inability</v>

2602
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:40.840
<v Speaker 2>to use certain words and the inability </v>
<v Speaker 2>to describe things accurately,</v>

2603
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:45.870
<v Speaker 2>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in many cases scientifically it </v>

2604
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:45.870
<v Speaker 2>hurts everybody.</v>

2605
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:46.250
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree with that.</v>

2606
02:07:46.251 --> 02:07:48.350
<v Speaker 6>I don't think facts themselves are </v>
<v Speaker 6>hateful.</v>

2607
02:07:48.351 --> 02:07:52.460
<v Speaker 6>I think people who use facts to justify </v>
<v Speaker 6>discrimination,</v>

2608
02:07:52.461 --> 02:07:57.461
<v Speaker 6>that's where the problem is and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>where the efforts should be going </v>

2609
02:07:57.461 --> 02:07:58.130
<v Speaker 6>because when you start to deny facts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where does that leave you?</v>

2610
02:07:58.160 --> 02:07:59.690
<v Speaker 6>Where do you draw the line in that case?</v>

2611
02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:01.650
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's,</v>

2612
02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:04.130
<v Speaker 2>there's something that's kind of cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

2613
02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:09.820
<v Speaker 2>that there are trans people and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool about it is that the world is </v>

2614
02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:11.600
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2615
02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:16.660
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not happy that they get a lot of </v>

2616
02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:20.060
<v Speaker 2>hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm kinda happy that they exist.</v>

2617
02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I wish they could just be women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish you could just hit a switch and </v>

2618
02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:25.660
<v Speaker 2>you really wish you were born a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>

2619
02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:30.640
<v Speaker 2>you're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I suspect that even if you could do </v>

2620
02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:31.910
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people would rather just be trans.</v>

2621
02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Some people would look like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people that I know that are trans</v>

2622
02:08:34.831 --> 02:08:36.680
<v Speaker 2>and also have Dick's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2623
02:08:36.930 --> 02:08:38.140
<v Speaker 2>And they want to keep the deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2624
02:08:38.660 --> 02:08:39.410
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2625
02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:41.570
<v Speaker 2>like what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

2626
02:08:41.571 --> 02:08:46.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're transphobic if you're a </v>

2627
02:08:46.571 --> 02:08:47.540
<v Speaker 2>straight heterosexual male and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not willing to date a trans woman with a</v>

2628
02:08:47.541 --> 02:08:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Dick,</v>

2629
02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:53.160
<v Speaker 6>but you know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's actually a sexual preference for </v>

2630
02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:53.620
<v Speaker 6>four men who will date trans women who </v>
<v Speaker 6>were.</v>

2631
02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:55.600
<v Speaker 6>It's retaining their penis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what it's called,</v>

2632
02:08:55.601 --> 02:08:58.150
<v Speaker 6>the literature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They decide not to get surgery.</v>

2633
02:08:58.151 --> 02:09:03.151
<v Speaker 6>It's actually a particular sexual </v>
<v Speaker 6>preference for the people that are </v>

2634
02:09:03.151 --> 02:09:05.260
<v Speaker 6>attracted to that particular trans guy </v>
<v Speaker 6>or morph affilia.</v>

2635
02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone told Jim Norton.</v>

2636
02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm nothing wrong with that either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2637
02:09:13.611 --> 02:09:16.540
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing what either do what you do,</v>

2638
02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:21.580
<v Speaker 2>but this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between a man and a </v>

2639
02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:21.850
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trans man,</v>

2640
02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:26.060
<v Speaker 2>a trans woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then someone who could actually be a</v>

2641
02:09:26.061 --> 02:09:31.061
<v Speaker 2>woman who transitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to get to a point </v>

2642
02:09:31.061 --> 02:09:34.301
<v Speaker 2>within whether it's 100 years or 500 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years where we can use things like the </v>

2643
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:39.910
<v Speaker 2>future version of crispr or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes down the line next.</v>

2644
02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Some scientific innovation that's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to allow people to literally transition.</v>

2645
02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's gonna happen and when that </v>

2646
02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:49.520
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect they're going to say that word</v>

2647
02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:50.440
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the one guy named Andrew?</v>

2648
02:09:50.450 --> 02:09:52.370
<v Speaker 2>More fulfilling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a bunch of those.</v>

2649
02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:54.470
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a bunch of people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2650
02:09:54.650 --> 02:09:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather just stay at chick with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>

2651
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.990
<v Speaker 6>I'll take it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2652
02:09:56.991 --> 02:09:57.330
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

2653
02:09:57.340 --> 02:10:02.340
<v Speaker 6>Andrew more fulfilling is the preference</v>
<v Speaker 6>for male to female people who have </v>

2654
02:10:02.340 --> 02:10:03.650
<v Speaker 6>retained their penis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking go for it.</v>

2655
02:10:03.651 --> 02:10:05.000
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing wrong.</v>

2656
02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:06.650
<v Speaker 6>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all good.</v>

2657
02:10:06.651 --> 02:10:10.400
<v Speaker 6>It's only when you tell other men that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to conform to this.</v>

2658
02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:15.760
<v Speaker 6>I think that's where the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think people should be allowed to be </v>

2659
02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:15.760
<v Speaker 6>into what they're into.</v>

2660
02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that you're transphobic,</v>

2661
02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:20.410
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen articles written where they're</v>

2662
02:10:20.411 --> 02:10:24.730
<v Speaker 2>shitting on men that are not willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>date women with penises.</v>

2663
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:26.080
<v Speaker 2>They call it the.</v>

2664
02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:26.890
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sorry,</v>

2665
02:10:26.891 --> 02:10:31.891
<v Speaker 6>the cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The cotton ceiling is the other way </v>

2666
02:10:31.891 --> 02:10:33.991
<v Speaker 6>around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When it's a male to female person and </v>

2667
02:10:33.991 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 6>women don't want to date them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lesbians</v>

2668
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:35.840
<v Speaker 5>don't want to date them because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a penis.</v>

2669
02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:38.780
<v Speaker 5>What do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The cotton ceiling because it's like the</v>

2670
02:10:38.781 --> 02:10:40.970
<v Speaker 5>glass ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Acceptance has to do with underwear.</v>

2671
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:48.310
<v Speaker 5>She's Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So lesbians who don't want to date trans</v>

2672
02:10:48.381 --> 02:10:50.500
<v Speaker 5>women because penises.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2673
02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:53.600
<v Speaker 5>What a wonderful world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>

2674
02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:55.550
<v Speaker 5>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This world is weird.</v>

2675
02:10:55.670 --> 02:10:57.290
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is where</v>

2676
02:10:57.510 --> 02:11:02.510
<v Speaker 4>I think I get why people would see what </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've said and think that it's </v>

2677
02:11:07.411 --> 02:11:10.380
<v Speaker 4>transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get like who I am.</v>

2678
02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:12.210
<v Speaker 4>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's a problem.</v>

2679
02:11:12.630 --> 02:11:15.600
<v Speaker 4>I get just looking at me as a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm,</v>

2680
02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:17.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a cage fighting commentator,</v>

2681
02:11:18.090 --> 02:11:20.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a dirty standup comedian.</v>

2682
02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:21.290
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2683
02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:24.660
<v Speaker 4>I've seen like I would be your enemy,</v>

2684
02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:26.630
<v Speaker 5>but people shouldn't assume,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2685
02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:29.480
<v Speaker 5>Like you're your own person so you might</v>
<v Speaker 5>look a certain way.</v>

2686
02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:33.610
<v Speaker 4>It's just what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same way a guy looks at a chick</v>

2687
02:11:33.611 --> 02:11:35.260
<v Speaker 4>with a Dick and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yikes,</v>

2688
02:11:35.470 --> 02:11:37.920
<v Speaker 4>what do we got going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just.</v>

2689
02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:42.760
<v Speaker 4>I just think as me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an individual,</v>

2690
02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:47.761
<v Speaker 4>as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing I like about it is I like </v>

2691
02:11:47.761 --> 02:11:52.470
<v Speaker 4>things that are weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like things that defy the standard </v>

2692
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.470
<v Speaker 4>definition.</v>

2693
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:55.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think it's more interesting.</v>

2694
02:11:55.780 --> 02:11:57.430
<v Speaker 5>It's far more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2695
02:11:57.550 --> 02:12:00.030
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting when you talked to </v>
<v Speaker 5>neuroscientists,</v>

2696
02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:02.260
<v Speaker 5>whereas a playboy tee shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2697
02:12:02.290 --> 02:12:03.440
<v Speaker 5>You're a Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2698
02:12:03.460 --> 02:12:04.240
<v Speaker 5>Do you like it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2699
02:12:04.241 --> 02:12:04.990
<v Speaker 5>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a cool,</v>

2700
02:12:04.991 --> 02:12:06.250
<v Speaker 5>clever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are a Weirdo.</v>

2701
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:11.310
<v Speaker 5>I am aware though for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that relates to your sense of humor </v>

2702
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:14.251
<v Speaker 5>too though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because my sense of humor is really dry </v>

2703
02:12:14.251 --> 02:12:17.190
<v Speaker 5>and I feel that's part of the way I look</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the world and why I appreciate the </v>

2704
02:12:17.190 --> 02:12:18.190
<v Speaker 5>world the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2705
02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:19.060
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

2706
02:12:19.061 --> 02:12:20.330
<v Speaker 5>I embrace the weird.</v>

2707
02:12:20.370 --> 02:12:21.640
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

2708
02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:24.160
<v Speaker 4>I'd love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd love that.</v>

2709
02:12:24.190 --> 02:12:26.080
<v Speaker 4>Things are strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2710
02:12:26.350 --> 02:12:28.990
<v Speaker 4>I think it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

2711
02:12:29.010 --> 02:12:32.770
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everything's interesting.</v>

2712
02:12:33.070 --> 02:12:33.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2713
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:36.430
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I try to cultivate that.</v>

2714
02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:41.580
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go out of my way to try to look at </v>

2715
02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:44.641
<v Speaker 4>things with fresh eyes and especially </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I smoke a lot of pot and so </v>

2716
02:12:44.641 --> 02:12:46.500
<v Speaker 4>whenever I do that I kind of always have</v>
<v Speaker 4>a new way of looking at it.</v>

2717
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2718
02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:52.090
<v Speaker 4>I never even thought about it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's one of the things that are </v>

2719
02:12:52.090 --> 02:12:52.090
<v Speaker 4>really like about marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I tried.</v>

2720
02:12:52.090 --> 02:12:54.790
<v Speaker 4>I've tried to explain that to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that don't smoke pot.</v>

2721
02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:58.810
<v Speaker 4>I got a conversation with Ted nugent </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that and one of the things,</v>

2722
02:12:58.870 --> 02:13:03.870
<v Speaker 4>because he had this perception that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people smoke pot or lazy and Ne'er do </v>

2723
02:13:03.870 --> 02:13:04.810
<v Speaker 4>wells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2724
02:13:04.811 --> 02:13:06.610
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't have enough jobs.</v>

2725
02:13:06.611 --> 02:13:11.611
<v Speaker 4>I have so many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do do so many fucking super high </v>

2726
02:13:11.611 --> 02:13:11.611
<v Speaker 4>functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always doing something.</v>

2727
02:13:11.611 --> 02:13:16.531
<v Speaker 4>I'm not lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I get the benefit that I get out of </v>

2728
02:13:16.961 --> 02:13:19.150
<v Speaker 4>it as a benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is not often.</v>

2729
02:13:21.490 --> 02:13:22.470
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2730
02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.440
<v Speaker 4>it's not often promoted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that benefit is there's something </v>

2731
02:13:28.631 --> 02:13:32.640
<v Speaker 4>good about being nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something good about what people</v>

2732
02:13:32.641 --> 02:13:37.641
<v Speaker 4>call paranoia is something good about </v>
<v Speaker 4>heightened perspective that is brought </v>

2733
02:13:38.101 --> 02:13:43.101
<v Speaker 4>upon by psychedelics or buy marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you are forced to reexamine what </v>

2734
02:13:44.551 --> 02:13:47.820
<v Speaker 4>you've taken for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I like about it.</v>

2735
02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:51.780
<v Speaker 4>And so what I like about one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that I like about smoking pot,</v>

2736
02:13:52.050 --> 02:13:55.050
<v Speaker 4>besides the fact that I believe it makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>me more compassionate,</v>

2737
02:13:55.051 --> 02:13:58.290
<v Speaker 4>it makes it instills a better sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

2738
02:13:58.291 --> 02:14:01.500
<v Speaker 4>It makes me more friendly and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>loving and it definitely does that,</v>

2739
02:14:01.890 --> 02:14:06.570
<v Speaker 4>but it also makes me look at things with</v>
<v Speaker 4>fresh eyes and appreciate the weirdness,</v>

2740
02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:11.670
<v Speaker 4>the weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I genuinely love it when I see like</v>

2741
02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:13.370
<v Speaker 4>some girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know Bailey?</v>

2742
02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:18.380
<v Speaker 4>Jay is a trans woman with a giant Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got pictures of her Dick.</v>

2743
02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:23.790
<v Speaker 4>Is Jamie going to pull it up right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>and think you can.</v>

2744
02:14:23.791 --> 02:14:26.010
<v Speaker 4>We'll get kicked off of youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I love it.</v>

2745
02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:28.890
<v Speaker 4>I like the fact that it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't bother me.</v>

2746
02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fun.</v>

2747
02:14:30.970 --> 02:14:33.000
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to enjoy a more fulfilled?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2748
02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:34.270
<v Speaker 4>no I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

2749
02:14:34.350 --> 02:14:38.820
<v Speaker 4>I like the fact that they exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do acceptance and I like the fact that</v>

2750
02:14:38.821 --> 02:14:43.290
<v Speaker 4>people liked them and I liked the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it makes certain people happy if it</v>

2751
02:14:43.291 --> 02:14:46.080
<v Speaker 4>makes them happy or people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>attracted to them happy.</v>

2752
02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:48.360
<v Speaker 4>I really do like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2753
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:52.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like definitions I don't like.</v>

2754
02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:55.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't like restrictions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2755
02:14:55.980 --> 02:15:00.980
<v Speaker 4>so where people would get an incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 4>assumption is my radical stance against </v>

2756
02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:07.100
<v Speaker 4>this trans woman fighting other women </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I recognize that as being unfair</v>

2757
02:15:09.390 --> 02:15:12.960
<v Speaker 4>and not well because there's suppression</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the debate as well.</v>

2758
02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:18.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing if you could talk about </v>

2759
02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:18.140
<v Speaker 4>it openly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2760
02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:18.140
<v Speaker 4>it's also something that I'm an expert </v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2761
02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:20.070
<v Speaker 4>so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop,</v>

2762
02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:20.940
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

2763
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:26.030
<v Speaker 4>don't try to compare this to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>tennis because even in tennis it wasn't </v>

2764
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:27.600
<v Speaker 4>fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is a different thing.</v>

2765
02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:30.750
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a radically different thing.</v>

2766
02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:33.090
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting because I heard you </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about this,</v>

2767
02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:35.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was your interview </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Josh Barnett,</v>

2768
02:15:35.431 --> 02:15:40.431
<v Speaker 4>but when you first get into the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what the other person is </v>

2769
02:15:40.431 --> 02:15:40.431
<v Speaker 4>going to be like until you start </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>

2770
02:15:40.630 --> 02:15:41.830
<v Speaker 4>Just imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2771
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:44.460
<v Speaker 4>if you go in and you don't know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone was born male,</v>

2772
02:15:44.461 --> 02:15:49.461
<v Speaker 4>how that's very big disadvantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a propensity for </v>

2773
02:15:49.461 --> 02:15:54.231
<v Speaker 4>violence that exists in the mind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>man that I just don't know if it's the </v>

2774
02:15:55.171 --> 02:15:58.500
<v Speaker 4>same in most women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think,</v>

2775
02:15:59.430 --> 02:16:00.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much of that.</v>

2776
02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:03.360
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know if you turn me into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>

2777
02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:07.140
<v Speaker 4>how much of that you would squeeze out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2778
02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:12.180
<v Speaker 4>but I know there's a switch that men </v>
<v Speaker 4>have because I've seen it go off.</v>

2779
02:16:12.181 --> 02:16:13.230
<v Speaker 4>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen,</v>

2780
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:19.910
<v Speaker 4>I've probably seen more people get </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up in real life than 99 point </v>

2781
02:16:22.861 --> 02:16:25.920
<v Speaker 4>nine percent of people that have ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>lived other than like,</v>

2782
02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:31.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people lived in Roman times and we get </v>

2783
02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:32.410
<v Speaker 4>chopped up by swords,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people in modern time,</v>

2784
02:16:32.411 --> 02:16:37.210
<v Speaker 4>I can targe fisticuffs people getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>head kicked and beaten down with elbows.</v>

2785
02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:42.420
<v Speaker 4>I've probably seen more of that than </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost anyone that's ever lived is sort </v>

2786
02:16:42.420 --> 02:16:45.940
<v Speaker 4>of probably a small group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got thousand people on the planet that</v>

2787
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:48.430
<v Speaker 4>seen as many people get fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>personally is I have,</v>

2788
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:52.710
<v Speaker 4>so I did you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you date at chunk you?</v>

2789
02:16:52.711 --> 02:16:55.030
<v Speaker 4>You get a sense of what you're seeing.</v>

2790
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:57.370
<v Speaker 4>You get a sense of and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you understand there's a,</v>

2791
02:16:57.940 --> 02:16:59.020
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2792
02:17:00.490 --> 02:17:04.030
<v Speaker 4>there's a technical violence that women </v>
<v Speaker 4>are capable of.</v>

2793
02:17:04.031 --> 02:17:09.031
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean especially like extreme examples </v>

2794
02:17:09.031 --> 02:17:11.881
<v Speaker 4>like cris cyborg is like super violent </v>
<v Speaker 4>or when Holly Holm head kicked Ronda </v>

2795
02:17:11.881 --> 02:17:13.600
<v Speaker 4>Rousey and then hammer fists at her </v>
<v Speaker 4>while she was unconscious.</v>

2796
02:17:13.870 --> 02:17:17.080
<v Speaker 4>Super violent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also very technical violence.</v>

2797
02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:22.380
<v Speaker 4>And then there's an extreme over the top</v>
<v Speaker 4>masculine violence that I've seen that's</v>

2798
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:27.470
<v Speaker 4>even more ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2799
02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:31.440
<v Speaker 4>there's something to it that is another </v>
<v Speaker 4>level this in.</v>

2800
02:17:32.050 --> 02:17:35.020
<v Speaker 4>And this is not saying that men are </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than women.</v>

2801
02:17:35.021 --> 02:17:40.021
<v Speaker 4>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just I'm saying there's a thing </v>

2802
02:17:40.021 --> 02:17:42.360
<v Speaker 4>that men do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason why men cause all wars.</v>

2803
02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:46.540
<v Speaker 4>Men Cause all wars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women are fucking suit up and going into</v>

2804
02:17:46.541 --> 02:17:47.680
<v Speaker 4>battle and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2805
02:17:47.730 --> 02:17:50.120
<v Speaker 4>and trying to conquer as a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2806
02:17:50.121 --> 02:17:54.940
<v Speaker 4>million strong group of women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>soldiers invading a foreign army.</v>

2807
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.320
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not happening.</v>

2808
02:17:56.350 --> 02:17:58.630
<v Speaker 4>This is a male behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Testosterone.</v>

2809
02:17:58.810 --> 02:17:59.740
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>

2810
02:17:59.770 --> 02:18:02.590
<v Speaker 4>it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about males.</v>

2811
02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:04.030
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this switch,</v>

2812
02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:08.110
<v Speaker 4>this violent switch that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It exists in a very dark way.</v>

2813
02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:13.320
<v Speaker 4>Women are capable of shooting people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stabbing people and doing all these </v>

2814
02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:13.320
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me wrong,</v>

2815
02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:17.551
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it does not happen in the same </v>

2816
02:18:17.551 --> 02:18:17.551
<v Speaker 4>numbers that it happens with men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't.</v>

2817
02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:23.040
<v Speaker 4>And I think that this is something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>also has to be taken into consideration </v>

2818
02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:23.620
<v Speaker 4>when you talk to you about men versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

2819
02:18:23.980 --> 02:18:28.980
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a different thing and people don't </v>

2820
02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:32.551
<v Speaker 4>think it's a different thing have </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably never been punched in the face </v>

2821
02:18:32.551 --> 02:18:34.180
<v Speaker 4>by a guy you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or seeing guys punch guys in the face or</v>

2822
02:18:34.181 --> 02:18:38.140
<v Speaker 4>been around it enough where you realize </v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's a different thing.</v>

2823
02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:40.510
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some awesome women fights,</v>

2824
02:18:40.630 --> 02:18:44.500
<v Speaker 4>awesome women fights amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super technical,</v>

2825
02:18:44.501 --> 02:18:47.360
<v Speaker 4>even very violent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but God damn it,</v>

2826
02:18:47.410 --> 02:18:49.210
<v Speaker 4>there's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a difference.</v>

2827
02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:51.360
<v Speaker 4>It's just not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2828
02:18:51.610 --> 02:18:56.610
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely agree with that and </v>

2829
02:18:56.610 --> 02:18:57.070
<v Speaker 4>most people would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if in today's climate,</v>

2830
02:18:57.550 --> 02:19:02.550
<v Speaker 4>in certain circles that would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>considered transphobic or maybe even </v>

2831
02:19:02.550 --> 02:19:02.550
<v Speaker 4>sexist,</v>

2832
02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.770
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's also this narrative that women,</v>

2833
02:19:04.771 --> 02:19:08.430
<v Speaker 6>because they need to be like men and </v>
<v Speaker 6>some level women have to be as strong as</v>

2834
02:19:08.431 --> 02:19:12.750
<v Speaker 6>men and I've seen this where they will </v>
<v Speaker 6>put like published piece of saying women</v>

2835
02:19:12.751 --> 02:19:17.130
<v Speaker 6>are as strong as men physically strong </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's not even true.</v>

2836
02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:18.000
<v Speaker 6>It's not true.</v>

2837
02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:23.530
<v Speaker 4>Only there's a not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's you can demonstrate it like </v>

2838
02:19:23.530 --> 02:19:28.071
<v Speaker 4>scientifically it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at the data in terms of what </v>

2839
02:19:28.071 --> 02:19:28.071
<v Speaker 4>men have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2840
02:19:28.071 --> 02:19:30.650
<v Speaker 4>what they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is this guy,</v>

2841
02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:35.880
<v Speaker 4>this woman who used to be a man who is </v>
<v Speaker 4>now competing in weightlifting and </v>

2842
02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:39.791
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everybody's going crazy over this </v>

2843
02:19:39.791 --> 02:19:42.311
<v Speaker 4>one who is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any sense that they're </v>

2844
02:19:42.311 --> 02:19:43.250
<v Speaker 4>allowing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If this is so nonsensical,</v>

2845
02:19:43.430 --> 02:19:47.300
<v Speaker 4>if you want to have trans transgender </v>
<v Speaker 4>Olympics,</v>

2846
02:19:47.570 --> 02:19:48.980
<v Speaker 4>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do that,</v>

2847
02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:54.340
<v Speaker 4>but to try to pretend until we come up </v>
<v Speaker 4>with some sort of a way like with crispr</v>

2848
02:19:54.721 --> 02:19:57.890
<v Speaker 4>or whatever we talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can actually turn a man into a</v>

2849
02:19:57.891 --> 02:20:02.891
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn a woman into a man until it's real </v>

2850
02:20:02.891 --> 02:20:02.891
<v Speaker 4>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We look at it and go,</v>

2851
02:20:02.891 --> 02:20:04.550
<v Speaker 4>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just did the chromosome test.</v>

2852
02:20:04.551 --> 02:20:09.551
<v Speaker 4>You've got a y chromosome now and you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>erased 30 years of testosterone and you </v>

2853
02:20:10.611 --> 02:20:12.260
<v Speaker 4>know a man now is built like you.</v>

2854
02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:14.630
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we're good.</v>

2855
02:20:14.860 --> 02:20:16.460
<v Speaker 4>We're good now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an actual woman.</v>

2856
02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Until then,</v>

2857
02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:24.220
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with some hardcore </v>

2858
02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:26.350
<v Speaker 4>variables and to not to be in denial of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those variables is silly and I'm gonna </v>

2859
02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:30.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to stand against it every time</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think it's.</v>

2860
02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:32.330
<v Speaker 4>I see what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2861
02:20:32.331 --> 02:20:34.550
<v Speaker 4>this is like a religious ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2862
02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:36.920
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're purposely ignoring facts.</v>

2863
02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:38.870
<v Speaker 4>Do you feel like most people in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>industry.</v>

2864
02:20:38.871 --> 02:20:40.760
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you or how did they feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

2865
02:20:40.810 --> 02:20:42.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>

2866
02:20:42.831 --> 02:20:44.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2867
02:20:44.571 --> 02:20:49.571
<v Speaker 4>The people who don't is a minor group </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're all like super progressive,</v>

2868
02:20:50.181 --> 02:20:55.181
<v Speaker 4>left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left leaning and some of them were </v>

2869
02:20:55.181 --> 02:20:56.930
<v Speaker 4>scared to talk about it because other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people aren't as vocal.</v>

2870
02:20:57.260 --> 02:21:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just didn't want to get the </v>

2871
02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:02.260
<v Speaker 4>blowback.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all it is.</v>

2872
02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:07.450
<v Speaker 4>But in terms of like fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a hundred percent mean </v>

2873
02:21:08.331 --> 02:21:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Ashley.</v>

2874
02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:13.010
<v Speaker 4>Evan Smith is a fucking beast for taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fight and even tougher for winning.</v>

2875
02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:15.110
<v Speaker 4>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she went into the UFC.</v>

2876
02:21:15.111 --> 02:21:17.660
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's in a UFC level fighter,</v>

2877
02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:20.150
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a big difference,</v>

2878
02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:23.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what she was kicking me.</v>

2879
02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:26.660
<v Speaker 4>If you look at like the caliber of </v>
<v Speaker 4>competition that she's fought,</v>

2880
02:21:26.930 --> 02:21:29.780
<v Speaker 4>guys like Raquel Pennington or girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

2881
02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:31.580
<v Speaker 4>like Raquel Pennington,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

2882
02:21:31.581 --> 02:21:36.581
<v Speaker 4>Raquel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And look at who found foxes fighting </v>

2883
02:21:36.581 --> 02:21:36.950
<v Speaker 4>when she was fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2884
02:21:36.951 --> 02:21:41.951
<v Speaker 4>lower level competitions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a giant leap between Raquel </v>

2885
02:21:41.951 --> 02:21:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Pennington and someone who is on these </v>
<v Speaker 4>amateur circuits and Raquel Pennington </v>

2886
02:21:46.390 --> 02:21:49.310
<v Speaker 4>beat Ashley Evan Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy fight was submitted with a bulldog</v>

2887
02:21:49.311 --> 02:21:51.650
<v Speaker 4>choke with like one second ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're screaming.</v>

2888
02:21:51.651 --> 02:21:53.280
<v Speaker 4>It was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Covered in blood.</v>

2889
02:21:53.281 --> 02:21:54.650
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2890
02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:59.600
<v Speaker 4>But this is like super elite world </v>
<v Speaker 4>championship level fighting.</v>

2891
02:22:00.210 --> 02:22:01.410
<v Speaker 4>That's the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2892
02:22:01.411 --> 02:22:02.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just fucking different,</v>

2893
02:22:03.770 --> 02:22:04.770
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2894
02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:07.370
<v Speaker 4>So there was a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>supported me,</v>

2895
02:22:07.940 --> 02:22:09.970
<v Speaker 4>but I knew I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2896
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:10.670
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2897
02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:12.740
<v Speaker 4>that other people are secretly agreeing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with you.</v>

2898
02:22:12.810 --> 02:22:17.810
<v Speaker 4>I will not even secretly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just didn't want to talk about it </v>

2899
02:22:17.810 --> 02:22:17.810
<v Speaker 4>publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that.</v>

2900
02:22:17.810 --> 02:22:18.890
<v Speaker 4>It was a secret,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2901
02:22:18.891 --> 02:22:22.220
<v Speaker 4>there was no people that were coming up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me disagreeing with me.</v>

2902
02:22:22.250 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 4>Trans people were agreeing with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trans people that I'm friends with,</v>

2903
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:27.330
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit is crazy.</v>

2904
02:22:27.331 --> 02:22:32.331
<v Speaker 2>That bitch is out of her fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was funny and also in the long run </v>

2905
02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:37.700
<v Speaker 2>over many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many conversations about it,</v>

2906
02:22:37.701 --> 02:22:38.790
<v Speaker 2>people realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2907
02:22:38.791 --> 02:22:42.110
<v Speaker 2>I see your perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not discriminatory.</v>

2908
02:22:42.140 --> 02:22:47.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just about combat sports and even </v>

2909
02:22:47.140 --> 02:22:47.140
<v Speaker 2>about weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2910
02:22:47.140 --> 02:22:51.411

2912
02:22:53.661 --> 02:22:57.530
<v Speaker 2>through the force of will and </v>
<v Speaker 2>determination and your focus and </v>

2913
02:22:57.530 --> 02:23:01.220
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then some trans woman comes in and </v>

<v Speaker 2>because they're discriminatory in the </v>

2918
02:23:14.121 --> 02:23:16.110
<v Speaker 2>opposite way and they won't recognize </v>

2922
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:27.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying one girl can take steroids</v>

2923
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:29.730
<v Speaker 2>because she thinks she's a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't think she's a boy,</v>

2924
02:23:29.731 --> 02:23:31.710
<v Speaker 2>so we'll let her take steroids.</v>

<v Speaker 6>by taking those,</v>

2931
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:50.750
<v Speaker 6>by taking testosterone too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he is sterilizing himself.</v>

2932
02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:52.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which is crazy at that age.</v>

2933
02:23:53.690 --> 02:23:58.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to say specifically of that </v>

2934
02:23:58.690 --> 02:23:58.690
<v Speaker 6>person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just in general.</v>

2935
02:23:58.690 --> 02:24:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a neuroscientist in your </v>

2936
02:24:03.550 --> 02:24:03.550
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the frontal lobe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the development of human,</v>

2937
02:24:03.850 --> 02:24:07.750
<v Speaker 2>because you realize like your decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>making capabilities not fully formed,</v>

2938
02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:11.360
<v Speaker 6>not till you're almost 30.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I just want people should vote.</v>

2939
02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:13.400
<v Speaker 6>That's when they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when they should make any sort of</v>

2940
02:24:13.401 --> 02:24:18.401
<v Speaker 6>important decision.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's crazy because you think a 17 </v>

2941
02:24:18.401 --> 02:24:21.101
<v Speaker 6>year old or even like A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even 21 year old can decide if </v>

2942
02:24:21.101 --> 02:24:21.860
<v Speaker 6>they want to be sterile for life.</v>

2943
02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:22.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2944
02:24:22.991 --> 02:24:25.150
<v Speaker 2>If you gave me a chance at 17 to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vasectomy,</v>

2945
02:24:25.151 --> 02:24:26.890
<v Speaker 2>I might've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2946
02:24:27.130 --> 02:24:30.250
<v Speaker 2>now I'm happy I have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's um,</v>

2947
02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:34.960
<v Speaker 2>it's an irreversible decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why it gets weird.</v>

2948
02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you decide to sterilize </v>

2949
02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:40.200
<v Speaker 2>yourself at testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any.</v>

2950
02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Coming back from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you started taking estrogen again?</v>

2951
02:24:41.891 --> 02:24:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Where your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where your cycle kicked back in?</v>

2952
02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:45.240
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2953
02:24:45.241 --> 02:24:46.800
<v Speaker 6>once you start taking cross sex </v>
<v Speaker 6>hormones.</v>

2954
02:24:46.801 --> 02:24:47.760
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2955
02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:52.800
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's amazing because parents are </v>

2956
02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:52.800
<v Speaker 6>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2957
02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:56.571
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if that's the decision they want to </v>

2958
02:24:56.571 --> 02:24:58.161
<v Speaker 6>make,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then they should make that decision and </v>

2959
02:24:58.161 --> 02:24:58.161
<v Speaker 6>they're okay with it.</v>

2960
02:24:58.161 --> 02:25:01.120
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting too is the language </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we use and that people use in the </v>

2961
02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:05.351
<v Speaker 2>media now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was a story about a woman who </v>

2962
02:25:05.351 --> 02:25:05.351
<v Speaker 2>just gave birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2963
02:25:05.530 --> 02:25:10.530
<v Speaker 6>tell me more actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I thought I thought I was </v>

2964
02:25:10.530 --> 02:25:10.530
<v Speaker 6>thinking of something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's something else.</v>

2965
02:25:10.530 --> 02:25:11.150
<v Speaker 2>She used to be a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd be,</v>

2966
02:25:11.170 --> 02:25:15.080
<v Speaker 2>she was transitioning to being a man and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got pregnant.</v>

2967
02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But became a full man.</v>

2968
02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after she gave birth,</v>

2969
02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:24.220
<v Speaker 2>had her breast removed the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2970
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Celebrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrated as this men give birth.</v>

2971
02:25:28.361 --> 02:25:29.190
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2972
02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:29.830
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

2973
02:25:29.860 --> 02:25:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she breastfed was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be celebrated.</v>

2974
02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's massive amounts of evidence</v>

2975
02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:41.340
<v Speaker 2>that breastfeeding is super positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that look at that full beard </v>

2976
02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:47.640
<v Speaker 2>holding a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So clearly taking the testosterone </v>

2977
02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:48.910
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not taking it while the baby's in the</v>

2978
02:25:48.911 --> 02:25:50.720
<v Speaker 2>womb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2979
02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:55.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure five years after having a child</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a woman,</v>

2980
02:25:55.720 --> 02:26:00.720
<v Speaker 2>what transgender man gives birth to baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>five years after having a child as a </v>

2981
02:26:01.541 --> 02:26:02.920
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2982
02:26:03.370 --> 02:26:08.370
<v Speaker 2>So she had a child as a woman and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>she got pregnant again as a man.</v>

2983
02:26:09.010 --> 02:26:11.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2984
02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:13.720
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on there?</v>

2985
02:26:14.370 --> 02:26:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are an alien.</v>

2986
02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:19.520
<v Speaker 6>So I guess it isn't impossible to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>pregnant.</v>

2987
02:26:19.521 --> 02:26:22.280
<v Speaker 6>But if you're straight from pubertal </v>
<v Speaker 6>blockers,</v>

2988
02:26:22.281 --> 02:26:23.730
<v Speaker 6>straight onto cross sex hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2989
02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:28.100
<v Speaker 6>your body hasn't even really developed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So in that case,</v>

2990
02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:29.360
<v Speaker 6>so as a grown up,</v>

2991
02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:33.330
<v Speaker 2>it's less likely that you will become </v>
<v Speaker 2>sterile.</v>

2992
02:26:33.331 --> 02:26:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Is that the case?</v>

2993
02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:36.210
<v Speaker 6>I think it depends on how.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not an endocrinologist,</v>

2994
02:26:36.211 --> 02:26:41.211
<v Speaker 6>but I think it has to do with how long </v>
<v Speaker 6>you've been on the hormones and probably</v>

2995
02:26:41.431 --> 02:26:42.930
<v Speaker 6>how old you were when you started.</v>

2996
02:26:44.410 --> 02:26:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2997
02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:46.400
<v Speaker 6>But in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I've,</v>

2998
02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:51.520
<v Speaker 6>I've seen cases too where trans women </v>
<v Speaker 6>will breastfeed but there and the </v>

2999
02:26:52.971 --> 02:26:56.820
<v Speaker 6>doctors say this is an amazing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're taking hormone.</v>

3000
02:26:56.821 --> 02:26:59.300
<v Speaker 6>So basically those hormones are going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the baby when they're</v>

3001
02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:02.960
<v Speaker 2>breastfeeding the boy.</v>

3002
02:27:03.350 --> 02:27:08.350
<v Speaker 6>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I even feel bad saying child in </v>

3003
02:27:08.350 --> 02:27:08.350
<v Speaker 6>danger mode.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know I feel bad saying this right now,</v>

3004
02:27:08.350 --> 02:27:12.590
<v Speaker 6>but why I feel it feels like I'm placing</v>
<v Speaker 6>judgment I guess</v>

3005
02:27:12.870 --> 02:27:17.870
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be placing judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While we were talking about something </v>

3006
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:19.540
<v Speaker 2>that's publicly projected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's in the news,</v>

3007
02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:24.550
<v Speaker 2>they chose to make this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They chose to be there with their </v>

3008
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:25.660
<v Speaker 2>cameras were taking pictures of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're proclaiming this,</v>

3009
02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:27.680
<v Speaker 6>that the other side isn't being </v>
<v Speaker 6>presented to.</v>

3010
02:27:27.681 --> 02:27:32.681
<v Speaker 6>I think that's part of the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 6>the other side of the things that we're </v>

3011
02:27:32.681 --> 02:27:32.681
<v Speaker 6>saying.</v>

3012
02:27:32.681 --> 02:27:32.681
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is what.</v>

3013
02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:35.620
<v Speaker 2>So what are the other thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the other side?</v>

3014
02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:40.820
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the one side of being that is </v>

3015
02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:40.820
<v Speaker 6>progressive and if you identify as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>woman and you have a child,</v>

3016
02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:45.590
<v Speaker 6>then you should raise that child as if </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's no different from any other </v>

3017
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:46.530
<v Speaker 6>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she doesn't identify as a woman.</v>

3018
02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:48.360
<v Speaker 6>She identifies as a man or not this </v>
<v Speaker 6>person,</v>

3019
02:27:48.361 --> 02:27:49.980
<v Speaker 6>the person I was talking about who is </v>
<v Speaker 6>breastfeeding</v>

3020
02:27:50.530 --> 02:27:54.740
<v Speaker 2>male-to-female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can breastfeed male to female.</v>

3021
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3022
02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:01.100
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not his kid,</v>

3023
02:28:01.460 --> 02:28:03.200
<v Speaker 2>her kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy,</v>

3024
02:28:03.210 --> 02:28:05.390
<v Speaker 2>we worth this is why those gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>pronouns,</v>

3025
02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why we need all these separate </v>

3026
02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:11.720
<v Speaker 2>gender pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All 72 of them.</v>

3027
02:28:12.020 --> 02:28:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the other thing,</v>

3028
02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:18.400
<v Speaker 2>this male transgender male obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>still likes dudes.</v>

3029
02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:24.080
<v Speaker 2>The one we just saw because she got </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant by a guy.</v>

3030
02:28:26.450 --> 02:28:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So stay at check,</v>

3031
02:28:28.271 --> 02:28:33.271
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know as just telling you to do </v>

3032
02:28:33.861 --> 02:28:36.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3033
02:28:36.291 --> 02:28:41.291
<v Speaker 2>we should probably take into </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration the idea that maybe this </v>

3034
02:28:41.291 --> 02:28:43.160
<v Speaker 2>isn't the best thing for that child to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be subjected to hormones.</v>

3035
02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:43.990
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

3036
02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:46.800
<v Speaker 6>that's the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think whether a parent is trans or not</v>

3037
02:28:47.550 --> 02:28:49.260
<v Speaker 6>have a bearing on their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 6>parent.</v>

3038
02:28:49.310 --> 02:28:54.310
<v Speaker 2>So while that trans man was pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he continue his testosterone </v>

3039
02:28:54.310 --> 02:28:54.980
<v Speaker 2>therapy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the question,</v>

3040
02:28:55.580 --> 02:28:56.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>

3041
02:28:57.870 --> 02:29:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Hold this one says no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how will they get pregnant?</v>

3042
02:29:00.470 --> 02:29:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they backed off to have a baby on </v>

3043
02:29:05.470 --> 02:29:05.470
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

3044
02:29:05.470 --> 02:29:05.470
<v Speaker 2>they took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got off the testosterone for health</v>

3045
02:29:05.470 --> 02:29:09.410
<v Speaker 2>reasons and then got pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this particular case.</v>

3046
02:29:09.411 --> 02:29:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Health reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3047
02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:12.710
<v Speaker 2>But I thought it was natural and </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

3048
02:29:13.370 --> 02:29:15.020
<v Speaker 2>It's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing too,</v>

3049
02:29:15.021 --> 02:29:16.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it is natural,</v>

3050
02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:22.840
<v Speaker 2>why do you have to have synthetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>hormones injected into your body that </v>

3051
02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:26.321
<v Speaker 2>are not endogenous like they did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>even supposed to be in your body?</v>

3052
02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:30.320
<v Speaker 2>This is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in such a bizarro world.</v>

3053
02:29:30.530 --> 02:29:35.530
<v Speaker 2>Seeing a guy with a beard who was fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant with a hairy chest is so </v>

3054
02:29:35.530 --> 02:29:36.920
<v Speaker 2>fucking odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd assume me as a hairy chest.</v>

3055
02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:38.330
<v Speaker 6>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3056
02:29:38.331 --> 02:29:41.000
<v Speaker 6>it goes against people who say that </v>
<v Speaker 6>gender is a social construct.</v>

3057
02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:44.270
<v Speaker 6>Why do you need to take testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 6>then to meet the opposite sex?</v>

3058
02:29:44.990 --> 02:29:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the weirdest things that </v>

3059
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:49.990
<v Speaker 2>the argument that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3060
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:52.870
<v Speaker 2>about one person online where they said </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Fallon Fox,</v>

3061
02:29:53.780 --> 02:29:58.780
<v Speaker 2>they said she's always been a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said even when she was having sex </v>

3062
02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:01.460
<v Speaker 2>with a woman and got her pregnant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she said yes.</v>

3063
02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Even then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're done.</v>

3064
02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:05.900
<v Speaker 2>We're done here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were in make believe land now.</v>

3065
02:30:06.730 --> 02:30:08.150
<v Speaker 2>But what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your role?</v>

3066
02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:10.670
<v Speaker 2>You were a woman when you were having </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex with a woman.</v>

3067
02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:13.460
<v Speaker 2>So why not just stay that woman who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex with women?</v>

3068
02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:15.770
<v Speaker 6>I think it's because people want to have</v>
<v Speaker 6>sympathy.</v>

3069
02:30:15.771 --> 02:30:17.180
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it's kind of like,</v>

3070
02:30:17.181 --> 02:30:19.200
<v Speaker 6>that's a nice story to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3071
02:30:19.490 --> 02:30:20.780
<v Speaker 6>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not true,</v>

3072
02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:24.710
<v Speaker 2>but that's the problem is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not dealing with reality.</v>

3073
02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:25.340
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3074
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:27.440
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're into this weird fantasy land that</v>

3075
02:30:27.441 --> 02:30:32.441
<v Speaker 2>opens you up to massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism from people that might be </v>

3076
02:30:32.441 --> 02:30:33.200
<v Speaker 2>discriminatory instead of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3077
02:30:33.201 --> 02:30:35.750
<v Speaker 2>this is problematic and weird and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange,</v>

3078
02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:38.510
<v Speaker 2>and the whole thing is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of saying that saying,</v>

3079
02:30:38.511 --> 02:30:39.620
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's always been a woman.</v>

3080
02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Well the fuck does that mean it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>blanket statement to write,</v>

3081
02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:48.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's a wonderful thing to do to shut</v>
<v Speaker 2>down all rational critique of this </v>

3082
02:30:48.460 --> 02:30:50.690
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wonderful way to do it.</v>

3083
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:52.050
<v Speaker 2>She's always been a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3084
02:30:52.850 --> 02:30:53.390
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

3085
02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:55.940
<v Speaker 6>That's the only way they can win too </v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

3086
02:30:55.970 --> 02:30:58.310
<v Speaker 6>Because if you actually enter into a </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversation,</v>

3087
02:30:58.340 --> 02:31:00.780
<v Speaker 6>you have to actually think about your </v>
<v Speaker 6>position right now.</v>

3088
02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:02.750
<v Speaker 6>Actually think of ways to argue with the</v>
<v Speaker 6>other person.</v>

3089
02:31:02.751 --> 02:31:04.520
<v Speaker 6>And that takes effort.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3090
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:08.090
<v Speaker 6>So it's a lot easier just to simply say </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were wrong and you can't argue with</v>

3091
02:31:08.091 --> 02:31:10.460
<v Speaker 6>someone's lived experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't just take effort.</v>

3092
02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:10.680
<v Speaker 6>It's</v>

3093
02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:13.770
<v Speaker 2>also an acknowledgement of the oddity of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation.</v>

3094
02:31:13.820 --> 02:31:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Like there's you have to take into </v>
<v Speaker 2>account,</v>

3095
02:31:16.380 --> 02:31:21.380
<v Speaker 2>like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not committed to one side or </v>

3096
02:31:21.380 --> 02:31:21.480
<v Speaker 2>the and you're looking at it for what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>really is,</v>

3097
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:23.400
<v Speaker 2>you really have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

3098
02:31:23.401 --> 02:31:26.850
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like be open minded,</v>

3099
02:31:26.851 --> 02:31:31.851
<v Speaker 2>be accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be completely embracing of all oddities,</v>

3100
02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:37.610
<v Speaker 2>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different variables of the,</v>

3101
02:31:37.620 --> 02:31:41.280
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the broad spectrum of human sexuality.</v>

3102
02:31:41.550 --> 02:31:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Be Open to all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also be aware of how fucking weird </v>

3103
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:49.530
<v Speaker 2>it is because it is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

3104
02:31:49.660 --> 02:31:53.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have hate in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart to recognize that.</v>

3105
02:31:53.251 --> 02:31:55.950
<v Speaker 2>It's strange to see a guy with a beard </v>
<v Speaker 2>breastfeeding,</v>

3106
02:31:56.030 --> 02:31:56.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3107
02:31:56.970 --> 02:31:58.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or fully pregnant.</v>

3108
02:31:58.470 --> 02:32:01.590
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just is.</v>

3109
02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Then I think if you're a curious person </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

3110
02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:08.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to learn more and you want to </v>

3111
02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:10.670
<v Speaker 3>ask questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like in the climate now you can't </v>

3112
02:32:10.670 --> 02:32:10.670
<v Speaker 3>even do that even if your heart isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good place.</v>

3113
02:32:10.670 --> 02:32:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard for people to know that </v>

3114
02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:17.091
<v Speaker 2>your heart is in a good place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just part of the problem when you </v>

3115
02:32:17.091 --> 02:32:18.210
<v Speaker 2>know you don't fall in line with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted narrative.</v>

3116
02:32:18.450 --> 02:32:19.620
<v Speaker 2>People think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3117
02:32:19.650 --> 02:32:24.650
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be because you're conservative </v>

3118
02:32:24.650 --> 02:32:27.891
<v Speaker 2>or you're transphobic or homophobic or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something wrong where you're not on </v>

3119
02:32:27.891 --> 02:32:29.640
<v Speaker 2>board with the way people are thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

3120
02:32:29.730 --> 02:32:34.560
<v Speaker 2>You're stuck in the past and that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the wrong side of history.</v>

3121
02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:36.900
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just,</v>

3122
02:32:37.140 --> 02:32:41.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to fully express your feelings</v>

3123
02:32:41.941 --> 02:32:43.260
<v Speaker 2>on nuanced tissues.</v>

3124
02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:44.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3125
02:32:44.980 --> 02:32:46.140
<v Speaker 3>it takes effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3126
02:32:46.180 --> 02:32:51.180
<v Speaker 3>It takes time and you have to actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about what is your position and </v>

3127
02:32:51.180 --> 02:32:53.170
<v Speaker 3>you actually have to look at the facts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then have a nuance position.</v>

3128
02:32:53.171 --> 02:32:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't think most of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>

3129
02:32:54.611 --> 02:32:59.611
<v Speaker 3>you can't just simply go with one side </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the other across the board or simply </v>

3130
02:32:59.611 --> 02:33:04.230
<v Speaker 3>go with what sounds nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's usually a lot of other stuff </v>

3131
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:04.230
<v Speaker 3>underlying that that needs to kind of be</v>
<v Speaker 3>hashed out.</v>

3132
02:33:04.490 --> 02:33:08.810
<v Speaker 2>What is your transition into academia </v>
<v Speaker 2>from academia to the,</v>

3133
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:10.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing what you do now.</v>

3134
02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Being able to write things and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts and be free of that sort of </v>

3135
02:33:16.791 --> 02:33:17.810
<v Speaker 2>create what has that been like,</v>

3136
02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:20.360
<v Speaker 3>the process or what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What led me to do it</v>

3137
02:33:20.490 --> 02:33:22.240
<v Speaker 2>both the process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What law you will,</v>

3138
02:33:22.270 --> 02:33:23.850
<v Speaker 2>you were described what led you to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

3139
02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just finished my phd last year and </v>

3140
02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:31.240
<v Speaker 3>the last two years I realized that </v>
<v Speaker 3>academia changed a lot.</v>

3141
02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:34.540
<v Speaker 3>So when I first two years and I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>say in the four years I did my phd,</v>

3142
02:33:34.541 --> 02:33:39.541
<v Speaker 3>it changed a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I started there are certain </v>

3143
02:33:39.541 --> 02:33:42.241
<v Speaker 3>topics that were in little taboo but you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could still ask questions and I had </v>

3144
02:33:42.241 --> 02:33:43.630
<v Speaker 3>planned to stay in academia and continue</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a sex researcher.</v>

3145
02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:48.760
<v Speaker 3>I love sex research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I realized as time went on that you </v>

3146
02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:51.730
<v Speaker 3>can ask important questions anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to gender,</v>

3147
02:33:51.731 --> 02:33:55.660
<v Speaker 3>sex differences and gender dysphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at the time,</v>

3148
02:33:55.690 --> 02:34:00.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with regards to the debate on kids with </v>

3149
02:34:00.690 --> 02:34:03.721
<v Speaker 3>gender dysphoria there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single mainstream news piece in </v>

3150
02:34:03.721 --> 02:34:06.310
<v Speaker 3>left leaning outlets was saying young </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids should transition.</v>

3151
02:34:06.730 --> 02:34:11.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the best thing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you'd see all this coverage of </v>

3152
02:34:11.730 --> 02:34:15.360
<v Speaker 3>young kids who had transitioned to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite sex and their parents were </v>

3153
02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:17.110
<v Speaker 3>elated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids were doing so well.</v>

3154
02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:19.450
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from a scientific perspective,</v>

3155
02:34:19.451 --> 02:34:21.700
<v Speaker 3>that's not what the research shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I said,</v>

3156
02:34:21.701 --> 02:34:25.660
<v Speaker 3>most kids will grow their feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's best to just wait and see.</v>

3157
02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:31.080
<v Speaker 3>And so I wrote an op ed about that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time I wrote it and I sat on it </v>

3158
02:34:31.241 --> 02:34:36.241
<v Speaker 3>for probably about six months trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide whether I should really try and </v>

3159
02:34:36.241 --> 02:34:39.031
<v Speaker 3>get it published because I knew that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were gonna be really upset even </v>

3160
02:34:39.031 --> 02:34:40.060
<v Speaker 3>though I was just talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific literature.</v>

3161
02:34:40.390 --> 02:34:42.490
<v Speaker 3>And I asked my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>

3162
02:34:42.491 --> 02:34:43.690
<v Speaker 3>And they said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3163
02:34:43.691 --> 02:34:46.210
<v Speaker 3>should I wait until I have tenure to </v>
<v Speaker 3>publish this?</v>

3164
02:34:46.570 --> 02:34:48.610
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you have tenure,</v>

3165
02:34:48.611 --> 02:34:51.250
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to protect you nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3166
02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:51.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3167
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:56.910
<v Speaker 3>I was lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mentors have always been very </v>

3168
02:34:56.910 --> 02:34:58.711
<v Speaker 3>supportive of looking at facts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at the truth and don't worry </v>

3169
02:34:58.711 --> 02:34:59.680
<v Speaker 3>about whether it's politically incorrect</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not.</v>

3170
02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:02.950
<v Speaker 3>Just say you do a study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just present what you found,</v>

3171
02:35:02.951 --> 02:35:04.990
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about how people are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to take it,</v>

3172
02:35:05.410 --> 02:35:08.950
<v Speaker 3>but not everyone is like that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially even in the hard sciences now</v>

3173
02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:14.340
<v Speaker 3>if you publish the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it won't even get published now </v>

3174
02:35:14.340 --> 02:35:16.591
<v Speaker 3>if you find things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial because journals don't </v>

3175
02:35:16.591 --> 02:35:17.620
<v Speaker 3>want to have to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The institutions don't want have to deal</v>

3176
02:35:17.621 --> 02:35:22.621
<v Speaker 3>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I made the decision to publish that </v>

3177
02:35:22.621 --> 02:35:22.621
<v Speaker 3>op Ed and then from there I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3178
02:35:22.621 --> 02:35:24.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to see what this journalism </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing can take me,</v>

3179
02:35:25.420 --> 02:35:27.460
<v Speaker 3>and so now I say whatever I want.</v>

3180
02:35:27.740 --> 02:35:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Well that sort of behavior and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought process is such on their side is</v>

3181
02:35:33.081 --> 02:35:38.081
<v Speaker 4>such a weakening or the foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>critical thinking and the.</v>

3182
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:43.750
<v Speaker 4>It also comes at the same time as these </v>
<v Speaker 4>platforms like podcasting and youtube </v>

3183
02:35:44.721 --> 02:35:49.721
<v Speaker 4>that allows a person like you or like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson to now disconnect and </v>

3184
02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:54.320
<v Speaker 4>have a far larger audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although it is scary.</v>

3185
02:35:54.321 --> 02:35:57.650
<v Speaker 4>There was quite a bit of censorship </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on with some of those platforms.</v>

3186
02:35:58.010 --> 02:35:59.990
<v Speaker 4>With Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3187
02:35:59.991 --> 02:36:03.260
<v Speaker 4>Youtube blogs to they they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have the cute thing they do.</v>

3188
02:36:03.261 --> 02:36:08.261
<v Speaker 4>They demonetize things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably do you monetize this </v>

3189
02:36:08.261 --> 02:36:08.261
<v Speaker 4>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

3190
02:36:08.261 --> 02:36:10.400
<v Speaker 4>They even let you upload it after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although let us upload.</v>

3191
02:36:10.401 --> 02:36:12.560
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the demonetization,</v>

3192
02:36:12.590 --> 02:36:14.420
<v Speaker 4>especially since we're criticized </v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube,</v>

3193
02:36:14.900 --> 02:36:19.900
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you criticize you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like one of the best ways to get </v>

3194
02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:20.630
<v Speaker 4>demonetized from one of their videos is </v>
<v Speaker 4>to criticize them.</v>

3195
02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:23.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking squirrely.</v>

3196
02:36:23.930 --> 02:36:26.660
<v Speaker 3>It's also make people like if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>subscribed,</v>

3197
02:36:26.750 --> 02:36:28.880
<v Speaker 3>they don't tell people when videos get </v>
<v Speaker 3>posted,</v>

3198
02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:30.170
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3199
02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:33.390
<v Speaker 4>They do some weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't pay attention,</v>

3200
02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:38.430
<v Speaker 4>just upload it and keep moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have friends who were there.</v>

3201
02:36:38.431 --> 02:36:43.431
<v Speaker 4>It's their main source of income was </v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube and videos and advertising for </v>

3202
02:36:45.751 --> 02:36:50.751
<v Speaker 4>them was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people that were making a lot of </v>

3203
02:36:50.751 --> 02:36:53.901
<v Speaker 4>money and then all sudden that money was</v>
<v Speaker 4>cut down to 30 percent of what it used </v>

3204
02:36:53.901 --> 02:36:55.320
<v Speaker 4>to be and with no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no clear guidelines.</v>

3205
02:36:55.350 --> 02:37:00.350
<v Speaker 4>The problem with the guidelines is even </v>
<v Speaker 4>if like say if we have a video and they </v>

3206
02:37:00.350 --> 02:37:00.350
<v Speaker 4>just decide that they don't like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>video,</v>

3207
02:37:00.510 --> 02:37:03.900
<v Speaker 4>you can't really protest it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can protest it and.</v>

3208
02:37:03.901 --> 02:37:08.901
<v Speaker 4>But then they review it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>uphold their initial ruling and they </v>

3209
02:37:08.901 --> 02:37:09.840
<v Speaker 4>don't tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no.</v>

3210
02:37:09.870 --> 02:37:10.680
<v Speaker 4>They don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3211
02:37:10.681 --> 02:37:15.681
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you called someone a queer or you did </v>

3212
02:37:15.681 --> 02:37:15.800
<v Speaker 4>this or no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3213
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:17.180
<v Speaker 2>They just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3214
02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:19.160
<v Speaker 2>this is how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's subjective.</v>

3215
02:37:19.210 --> 02:37:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's a problem with being a </v>

3216
02:37:24.210 --> 02:37:26.921
<v Speaker 2>monopoly and they're not a monopoly in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's not other video </v>

3217
02:37:26.921 --> 02:37:30.341
<v Speaker 2>platforms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are certainly the largest by </v>

3218
02:37:30.341 --> 02:37:31.960
<v Speaker 2>far in terms of like user uploaded video</v>
<v Speaker 2>platforms.</v>

3219
02:37:31.961 --> 02:37:34.970
<v Speaker 2>There's not even a close second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kinda weird.</v>

3220
02:37:35.090 --> 02:37:36.920
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that they've done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3221
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing remotely like it.</v>

3222
02:37:40.041 --> 02:37:45.041
<v Speaker 2>I know a bunch of people thought about </v>
<v Speaker 2>building one and I've been contacted by </v>

3223
02:37:45.041 --> 02:37:47.740
<v Speaker 2>people that are starting up a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want me to join that and like,</v>

3224
02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:50.150
<v Speaker 2>good luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>

3225
02:37:50.151 --> 02:37:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube is so far ahead.</v>

3226
02:37:52.270 --> 02:37:53.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you catch up to them?</v>

3227
02:37:54.210 --> 02:37:56.900
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think they're evil by any </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretch of the imagination.</v>

3228
02:37:57.230 --> 02:38:02.230
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with someone about </v>

3229
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.960
<v Speaker 2>it pretty recently where she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>describing that they're really,</v>

3230
02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:08.200
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're using crude tools and this is </v>

3231
02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:12.461
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem with what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is being deemed as censorship is </v>

3232
02:38:13.521 --> 02:38:18.521
<v Speaker 2>really they're trying to root out hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech and they're doing so with crude </v>

3233
02:38:18.521 --> 02:38:22.460
<v Speaker 2>tools that will eventually through ai </v>
<v Speaker 2>get better and better.</v>

3234
02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Is that it though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or is it that they're trying to shut </v>

3235
02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:27.540
<v Speaker 3>down any sort of dissenting points of </v>
<v Speaker 3>view?</v>

3236
02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3237
02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:32.810
<v Speaker 2>I think they definitely lean hard left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They definitely do.</v>

3238
02:38:32.811 --> 02:38:34.670
<v Speaker 2>So does google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lean hard left.</v>

3239
02:38:34.671 --> 02:38:38.360
<v Speaker 2>That was proven by the paper and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3240
02:38:38.390 --> 02:38:41.150
<v Speaker 2>how it was received,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the memo</v>

3241
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:42.190
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

3242
02:38:42.191 --> 02:38:47.191
<v Speaker 3>because I was doing youtube for a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I stopped just because I </v>

3243
02:38:47.191 --> 02:38:47.740
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately didn't have time because </v>
<v Speaker 3>my writing is like my number one thing.</v>

3244
02:38:47.741 --> 02:38:50.770
<v Speaker 3>But I had one video that minute it went </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3245
02:38:50.860 --> 02:38:53.160
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about science on gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>dysphoria.</v>

3246
02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:55.600
<v Speaker 3>Got Demonetized literally like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

3247
02:38:56.110 --> 02:38:56.920
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3248
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:58.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what my intentions are.</v>

3249
02:38:58.841 --> 02:39:01.120
<v Speaker 3>And it's really unsettling when that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

3250
02:39:01.420 --> 02:39:06.420
<v Speaker 2>It will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be because you're not doing </v>

3251
02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:09.040
<v Speaker 2>anything hateful know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they're doing is they're trying</v>

3252
02:39:09.041 --> 02:39:14.041
<v Speaker 2>to make subjects much less attractive to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss [inaudible] and who's doing it.</v>

3253
02:39:16.390 --> 02:39:21.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean is it doing it through crude </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools or someone looking at it and </v>

3254
02:39:21.390 --> 02:39:25.831
<v Speaker 2>flagging it and deciding that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not something they want to be involved </v>

3255
02:39:25.831 --> 02:39:29.641
<v Speaker 2>with advertising and in their defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this got started off by people </v>

3256
02:39:30.461 --> 02:39:35.461
<v Speaker 2>that were really doing fucked up things </v>
<v Speaker 2>on youtube and they had to respond and </v>

3257
02:39:35.461 --> 02:39:40.381
<v Speaker 2>they had to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminate that stuff in their platform </v>

3258
02:39:40.381 --> 02:39:43.021
<v Speaker 2>and I think once you start censoring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tendency is to continue to expand.</v>

3259
02:39:44.350 --> 02:39:46.570
<v Speaker 2>This tendency is not to back off of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>center ship.</v>

3260
02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just gonna allow Holocaust deniers</v>

3261
02:39:49.451 --> 02:39:54.451
<v Speaker 2>and racists and make your videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Youtube is a wild west baby aren't </v>

3262
02:39:54.451 --> 02:39:59.110
<v Speaker 2>going to do that because they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertisers and there's a significant </v>

3263
02:39:59.110 --> 02:39:59.110
<v Speaker 2>amount of revenue that they get from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3264
02:39:59.110 --> 02:40:00.830
<v Speaker 3>but they don't actually end the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation though.</v>

3265
02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:02.760
<v Speaker 3>People just get upset and they take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

3266
02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:07.820
<v Speaker 3>They might not be on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that people are still talking about </v>

3267
02:40:07.820 --> 02:40:07.820
<v Speaker 3>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not youtube</v>

3268
02:40:07.820 --> 02:40:09.650
<v Speaker 2>as long as they're not on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't give a shit like,</v>

3269
02:40:09.651 --> 02:40:10.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not on youtube.</v>

3270
02:40:10.970 --> 02:40:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with that conversation on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vimeo or wherever you're going to go.</v>

3271
02:40:17.410 --> 02:40:18.600
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3272
02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:20.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's odd.</v>

3273
02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:23.610
<v Speaker 2>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3274
02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that there's these disco.</v>

3275
02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I love the law part of me even likes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that things are being censored.</v>

3276
02:40:30.330 --> 02:40:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it fascinating.</v>

3277
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the argument is fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think first of all,</v>

3278
02:40:38.791 --> 02:40:43.791
<v Speaker 2>I think censorship clearly causes that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you push against something,</v>

3279
02:40:44.371 --> 02:40:49.371
<v Speaker 2>there's a natural reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That reaction is to bolster your </v>

3280
02:40:49.371 --> 02:40:50.010
<v Speaker 2>defenses and fire back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3281
02:40:50.011 --> 02:40:55.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's certainly some of that </v>

3282
02:40:55.011 --> 02:40:57.120
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really quiet ideas entirely,</v>

3283
02:40:57.390 --> 02:41:02.390
<v Speaker 2>but you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do expose your intentions and you </v>

3284
02:41:02.461 --> 02:41:07.461
<v Speaker 2>expose these blind spots that are what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been discussing all day.</v>

3285
02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:12.740
<v Speaker 2>There's this political ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blind spots that people have these </v>

3286
02:41:12.751 --> 02:41:16.050
<v Speaker 2>ideological holes that they have and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way they look at things.</v>

3287
02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:22.480
<v Speaker 3>Question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to solve the problem or are </v>

3288
02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:25.601
<v Speaker 3>you trying to just be successful as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>business if you want to solve the </v>

3289
02:41:25.601 --> 02:41:29.501
<v Speaker 3>problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think suppressing speech and </v>

3290
02:41:29.501 --> 02:41:32.800
<v Speaker 3>shutting down people who are genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 3>just trying to ask questions and have </v>

3291
02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:36.131
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's going to solve </v>

3292
02:41:36.131 --> 02:41:36.131
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3293
02:41:36.131 --> 02:41:36.131
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're trying to solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>any problems.</v>

3294
02:41:36.131 --> 02:41:41.121
<v Speaker 2>I think they're trying to make a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money and they're also very liberal and </v>

3295
02:41:41.121 --> 02:41:43.780
<v Speaker 2>they think the right thing to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppress certain ideology.</v>

3296
02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:46.480
<v Speaker 2>They deemed harmful or hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3297
02:41:46.490 --> 02:41:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with a woman as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube exec.</v>

3298
02:41:48.450 --> 02:41:51.600
<v Speaker 2>She was telling me that Douglas Murray </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Sam Harris,</v>

3299
02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:55.370
<v Speaker 2>they there this podcast that they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>online and uh,</v>

3300
02:41:56.220 --> 02:42:01.220
<v Speaker 2>some guy put it up in his playlist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he got a community guideline strike for </v>

3301
02:42:01.891 --> 02:42:04.350
<v Speaker 2>having it in this playlist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

3302
02:42:04.351 --> 02:42:05.550
<v Speaker 2>how is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

3303
02:42:05.551 --> 02:42:06.960
<v Speaker 2>it's hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3304
02:42:06.961 --> 02:42:09.540
<v Speaker 2>it's his speech speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that podcast.</v>

3305
02:42:09.850 --> 02:42:12.180
<v Speaker 2>And not only is it not hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't watch it.</v>

3306
02:42:12.510 --> 02:42:15.450
<v Speaker 2>She didn't listen to it like she had no </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea what the fuck it was,</v>

3307
02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:20.310
<v Speaker 2>but she just like confidently said it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me like I was going to just shut up.</v>

3308
02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Like you're out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know what you're talking </v>

3309
02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:25.900
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is hilarious,</v>

3310
02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:27.390
<v Speaker 2>but it was a person out of pretty high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level over there.</v>

3311
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:29.790
<v Speaker 2>So it's interesting to see that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3312
02:42:29.791 --> 02:42:33.570
<v Speaker 2>well this is the kind of a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical thinking that we're discussing.</v>

3313
02:42:33.870 --> 02:42:38.870
<v Speaker 2>This is the kind of blind spot that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're discussing that you feel like you </v>

3314
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:42.750
<v Speaker 2>could just say that instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate that this is to intellectuals</v>

3315
02:42:42.751 --> 02:42:46.350
<v Speaker 2>discussing something that's very complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is,</v>

3316
02:42:46.650 --> 02:42:51.650
<v Speaker 2>it was about immigration and about Islam</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are two things that people </v>

3317
02:42:51.901 --> 02:42:53.280
<v Speaker 2>don't want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3318
02:42:53.281 --> 02:42:56.400
<v Speaker 2>they just like go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those two things are off limits.</v>

3319
02:42:56.401 --> 02:42:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're a pro Islam or pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration,</v>

3320
02:42:59.730 --> 02:43:02.490
<v Speaker 2>you better shut the fuck up or we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to demonetize you and that,</v>

3321
02:43:02.910 --> 02:43:06.930
<v Speaker 2>that kind of censorship is fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me because it's not effective.</v>

3322
02:43:07.350 --> 02:43:08.460
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

3323
02:43:08.610 --> 02:43:10.350
<v Speaker 2>it just makes people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3324
02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:12.380
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it,</v>

3325
02:43:12.430 --> 02:43:17.430
<v Speaker 2>it makes the people on the youtube side </v>
<v Speaker 2>get defensive and it makes them double </v>

3326
02:43:17.621 --> 02:43:19.480
<v Speaker 2>down and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're seeing,</v>

3327
02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:22.870
<v Speaker 2>you see that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3328
02:43:22.871 --> 02:43:25.750
<v Speaker 2>you see it with many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3329
02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:29.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird time for ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3330
02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:32.350
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about being part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Idw,</v>

3331
02:43:34.090 --> 02:43:35.890
<v Speaker 2>the international dark web?</v>

<v Speaker 2>that group.</v>

3334
02:43:44.110 --> 02:43:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like being in any groups.</v>

3335
02:43:47.970 --> 02:43:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Would a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Groucho Marx once a,</v>

3336
02:43:50.410 --> 02:43:55.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3337
02:43:55.410 --> 02:43:57.121
<v Speaker 2>that would have me look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy to be able to have a </v>

3338
02:43:58.031 --> 02:44:02.080
<v Speaker 2>platform where I can have people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on or any of those people,</v>

3339

<v Speaker 2>Shapiro says.</v>

02:44:38.460 --> 02:44:39.670
<v Speaker 2>You saw that thing that happened with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that actor.</v>

3356
02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:56.890
<v Speaker 2>He's a really nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3357
02:44:56.980 --> 02:44:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I liked them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This internet,</v>

3358
02:45:00.490 --> 02:45:02.110
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dark web thing,</v>

3359
02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:07.880
<v Speaker 2>that's all eric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric Weinstein's idea was to name this </v>

3360
02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:08.380
<v Speaker 2>and label.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves all that Shit.</v>

3361
02:45:08.381 --> 02:45:10.840
<v Speaker 2>He loves all that cloak and dagger </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3362
02:45:10.870 --> 02:45:15.870
<v Speaker 2>He gets kicked out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he makes some very good points and </v>

3363
02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:15.870
<v Speaker 2>he's a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant guy.</v>

3364
02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:20.730
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that we're all joined </v>

3365
02:45:20.730 --> 02:45:20.730
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we all went,</v>

3366
02:45:20.730 --> 02:45:22.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a big dinner together,</v>

3367
02:45:22.091 --> 02:45:26.200
<v Speaker 2>like a bunch of dorks and we all got </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and were like this little club.</v>

3368
02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:31.720
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of fun and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it again and we're bringing more </v>

3369
02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:32.620
<v Speaker 2>people into bringing more people into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dark web.</v>

3370
02:45:34.750 --> 02:45:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Some people are resentful that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a part of the dark web and I'll tell</v>

3371
02:45:38.291 --> 02:45:43.291
<v Speaker 2>you some names afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people like contacted Barry </v>

3372
02:45:43.291 --> 02:45:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Weiss and were upset that they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>included in the dark web.</v>

3373
02:45:46.260 --> 02:45:48.700
<v Speaker 2>I loved berries column.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting.</v>

3374
02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:52.080
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole but the label of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>

3375
02:45:52.330 --> 02:45:54.760
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts this conversation,</v>

3376
02:45:54.761 --> 02:45:57.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why is it even necessary to have this</v>

3377
02:45:57.791 --> 02:45:59.770
<v Speaker 2>dark web and what's the function of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark web?</v>

3378
02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:04.820
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the dark web doing really like </v>

3379
02:46:04.820 --> 02:46:04.820
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3380
02:46:04.820 --> 02:46:09.030
<v Speaker 2>and there was an article today where </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone was calling it problematic and </v>

3381
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 2>saying that it's mostly right people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is</v>

3382
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:14.840
<v Speaker 4>absolutely not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris very left Bret Weinstein,</v>

3383
02:46:14.841 --> 02:46:17.540
<v Speaker 4>fiercely progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eric very left.</v>

3384
02:46:18.530 --> 02:46:23.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm way more left than I am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right to the very few right wing ideas </v>

3385
02:46:24.921 --> 02:46:27.110
<v Speaker 4>that I hold onto the very small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was very.</v>

3386
02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:31.550
<v Speaker 4>The vast majority of my positions on </v>
<v Speaker 4>things side with,</v>

3387
02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:34.550
<v Speaker 4>with people on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vast majority,</v>

3388
02:46:34.990 --> 02:46:37.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm Ben Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was very right,</v>

3389
02:46:37.820 --> 02:46:39.360
<v Speaker 4>but he's reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3390
02:46:39.370 --> 02:46:42.020
<v Speaker 4>and he's also a young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3391
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:46.250
<v Speaker 4>conservative religious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3392
02:46:46.290 --> 02:46:49.910
<v Speaker 4>but he's also extremely intelligent and </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonable.</v>

3393
02:46:50.260 --> 02:46:55.260
<v Speaker 4>Talked to him and he has himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>disavowed some of the things that he </v>

3394
02:46:57.891 --> 02:47:01.340
<v Speaker 4>said and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's himself criticized his own words.</v>

3395
02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:06.640
<v Speaker 4>He wrote a whole column.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's a list of all the stupid things </v>

3396
02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:07.460
<v Speaker 4>I've ever said online because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

3397
02:47:07.461 --> 02:47:09.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a very aware guy,</v>

3398
02:47:09.170 --> 02:47:11.990
<v Speaker 4>very self aware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

3399
02:47:12.110 --> 02:47:17.110
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's important to have </v>

3400
02:47:17.110 --> 02:47:20.651
<v Speaker 4>discussions and I think it's important </v>
<v Speaker 4>that when people feel like those </v>

3401
02:47:20.651 --> 02:47:23.270
<v Speaker 4>discussions are being suppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they talk about that.</v>

3402
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:25.430
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

3403
02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:27.260
<v Speaker 4>And I think you're a part of that as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

3404
02:47:27.350 --> 02:47:28.430
<v Speaker 2>I was in the column.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3405
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:33.550
<v Speaker 2>we could use you in the dark web,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman of color that you guys aren't </v>

3406
02:47:34.011 --> 02:47:37.820
<v Speaker 2>all racist much white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

3407
02:47:37.821 --> 02:47:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I took a 23 and me and I'm hoping I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got some black and Korean.</v>

3408
02:47:42.380 --> 02:47:47.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping for you to give me some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me more than five percent.</v>

3409
02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:52.750
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you have to have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you only have to have like one </v>

3410
02:47:52.750 --> 02:47:55.100
<v Speaker 2>slash 16th native American to catch a </v>
<v Speaker 2>check and some places.</v>

3411
02:47:55.580 --> 02:47:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what it is in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something like that.</v>

3412
02:47:58.080 --> 02:47:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3413
02:47:59.451 --> 02:48:04.451
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go fishing in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Canada and you're a first nation,</v>

3414
02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:10.000
<v Speaker 2>if you have an a what the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could bring as many fish as you </v>

3415
02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:14.051
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like if you like I was fishing in </v>

3416
02:48:14.051 --> 02:48:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Canada in a place where I could only get</v>
<v Speaker 2>one Walleye a day.</v>

3417
02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:20.320
<v Speaker 2>You only get one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was some dude next to me was </v>

3418
02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:20.320
<v Speaker 2>first nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Homeboy was just pulling them in.</v>

3419
02:48:20.430 --> 02:48:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Dr Wright and sticking them in a bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clean it up.</v>

3420
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:25.280
<v Speaker 2>So you better be hoping on that test </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

3421
02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:26.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping I'm praying.</v>

3422
02:48:27.380 --> 02:48:28.940
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be discriminated against.</v>

3423
02:48:31.220 --> 02:48:33.860
<v Speaker 2>One 16th is one great great </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandparents.</v>

3424
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all you need.</v>

3425
02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:40.160
<v Speaker 2>That's all I need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody come on chimp in your family </v>

3426
02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:40.160
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

3427
02:48:40.210 --> 02:48:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Somebody fucked a champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I think.</v>

3428
02:48:41.991 --> 02:48:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I think if people evolved from lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>hominids,</v>

3429
02:48:44.930 --> 02:48:46.400
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened.</v>

3430
02:48:46.430 --> 02:48:48.830
<v Speaker 2>That if you believe all that evolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense,</v>

3431
02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:50.600
<v Speaker 2>nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one believes that anymore.</v>

3432
02:48:50.601 --> 02:48:51.490
<v Speaker 2>It's pseudoscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3433
02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:56.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of pseudo science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that somewhere in my </v>

3434
02:48:56.500 --> 02:49:00.700
<v Speaker 2>ancestry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody went back in for one more shot </v>

3435
02:49:00.700 --> 02:49:03.730
<v Speaker 2>chimp when they probably shouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody said I was going to know.</v>

3436
02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:07.010
<v Speaker 2>They probably got drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No judgment,</v>

3437
02:49:07.050 --> 02:49:10.560
<v Speaker 2>no judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And clearly evolution is not.</v>

3438
02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:14.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fucking straight flat plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3439
02:49:15.090 --> 02:49:16.100
<v Speaker 2>It varies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3440
02:49:17.450 --> 02:49:19.160
<v Speaker 6>You can't deny the influence of it,</v>

3441
02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:21.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some people do.</v>

3442
02:49:21.370 --> 02:49:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3443
02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about all this dark </v>

3444
02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:29.440
<v Speaker 2>web stuff?</v>

3445
02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:30.570
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3446
02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:32.490
<v Speaker 6>I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3447
02:49:32.491 --> 02:49:37.491
<v Speaker 6>the fact that the New York Times covered</v>
<v Speaker 6>it give me a sense of relief because </v>

3448
02:49:37.491 --> 02:49:40.860
<v Speaker 6>sometimes the things I write,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't feel like the things I write are</v>

3449
02:49:40.861 --> 02:49:44.850
<v Speaker 6>that controversial or that offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the response I get sometimes,</v>

3450
02:49:44.851 --> 02:49:45.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm surprised</v>

3451
02:49:46.510 --> 02:49:48.670
<v Speaker 2>you said this as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a journalist,</v>

3452
02:49:48.671 --> 02:49:51.040
<v Speaker 2>as a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as intellectual,</v>

3453
02:49:51.041 --> 02:49:53.100
<v Speaker 2>as a person who actually understands </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking.</v>

3454
02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:55.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially someone who has studied,</v>

3455
02:49:55.041 --> 02:49:58.370
<v Speaker 6>especially these certain topics within </v>
<v Speaker 6>research,</v>

3456
02:49:58.670 --> 02:50:03.670
<v Speaker 6>I think I know what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so when people get really mad it </v>

3457
02:50:03.670 --> 02:50:05.510
<v Speaker 6>makes you question where are we going?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the fact that,</v>

3458
02:50:05.630 --> 02:50:10.630
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Barry covered this and I'm that the </v>

3459
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.630
<v Speaker 6>response was so positive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3460
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:11.270
<v Speaker 6>people got mad too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3461
02:50:11.340 --> 02:50:13.450
<v Speaker 6>people got mad at her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's taken a lot of heat.</v>

3462
02:50:13.460 --> 02:50:14.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3463
02:50:14.151 --> 02:50:15.860
<v Speaker 6>definitely a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3464
02:50:16.310 --> 02:50:19.900
<v Speaker 6>But I feel a little bit more optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it,</v>

3465
02:50:20.060 --> 02:50:24.140
<v Speaker 6>it tells me that people get it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we have conversations like this and</v>

3466
02:50:24.141 --> 02:50:28.430
<v Speaker 6>people don't think that we're bigoted or</v>
<v Speaker 6>that were coming from.</v>

3467
02:50:28.490 --> 02:50:30.790
<v Speaker 6>We have a nefarious agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3468
02:50:31.100 --> 02:50:36.100
<v Speaker 6>We just want to have conversations and </v>
<v Speaker 6>talk about things that aren't being </v>

3469
02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:36.100
<v Speaker 6>discussed in the mainstream.</v>

3470
02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where censorship becomes very </v>

3471
02:50:41.940 --> 02:50:44.221
<v Speaker 2>dangerous if you do silence a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these conversations and right now </v>

3472
02:50:44.221 --> 02:50:45.520
<v Speaker 2>they're not being silenced even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3473
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:48.340
<v Speaker 2>they're being democratized to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>extent.</v>

3474
02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:54.280
<v Speaker 2>That is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the conversation still exists and as</v>

3475
02:50:54.281 --> 02:50:59.281
<v Speaker 2>long as they do still existent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority exist in audio form </v>

3476
02:50:59.651 --> 02:51:04.651
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And podcasting is the vast majority of </v>

3477
02:51:04.651 --> 02:51:08.311
<v Speaker 2>the volume of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>downloading these kinds of </v>

3478
02:51:08.311 --> 02:51:11.131
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an incredibly unique time </v>

3479
02:51:11.231 --> 02:51:14.620
<v Speaker 2>for the distribution of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's ever any ever been</v>

3480
02:51:14.621 --> 02:51:17.680
<v Speaker 2>anything remotely like this in human </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

3481
02:51:18.190 --> 02:51:22.630
<v Speaker 2>There's never been a time where someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>like me can just do something,</v>

3482
02:51:22.930 --> 02:51:27.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just on a laptop with a Webcam and then </v>

3483
02:51:27.930 --> 02:51:30.860
<v Speaker 2>nine years later it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3484
02:51:30.910 --> 02:51:34.840
<v Speaker 2>we're just fucking nuts and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even.</v>

3485
02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:40.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't even think about it that </v>

3486
02:51:40.480 --> 02:51:40.720
<v Speaker 2>much honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just do it.</v>

3487
02:51:40.810 --> 02:51:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was excited to talk to you today.</v>

3488
02:51:42.711 --> 02:51:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I was looking forward to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was excited to too.</v>

3489
02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:51.840
<v Speaker 2>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give it much consideration as </v>

3490
02:51:51.850 --> 02:51:54.460
<v Speaker 2>far as the impact because I think as </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as you do that,</v>

3491
02:51:54.610 --> 02:51:59.050
<v Speaker 2>it'll slip through your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you think too much about it.</v>

3492
02:51:59.260 --> 02:52:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3493
02:52:00.131 --> 02:52:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I definitely wouldn't say half the Shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've already said today.</v>

3494
02:52:02.920 --> 02:52:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3495
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:06.040
<v Speaker 2>that's appeal</v>

3496
02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:08.920
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The appeal is that you and I,</v>

3497
02:52:09.010 --> 02:52:11.830
<v Speaker 4>I really believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was no microphone,</v>

3498
02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:16.920
<v Speaker 4>we probably would never have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation because it's too difficult </v>

3499
02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:17.200
<v Speaker 4>to sit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be too weird like you and I was</v>

3500
02:52:17.201 --> 02:52:18.910
<v Speaker 4>just going to sit down and just talk to </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

3501
02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:22.900
<v Speaker 4>Was came in and met you and we sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would be weird,</v>

3502
02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:28.740
<v Speaker 4>like you almost have to have this where </v>
<v Speaker 4>people could see it to do it because </v>

3503
02:52:28.740 --> 02:52:30.960
<v Speaker 4>otherwise you'd check your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I check my phone,</v>

3504
02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:32.500
<v Speaker 4>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to the bathroom.</v>

3505
02:52:32.501 --> 02:52:34.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like it would be a normal thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

3506
02:52:34.690 --> 02:52:39.690
<v Speaker 4>but by putting these headphones on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>by having this microphone in front of </v>

3507
02:52:39.690 --> 02:52:43.231
<v Speaker 4>our face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we lock in and know that how many </v>

3508
02:52:43.231 --> 02:52:43.231
<v Speaker 4>million people are going to be watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck load.</v>

3509
02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:48.600
<v Speaker 4>It's more every week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's growing in a weird way like a </v>

3510
02:52:48.600 --> 02:52:49.090
<v Speaker 4>fucking mold.</v>

3511
02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:50.500
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strange,</v>

3512
02:52:50.710 --> 02:52:55.710
<v Speaker 4>but this is the only way we would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>this conversation and it's made me far </v>

3513
02:52:55.710 --> 02:53:00.091
<v Speaker 4>better at talking to people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding conversations and </v>

3514
02:53:00.091 --> 02:53:03.751
<v Speaker 4>understanding what they are and also </v>
<v Speaker 4>examining my own speech patterns and the</v>

3515
02:53:03.911 --> 02:53:06.610
<v Speaker 4>way I communicate and getting better at </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3516
02:53:06.700 --> 02:53:10.000
<v Speaker 4>I like how you said you started it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you wanted to talk to people.</v>

3517
02:53:10.090 --> 02:53:15.090
<v Speaker 4>Like I think that's what it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should just be that interest in </v>

3518
02:53:15.090 --> 02:53:15.290
<v Speaker 4>having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3519
02:53:15.350 --> 02:53:18.100
<v Speaker 4>I used to like doing radio when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guest,</v>

3520
02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:20.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uncertain radio shows,</v>

3521
02:53:20.651 --> 02:53:21.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you do.</v>

3522
02:53:21.701 --> 02:53:26.530
<v Speaker 4>Like if I was going to go to phoenix or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

3523
02:53:27.030 --> 02:53:32.030
<v Speaker 4>I would go do stand up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have to promote it on the radio </v>

3524
02:53:32.030 --> 02:53:35.131
<v Speaker 4>and the old days and I would get there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I would get there early and you </v>

3525
02:53:35.131 --> 02:53:36.190
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke a joint beforehand,</v>

3526
02:53:36.250 --> 02:53:41.250
<v Speaker 4>drink a cup of coffee and get in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>start talking shit and having a good </v>

3527
02:53:41.250 --> 02:53:41.250
<v Speaker 4>time and laughing and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3528
02:53:41.250 --> 02:53:42.950
<v Speaker 4>that'd be fun to have a radio show man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3529
02:53:42.970 --> 02:53:45.010
<v Speaker 4>just go in there and just talk and have </v>
<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>

3530
02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:48.040
<v Speaker 4>But the problem was to me it was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>always the censorship.</v>

3531
02:53:48.041 --> 02:53:48.700
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3532
02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:54.000
<v Speaker 4>you got to censor yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I started doing the open anthony </v>

3533
02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:57.010
<v Speaker 4>show and opie and anthony had a show on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know as first if it was Xm,</v>

3534
02:53:57.011 --> 02:54:00.580
<v Speaker 4>then it became serious and and then they</v>
<v Speaker 4>split up,</v>

3535
02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:05.410
<v Speaker 4>but when I would do that it was opie and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony and Jim Norton and I was like,</v>

3536
02:54:05.500 --> 02:54:09.850
<v Speaker 4>this is the best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is so fun and the way they did it,</v>

3537
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:15.150
<v Speaker 4>credit to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they did it was different than </v>

3538
02:54:15.150 --> 02:54:17.680
<v Speaker 4>any radio show at ever been a part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was no structure at all.</v>

3539
02:54:17.681 --> 02:54:22.681
<v Speaker 4>They would just bring comics in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would just be me and Ari should fear </v>

3540
02:54:22.681 --> 02:54:24.100
<v Speaker 4>and bill burr and Joey Diaz and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys.</v>

3541
02:54:24.310 --> 02:54:26.980
<v Speaker 4>They would just come in and hang out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk shit.</v>

3542
02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:29.290
<v Speaker 4>There was no structure at all.</v>

3543
02:54:29.590 --> 02:54:32.470
<v Speaker 4>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony is such a smart and funny guide.</v>

3544
02:54:32.490 --> 02:54:37.490
<v Speaker 4>Opie would sort of run the thing and and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim was there and they would just let </v>

3545
02:54:37.490 --> 02:54:39.010
<v Speaker 4>everybody talk and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this would be amazing.</v>

3546
02:54:39.400 --> 02:54:44.400
<v Speaker 4>You could just come in and hang out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>have fun and then I'm done.</v>

3547
02:54:45.731 --> 02:54:50.731
<v Speaker 4>I started doing a podcast after that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was because of that and then </v>

3548
02:54:50.731 --> 02:54:52.360
<v Speaker 4>anthony did a thing called live from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>compound.</v>

3549
02:54:52.361 --> 02:54:55.720
<v Speaker 4>He calls his house the compound and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>did like this thing in his basement.</v>

3550
02:54:55.721 --> 02:55:00.721
<v Speaker 4>We had a green screen and he did his own</v>
<v Speaker 4>show and he did Karaoke while he's </v>

3551
02:55:00.721 --> 02:55:01.360
<v Speaker 4>holding a machine gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking crazy.</v>

3552
02:55:01.630 --> 02:55:05.750
<v Speaker 4>Anthony is like a legit gun nut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he had a studio that he built in his</v>

3553
02:55:05.751 --> 02:55:09.110
<v Speaker 4>basement with like legitimate equipment </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I went,</v>

3554
02:55:09.170 --> 02:55:12.230
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that inspired me and that,</v>

3555
02:55:12.330 --> 02:55:15.800
<v Speaker 4>that is literally what started me off to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do a podcast.</v>

3556
02:55:15.801 --> 02:55:19.420
<v Speaker 4>The scene that he had set this up in his</v>
<v Speaker 4>basement and I was like,</v>

3557
02:55:19.460 --> 02:55:21.830
<v Speaker 4>don't just fucking just start doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3558
02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3559
02:55:24.550 --> 02:55:27.010
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel the wrong speed.</v>

3560
02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:30.910
<v Speaker 6>The fact that I can see people being </v>
<v Speaker 6>mommed and I can think,</v>

3561
02:55:30.940 --> 02:55:35.940
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder what they're like and I can </v>

3562
02:55:35.940 --> 02:55:36.430
<v Speaker 6>just ask them like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that what it's like for you?</v>

3563
02:55:36.431 --> 02:55:38.470
<v Speaker 6>You see someone you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just want to talk to them?</v>

3564
02:55:38.690 --> 02:55:40.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3565
02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:44.690
<v Speaker 4>Especially someone in a controversial </v>
<v Speaker 4>position like Jordan,</v>

3566
02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:49.720
<v Speaker 4>like when I first met Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like when he was just starting to </v>

3567
02:55:50.390 --> 02:55:53.540
<v Speaker 4>get some attention online and I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk to them,</v>

3568
02:55:53.541 --> 02:55:54.020
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3569
02:55:54.021 --> 02:55:57.650
<v Speaker 4>what is going on here and why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is everybody be up so upset at you?</v>

3570
02:55:57.651 --> 02:56:02.651
<v Speaker 4>And I've never met anyone in in all my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life who is so purposely misrepresented </v>

3571
02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:06.940
<v Speaker 4>by other people than Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3572
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:08.340
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen it before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3573
02:56:08.390 --> 02:56:13.390
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing to see intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>articulate people clearly lying about </v>

3574
02:56:15.441 --> 02:56:20.441
<v Speaker 4>his positions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about how and not and not even </v>

3575
02:56:20.441 --> 02:56:24.521
<v Speaker 4>understanding that by doing that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>strengthening him and they're </v>

3576
02:56:24.521 --> 02:56:28.721
<v Speaker 4>strengthening their.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to lie to the point </v>

3577
02:56:28.721 --> 02:56:30.800
<v Speaker 4>where people are going to really</v>

3578
02:56:31.930 --> 02:56:36.930
<v Speaker 4>think that your position is correct and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these things that Jordan has said </v>

3579
02:56:37.150 --> 02:56:42.150
<v Speaker 4>that somehow or another you misheard </v>
<v Speaker 4>them or the whole world ms dot heard </v>

3580
02:56:42.150 --> 02:56:42.150
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3581
02:56:42.150 --> 02:56:47.070
<v Speaker 4>you're misrepresenting his positions and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just makes all the people that are </v>

3582
02:56:47.441 --> 02:56:50.170
<v Speaker 4>siding with him realize he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3583
02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:55.320
<v Speaker 4>It strengthened Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They literally don't understand that </v>

3584
02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:57.640
<v Speaker 4>they are his publicists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are helping.</v>

3585
02:56:57.860 --> 02:57:01.600
<v Speaker 4>They are proving his point and to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>point where he's selling out.</v>

3586
02:57:02.140 --> 02:57:07.140
<v Speaker 4>He sold out gigantic 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>seat theaters.</v>

3587
02:57:07.691 --> 02:57:10.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's selling them out all over the world</v>

3588
02:57:10.210 --> 02:57:12.670
<v Speaker 4>just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

3589
02:57:12.671 --> 02:57:16.570
<v Speaker 4>He's making millions of dollars because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them being stupid.</v>

3590
02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:21.900
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really amazing and all of it came </v>

3591
02:57:22.511 --> 02:57:27.511
<v Speaker 4>out of him putting his foot down in </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposition to the very same things that </v>

3592
02:57:28.861 --> 02:57:33.861
<v Speaker 4>you experienced that forced you to leave</v>
<v Speaker 4>academia is misrepresenting of reality.</v>

3593
02:57:34.620 --> 02:57:39.180
<v Speaker 4>That seems to be going in and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fueling the.</v>

3594
02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:42.990
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly fueling the dark web,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but on top of that,</v>

3595
02:57:43.570 --> 02:57:47.080
<v Speaker 6>these people are seeing that they can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>trust what they're being told.</v>

3596
02:57:47.140 --> 02:57:47.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3597
02:57:48.390 --> 02:57:48.960
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

3598
02:57:50.910 --> 02:57:53.220
<v Speaker 4>They can't trust what they're being told</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they.</v>

3599
02:57:53.221 --> 02:57:56.100
<v Speaker 4>They understand that there's other </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation to be had out there.</v>

3600
02:57:56.520 --> 02:57:59.820
<v Speaker 4>There was an article that I tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 4>today that was really interesting.</v>

3601
02:57:59.850 --> 02:58:00.450
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

3602
02:58:00.451 --> 02:58:05.451
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was talking about long form podcasts </v>

3603
02:58:05.451 --> 02:58:10.310
<v Speaker 4>and the ability that longform podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to allow people to have rational </v>

3604
02:58:14.160 --> 02:58:19.160
<v Speaker 4>civil discourse instead of just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting on these fucking CNN shows and </v>

3605
02:58:20.191 --> 02:58:23.520
<v Speaker 4>yelling at each other for three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is sometimes you get a panel.</v>

3606
02:58:23.521 --> 02:58:25.560
<v Speaker 4>Everyone just agrees with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3607
02:58:25.770 --> 02:58:27.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or the panels are crazy too.</v>

3608
02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:33.080
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck you going to have nine </v>
<v Speaker 4>people talking at the same time that </v>

3609
02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:33.540
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do.</v>

3610
02:58:33.541 --> 02:58:35.790
<v Speaker 4>When I do podcasts with two other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

3611
02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:36.900
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3612
02:58:36.901 --> 02:58:41.901
<v Speaker 4>it's entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a good way to discuss </v>

3613
02:58:41.901 --> 02:58:42.180
<v Speaker 4>topics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3614
02:58:42.181 --> 02:58:47.181
<v Speaker 4>long form conversations are really the </v>
<v Speaker 4>only way where you can get a good sense </v>

3615
02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:52.170
<v Speaker 4>of where someone stands on a position </v>
<v Speaker 4>and how they think,</v>

3616
02:58:53.070 --> 02:58:55.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I get a chance to see like you like</v>

3617
02:58:55.970 --> 02:58:58.200
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of people are going to get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>chance to see you today.</v>

3618
02:58:58.590 --> 02:59:00.070
<v Speaker 4>How you think about things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3619
02:59:00.270 --> 02:59:05.270
<v Speaker 4>what your thought process is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if there's holes in that thought </v>

3620
02:59:05.270 --> 02:59:05.270
<v Speaker 4>process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get exposed.</v>

3621
02:59:06.140 --> 02:59:09.300
<v Speaker 4>And that's I think also with issues that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are more complex.</v>

3622
02:59:09.310 --> 02:59:14.310
<v Speaker 4>You can talk about all the different </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuances to that issue because if you </v>

3623
02:59:14.310 --> 02:59:16.410
<v Speaker 4>just simply have your talking points and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sort of.</v>

3624
02:59:16.570 --> 02:59:19.380
<v Speaker 4>If you do like a standard interview </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's say seven minutes long,</v>

3625
02:59:20.040 --> 02:59:25.040
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very sparse in terms of what you're </v>

3626
02:59:25.040 --> 02:59:25.040
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3627
02:59:25.040 --> 02:59:28.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's not a single thing we </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussed today that wasn't 15 minutes </v>

3628
02:59:28.910 --> 02:59:31.020
<v Speaker 4>long at least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3629
02:59:31.320 --> 02:59:36.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can't really condense that and </v>

3630
02:59:36.320 --> 02:59:37.851
<v Speaker 4>mean you could condense it down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you lose a lot of the information </v>

3631
02:59:37.851 --> 02:59:39.090
<v Speaker 4>and also you feel like you didn't do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice.</v>

3632
02:59:39.690 --> 02:59:44.690
<v Speaker 4>Like I can't do those panel shows </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I feel like there's no way I'm </v>

3633
02:59:44.690 --> 02:59:45.480
<v Speaker 4>going to be able to do anything justice.</v>

3634
02:59:45.480 --> 02:59:49.770
<v Speaker 4>I just as not snow room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially now when people play it up to</v>

3635
02:59:49.800 --> 02:59:51.960
<v Speaker 4>they know that they're there for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>entertainment value,</v>

3636
02:59:51.961 --> 02:59:54.280
<v Speaker 4>so it's more about being upset at what </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's saying.</v>

3637
02:59:54.390 --> 02:59:56.460
<v Speaker 4>Some real under having some real </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding.</v>

3638
02:59:56.590 --> 02:59:58.950
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also about barking out your talking</v>

3639
02:59:58.951 --> 03:00:03.951
<v Speaker 4>points in this like ferocious a manner </v>
<v Speaker 4>as you can so that it can appear that </v>

3640
03:00:03.951 --> 03:00:04.980
<v Speaker 4>you're winning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3641
03:00:05.740 --> 03:00:10.740
<v Speaker 4>You're a nice guy too though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you're not going to come and </v>

3642
03:00:10.740 --> 03:00:10.740
<v Speaker 4>attack somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely don't want to do that.</v>

3643
03:00:10.890 --> 03:00:13.930
<v Speaker 4>The the what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have people on our.</v>

3644
03:00:14.040 --> 03:00:16.710
<v Speaker 4>Even someone that I think I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>disagree with,</v>

3645
03:00:16.740 --> 03:00:20.060
<v Speaker 4>I just want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to see how they think I want.</v>

3646
03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Even some people get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>

3647
03:00:22.621 --> 03:00:23.640
<v Speaker 4>oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3648
03:00:23.641 --> 03:00:26.130
<v Speaker 4>you more for your opinions based on </v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever's on the show.</v>

3649
03:00:26.131 --> 03:00:31.131
<v Speaker 4>That's not what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I do do is I let people talk </v>

3650
03:00:31.131 --> 03:00:34.950
<v Speaker 4>and I try to see their point of view and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to expand their point of view.</v>

3651
03:00:35.070 --> 03:00:36.710
<v Speaker 4>So if they say something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're also.</v>

3652
03:00:36.930 --> 03:00:40.530
<v Speaker 4>So what it is is that this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want them to keep going.</v>

3653
03:00:40.750 --> 03:00:41.550
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to.</v>

3654
03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:44.940
<v Speaker 4>I want to see the whole landscape or </v>
<v Speaker 4>their thought process.</v>

3655
03:00:44.941 --> 03:00:47.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to want to see a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 4>garden.</v>

3656
03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:49.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to see a little potted </v>
<v Speaker 4>plant.</v>

3657
03:00:49.890 --> 03:00:54.890
<v Speaker 4>I want to see the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get a sense of why do I </v>

3658
03:00:54.890 --> 03:00:55.620
<v Speaker 4>disagree with them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I fucked up?</v>

3659
03:00:55.650 --> 03:01:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's maybe it's them should be </v>

3660
03:01:00.650 --> 03:01:00.650
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

3661
03:01:00.650 --> 03:01:05.040
<v Speaker 6>don't think people should be stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 6>their opinion of even no matter how </v>

3662
03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:07.681
<v Speaker 6>right you think you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you should always be open to </v>

3663
03:01:07.681 --> 03:01:07.681
<v Speaker 6>changing your mind.</v>

3664
03:01:07.681 --> 03:01:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I think so too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's one of the rarest </v>

3665
03:01:12.170 --> 03:01:14.960
<v Speaker 2>qualities when it comes to discourse is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability that people have to abandon </v>

3666
03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:18.160
<v Speaker 2>ideas that they've supported in the past</v>
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

3667
03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:23.160
<v Speaker 6>what does that mean then?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're on one side and everyone in </v>

3668
03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:25.801
<v Speaker 6>your life thinks this way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what does it mean if you don't think </v>

3669
03:01:25.801 --> 03:01:25.801
<v Speaker 6>that way?</v>

3670
03:01:25.801 --> 03:01:25.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3671
03:01:25.801 --> 03:01:26.790
<v Speaker 2>what is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the.</v>

3672
03:01:26.791 --> 03:01:31.791
<v Speaker 2>Are Are the ideas you or you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and the ideas are just things that </v>

3673
03:01:31.791 --> 03:01:33.210
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're examining.</v>

3674
03:01:33.350 --> 03:01:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it should be,</v>

3675
03:01:35.460 --> 03:01:36.810
<v Speaker 2>but for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including me,</v>

3676
03:01:36.811 --> 03:01:38.880
<v Speaker 2>most of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was not the case.</v>

3677
03:01:38.910 --> 03:01:43.910
<v Speaker 2>If I had an idea and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I supported that idea that I'll </v>

3678
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:44.100
<v Speaker 2>fucking fight you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is this arm,</v>

3679
03:01:44.101 --> 03:01:45.060
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're wrong,</v>

3680
03:01:45.061 --> 03:01:49.320
<v Speaker 2>and what change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then doing this,</v>

3681
03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:53.070
<v Speaker 2>doing this podcast changed the way I </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to people.</v>

3682
03:01:53.130 --> 03:01:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Change the way I look at life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to so many smart people.</v>

3683
03:01:57.300 --> 03:02:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a thousand 100,</v>

3684
03:02:02.370 --> 03:02:06.840
<v Speaker 2>1200,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1200 podcasts plus all the mma ones.</v>

3685
03:02:07.610 --> 03:02:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many conversations.</v>

3686
03:02:10.470 --> 03:02:15.470
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through those conversations I've gotten </v>

3687
03:02:15.470 --> 03:02:19.220
<v Speaker 2>at least not a formal education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an understanding of things that I </v>

3688
03:02:19.220 --> 03:02:19.220
<v Speaker 2>never had before</v>

3689
03:02:19.590 --> 03:02:20.670
<v Speaker 6>across a lot of subject.</v>

3690
03:02:20.810 --> 03:02:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3691
03:02:22.190 --> 03:02:27.190
<v Speaker 2>And through that I think of understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've come to understand not just how I </v>

3692
03:02:28.881 --> 03:02:31.400
<v Speaker 2>think about things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why,</v>

3693
03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:32.910
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3694
03:02:33.010 --> 03:02:38.010
<v Speaker 2>I've had road blocks and conversations </v>
<v Speaker 2>before and speed bumps and,</v>

3695
03:02:38.300 --> 03:02:39.640
<v Speaker 2>and I've learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3696
03:02:39.650 --> 03:02:43.550
<v Speaker 2>I think if you examine your own yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your own thoughts,</v>

3697
03:02:43.950 --> 03:02:46.820
<v Speaker 2>you're sure to learn hopefully.</v>

3698
03:02:46.990 --> 03:02:49.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think it also can help if you look</v>

3699
03:02:49.781 --> 03:02:54.781
<v Speaker 6>at the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it can help you figure out why you </v>

3700
03:02:54.781 --> 03:02:55.630
<v Speaker 6>believe what you believe too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because you can look at them and say,</v>

3701
03:02:55.960 --> 03:02:57.910
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I still don't agree with you and this is</v>

3702
03:02:57.911 --> 03:03:02.911
<v Speaker 6>why I think if people aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 6>willing to look at the other side and </v>

3703
03:03:02.911 --> 03:03:04.030
<v Speaker 6>consider why they might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you really know?</v>

3704
03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you also run into some people </v>

3705
03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:12.611
<v Speaker 2>that they don't really have opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have these things that they've </v>

3706
03:03:12.921 --> 03:03:14.930
<v Speaker 2>adopted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like slogans.</v>

3707
03:03:15.020 --> 03:03:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3708
03:03:15.830 --> 03:03:17.290
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gotten these things,</v>

3709
03:03:17.320 --> 03:03:19.670
<v Speaker 2>they've decided this is what my side </v>
<v Speaker 2>support,</v>

3710
03:03:19.671 --> 03:03:24.671
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to just spout this out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this makes me seem like I'm a good team </v>

3711
03:03:24.671 --> 03:03:24.671
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3712
03:03:24.671 --> 03:03:29.190
<v Speaker 2>and then the thing about podcast though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you sit down for three hours,</v>

3713
03:03:29.191 --> 03:03:30.650
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think that?</v>

3714
03:03:30.970 --> 03:03:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they start talking about why </v>

3715
03:03:35.970 --> 03:03:38.891
<v Speaker 2>they think that and then know it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>falls apart and then you realize that </v>

3716
03:03:38.891 --> 03:03:39.650
<v Speaker 2>they don't even know why they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3717
03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they probably never even thought </v>

3718
03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:44.990
<v Speaker 2>about it before they just been saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they've been saying for so long.</v>

3719
03:03:45.010 --> 03:03:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it sounds nice.</v>

3720
03:03:46.220 --> 03:03:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3721
03:03:47.720 --> 03:03:49.370
<v Speaker 2>People love to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>

3722
03:03:49.370 --> 03:03:51.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's idea sports,</v>

3723
03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:53.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an idea.</v>

3724
03:03:53.031 --> 03:03:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Sports or arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments are so oftentimes idea sports.</v>

3725
03:03:57.820 --> 03:03:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics too.</v>

3726
03:03:59.501 --> 03:04:01.010
<v Speaker 2>To some degree I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3727
03:04:01.220 --> 03:04:04.670
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the politics are just so flavored by</v>

3728
03:04:04.671 --> 03:04:06.860
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that,</v>

3729
03:04:07.230 --> 03:04:12.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that version of idea sport is lobbyists </v>

3730
03:04:12.230 --> 03:04:13.640
<v Speaker 2>and special interest groups and </v>
<v Speaker 2>different people that are pushing you to</v>

3731
03:04:13.641 --> 03:04:17.480
<v Speaker 2>get in the office cause you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change laws and force things through and</v>

3732
03:04:18.770 --> 03:04:22.250
<v Speaker 2>that's the trickiest of all idea sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also the most shallow.</v>

3733
03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:27.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean just think about presidential </v>
<v Speaker 2>debates and speeches and those are the </v>

3734
03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:30.960
<v Speaker 2>most shallow discussions in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual reality of.</v>

3735
03:04:31.300 --> 03:04:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who that person is.</v>

3736
03:04:33.470 --> 03:04:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Who is that person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you were dating someone and </v>

3737
03:04:38.470 --> 03:04:39.560
<v Speaker 2>every time you went on a date with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a presidential speech.</v>

3738
03:04:40.870 --> 03:04:42.140
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you?</v>

3739
03:04:42.140 --> 03:04:45.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't display any humanity.</v>

3740
03:04:45.111 --> 03:04:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Kind of interesting though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3741
03:04:47.060 --> 03:04:48.520
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Write a book about that.</v>

3742
03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:51.200
<v Speaker 2>But that's what we want in leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3743
03:04:51.201 --> 03:04:53.000
<v Speaker 2>We want someone who's full of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

3744
03:04:53.060 --> 03:04:56.220
<v Speaker 2>who like makes us feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they.</v>

3745
03:04:56.960 --> 03:04:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they're speaking like a leader.</v>

3746
03:05:00.260 --> 03:05:02.030
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

3747
03:05:02.840 --> 03:05:05.360
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that we liked these patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

3748
03:05:05.361 --> 03:05:05.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3749
03:05:05.780 --> 03:05:09.770
<v Speaker 2>the presidential speaking pattern is of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

3750
03:05:09.771 --> 03:05:11.790
<v Speaker 2>very strange one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3751
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:15.770
<v Speaker 2>It's soothing though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3752
03:05:16.280 --> 03:05:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I guess in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3753
03:05:18.110 --> 03:05:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way it's soothing because we want a</v>

3754
03:05:20.961 --> 03:05:23.960
<v Speaker 2>big daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big daddy to take care of us,</v>

3755
03:05:24.030 --> 03:05:25.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell us everything will be okay.</v>

3756
03:05:25.730 --> 03:05:27.890
<v Speaker 2>But as you get older that makes less and</v>
<v Speaker 2>less sense.</v>

3757
03:05:28.220 --> 03:05:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm 50 and so if a new president </v>
<v Speaker 2>was 45,</v>

3758
03:05:32.511 --> 03:05:34.220
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bitch don't know shit.</v>

3759
03:05:34.800 --> 03:05:37.940
<v Speaker 2>He know have only been living in 45 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3760
03:05:38.300 --> 03:05:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3761
03:05:39.561 --> 03:05:42.740
<v Speaker 2>but like when you're 30 and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president's 70 like,</v>

3762
03:05:42.741 --> 03:05:46.250
<v Speaker 2>well you make sense he's an established </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

3763
03:05:46.280 --> 03:05:49.700
<v Speaker 2>he's a man of reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is it at the age difference or is it</v>

3764
03:05:49.701 --> 03:05:51.320
<v Speaker 2>your own maturity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3765
03:05:51.321 --> 03:05:56.321
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of old dummies for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of dummies who just </v>

3766
03:05:56.321 --> 03:05:57.200
<v Speaker 2>survived because we nerfed up the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>

3767
03:05:58.730 --> 03:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your own maturity.</v>

3768
03:06:00.260 --> 03:06:03.590
<v Speaker 2>It's also the amount of time that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to examine ideas.</v>

3769
03:06:03.970 --> 03:06:05.510
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I worked in a coal mine,</v>

3770
03:06:05.540 --> 03:06:10.540
<v Speaker 2>I probably would not have the time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit around all day and think shit </v>

3771
03:06:10.540 --> 03:06:14.981
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a a great luxury that you have </v>

3772
03:06:14.981 --> 03:06:15.380
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do this for a living,</v>

3773
03:06:15.890 --> 03:06:20.890
<v Speaker 2>that you get a chance to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people over and over and over </v>

3774
03:06:20.890 --> 03:06:22.100
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there'll be another podcast.</v>

3775
03:06:22.101 --> 03:06:27.101
<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow's another podcast next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every day I'm looking at a new person </v>

3776
03:06:27.101 --> 03:06:30.670
<v Speaker 2>and talking to a new brain and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see how it goes on in there.</v>

3777
03:06:30.920 --> 03:06:35.920
<v Speaker 2>What's behind the eyes figured out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that why you like it this length?</v>

3778
03:06:38.150 --> 03:06:40.340
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody told me not to do this.</v>

3779
03:06:40.400 --> 03:06:45.400
<v Speaker 2>This is where the Arusha fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's famously told me to go to your </v>

3780
03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:45.680
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3781
03:06:45.681 --> 03:06:50.681
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to listen to it for that </v>

3782
03:06:50.681 --> 03:06:50.681
<v Speaker 2>long so they don't listen and don't give</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fuck.</v>

3783
03:06:51.090 --> 03:06:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just going to do this.</v>

3784
03:06:53.280 --> 03:06:54.460
<v Speaker 2>you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like,</v>

3785

<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>either skip over or just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not downloaded.</v>

<v Speaker 2>which did three hours.</v>

3809
03:07:37.740 --> 03:07:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything you would like to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3810
03:07:40.830 --> 03:07:44.670
<v Speaker 2>to say or Zany thing you didn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't think we covered.</v>

3811
03:07:44.820 --> 03:07:49.820
<v Speaker 6>Mm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess the only thing I'd say we just </v>

3812
03:07:49.820 --> 03:07:49.820
<v Speaker 6>launched our first season of wrong </v>
<v Speaker 6>speak.</v>

3813
03:07:49.820 --> 03:07:51.220
<v Speaker 6>The second season will be starting in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fall.</v>

3814
03:07:51.360 --> 03:07:56.360
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How are you doing when you're saying </v>

3815
03:07:56.360 --> 03:07:57.571
<v Speaker 6>seasons?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we did three for the first and we're </v>

3816
03:07:57.571 --> 03:07:57.571
<v Speaker 6>going to do another cluster of three or </v>
<v Speaker 6>four for the next.</v>

3817
03:07:57.571 --> 03:08:01.960
<v Speaker 2>But why are you calling them a season?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's one group and one </v>

3818
03:08:01.960 --> 03:08:02.690
<v Speaker 2>particular subjects.</v>

3819
03:08:02.750 --> 03:08:03.500
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So then,</v>

3820
03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:07.220
<v Speaker 6>so next season we're going to do one on </v>
<v Speaker 6>political correctness.</v>

3821
03:08:07.221 --> 03:08:12.221
<v Speaker 6>In comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's going to be one on academic </v>

3822
03:08:12.221 --> 03:08:13.961
<v Speaker 6>mobbing and then there's gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 6>another one that's going to be </v>

3823
03:08:13.961 --> 03:08:13.961
<v Speaker 6>surprised.</v>

3824
03:08:13.961 --> 03:08:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you plan them out way in advance?</v>

3825
03:08:14.460 --> 03:08:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3826
03:08:15.380 --> 03:08:17.970
<v Speaker 6>Well we do a bit more of a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of more of a structure,</v>

3827
03:08:17.971 --> 03:08:20.280
<v Speaker 6>like a story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not a long form</v>

3828
03:08:20.490 --> 03:08:24.810
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a more production in there.</v>

3829
03:08:24.930 --> 03:08:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I've mostly heard you do other people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3830
03:08:28.140 --> 03:08:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

3831
03:08:29.850 --> 03:08:31.070
<v Speaker 2>So you're doing a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you.</v>

3832
03:08:31.100 --> 03:08:32.800
<v Speaker 2>How did you do a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3833
03:08:32.801 --> 03:08:35.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure how I found out about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3834
03:08:35.550 --> 03:08:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I found out about you online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what it was that,</v>

3835
03:08:39.510 --> 03:08:41.790
<v Speaker 2>that led me to one of your interviews.</v>

3836
03:08:41.860 --> 03:08:46.860
<v Speaker 6>Probably the Google memo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think when I wrote that column </v>

3837
03:08:46.860 --> 03:08:49.000
<v Speaker 6>defending Jameson Moore's memo because I</v>
<v Speaker 6>think that's when we first started being</v>

3838
03:08:49.001 --> 03:08:50.950
<v Speaker 6>in contact.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
