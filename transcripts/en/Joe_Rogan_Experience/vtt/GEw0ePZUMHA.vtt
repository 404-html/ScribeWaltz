1
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.080
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.033
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.650
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>How are you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>

5
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for doing this.</v>

6
00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

7
00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:15.490
<v Speaker 1>My pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who roped you into this?</v>

8
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

9
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I suppose James Tag Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

10
00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:22.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of your work.</v>

11
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.703
<v Speaker 1>I've read much of your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many of your interviews and </v>

12
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 1>videos online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

13
00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:28.774
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I really wanted </v>

14
00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:30.214
<v Speaker 1>to talk to you about it I find quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting is consciousness and your </v>

15
00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>belief that consciousness is not simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculation,</v>

16
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>but that there's something more to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>what you think this more could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>be from a scientific perspective,</v>

18
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:50.110
<v Speaker 1>which is unusual because a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some theories about consciousness,</v>

19
00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:52.840
<v Speaker 1>but they're usually crazy people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

20
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

21
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 1>we're all conscious and so we may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories about it.</v>

22
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.013
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now the ideas came by a somewhat </v>

23
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>roundabout route.</v>

24
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

25
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I went to Cambridge do graduate work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was mathematics.</v>

26
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I was working on pure mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects,</v>

27
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Algebra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry.</v>

28
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>But I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.993
<v Speaker 1>we've got three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll spend some of the time going to </v>

30
00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>other talks that might be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went to three talks particularly,</v>

31
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:27.811
<v Speaker 1>which had a big influence on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was a talk by Herman Bondi with uh,</v>

32
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>general relativity cosmology,</v>

33
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>wonderful tool with very sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animated presentation,</v>

34
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>the Ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a talk by Paul Dirac,</v>

35
00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:39.154
<v Speaker 1>one of the founders of quantum mechanics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and histalk what he's completely </v>

36
00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:45.850
<v Speaker 1>wonderful talk to wonderful lectures as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>but they're completely different style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very quiet and precise in what he</v>

38
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 1>said and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

39
00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:51.964
<v Speaker 1>in the very first lecture he was talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the superposition principle in </v>

40
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:56.344
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a particle and it could </v>

41
00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 1>be in one spot or it could be in another</v>
<v Speaker 1>spot,</v>

42
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>then you have all sorts of states where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be in both places at once.</v>

43
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.980
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to get used to that idea.</v>

44
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.383
<v Speaker 1>And he illustrated with his speech at </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of chalk and I think he broke it </v>

45
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 1>into two illustrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be in one spot or in the other.</v>

46
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 1>And my mind sort of wanders at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

47
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I was thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't concentrating.</v>

48
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 1>And about a few minutes later he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>finished,</v>

49
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.543
<v Speaker 1>his description is explanation and I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>some vague memory of something about </v>

50
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.330
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't understand what he said.</v>

51
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>And I've been totally mystified by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever since.</v>

52
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>So I suppose if I had heard what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

53
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:40.624
<v Speaker 1>he would have said something to calm me </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and I sort of accepted in one way </v>

54
00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:45.460
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as it was,</v>

55
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.713
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to me this was a major issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How on earth do you have things that </v>

56
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.780
<v Speaker 1>don't behave according to watch porn?</v>

57
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.440
<v Speaker 1>The mechanic says like cricket balls and</v>
<v Speaker 1>baseballs and things like that.</v>

58
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's two of the talks.</v>

59
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.733
<v Speaker 1>The course was a course by a man called </v>
<v Speaker 1>steen who talked on mathematical logic </v>

60
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.573
<v Speaker 1>and he explained things like girdle's </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorem and touring machines during </v>

61
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:15.631
<v Speaker 1>machines being their mathematical notion</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon which modern computers are based or</v>

62
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>computers basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

63
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.973
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about girdles there and you </v>

64
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:26.254
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd heard,</v>

65
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a colleague when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate in first of all,</v>

66
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who became a scientist later on.</v>

67
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.220
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.003
<v Speaker 1>logic and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you could make these kind of </v>

69
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>mathematical systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which worked out logic.</v>

70
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.790
<v Speaker 1>And I'd heard about this girls there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seem to say that there were things</v>

71
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>in mathematics that you just couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>prove.</v>

72
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't like that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

73
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.443
<v Speaker 1>when I heard the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went to this course by steen and </v>

74
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:02.750
<v Speaker 1>he explained what it really says and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it says is,</v>

75
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>suppose you've got a method of proving </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in mathematics.</v>

76
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>And when I say things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean things with numbers.</v>

77
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>That one famous example is fair Mars </v>
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>

78
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the Goldberg conjecture,</v>

79
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:17.284
<v Speaker 1>which isn't yet proved that every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even number bigger than two is the sum </v>

80
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>of two prime numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of example of the thing.</v>

81
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just sort of mathematical things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about numbers,</v>

82
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 1>which you can see what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

83
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.790
<v Speaker 1>but it may be very difficult to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's true or untrue.</v>

84
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.570
<v Speaker 1>But the idea often is in mathematics </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a system of methods of proof.</v>

85
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.193
<v Speaker 1>And the key thing about these methods of</v>
<v Speaker 1>proof is that you can have a computer </v>

86
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you've done it right.</v>

87
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>So these rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.243
<v Speaker 1>they could be adding in B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same as bna and things like </v>

89
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

90
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give you,</v>

91
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you say to the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

92
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.303
<v Speaker 1>here's a Theorem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Goldbar conjecture and you see </v>

93
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:07.684
<v Speaker 1>whether it can be proved and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I've got a proof and this follows </v>

94
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the steps and you give it to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer and it says,</v>

95
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done it right.</v>

96
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.263
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it will say you've done it </v>

97
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:18.964
<v Speaker 1>right and it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it may not see anything but just go </v>

98
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these are the sorts of outcomes.</v>

99
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:25.174
<v Speaker 1>And the point about it is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that these procedures do give </v>

100
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you a proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

101
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>that if the algorithm says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

102
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you believe that it is true because</v>

103
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you've understood the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the rules.</v>

104
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>He looked at the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

105
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.530
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at the second one said,</v>

106
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

107
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.621
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

108
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you go all the way down.</v>

109
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>And as long as you convinced all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules work and if it says yes,</v>

110
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>that's something you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

111
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.230
<v Speaker 1>now what girl shows as he constructs a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very specific sentence,</v>

112
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.600
<v Speaker 2>a statement which is a number thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

113
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 2>like we fair most lost their arm or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to think about numbers,</v>

114
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.833
<v Speaker 2>which what he shows is if you trust this</v>
<v Speaker 2>algorithm for proving mathematical </v>

115
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:13.424
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can see by the way it's </v>

116
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:16.454
<v Speaker 2>constructed that it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can also see by the way it's </v>

117
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 2>constructed that it cannot be proved by </v>
<v Speaker 2>this procedure.</v>

118
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.393
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was amazing to me because it tells </v>

119
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 2>me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

120
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.213
<v Speaker 2>you cannot formalize your understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>in in a scheme which you could put on a </v>

121
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:37.754
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see this statement which skeletal </v>

122
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.933
<v Speaker 2>comes up with is something you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the basis of the same understanding </v>

123
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 2>that allows you to trust the rules that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true,</v>

124
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.450
<v Speaker 2>but that is not actually derived by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

125
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.153
<v Speaker 2>It you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true by virtue of your belief in </v>

126
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:58.994
<v Speaker 2>the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this to me was amazing and I </v>

127
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:02.834
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Golly,</v>

128
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 2>you know what's understanding?</v>

129
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it something following rules?</v>

130
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 2>This is an algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this more or less as,</v>

131
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 2>it's not an algorithm because whenever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

132
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 2>there will be something that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>still see his true even though you don't</v>

133
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:21.020
<v Speaker 2>get it through the algorithm that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had in the first place.</v>

134
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 2>So this was a lot of subtleties about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this to people argue about endlessly.</v>

135
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.313
<v Speaker 2>But it was pretty convincing to me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shows that we don't think when we </v>

136
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:33.044
<v Speaker 2>understand something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in our heads is not an </v>

137
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 2>algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not following rules,</v>

138
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.363
<v Speaker 2>it's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that requires our </v>

139
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:46.160
<v Speaker 2>conscious appreciation of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about.</v>

140
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking it's a conscious thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding is a conscious activity.</v>

141
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 2>So I formed the view that conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>activities,</v>

142
00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just that kind of thing,</v>

143
00:07:57.921 --> 00:07:58.754
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing music or we're falling in love </v>

144
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:05.930
<v Speaker 2>or whatever these things might be on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not computations.</v>

145
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 2>There's something else going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought,</v>

146
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:10.274
<v Speaker 2>I like to think of myself as a scientist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that was going in our heads </v>

148
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 2>is according to the laws of physics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these laws of physics,</v>

149
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty good.</v>

150
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 2>They seem to work well and the outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

151
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 2>And so I believe that the laws that work</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our heads are the same as those laws.</v>

152
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.560
<v Speaker 2>So I began to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

153
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:33.120
<v Speaker 2>what about Newton's mechanics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

154
00:08:33.121 --> 00:08:33.954
<v Speaker 2>you could put that on a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about Einstein's special </v>

155
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:38.900
<v Speaker 2>relativity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do that.</v>

156
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 2>What about Maxwell's wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>equations,</v>

157
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:42.944
<v Speaker 2>which tell you how less electricity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnetism operates and light and radio </v>

158
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 2>waves and all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all follows this beautiful set of</v>

159
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 2>equations that Max will produced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can put that on a computer.</v>

160
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.673
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you might have to about </v>

161
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:56.154
<v Speaker 2>approximations and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these depend on continuous numbers </v>

162
00:08:58.981 --> 00:08:59.814
<v Speaker 2>rather than discreet things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't think that's the answer </v>

163
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 2>then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about general relativity?</v>

164
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Einstein's theory of gravity with curved</v>
<v Speaker 2>space and all that.</v>

165
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 2>We are familiar now with Lego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this detector,</v>

166
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.134
<v Speaker 2>which is detected black hole spiraling </v>
<v Speaker 2>into each other from distant galaxy and </v>

167
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 2>how do we know that those signals are </v>
<v Speaker 2>black holes,</v>

168
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of calculations,</v>

169
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:22.584
<v Speaker 2>people who put this thing on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>algorithm and you know what those </v>

170
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 2>signals look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Einstein's general relativity.</v>

171
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Sure you can put that in a coop on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

172
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 2>What about quantum mechanics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

173
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:34.344
<v Speaker 2>there's the famous equation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Schrodinger which tells you how a </v>

174
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 2>quantum state evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could put that on a computer too.</v>

175
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's many more parameters you have to</v>

176
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:45.504
<v Speaker 2>worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just this computable as these </v>

177
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

178
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:50.904
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I then remember direct lecture you see </v>

179
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:54.803
<v Speaker 2>and how it is that these things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>work in the quantum world don't seem to </v>

180
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 2>work at the level of classical big </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

181
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.023
<v Speaker 2>And it all depends on this process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called measurement in quantum </v>

182
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:12.690
<v Speaker 2>mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the measurement process is something</v>

183
00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 2>that you learn how to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the Schrodinger equation.</v>

184
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 2>It's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Schroeder himself was very intrigued</v>

185
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:21.774
<v Speaker 2>by this fact that his own equation gives</v>
<v Speaker 2>you nonsense and you the famous </v>

186
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Schrodinger's cat where he produces a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation in which the cat would be dead</v>

187
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 2>and alive at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He produced that in an example simply to</v>

188
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:37.014
<v Speaker 2>demonstrate that roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his equation gives you nonsense under </v>

189
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:42.444
<v Speaker 2>these circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something else and the </v>

190
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:48.390
<v Speaker 2>something else goes beyond our current </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics.</v>

191
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Speaker 2>And it tells you what happens when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum state makes a decision between,</v>

192
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.130
<v Speaker 2>doesn't follow the Schrodinger equation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of one thing or the other.</v>

193
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.323
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows that who does quantum </v>

194
00:10:58.321 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 2>mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they think,</v>

195
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:00.504
<v Speaker 2>oh it's what's called making a </v>
<v Speaker 2>measurement and you're allowed to do </v>

196
00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:03.054
<v Speaker 2>something different.</v>

197
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 2>But that didn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I had the view that okay,</v>

198
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.993
<v Speaker 2>there is a big gap and our understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if there is something in the world </v>

199
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.780
<v Speaker 2>which isn't something you could put on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

200
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 2>that's where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the view,</v>

201
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I held that for a long time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there,</v>

202
00:11:22.661 --> 00:11:27.661
<v Speaker 2>there's something non computable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something beyond computation involved in</v>

203
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 2>our understandings of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a view of health for ages.</v>

204
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do much with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just held the view until,</v>

205
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.500
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a radio talk between </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marvin Minsky and Edward,</v>

206
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.111
<v Speaker 2>Fred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ken,</v>

207
00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:42.690
<v Speaker 2>and they were explaining about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>computers can do.</v>

208
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 2>And they were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

209
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you have a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two computers talking to each other over</v>

210
00:11:47.611 --> 00:11:48.444
<v Speaker 2>there and you walk up to the room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time you've walked up the room to </v>

211
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 2>the computers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have computed.</v>

212
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.733
<v Speaker 2>Community communicates with each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>more thoughts than the human race ever </v>

213
00:11:58.991 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 2>has done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see?</v>

214
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:00.611
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

215
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:01.444
<v Speaker 2>I see where you're coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's what's </v>

216
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 2>happening in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in human communication.</v>

217
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Human understanding is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>different from what computers do.</v>

218
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.733
<v Speaker 2>And consciousness is the key thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consciousness is something different </v>

219
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 2>from computation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've held that view.</v>

220
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.250
<v Speaker 2>But then when I heard this talk by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Minsky and um,</v>

221
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.780
<v Speaker 2>and fred skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

222
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had ideas of writing a book some time,</v>

223
00:12:26.311 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 2>you a long time in the future when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>retired.</v>

224
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:30.970
<v Speaker 2>This is some while back I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

225
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this gives you the focus.</v>

226
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.430
<v Speaker 2>And so I wrote this book called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emperor's new mind,</v>

227
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.160
<v Speaker 2>which was supposed to be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

228
00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

229
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.853
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody seems to be thinking one </v>

230
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:44.500
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

231
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.830
<v Speaker 2>the little kid notices that the emperor </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have any clothes.</v>

232
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.250
<v Speaker 2>So it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

233
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 2>that theme of that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the basis of the book.</v>

234
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 2>So I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

235
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe a lots of people think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

236
00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:00.910
<v Speaker 2>we're doing this computing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you stand back and you say,</v>

237
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

238
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.393
<v Speaker 2>there's something else going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the basis of my thoughts </v>

239
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:07.954
<v Speaker 2>about consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wrote this book thinking that by </v>

240
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:14.390
<v Speaker 2>the time I got to the end of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

241
00:13:14.391 --> 00:13:15.211
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot,</v>

242
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly about physics and mathematics and</v>

243
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:17.914
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was really aiming for this thing </v>

244
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 2>about what's going on and conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

245
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.411
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

246
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:26.020
<v Speaker 2>I'll learn a bit about neurophysiology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

247
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 2>And by the time I get to the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

248
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know pretty well what it could be.</v>

249
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:31.803
<v Speaker 2>I didn't got to the end of the book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I just sort of tapered off rather than </v>

250
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:36.850
<v Speaker 2>with something a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>

251
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.450
<v Speaker 2>And that was the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you see,</v>

252
00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:40.284
<v Speaker 2>I hope that this book would stimulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>young people to get interested in </v>

253
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:46.720
<v Speaker 2>science and that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mathematics.</v>

254
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when the book was published,</v>

255
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.943
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get letters from young kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got letters from old retired people </v>

256
00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:54.844
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones who'd had the time to read my </v>

257
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:58.480
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

258
00:13:58.481 --> 00:14:00.640
<v Speaker 2>well that was a little disappointing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay,</v>

259
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad the old retired people like my </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

260
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.173
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing was I got a letter </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Stuart Hameroff and this letter </v>

261
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.453
<v Speaker 2>said more or less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you don't appreciate that </v>

262
00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 2>there's something else going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Neurons.</v>

263
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:14.944
<v Speaker 2>I mean the neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see you couldn't isolate the </v>

264
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:18.424
<v Speaker 2>quantum effects and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the what's called an </v>

265
00:14:21.721 --> 00:14:22.554
<v Speaker 2>environmental decoherence would happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get no way of keeping the </v>

266
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:28.870
<v Speaker 2>quantum state to the level that you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this picture.</v>

267
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.060
<v Speaker 2>So I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have it,</v>

268
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.433
<v Speaker 2>but Stuart Hameroff pointed out to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>these little things called microtubules </v>

269
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:41.430
<v Speaker 2>and he'd built up a theory that </v>
<v Speaker 2>microtubules are absolutely fundamental.</v>

270
00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:42.274
<v Speaker 2>The consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had his own reasons for believing </v>

271
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Speaker 2>that I had never heard of them at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

272
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.950
<v Speaker 2>but then I checked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:48.784
<v Speaker 2>I get lots of letters from people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe don't make sense sometimes the </v>

274
00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:55.580
<v Speaker 2>letters and this one I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is another one.</v>

275
00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Then I realized these microtubules are </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and they looked like just the kind</v>

276
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:02.024
<v Speaker 2>of thing that could well be supporting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of level of quantum mechanics </v>

277
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:11.561
<v Speaker 2>up to a level where you could expect the</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quantum state to sort of collapse.</v>

278
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:13.304
<v Speaker 2>That's the terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People using quantum mechanic micro </v>

279
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 2>tubules are inside brain neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are indeed.</v>

280
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.120
<v Speaker 2>And this is a recent discovery for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

281
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.700
<v Speaker 2>they're actually in lots of cells.</v>

282
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.080
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people often complain,</v>

283
00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:25.310
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in your liver too,</v>

284
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:26.144
<v Speaker 2>not just your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why isn't your liver conscious and </v>

285
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:28.514
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it has to do with the organization </v>

286
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:33.290
<v Speaker 2>of them and the nature of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the particular kind of microtubules,</v>

287
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.120
<v Speaker 2>how they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they're arranged,</v>

288
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:35.954
<v Speaker 2>which is different in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it vary in the brain compared </v>

289
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:40.860
<v Speaker 2>to other cells?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one big difference,</v>

290
00:15:40.861 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 2>although not Stewart emphasizes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much,</v>

291
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:43.754
<v Speaker 2>there are two kinds of microtubules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones who have a lattice and </v>

292
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:49.610
<v Speaker 2>the bead lattice and the a lattice ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

293
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:50.444
<v Speaker 2>they're very symmetrical ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are tubes and they look the same </v>

294
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:55.610
<v Speaker 2>all the way around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got a very beautiful arrangement</v>

295
00:15:55.611 --> 00:16:00.611
<v Speaker 2>of these proteins called Tubulin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they make a very nice arrangement,</v>

296
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:03.590
<v Speaker 2>which is connected with fibonacci </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers and things like that.</v>

297
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.830
<v Speaker 2>So they look a bit like for cones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were powerful.</v>

298
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.641
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

299
00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:08.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take her off.</v>

300
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:14.000
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is in the brain,</v>

301
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I think most of microtubules are </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably what I be lattice ones.</v>

302
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 2>And they're don't have so much symmetry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got like a sort of seemed on the</v>

303
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:22.963
<v Speaker 2>one side and they're very important in </v>
<v Speaker 2>transporting some substances around </v>

304
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 2>cells and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Microsoft was all sorts of things.</v>

305
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:35.360
<v Speaker 2>They don't just do what what stuart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they may be doing in the brain.</v>

306
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.583
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that in the brain they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>organized differently and probably the </v>

307
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 2>ones that are important have a lattice </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones,</v>

308
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:44.294
<v Speaker 2>which is a very symmetrical ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for a long time people couldn't see </v>

309
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 2>the difference and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they look very similar.</v>

310
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they may well be the ones that have </v>

311
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.720
<v Speaker 2>to be in pyramidal cells as a particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of cell.</v>

312
00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.113
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that interested in me </v>

313
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:02.114
<v Speaker 2>a lot is how it is that not all parts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain are the same in this respect </v>

314
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:06.914
<v Speaker 2>is that you've got the cerebrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the part at the top and divided </v>

315
00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:11.210
<v Speaker 2>down the middle on that.</v>

316
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.073
<v Speaker 2>When you see brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you normally see with the </v>

317
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.840
<v Speaker 2>convolutions in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

318
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:16.683
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right underneath and at the back </v>

319
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing called the cerebellum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which more it looks more like a,</v>

320
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.100
<v Speaker 2>like a ball of wool or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Cerebellum,</v>

321
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.753
<v Speaker 2>and it may still be argument about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to be that it's completely </v>

322
00:17:29.811 --> 00:17:33.890
<v Speaker 2>unconscious and it has comparable number</v>
<v Speaker 2>of neurons,</v>

323
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.220
<v Speaker 2>far more connections between neurons and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cerebrum.</v>

324
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:38.563
<v Speaker 2>And it's what takes control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe when you're driving your car </v>

325
00:17:41.391 --> 00:17:42.910
<v Speaker 2>and you're thinking about something else</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

326
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.793
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking what you're doing </v>

327
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.160
<v Speaker 2>because it's unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the unconscious control,</v>

328
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pianist who was very expert and moves </v>

329
00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:54.990
<v Speaker 2>the fingers around and plays a note with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little finger,</v>

330
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.490
<v Speaker 2>that pns doesn't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

331
00:17:56.491 --> 00:17:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I've got to move that muscle this way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this bone that way and so on.</v>

332
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all controlled unconsciously.</v>

333
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.383
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of this unconscious control is</v>
<v Speaker 2>done somewhere else in the cerebellum </v>

334
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.580
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get really skilled.</v>

335
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

336
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.310
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

337
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:13.320
<v Speaker 2>you've got different kinds of structures</v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

338
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.560
<v Speaker 2>and it could well be that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>pyramidal cells,</v>

339
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:19.380
<v Speaker 2>which have a particular organization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>microtubules,</v>

340
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.970
<v Speaker 2>are the ones that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that consciousness is really coming,</v>

341
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 2>coming to light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mainly,</v>

342
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot which is,</v>

343
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 2>which is not known about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial and all sorts of things,</v>

344
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.040
<v Speaker 2>but the cerebellum seems to be different</v>
<v Speaker 2>and organized differently.</v>

345
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:35.874
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just how many neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many connections are there because </v>

346
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:41.830
<v Speaker 2>there are more in the cerebellum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not that same else.</v>

347
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:42.743
<v Speaker 2>Do they know this from observing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain through Fmr dry or something like </v>

348
00:18:45.661 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 2>that during particular activities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Ah,</v>

349
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine he partly just examining</v>

350
00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:51.444
<v Speaker 2>it went from dead people and looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains and trying to estimate how many </v>

351
00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:56.190
<v Speaker 2>neurons their own it.</v>

352
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how would they know what,</v>

353
00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:59.830
<v Speaker 2>which partial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is consciousness.</v>

354
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.760
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty mellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that they do know that when</v>

355
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

356
00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.850
<v Speaker 2>the cerebellum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a bit of an argument about that</v>

357
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I think whether it's completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious or not,</v>

358
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 2>but it seems that actions that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are carried out by the cerebellum.</v>

359
00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:17.100
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not aware of what you're doing.</v>

360
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.440
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:20.274
<v Speaker 2>if he had the tennis player who has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think very carefully about whether with </v>

362
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 2>tilt the ball now that the control of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing,</v>

363
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.530
<v Speaker 2>so the overall control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably done with the cerebrum,</v>

364
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 2>but the cerebellum is controlling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed motions,</v>

365
00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:37.200
<v Speaker 2>how the fingers move and all that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>

366
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:38.523
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd make sure that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>play your thinks going to hit the ball </v>

367
00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:45.951
<v Speaker 2>down down the line there and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest is done under the control of an</v>

368
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 2>unconscious procedure.</v>

369
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may be simplifying,</v>

370
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.090
<v Speaker 2>but you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're saying that there's,</v>

371
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.680
<v Speaker 2>we don't totally understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know that there's different parts</v>

372
00:19:58.681 --> 00:20:01.740
<v Speaker 2>of the brain that are responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>different activities and some activities</v>

373
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.050
<v Speaker 2>don't seem to be conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

374
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.380
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

375
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

376
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm maybe,</v>

377
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't make a statement and I don't</v>

378
00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:11.784
<v Speaker 2>really know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly there are lots of </v>

379
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:17.430
<v Speaker 2>different parts of the cerebrum which </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

380
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.633
<v Speaker 2>which maybe not conscious too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not saying that the whole thing </v>

381
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.610
<v Speaker 2>is capable of being conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

382
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:25.860
<v Speaker 2>they seem to be differences in different</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts,</v>

383
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.963
<v Speaker 2>but are you convinced that microtubules </v>
<v Speaker 2>are responsible for consciousness or </v>

384
00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:32.574
<v Speaker 2>it's a primary theory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're the one of the best </v>

385
00:20:37.651 --> 00:20:38.790
<v Speaker 2>candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I you see,</v>

386
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:40.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's only microtia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

387
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what Stuart Hameroff view </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this is.</v>

388
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.573
<v Speaker 2>He certainly thinks the micro g was </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceedingly important in consciousness </v>

389
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:50.680
<v Speaker 2>and I think he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the feeling I get and he's done a</v>

390
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:54.730
<v Speaker 2>lot of work on trying to find a what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anesthetic gases.</v>

391
00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:55.564
<v Speaker 2>It's an important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the important ways you can tell </v>

392
00:20:57.821 --> 00:20:59.620
<v Speaker 2>things about conscious and most of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

393
00:20:59.621 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 2>it's just hearsay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it vary?</v>

394
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:02.194
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the important ways you can </v>

395
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:09.391
<v Speaker 2>tell something about consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what turns it off in a reversible way.</v>

396
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:15.210
<v Speaker 2>In Stuart's job is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know he's an anesthesiologist?</v>

397
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.713
<v Speaker 2>He puts people to sleep well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he would complain if I say </v>

398
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.133
<v Speaker 2>putting it to sleep because under </v>
<v Speaker 2>anesthetic is actually different for </v>

399
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:23.523
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you make them unconscious in a </v>

400
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:26.104
<v Speaker 2>reversible way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to make sure you think you can </v>

401
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:29.860
<v Speaker 2>wake them up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>

402
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:30.694
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously a very skills thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess a lot of his colleagues </v>

403
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:37.380
<v Speaker 2>might be a skilled at doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't.</v>

404
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.690
<v Speaker 2>They asked the questions about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually doing from the point of</v>

405
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 2>view of the biology and the physics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>

406
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.953
<v Speaker 2>So it still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really interested in that </v>

407
00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:47.680
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly I think the thing is like,</v>

408
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:48.543
<v Speaker 2>oh my tosas cell division and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>very struck by the way that the </v>

409
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:57.180
<v Speaker 2>chromosomes or lion lion up and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's these microtubules which pulling</v>

410
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 2>them and they're really a big part in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

411
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the structure of cells and how they,</v>

412
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.060
<v Speaker 2>how they behave and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why they are consciousness.</v>

413
00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was an experience with,</v>

414
00:22:09.101 --> 00:22:13.360
<v Speaker 2>with um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting people under anesthetics and the</v>

415
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 2>fact that the gases which put you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>

416
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.670
<v Speaker 2>and there again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say to sleep,</v>

417
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:23.410
<v Speaker 2>but put you on the anesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very unconnected chemically.</v>

418
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:24.244
<v Speaker 2>They're different kinds of things be yet</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still seem to have the same effect </v>

419
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.260
<v Speaker 2>and to understand what it is that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>affect is,</v>

420
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:32.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of his interest is to do </v>

421
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:34.534
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

422
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.133
<v Speaker 3>So just by putting someone unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>and registering what parts of the brain </v>

423
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:41.683
<v Speaker 3>are no longer active,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what they're using to sort of </v>

424
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.900
<v Speaker 3>reverse engineered by turning those </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts on.</v>

425
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.630
<v Speaker 3>That's what enables consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

426
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.693
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably a simplification </v>

427
00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.580
<v Speaker 2>of what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

428
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.840
<v Speaker 2>that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

429
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.570
<v Speaker 2>first first step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

430
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Consciousness becomes as a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

431
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.820
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very susceptible to woo.</v>

432
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indeed.</v>

433
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:11.210
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's one of those weird ones </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people want to start talking about</v>

434
00:23:11.361 --> 00:23:14.750
<v Speaker 3>souls and universal consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they start,</v>

435
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.333
<v Speaker 3>it gets,</v>

436
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.433
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a murky area and there's no clear </v>

437
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:21.334
<v Speaker 2>borderline with cc student runs these </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness conferences and he's very </v>

438
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:25.204
<v Speaker 2>broad minded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has people all sorts of different </v>

439
00:23:27.131 --> 00:23:31.240
<v Speaker 2>views like the ones you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not necessarily his view,</v>

440
00:23:31.241 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 2>but he likes to get a broad perspective </v>
<v Speaker 2>on what's going on.</v>

441
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

442
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bit more narrow minded than he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>on these matters.</v>

443
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am too.</v>

444
00:23:38.031 --> 00:23:41.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm very skeptical because I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand the inclination that people</v>

445
00:23:41.931 --> 00:23:45.140
<v Speaker 3>have to lean towards the woo then it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very fun.</v>

446
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for</v>

447
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason people are inclined to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lean towards,</v>

448
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.890
<v Speaker 1>do you ever see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw that movie,</v>

449
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the bleep do we know?</v>

450
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not go.</v>

451
00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.083
<v Speaker 1>That kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a little worrying to me that </v>

452
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

453
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:01.910
<v Speaker 1>indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that did worry me.</v>

454
00:24:01.911 --> 00:24:02.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

455
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:03.710
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

456
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:04.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was written,</v>

457
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:09.230
<v Speaker 1>the movie was made by a cult leader and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now it gets a little squirrelly.</v>

458
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right.</v>

459
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.890
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

460
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.460
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was distinctly,</v>

461
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you were a lot of people that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know there were like yourself,</v>

462
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 1>we're worried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

463
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 1>this is something that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplates.</v>

464
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Like what makes you conscious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the soul?</v>

465
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Is it a real thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

466
00:24:26.571 --> 00:24:27.404
<v Speaker 1>what is your consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it simply just your own biology </v>

467
00:24:30.141 --> 00:24:30.974
<v Speaker 1>trying to calculate your environment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking out for his best interests and </v>

468
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 1>trying to procreate and move forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

469
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.593
<v Speaker 1>the genes that had has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it something almost mystical or </v>

470
00:24:41.031 --> 00:24:42.020
<v Speaker 1>far more complicated?</v>

471
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:42.973
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even instead of the word mystical </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be tainted maybe something far </v>

472
00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:48.710
<v Speaker 1>more complex than we're currently able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand?</v>

473
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:53.420
<v Speaker 1>I think to some extent I would agree to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because it's any different,</v>

474
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I need to have some internal perception </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the external world and yeah,</v>

475
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.150
<v Speaker 1>have to think abstractly and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

476
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:07.460
<v Speaker 1>it's totally different from a way a </v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball runs through the air.</v>

477
00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:08.294
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes it spin and different than </v>

478
00:25:10.461 --> 00:25:14.360
<v Speaker 1>every other conscious animal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so sure about that.</v>

479
00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the difference isn't that big.</v>

480
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

481
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.041
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

482
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:21.260
<v Speaker 1>we use language to a degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

483
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 1>some animals use language to some kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of degree.</v>

484
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge difference in degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

485
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 1>But whether it's a difference in kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a total sure.</v>

486
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

487
00:25:32.751 --> 00:25:33.584
<v Speaker 1>you watch these nature movies and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember seeing one about elephants and </v>

488
00:25:39.021 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 1>this was about how the elephants were.</v>

489
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:42.930
<v Speaker 1>They always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

490
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.520
<v Speaker 1>they're always led by a female elephant </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not relevant to the story.</v>

491
00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:49.280
<v Speaker 1>But they were trying to go from a to B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

492
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.143
<v Speaker 1>maybe what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they thought that was a whole herd </v>

493
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:52.664
<v Speaker 1>of them then would be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then at a certain point they made a </v>

494
00:25:54.411 --> 00:25:59.411
<v Speaker 1>detour and they went off to a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the leader of the elephant herd,</v>

495
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.273
<v Speaker 1>her sister had died and that the bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tusks I suppose with their bones </v>

496
00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:10.130
<v Speaker 1>anyway with that and the elephants </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked him up,</v>

497
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.173
<v Speaker 1>handed them around and and seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>caress them and move them around and </v>

498
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:17.540
<v Speaker 1>then they went back and joined to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>the route that they want.</v>

499
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.453
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that tell us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something going on which is not </v>

500
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:26.660
<v Speaker 1>just some machine behaving like a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>

501
00:26:26.661 --> 00:26:29.270
<v Speaker 1>some feelings that that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate.</v>

502
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean another one I remember was one </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these,</v>

503
00:26:32.601 --> 00:26:36.950
<v Speaker 1>a punt I African hunting dogs and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>

504
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.073
<v Speaker 1>You see there's a route where some </v>
<v Speaker 1>antelopes we tend to go and had to go </v>

505
00:26:40.941 --> 00:26:41.774
<v Speaker 1>across the river and when they got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where the crossfit and that </v>

506
00:26:43.861 --> 00:26:44.150
<v Speaker 1>slow</v>

507
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 2>down and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make their way to get across.</v>

508
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Now these hunting dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see them,</v>

509
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.393
<v Speaker 2>I think it was taken from the air and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would go along towards this place </v>

510
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 2>where the river was and then they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>break into two.</v>

511
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.280
<v Speaker 2>So half of them would go one way towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

512
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.353
<v Speaker 2>and they would hide just where the river</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts and the other half would go and </v>

513
00:27:03.501 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 2>chase the antelopes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd gone bark and make an awful noise</v>

514
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.013
<v Speaker 2>chasing them right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other ones were pants on </v>

515
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:11.520
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's something there which is,</v>

516
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:12.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd been working it out between </v>

517
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:15.210
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's it doing?</v>

518
00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Commute communication of some kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

519
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.130
<v Speaker 2>And I think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will you call understanding.</v>

520
00:27:23.131 --> 00:27:23.964
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a more primitive level and then </v>

521
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.610
<v Speaker 2>human understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nevertheless there was something,</v>

522
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 2>there's no sort of clean dividing line </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my view it's,</v>

523
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:35.220
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty continuous.</v>

524
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this exists in wolves as well,</v>

525
00:27:37.401 --> 00:27:39.440
<v Speaker 3>so very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar behavior.</v>

526
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:44.510
<v Speaker 3>And they do seem to have not just verbal</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nonverbal communication.</v>

527
00:27:44.511 --> 00:27:45.344
<v Speaker 3>They seem to have some understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the task is and what their roles </v>

528
00:27:48.591 --> 00:27:49.424
<v Speaker 3>are in the task.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even though there's not as many </v>

529
00:27:52.491 --> 00:27:57.080
<v Speaker 3>variables maybe as human life there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there definitely seems to be a conscious</v>

530
00:27:57.081 --> 00:27:58.550
<v Speaker 3>awareness of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

531
00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.393
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their position in the hierarchy of the </v>

532
00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:05.030
<v Speaker 3>tribe of the pack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also their,</v>

533
00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.020
<v Speaker 3>what their objective is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

534
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.873
<v Speaker 3>this is not a selfish objective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a group objective and they operate </v>

535
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:15.170
<v Speaker 3>as a group and they do move like those </v>
<v Speaker 3>African dogs you were talking about.</v>

536
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

537
00:28:16.401 --> 00:28:17.660
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

538
00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:18.494
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of indication that </v>

539
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.590
<v Speaker 2>we're certainly chimps and elephants and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things in dolphins.</v>

540
00:28:24.591 --> 00:28:25.820
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know about them,</v>

541
00:28:25.821 --> 00:28:28.670
<v Speaker 2>but I imagine it goes quite far down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should think.</v>

542
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Speaker 2>How much have you studied a Octopi?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fascinating.</v>

543
00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

544
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:33.501
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

545
00:28:33.501 --> 00:28:34.334
<v Speaker 2>There's a new book about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I haven't gotten the chance to </v>

546
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:37.250
<v Speaker 2>read yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to read it.</v>

547
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're highly intelligent.</v>

548
00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

549
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:41.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only different really paying </v>

550
00:28:42.651 --> 00:28:44.710
<v Speaker 3>attention to them for a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

551
00:28:44.711 --> 00:28:45.544
<v Speaker 3>a good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Friend Remy Warren was doing a </v>

552
00:28:47.331 --> 00:28:49.010
<v Speaker 3>television show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

553
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:49.933
<v Speaker 3>called Apex Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We studied the way different animals </v>

554
00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:57.431
<v Speaker 3>hunted and he started studying the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>octopus and um,</v>

555
00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cuddle fish and all these different,</v>

556
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

557
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:05.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Octopi and what the way they could adapt</v>

558
00:29:05.211 --> 00:29:07.340
<v Speaker 3>to their environment by changing their </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual,</v>

559
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.720
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll not just to look,</v>

560
00:29:08.721 --> 00:29:09.554
<v Speaker 3>but the texture of their skin </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously and how this is not </v>

561
00:29:12.861 --> 00:29:15.680
<v Speaker 3>really understood how the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only how they do it,</v>

562
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.950
<v Speaker 3>but how they know what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's below them,</v>

563
00:29:18.951 --> 00:29:20.480
<v Speaker 3>what they're copying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

564
00:29:20.481 --> 00:29:21.314
<v Speaker 3>That they somehow or another can figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to blend in almost perfectly </v>

565
00:29:24.951 --> 00:29:26.810
<v Speaker 3>with their environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing isn't it?</v>

566
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.620
<v Speaker 3>They also can open jars and they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>climb out of tanks.</v>

567
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:31.663
<v Speaker 3>There was one guy had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a camera on his tank because he </v>

568
00:29:35.481 --> 00:29:36.314
<v Speaker 3>had two tanks and one of them had very </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive tropical fish and the other </v>

569
00:29:39.921 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 3>one had his octopus and he was</v>

570
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what was happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his expensive tropical fish.</v>

571
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 1>We put a camera on it and the octopus </v>
<v Speaker 1>was climbing out of the tank,</v>

572
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 1>walking across the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbing into the other tank,</v>

573
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.740
<v Speaker 1>killing one of the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating it,</v>

574
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.650
<v Speaker 1>and then going back into his tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

575
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's heavy.</v>

576
00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one I saw,</v>

577
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:02.340
<v Speaker 1>but I think I heard the description or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>read it.</v>

578
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:07.410
<v Speaker 1>I think I read it about some experiments</v>
<v Speaker 1>on testing the intelligence of octopuses</v>

579
00:30:07.691 --> 00:30:09.160
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had a,</v>

580
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.253
<v Speaker 1>a little thing they had to pull the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chain and then open a door and get food </v>

581
00:30:13.151 --> 00:30:13.984
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this octopus was thinking then I'm </v>

582
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 1>getting fed up with this thing and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>yank the chain.</v>

583
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.460
<v Speaker 1>It came right off and then it rose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top and started to squirting all the</v>

584
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:26.440
<v Speaker 1>people in their white coats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know that was pretty good.</v>

585
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.273
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something else going on that </v>

586
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Justin is something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

587
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't pressed for tea to figure</v>

588
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:40.270
<v Speaker 1>this out in some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a paper that you had to display in front</v>

589
00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:41.320
<v Speaker 1>of scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were,</v>

590
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.840
<v Speaker 1>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out like what do</v>

591
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:45.700
<v Speaker 1>you think it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

592
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.630
<v Speaker 1>what do you think consciousness is where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

593
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going too far to think,</v>

594
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:54.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that the answer,</v>

595
00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:55.234
<v Speaker 1>is there anything of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that this issue of having </v>

596
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.303
<v Speaker 1>some kind of quantum state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which preserves itself up to a certain </v>

597
00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:04.924
<v Speaker 1>level and the microtubules at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggested something where you could </v>

598
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 1>isolate them from the outside and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetry of these things is important.</v>

599
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.900
<v Speaker 1>And there are other structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect it's not just microtubules.</v>

600
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I suspect there are these um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classrooms,</v>

601
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:26.710
<v Speaker 1>these are molecules which inhabit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>synapses.</v>

602
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.113
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing about these ones is that </v>

603
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:33.970
<v Speaker 1>they're incredibly symmetrical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like a soccer ball.</v>

604
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:34.973
<v Speaker 1>You know there you have these pentagons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and excellence and each vertex you've </v>

605
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:39.874
<v Speaker 1>got a protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called a [inaudible] and they </v>

606
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 1>joined themselves along the edges of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

607
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:45.660
<v Speaker 1>of the pattern of the soccer mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

608
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:50.680
<v Speaker 1>But it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a substance.</v>

609
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:51.514
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's made of these proteins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing hanging around in </v>

610
00:31:54.401 --> 00:31:56.890
<v Speaker 1>the synopsis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

611
00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the symmetry has a key role.</v>

612
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:02.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing called the young teller </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect in quantum mechanics,</v>

613
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.120
<v Speaker 1>which tells you that when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly symmetrical structure like that,</v>

614
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:12.510
<v Speaker 1>then there can be a big gap between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lowest energy level and the next one.</v>

615
00:32:12.521 --> 00:32:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And there can be information in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lowest energy level,</v>

616
00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:19.090
<v Speaker 1>which can be shielded from the higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy levels.</v>

617
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:24.390
<v Speaker 1>So this is a sort of the suggestion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of quantum phenomenon is going</v>

618
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:25.900
<v Speaker 1>on in the serious way.</v>

619
00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.980
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot to understand there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean synopsis themselves,</v>

620
00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:30.814
<v Speaker 1>that kind of strange things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think if you were going to </v>

621
00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:33.274
<v Speaker 1>build a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just sold a little wires </v>

622
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.910
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the connections,</v>

623
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.753
<v Speaker 1>you see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having this thing with all the chemist </v>

624
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.770
<v Speaker 1>chemicals transferring this information </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one side,</v>

625
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.003
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something very needed for by </v>

626
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.663
<v Speaker 1>the system and it's all tied up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these classrooms there and and </v>

627
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.103
<v Speaker 1>Cytoskeleton structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which microtubials I one of the main </v>

628
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:55.910
<v Speaker 1>constituents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see,</v>

629
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that there's a lot to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn,</v>

630
00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like there's a,</v>

631
00:33:00.581 --> 00:33:01.414
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the biological understanding of </v>

632
00:33:03.621 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 1>the brain itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

633
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.533
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual nature of cells and of </v>

634
00:33:10.461 --> 00:33:11.294
<v Speaker 1>reality itself that this is being more </v>
<v Speaker 1>illuminated by science with every new </v>

635
00:33:16.131 --> 00:33:16.810
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>

636
00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting a better understanding,</v>

637
00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:22.840
<v Speaker 1>deeper and deeper as to the very nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of matter and of of the,</v>

638
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:23.683
<v Speaker 1>of these structures themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is getting deep into the end </v>

639
00:33:26.361 --> 00:33:27.194
<v Speaker 1>of the way the physical world operates </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things we don't understand about it </v>

640
00:33:31.011 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 1>just yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

641
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean the biology is one side of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

642
00:33:35.321 --> 00:33:36.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming as an outsider,</v>

643
00:33:36.651 --> 00:33:37.484
<v Speaker 1>I get struck by seth and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be quite familiar with the </v>

644
00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:43.340
<v Speaker 1>fact that the right signs of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cerebrum controllers,</v>

645
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.530
<v Speaker 1>the left hand and the left hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right hand,</v>

646
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Speaker 1>but then you look at this and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just that.</v>

647
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.350
<v Speaker 1>What about the soles of your feet right </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top.</v>

648
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:52.483
<v Speaker 1>What about your eyes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They signals right at the back you can </v>

649
00:33:55.641 --> 00:33:56.474
<v Speaker 1>think this is the most ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction you you're going to do the </v>

650
00:33:58.401 --> 00:33:59.840
<v Speaker 1>worst possible place.</v>

651
00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:00.763
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There must be a reason and the </v>

652
00:34:02.121 --> 00:34:02.954
<v Speaker 1>cerebellum is different cause cerebellum</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the left side controls the left side </v>

653
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:07.850
<v Speaker 1>and the right side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right side.</v>

654
00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Did this something going on which </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves these signals getting,</v>

655
00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 1>having to cross each other or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

656
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:14.804
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we'd like to think that there's a </v>

657
00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:19.130
<v Speaker 1>reason but then we look at other </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological life forms and they look kind</v>

658
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:21.260
<v Speaker 1>of preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a platypus.</v>

659
00:34:21.261 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 1>For instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at that and go,</v>

660
00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:24.920
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was out of the experiment.</v>

661
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Is that a prototype that just ran wild </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Islam as well?</v>

662
00:34:30.141 --> 00:34:30.974
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to think of it in terms of </v>

663
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 1>natural select shoreham source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

664
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I guess the circumstances though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

665
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.170
<v Speaker 1>In Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you find it must be specific.</v>

666
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I guess the a lot of that was because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were isolated from,</v>

667
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:46.603
<v Speaker 1>from the rest of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get sort of strange animals in </v>

668
00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Australia and in New Zealand where a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of isolation from,</v>

669
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:55.820
<v Speaker 1>from the rest of the evolution.</v>

670
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.830
<v Speaker 1>So they did their own thing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

671
00:34:57.831 --> 00:35:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Marsupials which is intriguing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

672
00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

673
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phrase quantum is another one that's</v>

674
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.320
<v Speaker 1>fraught with woo indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

675
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:13.490
<v Speaker 1>And some people like Deepak Chopra and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the like,</v>

676
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:17.360
<v Speaker 1>they love to use that word because as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as you use that word you could kind</v>

677
00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:19.050
<v Speaker 1>of get away with almost anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

678
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.513
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say I have quantum mechanics </v>

679
00:35:23.331 --> 00:35:24.164
<v Speaker 1>is a strange thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the blame me for certain things I </v>

680
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:29.550
<v Speaker 1>don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be unfair here.</v>

681
00:35:29.551 --> 00:35:30.384
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying no as I blame it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives some people have the </v>

682
00:35:33.021 --> 00:35:33.950
<v Speaker 1>impression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

683
00:35:33.951 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 1>the fact your theory doesn't make any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

684
00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say crazy things.</v>

685
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.083
<v Speaker 2>Quantum mechanics is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we wanted to except some other crazy </v>

686
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:42.534
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course quantum mechanics has the </v>

687
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:45.384
<v Speaker 2>virtue of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does agree with an awful lot of </v>

688
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:47.394
<v Speaker 2>experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you a huge insight since the </v>

689
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:53.340
<v Speaker 2>things that that one didn't have before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just the fact that it's crazy isn't,</v>

690
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.590
<v Speaker 2>isn't enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make,</v>

691
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 2>to make it something you should study </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

692
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.323
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

693
00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:00.423
<v Speaker 3>well it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to understand even for </v>

694
00:36:03.321 --> 00:36:04.580
<v Speaker 3>people who study it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

695
00:36:04.581 --> 00:36:06.860
<v Speaker 3>indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for someone like myself,</v>

696
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:11.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to pay attention to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>without devoting my entire life to it.</v>

697
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.463
<v Speaker 3>And it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's becomes a big problem because </v>

698
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:15.300
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

699
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there too,</v>

700
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I in one of my books had tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain there are actually two mysteries</v>

701
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.440
<v Speaker 2>in quantum mechanics and they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>muddled.</v>

702
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:27.100
<v Speaker 2>One of them is the whole subject is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty crazy.</v>

703
00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's coherent and it makes sense.</v>

704
00:36:31.811 --> 00:36:33.220
<v Speaker 2>And if you study it properly and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

705
00:36:33.221 --> 00:36:33.621
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

706
00:36:33.621 --> 00:36:34.454
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this includes things like non local </v>

707
00:36:38.051 --> 00:36:38.884
<v Speaker 2>effects where you can have two things </v>
<v Speaker 2>now they know eating thousands of </v>

708
00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.290
<v Speaker 2>kilometers apart and you can see these </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum entanglement effects.</v>

709
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.223
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there they are still in some sense </v>

710
00:36:47.741 --> 00:36:49.960
<v Speaker 2>connected with each other even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're that far apart,</v>

711
00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.820
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's baffling.</v>

712
00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:52.923
<v Speaker 2>That's baffling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's part of the comprehensive or </v>

713
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:55.584
<v Speaker 2>part of quantities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's muddied up because there's the </v>

714
00:36:58.421 --> 00:36:59.254
<v Speaker 2>other part which has to do with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse of the wave function and </v>

715
00:37:01.991 --> 00:37:05.080
<v Speaker 2>standard quantum mechanics really </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make sense,</v>

716
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.573
<v Speaker 2>but people get them muddled in my year </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think because this doesn't make </v>

717
00:37:08.891 --> 00:37:09.724
<v Speaker 2>sense and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's all a bit crazy and so </v>

718
00:37:11.081 --> 00:37:13.780
<v Speaker 2>anything crazy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is is up for grabs,</v>

719
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.420
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics,</v>

720
00:37:16.421 --> 00:37:17.254
<v Speaker 2>the things which are crazy and they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>hang together and the theory works and </v>

721
00:37:19.481 --> 00:37:20.314
<v Speaker 2>you understand that that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the things which involve the </v>

722
00:37:23.171 --> 00:37:24.004
<v Speaker 2>collapse of the wave function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not fine because we don't have </v>

723
00:37:27.731 --> 00:37:28.590
<v Speaker 2>the right theory.</v>

724
00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:34.080
<v Speaker 2>That's why it doesn't make logical sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not the right theory yet.</v>

725
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.380
<v Speaker 2>That's my view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

726
00:37:35.381 --> 00:37:39.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm a minority and saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people who study the foundations of</v>

727
00:37:39.671 --> 00:37:40.600
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

728
00:37:40.601 --> 00:37:41.434
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't got the right interpretation </v>

729
00:37:42.581 --> 00:37:43.414
<v Speaker 2>right yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to think when it means and so </v>

730
00:37:45.161 --> 00:37:46.360
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think,</v>

731
00:37:46.361 --> 00:37:47.194
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

732
00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.093
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's something when this </v>

733
00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:51.483
<v Speaker 2>affects get big enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something else comes in and we need a </v>

734
00:37:54.701 --> 00:37:58.030
<v Speaker 2>new insights and new theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I think</v>

735
00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.250
<v Speaker 3>now in something like super position </v>
<v Speaker 3>where something can be both still and in</v>

736
00:38:03.251 --> 00:38:05.980
<v Speaker 3>motion at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you say that.</v>

737
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the common person like myself,</v>

738
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:13.240
<v Speaker 3>my brain glazes over and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my eyebrows raised up and I go,</v>

739
00:38:13.241 --> 00:38:14.110
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does,</v>

740
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.033
<v Speaker 3>and then you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>entanglement things hundreds of </v>

741
00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.200
<v Speaker 3>thousands of kilometers apart that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another interacting with each</v>

742
00:38:20.201 --> 00:38:22.840
<v Speaker 3>other in a way that we don't totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

743
00:38:22.841 --> 00:38:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Or we don't have a theory that </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely explains in a concrete way</v>

744
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:27.603
<v Speaker 2>when it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you don't get to the </v>

745
00:38:28.661 --> 00:38:29.494
<v Speaker 2>measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the measurement entanglement part is </v>

746
00:38:31.541 --> 00:38:33.490
<v Speaker 2>pretty well understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the measurement,</v>

747
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 2>the measurement part is not be seen as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the puzzles</v>

748
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 1>about the entanglement is when you come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the measurement,</v>

749
00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.850
<v Speaker 1>you make a measurement over here and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>measurement over there and they can be,</v>

750
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:47.800
<v Speaker 1>well now a thousand kilometers apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The record was only 143 or something.</v>

751
00:38:47.801 --> 00:38:48.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a little while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

752
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:49.691
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

753
00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:51.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long distance,</v>

754
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.970
<v Speaker 1>but there's hardly any movement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

755
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:58.360
<v Speaker 1>So the thing that you see in the scheme </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

756
00:38:58.361 --> 00:38:59.194
<v Speaker 1>which involves the collapse of the wave </v>
<v Speaker 1>function involves certain amount of </v>

757
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:05.740
<v Speaker 1>displacement and mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

758
00:39:05.741 --> 00:39:10.630
<v Speaker 1>if it's just photons that's light and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these experiments tend to be just light,</v>

759
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:14.350
<v Speaker 1>then there's no mass displacement in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

760
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.800
<v Speaker 1>And so sure what quantum mechanics says </v>
<v Speaker 1>is fine by me.</v>

761
00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.053
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get your mind around and I </v>

762
00:39:20.681 --> 00:39:23.380
<v Speaker 1>certainly agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's logical.</v>

763
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not logical comes apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you worry about the measurement</v>

764
00:39:28.031 --> 00:39:31.090
<v Speaker 1>issue and the collapse of the wave </v>
<v Speaker 1>function and portal,</v>

765
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Schrodinger was very upset by this quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

766
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:35.303
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

767
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:36.443
<v Speaker 3>Now when you discuss consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mystery of consciousness and then </v>

768
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:46.700
<v Speaker 3>you take into account some of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristics that are being displayed</v>

769
00:39:47.641 --> 00:39:48.474
<v Speaker 3>in the quantum world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that perhaps some of them </v>

770
00:39:50.941 --> 00:39:54.930
<v Speaker 3>are interchangeable or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or similar to consciousness itself,</v>

771
00:39:54.931 --> 00:39:59.931
<v Speaker 3>that there is some sort of a connection </v>
<v Speaker 3>that human beings share and some,</v>

772
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:04.440
<v Speaker 3>some strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unique and miss or not,</v>

773
00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.890
<v Speaker 3>not understood way yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the</v>

774
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.260
<v Speaker 1>careful about these things and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>do well,</v>

775
00:40:09.261 --> 00:40:13.400
<v Speaker 1>even Niels Bohr who is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>founders of these ideas,</v>

776
00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

777
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:17.623
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tried to make a philosophy out of </v>

778
00:40:19.941 --> 00:40:22.340
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics and what do you call </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

779
00:40:22.341 --> 00:40:26.450
<v Speaker 1>So complimentarity and so I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going a bit far.</v>

780
00:40:26.451 --> 00:40:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't really see cause there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence for it.</v>

781
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a bit misleading that one,</v>

782
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:33.763
<v Speaker 1>you can see analogies between things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see myself that that should </v>

783
00:40:40.191 --> 00:40:42.770
<v Speaker 1>be taken much further than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

784
00:40:42.771 --> 00:40:44.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's more there,</v>

785
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.390
<v Speaker 3>but you're open to the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>should new information.</v>

786
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

787
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it comes to things like,</v>

788
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people talk about it entanglements </v>

789
00:40:54.181 --> 00:40:58.230
<v Speaker 1>and things quantum states can spread to </v>
<v Speaker 1>long distances,</v>

790
00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:03.030
<v Speaker 1>does that mean that human beings minds </v>
<v Speaker 1>can stretch to long distances and so on.</v>

791
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.220
<v Speaker 1>So the people will raise questions like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

792
00:41:05.221 --> 00:41:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Myself.</v>

793
00:41:06.571 --> 00:41:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty farfetched.</v>

794
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.410
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

795
00:41:10.411 --> 00:41:11.244
<v Speaker 1>you might worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it could it be that there some </v>

796
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:18.180
<v Speaker 1>quantum state which is shared between </v>
<v Speaker 1>different individuals.</v>

797
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:19.830
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be,</v>

798
00:41:19.831 --> 00:41:22.230
<v Speaker 1>unless they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I meant if they're identical twins,</v>

799
00:41:22.231 --> 00:41:24.330
<v Speaker 1>I suppose they were once in one cell at </v>
<v Speaker 1>one time,</v>

800
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.910
<v Speaker 1>but you'd have to preserve that </v>
<v Speaker 1>information all the way through.</v>

801
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.830
<v Speaker 1>And I just don't see how that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

802
00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not a fan of trying to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum ideas</v>

803
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:38.240
<v Speaker 2>sort of directly and say human behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

804
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those analogies are pretty far fetched,</v>

805
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.280
<v Speaker 2>partly because the sorts of mathematics </v>
<v Speaker 2>you use in quantum mechanics,</v>

806
00:41:46.281 --> 00:41:47.114
<v Speaker 2>there's very specific to quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics and doesn't really apply to </v>

807
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.780
<v Speaker 2>macroscopic behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

808
00:41:53.781 --> 00:41:55.800
<v Speaker 2>as I can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this</v>

809
00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.600
<v Speaker 3>thing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

810
00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 3>that your ax asked about most often?</v>

811
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 2>You mean in my research all together or </v>
<v Speaker 2>just amongst the common people?</v>

812
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Like myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only one of them.</v>

813
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:10.243
<v Speaker 2>But you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's slightly misleading when you're </v>

814
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 2>thinking about what my interests are </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had this,</v>

815
00:42:15.171 --> 00:42:15.921
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

816
00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I explained more or less the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas there and I did write a book or at</v>

817
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:21.530
<v Speaker 2>least another one after that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

818
00:42:21.531 --> 00:42:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I guess I've written three books about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>

819
00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:25.850
<v Speaker 2>That one was taken down lectures and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

820
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not what I do mainly,</v>

821
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.590
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Main research is,</v>

822
00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:31.960
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is um,</v>

823
00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:34.520
<v Speaker 2>cosmology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

824
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.560
<v Speaker 2>well thing is this area called twists </v>
<v Speaker 2>the theory but necessarily go into that.</v>

825
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:43.580
<v Speaker 2>But it's meant to be foundational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quantum is a foundational physics,</v>

826
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.320
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but general relativity.</v>

827
00:42:45.321 --> 00:42:46.154
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the work I did originally with </v>

828
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 2>people paid attention to is in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in general relativity and black holes.</v>

829
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:54.343
<v Speaker 2>What a black hole is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why we have the idea that they're there </v>

830
00:42:56.901 --> 00:42:58.970
<v Speaker 2>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>

831
00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I worked on that one point.</v>

832
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.063
<v Speaker 3>Cosmology as a whole is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying concepts to me because I </v>

833
00:43:06.591 --> 00:43:10.080
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I start thinking about the size and</v>

834
00:43:10.081 --> 00:43:10.914
<v Speaker 3>scale of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get to a certain point and my brain </v>

835
00:43:15.751 --> 00:43:17.970
<v Speaker 3>just shuts off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough juice.</v>

836
00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty huge.</v>

837
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.690
<v Speaker 2>One is has to think on a pretty huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale,</v>

838
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:23.943
<v Speaker 2>but it's like so many things you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks sort of mind boggling at first </v>

839
00:43:26.621 --> 00:43:27.454
<v Speaker 2>and then when you get used to the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sort of play around with the </v>

840
00:43:30.731 --> 00:43:34.450
<v Speaker 2>ideas and maybe forget how much bottling</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be.</v>

841
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:35.763
<v Speaker 3>I was watching a documentary around </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermassive black holes and they were </v>

842
00:43:37.691 --> 00:43:38.524
<v Speaker 3>discussing how the size of this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this is still a current </v>

843
00:43:42.971 --> 00:43:44.950
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This documentary was a few years old,</v>

844
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:48.370
<v Speaker 3>but they were saying that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a supermassive black hole inside</v>

845
00:43:48.371 --> 00:43:52.210
<v Speaker 3>of every galaxy that's one half of 1% of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mass of the entire galaxy.</v>

846
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.280
<v Speaker 3>And that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>

847
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.233
<v Speaker 3>one of the theories was that inside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermassive black holes could be an </v>

848
00:43:59.171 --> 00:44:00.004
<v Speaker 3>entirely different universe with </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of billions of galaxies each </v>

849
00:44:02.741 --> 00:44:04.630
<v Speaker 3>with their own black holes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's</v>

850
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.940
<v Speaker 2>infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

851
00:44:05.941 --> 00:44:07.410
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a fairly,</v>

852
00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:12.480
<v Speaker 2>an idea which I think the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 2>does still regarded as a bit crazy,</v>

853
00:44:12.481 --> 00:44:13.314
<v Speaker 2>but not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're going to have much </v>

854
00:44:15.781 --> 00:44:18.600
<v Speaker 2>fun inside a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's in there.</v>

855
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

856
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.401
<v Speaker 2>not much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

857
00:44:20.401 --> 00:44:21.234
<v Speaker 2>you could have a really big black hole </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of time in there who </v>

858
00:44:23.401 --> 00:44:25.110
<v Speaker 2>really big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

859
00:44:25.111 --> 00:44:26.670
<v Speaker 2>if you were in a space ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

860
00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:30.090
<v Speaker 2>you could have a few parties before you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get hour.</v>

861
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not sure</v>

862
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

863
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:35.350
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

864
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:37.283
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in black holes are remarkable </v>

865
00:44:38.371 --> 00:44:41.460
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the thing I did,</v>

866
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:46.461
<v Speaker 1>which was in 1964 and the publish under </v>
<v Speaker 1>65 which to show that black hose,</v>

867
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:51.043
<v Speaker 1>well I'm using a terminal knowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't around at that time that the </v>

868
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:56.730
<v Speaker 1>black holes collide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was co gravitational collapse.</v>

869
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:58.223
<v Speaker 1>You see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

870
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:59.063
<v Speaker 1>the history went back to originally I </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess Chandra Sekhar Indian scientist </v>

871
00:45:02.791 --> 00:45:05.220
<v Speaker 1>when he was not quite 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

872
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 19 or 20.</v>

873
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 1>And he was going to England to study </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>

874
00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:14.100
<v Speaker 1>astronomy and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he worked on this problem about what</v>

875
00:45:14.101 --> 00:45:15.920
<v Speaker 1>holes white doffs apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the,</v>

876
00:45:15.921 --> 00:45:19.530
<v Speaker 1>is very massive stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the companion of serious,</v>

877
00:45:19.531 --> 00:45:20.364
<v Speaker 1>serious as a white dwarf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was doing calculations to find </v>

878
00:45:24.661 --> 00:45:27.120
<v Speaker 1>out whether they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

879
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:28.223
<v Speaker 1>what the interior has a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly as struck structure of </v>

880
00:45:31.231 --> 00:45:32.064
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

881
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.510
<v Speaker 1>And he came to the conclusions if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a bigger mass than a certain amount,</v>

882
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:41.190
<v Speaker 1>which is about a bit less than one and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half times the sun's mass,</v>

883
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.760
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't build a home selves apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they would collapse and he didn't</v>

884
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:49.980
<v Speaker 1>speculate on what had happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

885
00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:53.550
<v Speaker 1>one is less there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some very modest comment he made is one,</v>

886
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.240
<v Speaker 1>we are left speculating on possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

887
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:02.930
<v Speaker 1>But then that was in the 1930s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess round about 1930 and much later,</v>

888
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 1>just before the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

889
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.170
<v Speaker 1>cinema one 90 13 at west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a bit later,</v>

890
00:46:09.171 --> 00:46:10.004
<v Speaker 1>I guess 1939,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a paper by oppenheimer of </v>

891
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.253
<v Speaker 1>atomic bomb fame and Schneider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a student of his Hartland </v>

892
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Snyder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they produced a model which was,</v>

893
00:46:24.631 --> 00:46:27.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a solution of the Einstein Equations,</v>

894
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:28.553
<v Speaker 1>which describes a cloud of dust which </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses and becomes what we now call </v>

895
00:46:34.831 --> 00:46:36.340
<v Speaker 1>the black hole there.</v>

896
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.800
<v Speaker 1>This was the first clear picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed to a black hole.</v>

897
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Now in their picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made two huge assumptions,</v>

898
00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:49.320
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is does the material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means it didn't have any pressure.</v>

899
00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:51.840
<v Speaker 1>And so you could imagine when it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to itself,</v>

900
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:54.450
<v Speaker 1>it might would push away if it had </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on it in any way.</v>

901
00:46:54.451 --> 00:46:56.670
<v Speaker 1>But this was just dust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one thing,</v>

902
00:46:56.671 --> 00:47:00.930
<v Speaker 1>but more important that the model was </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly symmetrical.</v>

903
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.820
<v Speaker 1>So it was just very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical all matter,</v>

904
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:08.760
<v Speaker 1>falling in the dust particles would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused right into the central point.</v>

905
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.073
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not so hard to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a singularity where the density </v>

906
00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:14.634
<v Speaker 1>goes infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the curvatures go infinite and your </v>

907
00:47:16.081 --> 00:47:20.010
<v Speaker 1>equations go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at that point,</v>

908
00:47:20.011 --> 00:47:22.710
<v Speaker 1>when the dust reaches the middle point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

909
00:47:22.711 --> 00:47:25.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not so surprising because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very contrived situation.</v>

910
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.290
<v Speaker 1>So I think a lot of people thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

911
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.260
<v Speaker 1>perhaps we shouldn't take it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

912
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.113
<v Speaker 1>I think they weren't sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there was a paper by two </v>

913
00:47:33.521 --> 00:47:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Russians caulk flattened lifshitz and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kolodny cough.</v>

914
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:42.570
<v Speaker 1>And they seem to have proved that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get singularities and the general</v>

915
00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:45.550
<v Speaker 1>case that somehow it was swirl around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and switch out again.</v>

916
00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.350
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a possibility.</v>

917
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:49.293
<v Speaker 1>And then there was this discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in 1962 when Martin Schmidt to </v>

918
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Dutch astronomer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

919
00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Dutch American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think where he was living there at the</v>

920
00:47:59.201 --> 00:48:00.034
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>

921
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.890
<v Speaker 1>but he observed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became what we call the,</v>

922
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:05.163
<v Speaker 1>the first quasar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was an object of which was </v>

923
00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.910
<v Speaker 1>irradiating an awful amount of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far more than an entire galaxy.</v>

924
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 1>But it seemed to be a very small thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't be much bigger than the size</v>

925
00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:18.394
<v Speaker 1>of the solar system if even that big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it variations in brightness </v>

926
00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:27.400
<v Speaker 1>indicated that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the speed of light could size of it</v>

927
00:48:27.401 --> 00:48:32.000
<v Speaker 1>had to be comparable with the same speed</v>
<v Speaker 1>at which the variations in,</v>

928
00:48:32.001 --> 00:48:33.280
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

929
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:35.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Brighton this came about.</v>

930
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.780
<v Speaker 1>So it seemed to be an object that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormously energetic,</v>

931
00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:41.643
<v Speaker 1>producing more energy than a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy and varying with such a degree </v>

932
00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:46.534
<v Speaker 1>that it must be fairly small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this raised the question of whether </v>

933
00:48:50.111 --> 00:48:53.650
<v Speaker 1>it was small enough to be what we now </v>
<v Speaker 1>call a black hole.</v>

934
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:54.730
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

935
00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing called the short,</v>

936
00:48:57.131 --> 00:48:57.964
<v Speaker 1>short radius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schwab shocked was the man who first </v>

937
00:49:00.821 --> 00:49:02.950
<v Speaker 1>discovered the solutions of Einstein's </v>
<v Speaker 1>equations,</v>

938
00:49:02.951 --> 00:49:03.784
<v Speaker 1>which described this spherical body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't extrapolate it inwards to </v>

939
00:49:08.741 --> 00:49:11.330
<v Speaker 1>what's called this horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call it horizon now.</v>

940
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:12.173
<v Speaker 1>It used to be called the Schwartz at </v>
<v Speaker 1>singularity and people began to realize </v>

941
00:49:15.491 --> 00:49:16.324
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't really a singularity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my something you could imagine </v>

942
00:49:18.431 --> 00:49:19.264
<v Speaker 1>falling through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was in the Metro who first </v>

943
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.920
<v Speaker 1>made clear that clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not many people paid attention.</v>

944
00:49:26.921 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 1>But that was the idea of a black hole.</v>

945
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:29.883
<v Speaker 1>And it looked then is that these quasars</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be having some back hole in the </v>

946
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:35.524
<v Speaker 1>middle of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember John Wheeler who's at </v>

947
00:49:37.931 --> 00:49:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Princeton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then very distinguished scientist and he</v>

948
00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.093
<v Speaker 1>got where you worried about these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he talked to me and he were right </v>

949
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do we believe,</v>

950
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:46.770
<v Speaker 1>is there a singularity in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

951
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.520
<v Speaker 1>we believe Lifshitz and Claton and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

952
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:50.320
<v Speaker 1>they sort of swirl around and bounce </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

953
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:55.120
<v Speaker 1>What are we supposed to think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started thinking about this problem</v>

954
00:49:55.930 --> 00:50:00.280
<v Speaker 1>and since that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you see either people,</v>

955
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:02.320
<v Speaker 1>when he wants to solve the Einstein </v>
<v Speaker 1>equations,</v>

956
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.250
<v Speaker 1>either you make a lot of assumptions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a symmetrical like,</v>

957
00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:06.093
<v Speaker 1>like the open home is slotted model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You assume it's got very special </v>

958
00:50:09.371 --> 00:50:12.040
<v Speaker 1>properties and then you can maybe solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the equations.</v>

959
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.353
<v Speaker 1>But only very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very special cases and the computers </v>

960
00:50:15.281 --> 00:50:18.940
<v Speaker 1>weren't powerful enough to tell you very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much about what happened.</v>

961
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.613
<v Speaker 1>So I started thinking about this problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and realizing that I'd have to think </v>

962
00:50:23.681 --> 00:50:27.070
<v Speaker 1>about it in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I used ideas,</v>

963
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:32.440
<v Speaker 1>involve ideas from topology and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that to show that there had to be a</v>

964
00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:36.320
<v Speaker 1>singularity in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provided that the collapse had reached a</v>

965
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:41.380
<v Speaker 1>certain point of no return,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess to get some idea of,</v>

966
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not too misleading.</v>

967
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a mathematical theorem called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hairy dog theorem.</v>

968
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Hairy dog pheromones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

969
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just a jocular </v>
<v Speaker 1>terminology,</v>

970
00:50:53.381 --> 00:50:54.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you think of,</v>

971
00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:55.203
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something which is topologically a </v>

972
00:50:57.321 --> 00:50:58.810
<v Speaker 1>sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you see it,</v>

973
00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.673
<v Speaker 1>you imagine a dog shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could sort of move it around </v>

974
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:05.240
<v Speaker 1>with a piece of plasticine until it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like a sphere.</v>

975
00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.950
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have holes in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

976
00:51:06.951 --> 00:51:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Forget about his digestive system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

977
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.830
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about the surface </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside and then you're out.</v>

978
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.733
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you're trying to comb the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair on the dog all the way around and </v>

979
00:51:15.891 --> 00:51:18.060
<v Speaker 1>the theorem says there's got to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere where the hair,</v>

980
00:51:18.061 --> 00:51:21.440
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't lie flat and you try it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sphere.</v>

981
00:51:21.441 --> 00:51:25.400
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be a point where with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair makes a kind of singular point.</v>

982
00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:26.773
<v Speaker 1>So it's a bit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea where the singularity </v>

983
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:31.700
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know from general,</v>

984
00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.540
<v Speaker 1>top logical reasons that there's got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be one somewhere.</v>

985
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.660
<v Speaker 1>And that was the sort of argument that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced.</v>

986
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:40.123
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess a lot of people had little bit </v>

987
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.793
<v Speaker 1>be trouble because they never seen this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of arguing and a lot of people </v>

988
00:51:46.821 --> 00:51:50.620
<v Speaker 1>picked up on it and particular Stephen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawking and uh,</v>

989
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.970
<v Speaker 1>it became for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

990
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.823
<v Speaker 1>many people working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's not so popular now because </v>

991
00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.940
<v Speaker 1>probably would run out of serums.</v>

992
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:06.430
<v Speaker 1>The idea of a singularity or is when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see something like a,</v>

993
00:52:07.351 --> 00:52:08.184
<v Speaker 1>a quasar or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the center of a galaxy and we were </v>

994
00:52:14.061 --> 00:52:16.490
<v Speaker 1>talking a lot of black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say a singularity,</v>

995
00:52:16.491 --> 00:52:17.324
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly are you do you mean by </v>

996
00:52:19.341 --> 00:52:20.174
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the normal expectation is that you </v>

997
00:52:22.911 --> 00:52:25.980
<v Speaker 1>have a place like in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oppenheimer,</v>

998
00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.033
<v Speaker 1>that dust cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a point there where the density </v>

999
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.810
<v Speaker 1>becomes infinite and so the curvature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>space time becomes infinite.</v>

1000
00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:41.260
<v Speaker 1>So you have a place where the equations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and run away and they go to infinity and</v>

1001
00:52:41.421 --> 00:52:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you say well something's gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe initially it was in these very</v>

1002
00:52:45.951 --> 00:52:46.784
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical cases but but you could show</v>
<v Speaker 1>by these indirect arguments that </v>

1003
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:51.104
<v Speaker 1>somewhere some of these got to go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't continue the equations of </v>

1004
00:52:55.761 --> 00:52:56.594
<v Speaker 1>Einstein and they got stuck right to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place where they go infinite or what in </v>

1005
00:53:01.431 --> 00:53:02.450
<v Speaker 1>detail happens.</v>

1006
00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.373
<v Speaker 1>The theorems don't tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just say that something goes wrong </v>

1007
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:07.123
<v Speaker 1>and that's what we call the singularity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if a black hole is larger or </v>

1008
00:53:10.281 --> 00:53:13.130
<v Speaker 1>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the singularity remains constant.</v>

1009
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:14.263
<v Speaker 1>It remains in in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's remains in there but it's not </v>

1010
00:53:16.911 --> 00:53:17.744
<v Speaker 1>measurable in terms of its actual size </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whether you can measure size very </v>

1011
00:53:20.661 --> 00:53:24.800
<v Speaker 1>well cause its size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an intriguing question.</v>

1012
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.560
<v Speaker 1>You might say the size is going to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1013
00:53:27.561 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 1>but it could be quite complicated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>irregular.</v>

1014
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Not like the original opera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I miss every one of my soldiers.</v>

1015
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Even then the point is the wrong point </v>
<v Speaker 1>of view but let's not go into that.</v>

1016
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Now there is something about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of these things.</v>

1017
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:45.790
<v Speaker 1>You can say they're not all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No the singularities and all of sudden,</v>

1018
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:47.220
<v Speaker 1>but the black holes are not all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

1019
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:48.083
<v Speaker 1>They're not all the same but they this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the strange things about black </v>

1020
00:53:51.241 --> 00:53:54.160
<v Speaker 1>holes is that if you let them settle </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

1021
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.013
<v Speaker 1>they're not all the same to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>but are not many different things they </v>

1022
00:53:58.501 --> 00:53:59.430
<v Speaker 1>can settled into.</v>

1023
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:00.743
<v Speaker 1>They can have rotation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can have a certain mass and the </v>

1024
00:54:03.481 --> 00:54:08.481
<v Speaker 1>mass translates into the size of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>diameter of the hole and you've also got</v>

1025
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:14.730
<v Speaker 1>a rotation so they can rotate and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>are short sweatshirt found.</v>

1026
00:54:14.731 --> 00:54:15.564
<v Speaker 1>The non rotating ones and it was roy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and who first produced a </v>

1027
00:54:18.941 --> 00:54:22.500
<v Speaker 1>solution for a rotating black hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotating.</v>

1028
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rotating one.</v>

1029
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 1>But then you see the remarkable thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they settled down too.</v>

1030
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:28.613
<v Speaker 1>So there are good theorem this which </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you that the general black hole to </v>

1031
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:31.494
<v Speaker 1>be very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly rapidly will settle down and </v>

1032
00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:37.590
<v Speaker 1>become one of these care solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rotating black hole.</v>

1033
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I first saw that </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary and I saw the,</v>

1034
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.570
<v Speaker 1>when they were discussing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shape of these galaxies and that the</v>

1035
00:54:45.571 --> 00:54:46.404
<v Speaker 1>center of it had this supermassive black</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole that was slowly devouring the </v>

1036
00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:50.963
<v Speaker 1>galaxy.</v>

1037
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:52.803
<v Speaker 1>It is an unbelievably beautiful yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously terrifying idea is that </v>

1038
00:54:58.591 --> 00:55:03.450
<v Speaker 1>there's this yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite power in the center of infinite</v>

1039
00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:07.560
<v Speaker 1>mass that's absorbing slowly but surely </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything around it.</v>

1040
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:08.803
<v Speaker 1>But it's not an infinite mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mass is quite well defined and </v>

1041
00:55:10.891 --> 00:55:12.960
<v Speaker 1>there's not infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1042
00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I always a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you wait forever,</v>

1043
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:19.410
<v Speaker 1>how much of the mass actually gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>swallowed by the black hole?</v>

1044
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:20.940
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

1045
00:55:20.941 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 1>the pictures to think not just the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy but the cluster.</v>

1046
00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:25.353
<v Speaker 1>You see our galaxy has this 4 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>solar mass black hole and we are on a </v>

1047
00:55:29.491 --> 00:55:32.700
<v Speaker 1>collision course with the Andromeda </v>
<v Speaker 1>Galaxy.</v>

1048
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:37.260
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many book some time in the future.</v>

1049
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The black holes,</v>

1050
00:55:38.311 --> 00:55:41.370
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably spile into each other and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be one big one.</v>

1051
00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:42.683
<v Speaker 1>So it's definable mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in infinite density and that this </v>

1052
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:47.580
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were,</v>

1053
00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:48.414
<v Speaker 1>they were speculating that this could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly in the center of the </v>

1054
00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:53.910
<v Speaker 1>supermassive black holes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could go through that,</v>

1055
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.860
<v Speaker 1>there would be another universe.</v>

1056
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that's speculation.</v>

1057
00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:00.900
<v Speaker 1>So nice romantic thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1058
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.970
<v Speaker 1>is it more woo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid.</v>

1059
00:56:02.971 --> 00:56:05.190
<v Speaker 1>So it's also good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1060
00:56:05.191 --> 00:56:06.024
<v Speaker 1>I know what it's a shame for science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction because it makes a nice thing </v>

1061
00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:09.923
<v Speaker 1>that we try to make things more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated than they are because </v>

1062
00:56:11.551 --> 00:56:16.050
<v Speaker 1>they're so complicated as it is dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter for instance,</v>

1063
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.990
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it boggles the mind that we don't really</v>

1064
00:56:18.991 --> 00:56:22.130
<v Speaker 1>totally understand what 90 plus percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1065
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does that stuff,</v>

1066
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:26.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want me to tell you my theory?</v>

1067
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.733
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

1068
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:29.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

1069
00:56:29.321 --> 00:56:32.920
<v Speaker 1>it's part of a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know,</v>

1070
00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:37.280
<v Speaker 1>about 15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must've years of passing back on,</v>

1071
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.270
<v Speaker 1>remember how long ago now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had this idea,</v>

1072
00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:42.213
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe as a whole is expanding </v>

1073
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.620
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1074
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.350
<v Speaker 1>early in the this century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ask me dates again.</v>

1075
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:54.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people by observing Supernova </v>

1076
00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 1>supernovas saw exposing sauce very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very far away.</v>

1077
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:06.520
<v Speaker 1>They found out that the university is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually accelerating in its expansion.</v>

1078
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:09.610
<v Speaker 1>And some people found this very </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysterious.</v>

1079
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.073
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in all the cosmology books because </v>

1080
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:16.900
<v Speaker 1>there is that expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

1081
00:57:16.901 --> 00:57:21.100
<v Speaker 1>in 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein produced his general theory.</v>

1082
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:26.400
<v Speaker 1>In 1917 he introduced what's called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmological constant.</v>

1083
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:30.460
<v Speaker 1>So you think of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was called lambda,</v>

1084
00:57:30.461 --> 00:57:33.160
<v Speaker 1>you think of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a v shape turned upside down,</v>

1085
00:57:33.161 --> 00:57:33.994
<v Speaker 1>which is a member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he introduced this term for the </v>

1086
00:57:37.241 --> 00:57:40.060
<v Speaker 1>wrong reason because at that time people</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't,</v>

1087
00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:41.493
<v Speaker 1>there was some indication in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe was expanding but not very </v>

1088
00:57:43.691 --> 00:57:44.980
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An Einstein,</v>

1089
00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe didn't know,</v>

1090
00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

1091
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:52.570
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the couples observations hadn't yet come</v>

1092
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:55.450
<v Speaker 1>to make a convincing case of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion.</v>

1093
00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.160
<v Speaker 1>So I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

1094
00:57:57.161 --> 00:57:59.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the universe is static.</v>

1095
00:57:59.081 --> 00:57:59.914
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of philosophically nice to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it's sitting there all the </v>

1096
00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:02.614
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1097
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:06.580
<v Speaker 1>And he couldn't make it do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1098
00:58:06.581 --> 00:58:07.414
<v Speaker 1>so he had to introduce this term called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cosmological constant and he did </v>

1099
00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:16.921
<v Speaker 1>that and then not while very much longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>after this Hobo showed the universe does</v>

1100
00:58:18.911 --> 00:58:19.744
<v Speaker 1>seem to be expanding and Einstein </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded this lamb the term as his </v>

1101
00:58:25.061 --> 00:58:25.894
<v Speaker 1>biggest blunder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an irony because it turns out </v>

1102
00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.453
<v Speaker 1>that this term is probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation for the expansion of the </v>

1103
00:58:33.941 --> 00:58:37.420
<v Speaker 1>universe that we now see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's what people call dark energy.</v>

1104
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the term very much cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's neither dark,</v>

1105
00:58:41.321 --> 00:58:45.280
<v Speaker 1>no proper energy in any clear sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still that was not worry about that.</v>

1106
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:48.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an odd term.</v>

1107
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1108
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a little confusing cause it's dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter as well,</v>

1109
00:58:52.241 --> 00:58:53.350
<v Speaker 1>which is quite different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1110
00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.313
<v Speaker 1>I must be confused with the dark energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it's called of the cosmological </v>

1111
00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.460
<v Speaker 1>constant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which as far as we can tell,</v>

1112
00:59:00.461 --> 00:59:04.120
<v Speaker 1>it is completely consistent with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>observations.</v>

1113
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:06.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a positive number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small,</v>

1114
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:10.240
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be producing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion.</v>

1115
00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:15.550
<v Speaker 1>And I'm quite happy with that viewpoint </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it leads to a picture,</v>

1116
00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:18.360
<v Speaker 1>which I've been trying to plug for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile now,</v>

1117
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:21.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe up to 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

1118
00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea,</v>

1119
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I said it's hard to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let me try.</v>

1120
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:29.593
<v Speaker 1>It came about because I was worrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the remote future and I was </v>

1121
00:59:33.951 --> 00:59:34.960
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1122
00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:36.980
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When these black holes around,</v>

1123
00:59:36.981 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 1>they swallowed up all the stars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just sitting around.</v>

1124
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.490
<v Speaker 1>And what's the most next exciting thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening?</v>

1125
00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hawking evaporation,</v>

1126
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:46.063
<v Speaker 1>they're going to radiate away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Hawking showed that black holes </v>

1127
00:59:48.861 --> 00:59:51.710
<v Speaker 1>had this temperature extremely cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

1128
00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:52.563
<v Speaker 1>these enormous ones are absurdly cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much colder than anything made on the </v>

1129
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:58.490
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1130
00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:01.850
<v Speaker 1>but when the universe expands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expands and expands,</v>

1131
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:03.860
<v Speaker 1>it gets colder than the black holes.</v>

1132
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:06.500
<v Speaker 1>And so those black holes become the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hottest,</v>

1133
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.560
<v Speaker 1>hottest things around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they radiate away very,</v>

1134
01:00:09.561 --> 01:00:10.394
<v Speaker 1>very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This hawking radiation and that carries </v>

1135
01:00:13.821 --> 01:00:14.654
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they shrink and the shrink and </v>

1136
01:00:15.891 --> 01:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>the shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally they disappear with a pop.</v>

1137
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I said pop is probably a pretty big </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion,</v>

1138
01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not that big from a cosmological</v>

1139
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.180
<v Speaker 1>astrophysical scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the disappear,</v>

1140
01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.553
<v Speaker 1>well it may have been pretty boring when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting around waiting for the </v>

1141
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:35.900
<v Speaker 1>black hole to go pop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But afterwards that's really boring.</v>

1142
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:37.063
<v Speaker 1>So this was picture I thought off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being rather depressed by it thinking </v>

1143
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>that stats are that fate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the faith of all the interesting</v>

1144
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:46.034
<v Speaker 1>things happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimate fate is this unbelievably </v>

1145
01:00:48.261 --> 01:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>boring final state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1146
01:00:51.051 --> 01:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>this is an emotional argument but it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives me a bit of leeway.</v>

1147
01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.513
<v Speaker 1>So I began to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's not going to be us who are </v>

1148
01:00:58.341 --> 01:00:59.174
<v Speaker 1>going to be bored because we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be around the main things that </v>

1149
01:01:02.661 --> 01:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>will be around.</v>

1150
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.033
<v Speaker 1>We'll be photons and it's pretty hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>borrow a photon for two very good </v>

1151
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:10.694
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is it probably doesn't have </v>

1152
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>conscious experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not about sure.</v>

1153
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:14.503
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other is more of the science </v>

1154
01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:20.891
<v Speaker 1>point that they don't measure time cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>the photon has no mass.</v>

1155
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.730
<v Speaker 1>It travels at the speed of light and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way relativity works,</v>

1156
01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:30.731
<v Speaker 1>it means that clocks stop if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it had experiences it,</v>

1157
01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:32.483
<v Speaker 1>the moment of its creation would be one </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment and the next moment would be </v>

1158
01:01:34.671 --> 01:01:35.504
<v Speaker 1>infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're just zip up to infinity </v>

1159
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:41.960
<v Speaker 1>without noticing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now she had been doing work on this kind</v>

1160
01:01:41.961 --> 01:01:42.794
<v Speaker 1>of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking more about gravitational </v>

1161
01:01:43.971 --> 01:01:46.460
<v Speaker 1>radiation and how you measure it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and things like that.</v>

1162
01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And it was a very useful picture too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Squashed down infinity.</v>

1163
01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:52.883
<v Speaker 1>A useful thing to think about here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you seen these pictures by the Dutch </v>

1164
01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:57.254
<v Speaker 1>artist Mc Escher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are those which are called </v>

1165
01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:00.614
<v Speaker 1>circle limits and there's a very famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>one with angels and devils interlocking </v>

1166
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:06.740
<v Speaker 1>and they get all crowded up until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>edge.</v>

1167
01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:07.763
<v Speaker 1>They weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think about is that this </v>

1168
01:02:08.931 --> 01:02:09.764
<v Speaker 1>is a kind of geometry called hyperbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry and the angels and devils live </v>

1169
01:02:13.821 --> 01:02:17.870
<v Speaker 1>in that geometry and the ones right </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the edge think they're the same</v>

1170
01:02:17.871 --> 01:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>size and same shape as the ones in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

1171
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you good?</v>

1172
01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1173
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is that if you look at </v>

1174
01:02:28.351 --> 01:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>it from the angels and devils point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

1175
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>that's infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that boundary.</v>

1176
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.013
<v Speaker 1>But from our point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can look at it and we have what's </v>

1177
01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>called a conformal map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That picture is a conformal map,</v>

1178
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>but that means is that little shapes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite consistently drawn,</v>

1179
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:46.703
<v Speaker 1>but they can be big or small and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't care about whether they're big or </v>

1180
01:02:49.861 --> 01:02:50.694
<v Speaker 1>they're small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small shapes are accurate or angles if </v>

1181
01:02:54.421 --> 01:02:55.254
<v Speaker 1>you like her correctly drawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's what's called a conformal map </v>

1182
01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:01.710
<v Speaker 1>and that can form a map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describes infinity.</v>

1183
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Now you can do the same thing to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

1184
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.353
<v Speaker 1>When I say do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can imagine it where this </v>

1185
01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.084
<v Speaker 1>remote future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can squash it down just like in the </v>

1186
01:03:11.881 --> 01:03:16.881
<v Speaker 1>essure picture to a finite boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as the things with no mass,</v>

1187
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:19.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a way of measuring how </v>
<v Speaker 1>big or small it is.</v>

1188
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>The maxwell equations don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>

1189
01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.010
<v Speaker 1>they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that work just as well for smaller,</v>

1190
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:25.853
<v Speaker 1>so big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can stretch it in someplace and </v>

1191
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:27.714
<v Speaker 1>squash it somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as the stretching and squashing </v>

1192
01:03:29.761 --> 01:03:30.594
<v Speaker 1>is isotropic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just as much one way as the other </v>

1193
01:03:32.581 --> 01:03:33.414
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means more or less that you keep </v>

1194
01:03:34.981 --> 01:03:36.690
<v Speaker 1>what I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The light cones there,</v>

1195
01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:37.953
<v Speaker 1>and that's not going to details here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means that that if you have </v>

1196
01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:45.660
<v Speaker 1>things without mass and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the photons,</v>

1197
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.033
<v Speaker 1>then that boundary is just like anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>else and the photons goes zipping up to </v>

1198
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:53.340
<v Speaker 1>it and so you might think they got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have somewhere to go,</v>

1199
01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a,</v>

1200
01:03:55.890 --> 01:03:58.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was the point of view.</v>

1201
01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.800
<v Speaker 1>I had the photons need the need </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere to enter it in a way,</v>

1202
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:05.520
<v Speaker 1>but then where does it go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the other picture,</v>

1203
01:04:05.521 --> 01:04:07.740
<v Speaker 1>which is the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the big bang.</v>

1204
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Now you can do a similar sort of trick </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1205
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.593
<v Speaker 1>which is stretching it out and making it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a boundary and that can be done </v>

1206
01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:17.724
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played around with these ideas for a </v>

1207
01:04:19.051 --> 01:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>long time and the standard cosmology </v>
<v Speaker 1>models you can do it with,</v>

1208
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:27.230
<v Speaker 1>but the more complicated cosmology </v>
<v Speaker 1>models you might have one,</v>

1209
01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:29.940
<v Speaker 1>which is very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Bang.</v>

1210
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.370
<v Speaker 1>The general ones don't look like that at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1211
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:33.503
<v Speaker 1>so you need to condition which tells you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the big bang was a very special </v>

1212
01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:38.784
<v Speaker 1>kind that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all tied up with this thing called </v>

1213
01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:41.994
<v Speaker 1>the second law of thermodynamics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all ties together with physics </v>

1214
01:04:44.221 --> 01:04:46.290
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which perhaps we don't have time to talk</v>

1215
01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:47.124
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed to me a really good idea </v>

1216
01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:52.043
<v Speaker 1>to have the condition on the big bang </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could continue it in the same </v>

1217
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:55.674
<v Speaker 1>way I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of doing this was a former </v>

1218
01:04:58.171 --> 01:04:59.880
<v Speaker 1>student of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Todd,</v>

1219
01:04:59.881 --> 01:05:03.790
<v Speaker 1>who's a colleague of mine and he used </v>
<v Speaker 1>this continuum,</v>

1220
01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:04.653
<v Speaker 1>conform or continuation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a nice way of saying what the </v>

1221
01:05:08.161 --> 01:05:10.500
<v Speaker 1>condition is on the big bang to give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>

1222
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>but that's a huge condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it nevertheless,</v>

1223
01:05:14.191 --> 01:05:17.850
<v Speaker 1>it's what starts our universe off in in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

1224
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:21.940
<v Speaker 2>very special state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what we live off.</v>

1225
01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:22.774
<v Speaker 2>In a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the second law of thermodynamics </v>

1226
01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.710
<v Speaker 2>needs that to get going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1227
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you want to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1228
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:28.743
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point was that it looks as though </v>

1229
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:36.361
<v Speaker 2>it's a good condition on the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also should be conformally.</v>

1230
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a boundary,</v>

1231
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:41.290
<v Speaker 2>which if you had no mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't notice it.</v>

1232
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.113
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got particles with mass running </v>

1233
01:05:44.051 --> 01:05:44.884
<v Speaker 2>around near the Big Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as you get closer and closer and </v>

1234
01:05:46.871 --> 01:05:49.410
<v Speaker 2>closer to the energy goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the temperature goes zooming,</v>

1235
01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:50.283
<v Speaker 2>zooming up these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zipping around at such a speed that the </v>

1236
01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:57.991
<v Speaker 2>energy of their emotion is much bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the equals MC squared mass.</v>

1237
01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:00.723
<v Speaker 2>Einstein's mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the energy in the mass as a certain </v>

1238
01:06:05.471 --> 01:06:08.620
<v Speaker 2>amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when they get so hot,</v>

1239
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:09.603
<v Speaker 2>you can forget about the mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they like photons behave like </v>

1240
01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.330
<v Speaker 2>particles without mass.</v>

1241
01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:19.330
<v Speaker 2>And so they're just interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conformal geometry.</v>

1242
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:20.793
<v Speaker 2>So the crazy idea I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just only you stretch out the big </v>

1243
01:06:23.921 --> 01:06:26.080
<v Speaker 2>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he squashed on the infinity,</v>

1244
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:31.770
<v Speaker 2>but maybe our big bang was squashed down</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinity of a previous Ian.</v>

1245
01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:37.900
<v Speaker 2>So I'm saying our Ian began with a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>bang,</v>

1246
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:41.050
<v Speaker 2>ended up with this exponential </v>
<v Speaker 2>expansion.</v>

1247
01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:44.530
<v Speaker 2>There was another one before us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will be another one astros.</v>

1248
01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.600
<v Speaker 2>There was another one before that and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1249
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.673
<v Speaker 2>So it's an infinite cycle of big banks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the picture and constant </v>

1250
01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:51.184
<v Speaker 2>expansion to the point where there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>more energy and then somehow or another </v>

1251
01:06:53.411 --> 01:06:54.820
<v Speaker 2>a big bang comes out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1252
01:06:54.821 --> 01:06:55.654
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the tricky part that people </v>

1253
01:06:56.651 --> 01:06:57.484
<v Speaker 2>have trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's universally accepted that the big </v>

1254
01:06:59.351 --> 01:07:00.184
<v Speaker 2>bang was an event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no pretty well universally </v>

1255
01:07:02.891 --> 01:07:04.750
<v Speaker 2>theories that are attractive.</v>

1256
01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:08.403
<v Speaker 2>I would say nothing terribly popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certain ideas which say you </v>

1257
01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:16.430
<v Speaker 2>can continue into the before the Big </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang Paul Steinhauser,</v>

1258
01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.180
<v Speaker 2>what are they thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1259
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:21.640
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has things in common with my model,</v>

1260
01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:23.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's not quite the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1261
01:07:23.111 --> 01:07:26.020
<v Speaker 2>and you see it still is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1262
01:07:26.021 --> 01:07:26.854
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't right not long after </v>
<v Speaker 2>Einstein produces theory and this </v>

1263
01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:33.963
<v Speaker 2>Alexandra Friedman who was a Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematical physicist and he produced </v>

1264
01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:38.050
<v Speaker 2>the first cousin cause mammalogy </v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals.</v>

1265
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:42.430
<v Speaker 2>And one of these was the one which has </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of bounces and big bang.</v>

1266
01:07:42.431 --> 01:07:43.264
<v Speaker 2>It expands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it contracts again and it bounces and </v>

1267
01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:47.020
<v Speaker 2>conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was the one of his models.</v>

1268
01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:50.980
<v Speaker 2>The only trouble is if you put </v>
<v Speaker 2>irregularities into these models,</v>

1269
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:52.083
<v Speaker 2>you get black holes and these black </v>
<v Speaker 2>holes component and an incredible mess </v>

1270
01:07:54.851 --> 01:07:55.684
<v Speaker 2>at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't join onto a nice </v>

1271
01:07:56.711 --> 01:07:57.670
<v Speaker 2>smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big bang.</v>

1272
01:07:58.170 --> 01:07:58.780
<v Speaker 2>The next one.</v>

1273
01:07:58.780 --> 01:07:59.613
<v Speaker 2>So you have trouble with those models,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still people take these things </v>

1274
01:08:01.871 --> 01:08:04.490
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I say stanhart and tour,</v>

1275
01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.440
<v Speaker 2>I kind of a model which is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are the things one has to think</v>

1276
01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:11.620
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My own view is that they don't take into</v>

1277
01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:12.790
<v Speaker 2>account the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1278
01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>the black hole problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>

1279
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:16.694
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my one gets rid of that because the </v>

1280
01:08:18.651 --> 01:08:21.320
<v Speaker 2>black holes or evaporate away by hawking</v>
<v Speaker 2>evaporation.</v>

1281
01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's forms a model.</v>

1282
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:27.320
<v Speaker 2>I used to give talks about this feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite happy.</v>

1283
01:08:27.321 --> 01:08:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would ever prove it wrong so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go on and talking.</v>

1284
01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't quite happy with that.</v>

1285
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:36.260
<v Speaker 2>I thought maybe you could see signals </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming through.</v>

1286
01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:39.200
<v Speaker 2>So I had one idea about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more recently,</v>

1287
01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:42.200
<v Speaker 2>and this is only just this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1288
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I have to polish colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Christoph Meisner and Pav on near</v>

1289
01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:48.624
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1290
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:53.770
<v Speaker 2>And there is a Korean who works in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York or Daniel an and we,</v>

1291
01:08:54.591 --> 01:08:55.424
<v Speaker 2>the four of us have a paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think today or tomorrow will be </v>

1292
01:08:59.690 --> 01:09:04.400
<v Speaker 2>the new improved version of this paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be on the archive and this,</v>

1293
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:05.563
<v Speaker 2>the title of the paper is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we seeing hawking points in the cmb </v>

1294
01:09:09.141 --> 01:09:09.831
<v Speaker 2>sky?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1295
01:09:09.831 --> 01:09:11.660
<v Speaker 2>what's a hawking point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

1296
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I talked about the black holes sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the previous aeon two hours,</v>

1297
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:19.610
<v Speaker 2>assuming it's more or less like ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be black holes in clusters of</v>

1298
01:09:19.611 --> 01:09:20.510
<v Speaker 2>galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge,</v>

1299
01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:21.344
<v Speaker 2>enormous ones swallowing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predict pretty well the whole cluster </v>

1300
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.900
<v Speaker 2>and what happens to the energy in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>black holes?</v>

1301
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.943
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes out in hawking radiation and it </v>

1302
01:09:30.141 --> 01:09:33.020
<v Speaker 2>takes an age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ages and ages and ages,</v>

1303
01:09:33.021 --> 01:09:38.021
<v Speaker 2>maybe 10 to a hundred year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google years or something.</v>

1304
01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ages and ages,</v>

1305
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:44.480
<v Speaker 2>but all that energy in the picture comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>up basically one point.</v>

1306
01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.313
<v Speaker 2>Think of that as your picture and right </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the very edge you see that an awful </v>

1307
01:09:48.831 --> 01:09:49.664
<v Speaker 2>lot of angels and devils squashed </v>
<v Speaker 2>together there so that the entire </v>

1308
01:09:53.781 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 2>radiation from that single black hole </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be squashed into that little point.</v>

1309
01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Now where on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we see?</v>

1310
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:02.833
<v Speaker 2>Well there will be a big release of </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy at that point and that's what we </v>

1311
01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:09.680
<v Speaker 2>call the hawking point and it spreads </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1312
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 2>You see what we see in the cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 2>microwave background.</v>

1313
01:10:13.011 --> 01:10:13.844
<v Speaker 2>This is radiation coming from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>directions and this radiation doesn't </v>

1314
01:10:18.621 --> 01:10:20.270
<v Speaker 2>come from the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1315
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.850
<v Speaker 2>It comes from 380,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years after the big bang.</v>

1316
01:10:23.851 --> 01:10:24.684
<v Speaker 2>So there's a sort of last scattering </v>
<v Speaker 2>surface where the photons which are </v>

1317
01:10:27.411 --> 01:10:28.244
<v Speaker 2>trying to get out finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally can escape and we see them now </v>

1318
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:38.770
<v Speaker 2>that spread out from the hawking point </v>
<v Speaker 2>to what you see and the cosmic microwave</v>

1319
01:10:41.811 --> 01:10:42.644
<v Speaker 2>background in the last scattering </v>
<v Speaker 2>surface is something of the diameter of </v>

1320
01:10:46.971 --> 01:10:49.670
<v Speaker 2>about eight times the diameter of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>

1321
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:52.250
<v Speaker 2>No bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no smaller.</v>

1322
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:56.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't see the whole thing because</v>

1323
01:10:56.271 --> 01:10:58.370
<v Speaker 2>our past cone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where were we?</v>

1324
01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:00.770
<v Speaker 2>What we see is to cut across it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't see the whole thing,</v>

1325
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.963
<v Speaker 2>but we see probably most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could imagine something from </v>

1326
01:11:04.881 --> 01:11:07.820
<v Speaker 2>about four to eight times the moon's </v>
<v Speaker 2>diameter,</v>

1327
01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 2>which is a small region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is highly energetic,</v>

1328
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.470
<v Speaker 2>more energetic in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it tapers off as you go to the edge.</v>

1329
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.950
<v Speaker 2>And we seem to see these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the analysis that,</v>

1330
01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the polls,</v>

1331
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:27.530
<v Speaker 2>they have the techniques and the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>analyzing the data.</v>

1332
01:11:28.111 --> 01:11:31.830
<v Speaker 2>This is the planck satellite data was </v>
<v Speaker 2>done by Daniel Lan.</v>

1333
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:33.263
<v Speaker 2>And then we look at the data and we seem</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see an effect which see what you do </v>

1334
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:39.750
<v Speaker 2>is you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got only one universe.</v>

1335
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:40.584
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're complaining about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you know if something's real </v>

1336
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:42.660
<v Speaker 2>or not?</v>

1337
01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:43.493
<v Speaker 2>Whether you make zillions of fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>universes and you compare this with </v>

1338
01:11:46.951 --> 01:11:48.840
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of technique about how you</v>

1339
01:11:48.841 --> 01:11:50.400
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1340
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.593
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel first did a thousand of these </v>

1341
01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:57.150
<v Speaker 2>fakes and they were sort of two sizes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these.</v>

1342
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:58.223
<v Speaker 2>You look at these rings to see whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>the temperature goes out from the </v>

1343
01:12:00.031 --> 01:12:03.780
<v Speaker 2>outside to the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were two sizes,</v>

1344
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:08.400
<v Speaker 2>both within the size of the essay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about four degrees across the sky.</v>

1345
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:09.803
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no evidence of them at all in </v>

1346
01:12:13.231 --> 01:12:15.450
<v Speaker 2>the simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a real effect.</v>

1347
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:17.003
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then people were skeptical of this for </v>

1348
01:12:18.241 --> 01:12:20.970
<v Speaker 2>one reason or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Daniel did another,</v>

1349
01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:22.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>

1350
01:12:22.651 --> 01:12:23.484
<v Speaker 2>altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you occasionally the one or two </v>

1351
01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:27.540
<v Speaker 2>which do what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two or three,</v>

1352
01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:28.374
<v Speaker 2>to be precise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you see this effect in the </v>

1353
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.240
<v Speaker 2>simulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you work out the probability that</v>

1354
01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:34.074
<v Speaker 2>this is a real effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come up with a confidence level of </v>

1355
01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:40.350
<v Speaker 2>99.98%</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is a real effect.</v>

1356
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:43.770
<v Speaker 2>So we're waiting to see what people say </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

1357
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:47.610
<v Speaker 2>What are your thoughts on multiverses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1358
01:12:47.611 --> 01:12:48.444
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is different because this is the </v>

1359
01:12:50.761 --> 01:12:51.750
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sequential.</v>

1360
01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't call it a multiverse.</v>

1361
01:12:54.001 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 2>They each influence the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're not independent worlds.</v>

1362
01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the,</v>

1363
01:12:59.410 --> 01:13:01.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of Independent.</v>

1364
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1365
01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:04.254
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two reasons for believing </v>

1366
01:13:05.761 --> 01:13:06.594
<v Speaker 2>multiverses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is the quantum reason that </v>

1367
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:10.733
<v Speaker 2>maybe we have the shorting this dead and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the livecast they in different worlds </v>

1368
01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:18.300
<v Speaker 2>and they separate universes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that argument.</v>

1369
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the right way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at quantum mechanics,</v>

1370
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:21.474
<v Speaker 2>but many people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that suggests that you might have </v>

1371
01:13:23.731 --> 01:13:27.120
<v Speaker 2>these multiple universities and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense on attractive about that to you.</v>

1372
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:31.680
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't explain what we see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he wanted a theory which explains the</v>

1373
01:13:31.681 --> 01:13:34.050
<v Speaker 2>world we see and the world we see.</v>

1374
01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:38.400
<v Speaker 2>You get collapse the state does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to explain that,</v>

1375
01:13:38.401 --> 01:13:39.234
<v Speaker 2>well it's only because we've drifted off</v>
<v Speaker 2>into some world and another version of </v>

1376
01:13:42.631 --> 01:13:43.464
<v Speaker 2>ourselves as drift into another one and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some c one and the other side of the </v>

1377
01:13:45.901 --> 01:13:50.901
<v Speaker 2>other and they're all in super position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't explain why you see one world</v>

1378
01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:54.913
<v Speaker 2>and she has this kind of coherence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean lots of people try and there are </v>

1379
01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:00.900
<v Speaker 2>many attempts at the sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1380
01:14:00.901 --> 01:14:05.100
<v Speaker 2>it's quite a widely held view and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe quantum mechanics,</v>

1381
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:08.010
<v Speaker 2>the collapse is not real and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1382
01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:09.413
<v Speaker 2>And all the alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dead cats on the cab coexists in </v>

1383
01:14:12.401 --> 01:14:14.560
<v Speaker 2>different worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the interpretation.</v>

1384
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:17.770
<v Speaker 2>That's a view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that I want,</v>

1385
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:20.530
<v Speaker 2>I want an explanation for the world we </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in.</v>

1386
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:26.040
<v Speaker 2>And you don't see cast different worlds </v>
<v Speaker 2>with cats and well it's a long story,</v>

1387
01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:27.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1388
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:28.323
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a view you can hold to and if you </v>

1389
01:14:30.581 --> 01:14:32.110
<v Speaker 2>don't want to monkey with quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics,</v>

1390
01:14:32.111 --> 01:14:34.480
<v Speaker 2>it's where you lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1391
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:36.010
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the alternative.</v>

1392
01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:36.873
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't make a single try to change </v>

1393
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.053
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you are led to this multi </v>

1394
01:14:43.601 --> 01:14:45.070
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

1395
01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:45.933
<v Speaker 2>many world picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it even doesn't make that much </v>

1396
01:14:49.571 --> 01:14:51.220
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to be careful about it.</v>

1397
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:53.480
<v Speaker 2>That whether they are really like </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

1398
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:56.290
<v Speaker 2>distinct worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it really,</v>

1399
01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.870
<v Speaker 2>my view is it doesn't really work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me not try and attack that.</v>

1400
01:14:58.871 --> 01:14:59.704
<v Speaker 2>And I think I have a different view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that the theory is not quite </v>

1401
01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:04.450
<v Speaker 2>quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1402
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.970
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1403
01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:09.820
<v Speaker 2>there is something which makes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse into a physical process.</v>

1404
01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.313
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1405
01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:13.563
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only one world now the other </v>

1406
01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:19.720
<v Speaker 2>many worlds view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is comes from a different reason.</v>

1407
01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.370
<v Speaker 2>And that is that that seem there seem to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be various accidents,</v>

1408
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:26.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1409
01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:27.363
<v Speaker 2>well maybe one of them being that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutron is just slightly more massive </v>

1410
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:32.440
<v Speaker 2>than the Proton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>

1411
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:33.603
<v Speaker 2>There are lots of other accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see that if they were a little </v>

1412
01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:38.500
<v Speaker 2>different than life as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't happen.</v>

1413
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:41.140
<v Speaker 2>And so how do you explain this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1414
01:15:41.141 --> 01:15:42.250
<v Speaker 2>some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1415
01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:47.280
<v Speaker 2>all these universes with different </v>
<v Speaker 2>values of these constants all coexist.</v>

1416
01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:48.963
<v Speaker 2>It's just we only see the one that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in because the numbers come out right </v>

1417
01:15:52.031 --> 01:15:52.864
<v Speaker 2>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's called an anthropic </v>

1418
01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1419
01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I can see the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it much.</v>

1420
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.160
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we need a better explanation for</v>

1421
01:16:03.161 --> 01:16:05.080
<v Speaker 2>why the numbers are what we see and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1422
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:08.920
<v Speaker 2>But that's that that one makes more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense to me than the other one.</v>

1423
01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.473
<v Speaker 2>So I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe it has to take that </v>

1424
01:16:12.971 --> 01:16:13.804
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly not the view I'm </v>

1425
01:16:15.191 --> 01:16:20.191
<v Speaker 2>presenting here with this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for someone like me.</v>

1426
01:16:20.351 --> 01:16:21.184
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting to know that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>still a considerable amount of </v>

1427
01:16:23.861 --> 01:16:25.510
<v Speaker 2>speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1428
01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

1429
01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:30.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of speculation,</v>

1430
01:16:30.401 --> 01:16:31.234
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it is pretty off the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a lot of people think mine are </v>

1431
01:16:34.871 --> 01:16:38.410
<v Speaker 2>off the wall and see who's to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1432
01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no man,</v>

1433
01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:41.230
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1434
01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:43.003
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did think in decent things in the </v>

1435
01:16:44.591 --> 01:16:45.424
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just didn't trust this abuse is </v>

1436
01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.240
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess that's what people think.</v>

1437
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you see,</v>

1438
01:16:50.291 --> 01:16:52.000
<v Speaker 2>if it was just me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could understand that.</v>

1439
01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:53.523
<v Speaker 2>But I've got these posts and I went an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Armenian colleague who's done things on </v>

1440
01:16:57.221 --> 01:16:58.054
<v Speaker 2>this two and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't be that we all all off the </v>

1441
01:17:00.551 --> 01:17:02.230
<v Speaker 2>rails I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1442
01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:04.930
<v Speaker 2>there's something out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now with their talking points,</v>

1443
01:17:04.931 --> 01:17:05.764
<v Speaker 2>there's something people can really go </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and look for and if they don't see </v>

1444
01:17:08.831 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 2>you and something funny going on</v>

1445
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.450
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they do see them,</v>

1446
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.160
<v Speaker 1>there's something else going funny on </v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1447
01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:17.250
<v Speaker 1>which they'll have to think of another </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation unless it's my explanation.</v>

1448
01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.320
<v Speaker 1>They'll have to think of a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>view from the current inflation view,</v>

1449
01:17:21.321 --> 01:17:24.770
<v Speaker 1>which is in real trouble with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>observations as far as I can see.</v>

1450
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you anticipate in any foreseeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>time in the future,</v>

1451
01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:28.653
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better understanding of dark matter </v>

1452
01:17:29.901 --> 01:17:34.490
<v Speaker 1>and dark energy or perhaps a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of what those things are?</v>

1453
01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1454
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.810
<v Speaker 1>we see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my,</v>

1455
01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.470
<v Speaker 1>my own current view is that dark energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it's called,</v>

1456
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.220
<v Speaker 1>is the cosmological constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a lot of explanation if you'd</v>

1457
01:17:45.221 --> 01:17:46.120
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because why is it,</v>

1458
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.233
<v Speaker 1>why is it that the value it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it they're tall and they're </v>

1459
01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:52.520
<v Speaker 1>certainly questions about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I agree with.</v>

1460
01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matta.</v>

1461
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the scheme of mine,</v>

1462
01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.260
<v Speaker 1>it has to be there.</v>

1463
01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:04.130
<v Speaker 1>When I say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that if you want the equations to</v>

1464
01:18:04.131 --> 01:18:04.964
<v Speaker 1>make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which crossover from our remote future </v>

1465
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:08.923
<v Speaker 1>to the big bang of the next Ian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a creation of a </v>

1466
01:18:13.761 --> 01:18:16.410
<v Speaker 1>dominant new material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is scaler.</v>

1467
01:18:16.930 --> 01:18:18.410
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't spin.</v>

1468
01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just ordinary particles and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they only interact gravitationally.</v>

1469
01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:26.053
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the theory that I'm putting forward </v>

1470
01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:30.053
<v Speaker 1>would make these things very massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>there about what's called the planck </v>

1471
01:18:34.101 --> 01:18:34.934
<v Speaker 1>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly cause there's some </v>

1472
01:18:36.141 --> 01:18:38.960
<v Speaker 1>freedom in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like the prank planck mass,</v>

1473
01:18:38.961 --> 01:18:42.740
<v Speaker 1>which people describe as the massive of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleas.</v>

1474
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.633
<v Speaker 1>I don't quite know why they make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's about 10 to the minus five </v>

1475
01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:49.304
<v Speaker 1>grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're looking at the 100000th of a </v>

1476
01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:56.660
<v Speaker 1>gram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of an appreciable size.</v>

1477
01:18:56.661 --> 01:18:59.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like basic particles in physics</v>

1478
01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:00.620
<v Speaker 1>measurable.</v>

1479
01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:01.453
<v Speaker 1>It's the sort of measurable thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could imagine you could get that get </v>

1480
01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:05.354
<v Speaker 1>hold of in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's huge for for a fundamental </v>

1481
01:19:08.361 --> 01:19:10.160
<v Speaker 1>particle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

1482
01:19:10.161 --> 01:19:12.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a wild idea from that point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>

1483
01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 1>But also they should decay and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should decay into gravitational signals,</v>

1484
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:20.600
<v Speaker 1>which may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be seen by Lego,</v>

1485
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.943
<v Speaker 1>maybe have been seen by lego and thrown </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the rubbish bin because they'd be </v>

1486
01:19:27.201 --> 01:19:30.080
<v Speaker 1>different types of signals from what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would expect.</v>

1487
01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't like to put my money anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1488
01:19:33.321 --> 01:19:34.154
<v Speaker 1>but I'm lacking hoping that these dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter particles are the ones that come </v>

1489
01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:42.080
<v Speaker 1>from the theory that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm putting forward.</v>

1490
01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.090
<v Speaker 1>So that will be another consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular point of view.</v>

1491
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And they've observed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

1492
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:53.270
<v Speaker 1>entire galaxies that they believe are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the consist of dark matter.</v>

1493
01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.300
<v Speaker 1>There is Liz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see if I remember what it is.</v>

1494
01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.330
<v Speaker 1>There's some galaxies the other way </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

1495
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:01.550
<v Speaker 1>which don't seem to have any dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

1496
01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 1>There are other galaxies which have huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts.</v>

1497
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.350
<v Speaker 1>That's probably what you're referring </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1498
01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:08.090
<v Speaker 1>whether they were only dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine</v>

1499
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:10.370
<v Speaker 2>you'd have trouble seeing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right because dot.</v>

1500
01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Mazur off til he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a measured thing.</v>

1501
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 2>It may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that one.</v>

1502
01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:17.280
<v Speaker 2>It's quite possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1503
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:20.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1504
01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:24.210
<v Speaker 2>they just have to have some reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>they clump together in this way.</v>

1505
01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:28.320
<v Speaker 2>You see it's quite possible if galaxies </v>
<v Speaker 2>collide,</v>

1506
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:32.310
<v Speaker 2>then when you see the stars tend to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

1507
01:20:32.311 --> 01:20:35.070
<v Speaker 2>so they would accompany with they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>company the dark matter,</v>

1508
01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:39.600
<v Speaker 2>the dust and the galaxies tends to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck and stay where it is.</v>

1509
01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:40.434
<v Speaker 2>So if two collide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'd have a big pile of dust in </v>

1510
01:20:42.541 --> 01:20:43.374
<v Speaker 2>the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the dark matter tends to </v>

1511
01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:49.300
<v Speaker 2>carry on through with the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1512
01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:53.460
<v Speaker 2>There may be some process which could </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce just islands of dark matter.</v>

1513
01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1514
01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.793
<v Speaker 3>When you discussed the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the single most intriguing </v>

1515
01:20:58.291 --> 01:21:03.291
<v Speaker 3>possibility to us as human beings is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what other intelligent life,</v>

1516
01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:06.270
<v Speaker 3>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is out there.</v>

1517
01:21:06.271 --> 01:21:07.104
<v Speaker 3>And how interesting is that to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you spent so much time studying </v>

1518
01:21:10.801 --> 01:21:13.560
<v Speaker 3>the fundamental particles of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe itself.</v>

1519
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:14.693
<v Speaker 3>How interested are you in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of other intelligent life </v>

1520
01:21:18.661 --> 01:21:23.010
<v Speaker 3>forms or have you just like put that out</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the,</v>

1521
01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:23.844
<v Speaker 3>it's just so ridiculously unlikely or so</v>
<v Speaker 3>far away from us that we're probably </v>

1522
01:21:28.621 --> 01:21:29.580
<v Speaker 3>never going to make contact.</v>

1523
01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:30.563
<v Speaker 2>Where do you see it's not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this Seti program looking at </v>

1524
01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:37.860
<v Speaker 2>to see where they can see signals from </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to civilizations.</v>

1525
01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:42.990
<v Speaker 2>The problem there from my perspective is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that although they might be out there,</v>

1526
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:47.340
<v Speaker 2>they've got to have had a real headstart</v>
<v Speaker 2>on us before he would see them.</v>

1527
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:51.140
<v Speaker 2>They might have done so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I dunno,</v>

1528
01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:53.610
<v Speaker 2>you see actually via,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes to John,</v>

1529
01:21:53.611 --> 01:21:58.611
<v Speaker 2>who's my Armenian colleague and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked also for these ring shaped things</v>

1530
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:01.890
<v Speaker 2>and looked at them in a different way </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Polish people.</v>

1531
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:05.190
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we seem to have seen something there.</v>

1532
01:22:05.191 --> 01:22:06.024
<v Speaker 2>But we wrote a paper in which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>speculated on beings from the previous </v>

1533
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:11.904
<v Speaker 2>Ian communicating with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the advantage there is that you're </v>

1534
01:22:16.501 --> 01:22:18.790
<v Speaker 2>looking at the really advanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations,</v>

1535
01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.580
<v Speaker 2>really the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see</v>

1536
01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.673
<v Speaker 3>billions of years ago that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their universe disappeared and then had </v>

1537
01:22:27.951 --> 01:22:32.330
<v Speaker 3>to come back to a big bank statements </v>
<v Speaker 3>and those could come through and somehow</v>

1538
01:22:32.331 --> 01:22:34.730
<v Speaker 3>or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those signals Romaine.</v>

1539
01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.440
<v Speaker 3>It's conceivable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1540
01:22:36.441 --> 01:22:38.330
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty far fetched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1541
01:22:38.331 --> 01:22:39.710
<v Speaker 3>who knows what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Ian's,</v>

1542
01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:41.840
<v Speaker 3>how many billions of years are you </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about?</v>

1543
01:22:41.841 --> 01:22:43.280
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big bang.</v>

1544
01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:45.050
<v Speaker 3>14 billion.</v>

1545
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you see that's way,</v>

1546
01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.960
<v Speaker 2>way at the beginning in a sense or at </v>
<v Speaker 2>three quarters of the way through.</v>

1547
01:22:51.961 --> 01:22:52.794
<v Speaker 2>In another sense it depends on how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>draw the picture in the sense of </v>

1548
01:22:57.450 --> 01:22:58.800
<v Speaker 2>interestingness or</v>

1549
01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:03.490
<v Speaker 3>formal picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are already three quarters of the way</v>

1550
01:23:03.491 --> 01:23:05.800
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 14 billion now.</v>

1551
01:23:05.801 --> 01:23:06.730
<v Speaker 3>So we have</v>

1552
01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:07.753
<v Speaker 1>how much content does he is you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble is it's this a cheat to cheat </v>

1553
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:14.660
<v Speaker 1>the year count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as much as you like.</v>

1554
01:23:14.661 --> 01:23:15.494
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the on on something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mass has to feed out and how you </v>

1555
01:23:19.851 --> 01:23:24.851
<v Speaker 1>measure the time it becomes problematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's either infinity you see,</v>

1556
01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:30.251
<v Speaker 1>which isn't much use or you might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>different definitions of time,</v>

1557
01:23:30.741 --> 01:23:31.574
<v Speaker 1>which depends on what particle you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using as your clocks and things like </v>

1558
01:23:33.531 --> 01:23:33.840
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1559
01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:34.673
<v Speaker 3>So are you essentially saying that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely possible that we are the </v>

1560
01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:42.810
<v Speaker 3>furthest in terms of our technological </v>
<v Speaker 3>achievement and our understanding of the</v>

1561
01:23:42.811 --> 01:23:45.780
<v Speaker 3>universe itself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's possible that we're at the front of</v>

1562
01:23:45.781 --> 01:23:46.614
<v Speaker 3>the line though there might be some </v>
<v Speaker 3>other intelligent life forms in the </v>

1563
01:23:48.631 --> 01:23:50.940
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they might be behind us.</v>

1564
01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Well there would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1565
01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying they got through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

1566
01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.800
<v Speaker 1>well maybe they have techniques for </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting through,</v>

1567
01:23:56.801 --> 01:23:58.840
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bit hard to imagine.</v>

1568
01:23:59.530 --> 01:24:00.160
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1569
01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.490
<v Speaker 1>maybe information from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgee it through and maybe you mean from</v>

1570
01:24:03.491 --> 01:24:04.680
<v Speaker 1>the previous els?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1571
01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.600
<v Speaker 1>They might have got through like somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another survived.</v>

1572
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:08.583
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it would have to be in the form of </v>

1573
01:24:10.181 --> 01:24:11.790
<v Speaker 1>photons or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1574
01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I know you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1575
01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculators.</v>

1576
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In coding information.</v>

1577
01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.000
<v Speaker 1>The photons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1578
01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:19.893
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1579
01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:21.003
<v Speaker 1>It's conceivable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say that I see it </v>

1580
01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:24.424
<v Speaker 1>happening or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not out of the question that </v>

1581
01:24:26.531 --> 01:24:31.180
<v Speaker 1>they could develop some technology which</v>
<v Speaker 1>would get information,</v>

1582
01:24:31.181 --> 01:24:34.790
<v Speaker 1>which might be them in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1583
01:24:34.810 --> 01:24:36.430
<v Speaker 1>across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the form of photons.</v>

1584
01:24:36.650 --> 01:24:37.483
<v Speaker 3>But you're not optimistic about current </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent life somewhere in the </v>

1585
01:24:40.011 --> 01:24:40.844
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

1586
01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Not too optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because,</v>

1587
01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:48.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it took us a long time to get</v>

1588
01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:52.240
<v Speaker 1>going because the dinosaurs were there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a while and somebody might've got in</v>

1589
01:24:52.241 --> 01:24:53.074
<v Speaker 1>there earlier and they're different </v>
<v Speaker 1>planets and they could've got there </v>

1590
01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:57.070
<v Speaker 1>quite ahead of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1591
01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.050
<v Speaker 1>it's conceivable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to rule it out.</v>

1592
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I just not terribly optimistic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1593
01:25:02.741 --> 01:25:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's worth doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth looking.</v>

1594
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.943
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not something that you're </v>

1595
01:25:06.391 --> 01:25:08.090
<v Speaker 1>really not servicing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm expecting.</v>

1596
01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I be curious.</v>

1597
01:25:10.001 --> 01:25:10.834
<v Speaker 1>Certainly then I'm not expecting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess is it just because of the </v>

1598
01:25:13.301 --> 01:25:14.134
<v Speaker 1>overall lack of real evidence and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not an attractive thing for you to </v>

1599
01:25:20.561 --> 01:25:22.150
<v Speaker 1>pursue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite attractive.</v>

1600
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.290
<v Speaker 1>It's short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1601
01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:25.293
<v Speaker 1>I've just been doing other things and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know there's enough to do in the </v>

1602
01:25:28.241 --> 01:25:33.241
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really come to terms that very</v>

1603
01:25:35.231 --> 01:25:35.800
<v Speaker 1>hugely.</v>

1604
01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.700
<v Speaker 1>So I know there's this activity and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be interested to see if any kind of,</v>

1605
01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:40.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this,</v>

1606
01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:45.250
<v Speaker 1>there was this thing that came past that</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people speculated was sent there by</v>

1607
01:25:45.251 --> 01:25:46.084
<v Speaker 1>and different intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which came quite close in our solar </v>

1608
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:50.771
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1609
01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:53.380
<v Speaker 1>that was that strange looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This trailer shaved.</v>

1610
01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.233
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1611
01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:55.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1612
01:25:55.121 --> 01:25:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any real reason to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's alien supposedly because of the way</v>

1613
01:25:59.381 --> 01:26:02.660
<v Speaker 1>it was traveling though was the idea or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1614
01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I really serious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what these people did suggest.</v>

1615
01:26:05.391 --> 01:26:08.750
<v Speaker 1>It might be something sent by an alien </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

1616
01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:13.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's worth you if one could make </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect with it in some way.</v>

1617
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:16.910
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's too far away now.</v>

1618
01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:20.150
<v Speaker 1>He wants another thing that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniquely fascinating for us.</v>

1619
01:26:20.151 --> 01:26:23.240
<v Speaker 1>The concept of sale of another of </v>
<v Speaker 1>another life form out there.</v>

1620
01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1621
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No you see there are lots of things I'm </v>

1622
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:29.743
<v Speaker 1>interested in the ones I talked to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and perhaps some of the main </v>

1623
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.863
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the consciousness one is I'm </v>

1624
01:26:36.171 --> 01:26:40.970
<v Speaker 1>glad that there are people doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this is one of the things,</v>

1625
01:26:40.971 --> 01:26:45.971
<v Speaker 1>there's this institute that's that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being created using my name and uh,</v>

1626
01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:51.730
<v Speaker 1>James Tag is involved with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started it and I was quite,</v>

1627
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not admitting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about having my name attached to</v>

1628
01:26:55.971 --> 01:26:57.440
<v Speaker 1>this thing when I didn't know much about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1629
01:26:57.650 --> 01:26:58.483
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me a really important </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing where you can deliberate purpose </v>

1630
01:27:04.521 --> 01:27:09.521
<v Speaker 1>of it is to develop ideas which are make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense but are not mainstream.</v>

1631
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:13.460
<v Speaker 1>And one of these was the consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1632
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1633
01:27:14.541 --> 01:27:15.374
<v Speaker 1>Stuart Hameroff is doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a activity that's being </v>

1634
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:24.680
<v Speaker 1>taken pot people researching it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in detail in other parts of the world.</v>

1635
01:27:25.190 --> 01:27:26.023
<v Speaker 1>So to have a place which supports that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing is great and I think </v>

1636
01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:33.170
<v Speaker 1>that's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I heard about it at first,</v>

1637
01:27:33.171 --> 01:27:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1638
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:38.840
<v Speaker 1>most of my interests are on the physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>side and not so much in biology,</v>

1639
01:27:38.841 --> 01:27:39.674
<v Speaker 1>which I'm pretty ignorant about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are lots of ideas on that </v>

1640
01:27:42.981 --> 01:27:44.900
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the cosmology,</v>

1641
01:27:44.901 --> 01:27:45.734
<v Speaker 1>but ideas and building experiments which</v>
<v Speaker 1>might detect the collapse of the wave </v>

1642
01:27:52.941 --> 01:27:53.774
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one idea to look at Bose-einstein </v>

1643
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:57.343
<v Speaker 1>condensates said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a colleague that's Yvette </v>

1644
01:27:59.301 --> 01:28:04.301
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] who I knew about and who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas of how to use,</v>

1645
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:06.283
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bose-einstein condensates to detect </v>

1646
01:28:09.591 --> 01:28:11.930
<v Speaker 1>gravitational waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also very,</v>

1647
01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a mainstream way of looking at it,</v>

1648
01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.433
<v Speaker 1>but a very clever idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Bose-einstein condensates </v>

1649
01:28:18.891 --> 01:28:21.650
<v Speaker 1>because that's so quantum mechanical and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so cold,</v>

1650
01:28:21.651 --> 01:28:22.484
<v Speaker 1>they're almost virtually absolute zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can keep external disturbances </v>

1651
01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.513
<v Speaker 1>from causing problems and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate them in ways to make them in </v>

1652
01:28:35.841 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 1>two places at once.</v>

1653
01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:37.753
<v Speaker 1>People have done this kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it might well be a good way of </v>

1654
01:28:40.521 --> 01:28:42.860
<v Speaker 1>testing the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Schrodinger cat thing.</v>

1655
01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.530
<v Speaker 1>And we went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1656
01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:49.070
<v Speaker 1>whether the state reduction or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse of way function is a phenomenon</v>

1657
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:54.350
<v Speaker 1>in which is kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I hope might be like gravitational</v>

1658
01:28:54.441 --> 01:28:56.320
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in,</v>

1659
01:28:56.321 --> 01:28:57.650
<v Speaker 1>in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it is,</v>

1660
01:28:57.651 --> 01:28:59.750
<v Speaker 1>then that will be relevant to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness problem.</v>

1661
01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 1>So all these things tied in various </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1662
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:05.280
<v Speaker 1>And so the hope was that these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>

1663
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:07.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1664
01:29:07.021 --> 01:29:07.854
<v Speaker 1>could be supported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was important because </v>

1665
01:29:10.171 --> 01:29:13.980
<v Speaker 1>there's always the danger of such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>institute being regarded as flaky,</v>

1666
01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:16.560
<v Speaker 1>but he's doing weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

1667
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.903
<v Speaker 1>So the important point from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is that they should be </v>

1668
01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:21.323
<v Speaker 1>things which can me and either now </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately tested experimentally or </v>

1669
01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:30.870
<v Speaker 1>when a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that things which are really,</v>

1670
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:31.793
<v Speaker 1>you can get your hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get and test them and see </v>

1671
01:29:33.811 --> 01:29:34.740
<v Speaker 1>whether they're right or not.</v>

1672
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:37.940
<v Speaker 1>So this would be a protection against </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking of,</v>

1673
01:29:37.941 --> 01:29:38.774
<v Speaker 1>well these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these crazy ideas that are being </v>

1674
01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:40.914
<v Speaker 1>pursued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be ideas which are capable </v>

1675
01:29:43.591 --> 01:29:46.740
<v Speaker 1>of tests and have a reasonable chance </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1676
01:29:46.770 --> 01:29:47.603
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of showing evidence in favor in their </v>

1677
01:29:50.431 --> 01:29:51.570
<v Speaker 1>favor or against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1678
01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:55.020
<v Speaker 1>whichever would be interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to know.</v>

1679
01:29:55.230 --> 01:29:56.063
<v Speaker 1>So from the outside looking in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it's so fascinating to watch </v>

1680
01:29:59.130 --> 01:29:59.963
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yourself that are bouncing these </v>

1681
01:30:03.391 --> 01:30:06.210
<v Speaker 1>ideas around that are possible but are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not mainstream.</v>

1682
01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:10.110
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precarious sort of tight rope walk.</v>

1683
01:30:10.111 --> 01:30:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want to say anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous that's not true.</v>

1684
01:30:13.630 --> 01:30:14.463
<v Speaker 1>So he would love to say something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be ridiculous but turns out to </v>

1685
01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:21.210
<v Speaker 1>be in fact accurate and provable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was this dance.</v>

1686
01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1687
01:30:22.861 --> 01:30:23.694
<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course you've got to play with </v>

1688
01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:30.800
<v Speaker 1>ideas which are on the sort of edge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we know otherwise you're stuck with</v>

1689
01:30:30.991 --> 01:30:31.824
<v Speaker 1>what we know.</v>

1690
01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:36.110
<v Speaker 1>And these things will simply get </v>
<v Speaker 1>channeled down the old roots and,</v>

1691
01:30:36.111 --> 01:30:37.850
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be able to break,</v>

1692
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:40.290
<v Speaker 1>break free of those from time to time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not in a,</v>

1693
01:30:40.291 --> 01:30:45.270
<v Speaker 1>in a way which is too crazy to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>examined.</v>

1694
01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:46.133
<v Speaker 1>See whether there's truth in these ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not because of the synchronization </v>

1695
01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:52.650
<v Speaker 1>that people have to go towards Wu or </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards crazy ideas.</v>

1696
01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.870
<v Speaker 1>It is important for the skepticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1697
01:30:54.871 --> 01:30:57.000
<v Speaker 1>And it is important for the scrutiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1698
01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's real,</v>

1699
01:30:58.861 --> 01:31:01.530
<v Speaker 1>it was real danger in that ledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1700
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:02.423
<v Speaker 1>Well you see this is a strange kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem you see because with these </v>

1701
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:08.130
<v Speaker 1>observations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not about,</v>

1702
01:31:08.131 --> 01:31:09.820
<v Speaker 1>they're hawking points which I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing,</v>

1703
01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:14.460
<v Speaker 1>but the earlier ones about black hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>collisions and my Armenian colleague and</v>

1704
01:31:14.461 --> 01:31:15.294
<v Speaker 1>I had written a couple of papers on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we hadn't gotten any response at </v>

1705
01:31:19.531 --> 01:31:20.364
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1706
01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And the Polish people and they'd written</v>
<v Speaker 1>papers,</v>

1707
01:31:23.461 --> 01:31:26.460
<v Speaker 1>two of them accepted by respectable </v>
<v Speaker 1>journals.</v>

1708
01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And I'm Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've asked me,</v>

1709
01:31:30.811 --> 01:31:32.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of responses you got and I say</v>

1710
01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:34.290
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I see him.</v>

1711
01:31:34.291 --> 01:31:37.200
<v Speaker 1>What about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about what people respond to zero.</v>

1712
01:31:37.770 --> 01:31:39.600
<v Speaker 1>So this is kind of spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

1713
01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.880
<v Speaker 1>we've got these things out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

1714
01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.313
<v Speaker 1>refereed a accepted publications and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of people saying this is a load </v>

1715
01:31:48.301 --> 01:31:49.051
<v Speaker 1>of nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1716
01:31:49.051 --> 01:31:49.884
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason and this disagrees with this </v>

1717
01:31:51.721 --> 01:31:53.610
<v Speaker 1>observation and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was fine.</v>

1718
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:56.190
<v Speaker 1>If I see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be unhappy with it,</v>

1719
01:31:56.610 --> 01:31:58.680
<v Speaker 1>but you've got something to work on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

1720
01:31:58.710 --> 01:31:59.800
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what's wrong.</v>

1721
01:31:59.801 --> 01:32:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Something needs modifying here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1722
01:32:01.541 --> 01:32:04.780
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't explain properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's needed or yes,</v>

1723
01:32:04.781 --> 01:32:05.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1724
01:32:05.191 --> 01:32:07.300
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been abandoned this idea.</v>

1725
01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:08.493
<v Speaker 1>All of these things come from criticisms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to have absolutely no tension </v>

1726
01:32:13.271 --> 01:32:17.500
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever paid to these papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something I find spooky.</v>

1727
01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think there's no attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid?</v>

1728
01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know.</v>

1729
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:26.103
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things is there's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much information and that people don't </v>

1730
01:32:29.981 --> 01:32:30.814
<v Speaker 1>have time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've grown their own projects and </v>

1731
01:32:32.141 --> 01:32:32.974
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to pay attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think it looks crazy because it's </v>

1732
01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:41.200
<v Speaker 1>too much outside the picture of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that they have.</v>

1733
01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:45.940
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of it's that and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe say,</v>

1734
01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:47.360
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking,</v>

1735
01:32:47.361 --> 01:32:48.194
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an old guy now and I maybe I did </v>

1736
01:32:50.651 --> 01:32:53.000
<v Speaker 1>good things in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1737
01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:54.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe I've gone a bit off the rails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that,</v>

1738
01:32:54.971 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got colleagues,</v>

1739
01:32:56.110 --> 01:33:00.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not just me and these respect to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who work on these things too.</v>

1740
01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:03.490
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that can be a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

1741
01:33:03.491 --> 01:33:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's part of it.</v>

1742
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:05.583
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sheer volume of papers that are </v>

1743
01:33:06.401 --> 01:33:07.234
<v Speaker 3>published,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be impossible to keep up </v>

1744
01:33:08.561 --> 01:33:09.050
<v Speaker 3>with all that.</v>

1745
01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a big part of the trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are other ideas which,</v>

1746
01:33:13.130 --> 01:33:16.540
<v Speaker 1>which to me look crazy and do other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't look in ears.</v>

1747
01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:17.443
<v Speaker 1>And as crazy as my idea as you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's why there's a lot of </v>

1748
01:33:21.021 --> 01:33:23.270
<v Speaker 1>them have more attention page than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones we,</v>

1749
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:24.183
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious to know whether the hawking </v>

1750
01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.230
<v Speaker 1>points we'll take off or not.</v>

1751
01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:28.453
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy there's people like you </v>

1752
01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:30.793
<v Speaker 3>doing this kind of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then someone condensing it down to </v>

1753
01:33:33.501 --> 01:33:38.501
<v Speaker 3>an understandable point that someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>like me can absorb and just tried to get</v>

1754
01:33:39.351 --> 01:33:43.360
<v Speaker 3>a better picture of this insane reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're living in.</v>

1755
01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:44.793
<v Speaker 3>But it is pretty weird subsidies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like the more I talked to </v>

1756
01:33:49.671 --> 01:33:52.130
<v Speaker 3>people like yourself and the more you </v>
<v Speaker 3>study this,</v>

1757
01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:55.460
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't get less weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets more weird.</v>

1758
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's right.</v>

1759
01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know more information.</v>

1760
01:33:59.421 --> 01:34:00.254
<v Speaker 3>It seems to be more fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's suddenly a lot of very weird </v>

1761
01:34:03.201 --> 01:34:03.860
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1762
01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:07.850
<v Speaker 1>but the point about them is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to make sense,</v>

1763
01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:12.080
<v Speaker 1>mathematical sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got agree with observation facts</v>

1764
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:15.680
<v Speaker 1>and that rules out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the really weird ones</v>

1765
01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:17.173
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even the ones that are observable </v>

1766
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:23.410
<v Speaker 3>and do adhere to the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so fantastic.</v>

1767
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.160
<v Speaker 3>It's so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality,</v>

1768
01:34:25.170 --> 01:34:26.003
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things that's most </v>
<v Speaker 3>frustrating about people's inclination </v>

1769
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:30.304
<v Speaker 3>to lean towards the Wu and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been guilty of it myself and so </v>

1770
01:34:33.611 --> 01:34:34.444
<v Speaker 3>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's frustrating about it is that </v>

1771
01:34:37.330 --> 01:34:41.050
<v Speaker 3>provable reality is so titanic Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre.</v>

1772
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:43.100
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1773
01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:43.953
<v Speaker 3>I agree that it's almost like why bother</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the woo reality is you can make a </v>

1774
01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Speaker 3>good point in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely right.</v>

1775
01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

1776
01:34:53.081 --> 01:34:53.680
<v Speaker 3>very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strange</v>

1777
01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.710
<v Speaker 1>in quantum mechanics in so many ways is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see you got to,</v>

1778
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a little bit of a danger</v>
<v Speaker 1>of separating the things which are,</v>

1779
01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:06.740
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be just wrong.</v>

1780
01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:07.933
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are things which do require </v>

1781
01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:10.153
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics to be changed in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and there'd be other ones which are </v>

1782
01:35:13.461 --> 01:35:17.510
<v Speaker 1>within quantum mechanics are just weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's absolutely true.</v>

1783
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:19.183
<v Speaker 1>There are these things which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe have to be true as much </v>

1784
01:35:22.131 --> 01:35:25.580
<v Speaker 1>as the Dib died in the womb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quantum mechanics,</v>

1785
01:35:25.581 --> 01:35:28.700
<v Speaker 1>people who follow the party lines and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1786
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these quantum entanglements,</v>

1787
01:35:32.001 --> 01:35:35.420
<v Speaker 1>the fact that things can be whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1788
01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:36.633
<v Speaker 1>a couple of thousand kilometers </v>
<v Speaker 1>separated and yet know each other and a </v>

1789
01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:42.224
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't explain that there are </v>

1790
01:35:44.541 --> 01:35:49.541
<v Speaker 1>separate individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They behave as though they're one called</v>

1791
01:35:50.650 --> 01:35:51.483
<v Speaker 1>the and tangled state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can make experiments which </v>

1792
01:35:54.651 --> 01:35:56.740
<v Speaker 1>revealed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1793
01:35:56.741 --> 01:35:57.574
<v Speaker 1>it's was a John Bell who is an Irish </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical physicists who really made </v>

1794
01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:04.670
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made all this very clear.</v>

1795
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000
<v Speaker 1>These things are real manifestations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the peculiarity of quantum mechanics and</v>

1796
01:36:10.251 --> 01:36:11.450
<v Speaker 1>really out there in the world.</v>

1797
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:13.723
<v Speaker 3>Was it jbs Haldane it said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is not only queer than you </v>

1798
01:36:16.281 --> 01:36:18.150
<v Speaker 3>suppose it's queer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you can suppose,</v>

1799
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:21.410
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what this is,</v>

1800
01:36:21.411 --> 01:36:22.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indeed,</v>

1801
01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:23.720
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is that kind of thing.</v>

1802
01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen sir,</v>

1803
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:26.480
<v Speaker 3>thank you for your time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really appreciate it.</v>

1804
01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I really appreciate talking to you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you for all your work and your,</v>

1805
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:35.290
<v Speaker 3>your contribution to our understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what we're looking at here.</v>

1806
01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.900
<v Speaker 3>What I hope it helps a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it helps a lot.</v>

1807
01:36:38.901 --> 01:36:40.310
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1808
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:41.263
<v Speaker 3>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>

1809
01:36:48.330 --> 01:36:49.163
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
