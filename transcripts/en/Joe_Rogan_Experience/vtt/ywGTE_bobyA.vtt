<v Speaker 1>Thank you to whoever gave me this this weekend at the Ice House.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some dude gave me hunter s Thompson is the rum diary on nice paper back.</v>

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Just one of the things that God did,</v>

5
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>his share of drugs,</v>

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Have you done your share yet?</v>

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>not yet.</v>

10
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>As much as I took a four hour shower on mushrooms once.</v>

11
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.393
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>And then I was hiking in big whiskey mountain on mushrooms with my buddy.</v>

13
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>We decided to take a back route,</v>

14
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:25.831
<v Speaker 1>which you never do.</v>

15
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I was climbing up a landslide.</v>

16
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>That's smart and I was like to my buddy,</v>

23
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>You're not moving with the mountain.</v>

24
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

25
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.901
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

26
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>He's a real mountain mine.</v>

27
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.511
<v Speaker 1>So he's climbing.</v>

28
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:35.671

30
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.763
<v Speaker 1>I'm over in the mountain.</v>

31
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

32
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stay here and talk to this rock.</v>

33
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>And I had to have a conversation with a rock and then as he tells it,</v>

34
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>we're on top of whisky mountain,</v>

35
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>which is a very big mountain.</v>

36
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

37
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Luckily it was in the summer as well.</v>

38
00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I was with,</v>

39
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I was dating patty back in the day and they were waiting downstairs and he turns</v>

40
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>back around and I'm not wearing any clothes and I mean,</v>

41
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.543
<v Speaker 1>no clue.</v>

42
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>And I'm up on top of a mountain that,</v>

43
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>that takes like a really long time to climb up.</v>

44
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>And I'm naked.</v>

45
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do with the clothes?</v>

46
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>We never found my clothes.</v>

47
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

48
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>but I did stop and need a lot of blueberries.</v>

49
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>And by the time we asked,</v>

50
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:10.161
<v Speaker 1>took a,</v>

51
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>she had squatting and then as I was doing that naked,</v>

52
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>my buddy moved some branches pretending it was a bear jumped up and started to</v>

53
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>run and uh,</v>

54
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>that caused a problem.</v>

55
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>And then I came back down the mountain,</v>

56
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>all scratched up,</v>

57
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.260
<v Speaker 1>no quotes and I can stop and eat blueberries.</v>

58
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>My buddy who got you stop eating blueberries.</v>

59
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:29.940

60
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.731

<v Speaker 1>you walked barefoot.</v>

63
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.200

73
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.354
<v Speaker 1>during the war.</v>

74
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.201
<v Speaker 1>When I finally got down,</v>

75
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:48.560

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.621
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.221

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll take the skinny guy with the blue mouth and a shit in his ass.</v>

94
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.690
<v Speaker 1>It was coming down off mushrooms.</v>

95
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>So that was my experience with marsh.</v>

96
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>How much did you take?</v>

97
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Did I heat?</v>

98
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>My buddy gave me just a handful,</v>

99
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>handful,</v>

100
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>it goes eat them.</v>

101
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.793
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

102
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

103
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I want to have an experience.</v>

104
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>You got to eat him on an empty stomach.</v>

105
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:25.321
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't eaten.</v>

106
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:25.651
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

107
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:26.484
<v Speaker 1>That's really good.</v>

108
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And we're climbing man.</v>

109
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>And I just started literally just hallucinating.</v>

110
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

111
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you're better off that you didn't eat anything.</v>

112
00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 1>If he had eaten it something you'd probably throw the problem.</v>

113
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I took a shower one time,</v>

114
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't get out of the shower.</v>

115
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Patty was banging on the door and I was like,</v>

116
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:39.451
<v Speaker 1>I'll be there.</v>

117
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure something out.</v>

118
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

119
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

120
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to explain.</v>

121
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>But I believe I kept seeing my profile and the first thing I was like,</v>

122
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>as I kept saying,</v>

123
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.491
<v Speaker 1>oh I fuck,</v>

124
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was barrel chested.</v>

125
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not barrel chested.</v>

126
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>My grandfather's barrel chested.</v>

127
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I know I have a sunken chest.</v>

128
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>This is horse shit.</v>

129
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

130
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.431
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

131
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible profile.</v>

132
00:02:57.451 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>So then I resolved,</v>

133
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>resolved.</v>

134
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I was in the shower to just spend the entire summer on a bench press.</v>

135
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I was going to hire a coach,</v>

136
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>just a bench,</v>

137
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>which that never happened.</v>

138
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>And then I came out of the shower and then I had this experience of somebody</v>

139
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>standing like watching me and judging me.</v>

140
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>And I felt like it was the devil telling me that I was a phony.</v>

141
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.010
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

142
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.091
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

143
00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:17.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm a phony.</v>

144
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm a skinny phony.</v>

145
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>He was the devil.</v>

146
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.823
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know.</v>

147
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I just felt I saw this.</v>

148
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.600
<v Speaker 1>That just felt like that's what it was like.</v>

149
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>It was just the truth and so me and I was so raw.</v>

150
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I came out one thing,</v>

151
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:29.370
<v Speaker 1>God maybe,</v>

152
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe or was it just felt like the devil because he didn't want to admit the</v>

153
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:35.081
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

154
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:35.621
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

155
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what the,</v>

156
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>that's what the bank that is bro.</v>

157
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I can always tell people,</v>

158
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>you can just see,</v>

159
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting to watch how people,</v>

160
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>like I was thinking about this the other day,</v>

161
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>how people basically as adult like I would call it to adulthood and what they</v>

162
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:54.421
<v Speaker 1>call maturity is the slow acceptance of what you will never be.</v>

163
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what it is.</v>

164
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.070
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is you so much things.</v>

165
00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

166
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>you see little girls dressed like princesses,</v>

167
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

168
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.290
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

169
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's their ideal.</v>

170
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>They grow up with these ideas.</v>

171
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>We still,</v>

172
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>we stick these ideals and children.</v>

173
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to marry a prince and he's going to be pimped prince charming</v>

174
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>and that shit gets whittled away.</v>

175
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>You start settling for simulation and simulation.</v>

176
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

177
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Basically your life becomes,</v>

178
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll take what I can get until finally you're dating some guy with hair on his</v>

179
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>ears and a potbelly,</v>

180
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

181
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>at least he pays a fucking bills,</v>

182
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>which is when I had to get them.</v>

183
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

184
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I like to get them when they're just going through a divorce,</v>

185
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>had their heartbroken to 300 times.</v>

186
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>They're 40 they work out way too much.</v>

187
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.960
<v Speaker 1>That anger and frustration is combined into this fucking wood creates like a</v>

188
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>freaky that I can really work with.</v>

189
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Hotel 39 year old.</v>

190
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Crazy wall.</v>

194

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.893
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

200
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.823
<v Speaker 1>That's young for me.</v>

201
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>So when you're coming down the hill,</v>

202
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>you're totally naked.</v>

203
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>You're high as a kite on mushrooms.</v>

204
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:00.341
<v Speaker 1>Do whatever.</v>

205
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:00.941
<v Speaker 1>Any point.</v>

206
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Realize like you starting to sober up at any point in time,</v>

207
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.480
<v Speaker 1>like what's what's happening as you're sobering up,</v>

208
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.731
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

209
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>what was happening?</v>

210
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 1>As I was sobering up and because I'm such a freak because I had read a lot about</v>

211
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 1>how when you can be on a mountain in the summer or a winter storm can brew up,</v>

212
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.331
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

213
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>They can keep up,</v>

214
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 1>you can get caught in hail storms,</v>

215
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>freeze to death actually sometimes,</v>

216
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

217
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.841
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

218
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

219
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

220
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I was like I got to get the phone and I'd read about k two and I don't know if</v>

221
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 1>you've ever read about climbing k two.</v>

222
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing to climb Mount Everest.</v>

223
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>It's quite another thing to can't climb.</v>

224
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>K Two I believe there's only one side of k two one can climb.</v>

225
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>And for a while I believe in,</v>

226
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>you can check this on factcheck one in four people,</v>

227
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

228
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't make it,</v>

229
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

230
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>on k two people died all the time because before people would make it like</v>

231
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>didn't survive.</v>

232
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Can you do fact check?</v>

233
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Cause I believe that was the case for quite awhile.</v>

234
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.580
<v Speaker 1>She's crashed.</v>

235
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>And so what happened was it was the holy grail of mountain still is cause uh,</v>

236
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>cause um,</v>

237
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>what happens is storms whip up really fucking fast.</v>

238
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Like really fast and a,</v>

239
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.084
<v Speaker 1>and you die.</v>

240
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

241
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.381
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

244
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.720

245
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's been a bunch of disasters up there.</v>

250
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>two very few people.</v>

255
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Client when you meet a mountain climber and they said,</v>

256
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I got to the top of k two.</v>

257
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.150
