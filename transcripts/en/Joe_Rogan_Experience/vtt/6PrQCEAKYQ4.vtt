00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I know a dude who thought he was buying a stereo,</v>

3
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>but he's actually buying bricks.</v>

4
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.250
<v Speaker 1>He got one of those stereotypes.</v>

5
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.580
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking half a month ago.</v>

6
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>He stopped at the street and bought from a guy named Jamal.</v>

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy,</v>

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I was buying pet food.</v>

9
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I pulled into this parking spot.</v>

10
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I got out and this dude literally opened the van like he was going to take me in</v>

11
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>and fuck me.</v>

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like some little kid.</v>

13
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>He was about to scoop up out of the woods like it was a molester and I'm like,</v>

14
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.040

17
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

18
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.560

22
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

23
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>He opened up the door like as people parked the car and it was literally like,</v>

24
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:36.900

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

28
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>You're asking for trouble if you do business one of those guys,</v>

29
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>most obvious shit ever.</v>

30
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>he's just randomly trying to sell a stereo to the back of a van.</v>

32
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.991
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

33
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>What are these things that they do in whatever?</v>

34
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Like the people go when they have,</v>

35
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>what do they junk junkets.</v>

36
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Junkets.</v>

37
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.541
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

38
00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

39
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.761
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

40
00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

41
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>The thing off the fucking five,</v>

42
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>the you always see in the movies and all the fucking Friday they all go to a</v>

43
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:05.421
<v Speaker 1>place and they,</v>

44
00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:05.581
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

45
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>they buy stereos and raider hats.</v>

46
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Swap swap me.</v>

47
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.033
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

48
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Well in that way it's a swap meet in Jersey that called,</v>

49
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.951
<v Speaker 1>what do they call you?</v>

50
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Market?</v>

51
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.473
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

52
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid I used to go to where they used to do the bicycles,</v>

53
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:28.491
<v Speaker 1>whatever those street car races and next door to it they had what was called and</v>

54
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>you'd go there and they had pretty much shit that was stolen.</v>

55
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>It was just a festival and they tries to a table fee because everything was 50</v>

56
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:38.664
<v Speaker 1>percent off.</v>

57
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Even the sneakers I remember and then we found that that the guy would go to the</v>

58
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>fucking factory and jump over the fence and take over</v>

59
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.841
<v Speaker 1>the sneakers.</v>

60
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>No mistakes.</v>

61
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Irregulars he,</v>

62
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>they would take those and just sell them at those swap swap meets.</v>

63
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>And then we found that we cut into his action.</v>

64
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I just want it gone.</v>

65
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

66
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

67
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>we cut into that action and the action limit,</v>

68
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>those tubes are blocked.</v>

69
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Best Prank,</v>

70
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 1>they would throw thousands of amount with little things like the chemical was</v>

71
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

72
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>You start blinking too much,</v>

73
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>like the chemical.</v>

74
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Then it was pepper spray,</v>

75
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.671
<v Speaker 1>pepper spray,</v>

76
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>like people would spray it and you can see what happened.</v>

77
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.851
<v Speaker 1>It's not regular,</v>

78
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:24.361
<v Speaker 1>but Naka.</v>

79
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>What does that tear gas.</v>

80
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>It was like the tickets.</v>

81
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 1>This band is good.</v>

82
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>That was afterthought and we make them jump the fence and we'd have thousands of</v>

83
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>tubes and we'd sell them for fifty cents a piece on Monday the sixth and seventh</v>

84
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>grade I virus,</v>

85
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>but there wasn't always three kids that complain.</v>

86
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:44.800
<v Speaker 1>There was a little like the chemical imbalances</v>

87
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying for awhile,</v>

88
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but I think Caitlyn Jenner created Donald Trump.</v>

89
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>

90
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>but it created this thing.</v>

91
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

92
00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a thing,</v>

93
00:02:56.101 --> 00:03:01.101
<v Speaker 1>there was a tipping point and for me it was when they gave her a woman of the</v>

94
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>year and Glamour magazine and then Espn gave her as an athlete of the year and</v>

95
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.170
<v Speaker 1>when we're that ridiculous thing that they did where they circled her house,</v>

96
00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:12.510
<v Speaker 1>so the helicopter and she was hiding behind the curtains and it was all</v>

97
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>mysterious like why in the fuck are you selling?</v>

98
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this?</v>

99
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>And for people at home that are like in Indiana and they're drinking beer and</v>

100
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 1>they like football and they went to watch the sbs to see who won best</v>

101
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>quarterback of the year and they're seeing that kind of shit.</v>

102
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:26.771
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

103
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is as we need to make America great again.</v>

104
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I never linked it that specifically,</v>

106
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're totally right.</v>

107
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Even right now when I've been watching the NBA season just started and I love</v>

108
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:37.774
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>

109
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Every time I turn on TNT now it's Barkley and Kenny Smith and Shaq and Ernie</v>

110
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Johnson talking about race.</v>

111
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>They're not talking about basketball.</v>

112
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.061
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about race.</v>

113
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about policing,</v>

114
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>those are all important issues to talk about,</v>

115
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>but people go to sports for the release,</v>

116
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>they go to sports because they care about that leads and what's happening on the</v>

117
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:56.644
<v Speaker 1>field and in the,</v>

118
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>in the box and imagine whatever it is and now everything is becoming</v>

119
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>politicized.</v>

120
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>So espn is giving their athlete of the year to Caitlyn Jenner.</v>

121
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>It makes no freaking sense.</v>

122
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

123
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>that was a white nfl ratings down.</v>

124
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:08.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

125
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>it's because people are talking about Kaepernick and politics instead of sports.</v>

126
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Does that make the ratings go down?</v>

127
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.133
<v Speaker 1>Really is the ratings.</v>

128
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>The ratings are hugely down in the NFL this year and a lot of people are linking</v>

129
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

130
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know it empirically.</v>

131
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be shocked.</v>

132
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people in this country just have zero tolerance.</v>

133
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's almost like separation of church and state.</v>

134
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 1>They would like their sports to just be sports and about sports.</v>

135
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

136
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

137
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:30.531
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

138
00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I kind of appreciate that in a certain way because it's like if you were</v>

139
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>watching a comedy show and all of a sudden during that comedy show they started</v>

140
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:40.861
<v Speaker 1>deeply discussing religion and like really like discussing deep intricacies of</v>

141
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:44.610
<v Speaker 1>different faith based cultures.</v>

142
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.951
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

143
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.200
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I want?</v>

144
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.960
<v Speaker 1>This is not comedy do is funny.</v>

145
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>But once you heard in that thing and now you're doing something else right,</v>

146
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a different thing.</v>

147
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing sports,</v>

148
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>

149
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.690
<v Speaker 1>you're doing race relations,</v>

150
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.543
<v Speaker 1>are you doing?</v>

151
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>But I don't understand that.</v>

152
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>It's also they look at it as a platform for our culture and that's what</v>

153
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Kaepernick did.</v>

154
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.561
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

155
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:02.741
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

156
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I have this platform.</v>

157
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.150
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways I think what he did kind of worked because a lot of kids in</v>

158
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 1>high school now are doing that.</v>

159
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:12.070
<v Speaker 1>They're taking knees and the national,</v>

160
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>when they do the national anthem,</v>

162
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.043
<v Speaker 1>it's strange,</v>

163
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like the black,</v>

164
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

165
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.990
<v Speaker 1>like when people have the black fist at the Olympics,</v>

166
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:20.141
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

167
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:22.160
<v Speaker 1>those dudes that did that in the 19 seven,</v>

168
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 71.</v>

169
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Maybe something like that.</v>

170
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that was.</v>

171
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean that got people talk and this gets people talking to and maybe sometimes</v>

172
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:36.091
<v Speaker 1>you need to kind of inject some sort of something to think about during sporting</v>

173
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:37.160
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>

174
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling them not to do it.</v>

175
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Of course I would.</v>

176
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Net cabernet wants to do that.</v>

177
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

178
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.861
<v Speaker 1>These guys,</v>

179
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

180
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.250
<v Speaker 1>if Barkley and all that one,</v>

181
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.010
<v Speaker 1>if they're tnt bosses are okay with it and they go,</v>

182
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:46.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

183
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.141
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>

185
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Instead of talking about how many points Duran had been,</v>

186
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:49.924
<v Speaker 1>so be it,</v>

187
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying what I think most people want from sports is an escape.</v>

188
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you for sure in the two or three at the NBA season has been</v>

189
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>

190
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 2>Every time I flipped by TNT and they're doing that,</v>

191
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.173
<v Speaker 2>I change it.</v>

192
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 2>When those homeless people were breaking in my house,</v>

193
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 2>joy drove by every night.</v>

194
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 2>How many homeless people broke into your house?</v>

195
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:07.650
<v Speaker 2>A couple.</v>

196
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Really because we were under construction.</v>

197
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.300
<v Speaker 2>We're renovating.</v>

198
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

199
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 2>First one broke in a Brumby's.</v>

200
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Very similar.</v>

201
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.133
<v Speaker 2>You can't scare them.</v>

202
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

203
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

204
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.563
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting.</v>

205
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

206
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.640
<v Speaker 2>We had dinner at my sister's house.</v>

207
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:28.900
<v Speaker 2>The girls went inside.</v>

208
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Everything's under construction.</v>

209
00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:32.440
<v Speaker 2>We've got like a big dumpster out front.</v>

210
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.340
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it's under construction and I'm sitting off to the side smoking a</v>

211
00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:40.060
<v Speaker 2>cigar in the darkness and this girl just starts walking in,</v>

212
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.440
<v Speaker 2>walking up the driveway,</v>

213
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.840
<v Speaker 2>starts to go into our backyard and I see her and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I must know her.</v>

217
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing when you get robbed that you're like,</v>

218
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like a such a confrontation that you're like,</v>

219
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.020
<v Speaker 2>like if you ever been like been in conversation and someone's like,</v>

220

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:56.020
<v Speaker 2>And then they attack you and you're like,</v>

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.760
<v Speaker 2>This is how it starts.</v>

227
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.190
<v Speaker 2>That that was what happened in this girl was just going back here and I go and</v>

231
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.253

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.720
<v Speaker 2>She's not fucking scared at all.</v>

242
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Priscilla is 130 pound bull mastiff obese.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Have a fucking dog is going at her,</v>

245
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Keeping up as a little tiny like dog fence that we had in our front yard at the</v>

246
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.503
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

247
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Fearless this woman was.</v>

248
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.650
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't shake her hair.</v>

249
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I think a heroin addict probably.</v>

250
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.050

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Then the cops show up.</v>

256
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:46.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember when Shit's on cops.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I love them.</v>

258
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.280
<v Speaker 2>They showed up in three minutes.</v>

259
00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Speaker 2>They were there three minutes.</v>

260
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.680
<v Speaker 2>The woman had already taken off.</v>

261
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I told them where they were at.</v>

262
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.230
<v Speaker 2>She went and the guy was like,</v>

267
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.210
<v Speaker 2>a lot of junkies and homeless people.</v>

268
00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.640

276
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Do you mind if the girls come down for like two seconds and just let them know</v>

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.730
<v Speaker 2>And they gave him to the cops.</v>

285
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm me talking about a heart breaking moment.</v>
