1
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.641
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're live.</v>

2
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are Our.</v>

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>A lot of stuff is going on</v>

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alana,</v>

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.063
<v Speaker 2>since your settlement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie and I were hoping that you would </v>

6
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 2>come in with one of those Paul Wall </v>
<v Speaker 2>grills,</v>

7
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 2>like diamonds on it and maybe some furs.</v>

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in a cadillac.</v>

9
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately it it's enough money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a difference,</v>

10
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.344
<v Speaker 1>but it's not enough money to do no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer have to think about such things </v>

11
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:33.564
<v Speaker 1>so you can temporarily ball though if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were irresponsible and you didn't </v>

12
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>have a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't have a family,</v>

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>you get crazy for a couple of months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it happens.</v>

14
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>It gives us a room to think about how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>replace our incomes.</v>

15
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>We have about two years at our current </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate of.</v>

16
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Of burning to keep the family.</v>

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just.</v>

18
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 2>So this is a standalone podcast so </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can kind of.</v>

19
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 2>What you need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're really interested in this,</v>

20
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 2>it really interested is google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bret Weinstein and you will get the full</v>

21
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:04.584
<v Speaker 2>story from beginning to end with </v>
<v Speaker 2>evergreen state college where I'll just </v>

22
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:09.924
<v Speaker 2>give you the short version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a bunch of what you would </v>

23
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 2>kindly call social active people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors,</v>

24
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 2>people who there's a movement going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country and it's very aggressive</v>

25
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do is they wanted to have a day where</v>

26
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all white people stayed home.</v>

27
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.933
<v Speaker 2>You thought that was racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought you were racist for saying </v>

28
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 2>that was racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

29
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 2>they decided to literally take over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>college for a short period of time.</v>

30
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 2>The dust settled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just got a big fat settlement,</v>

31
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 2>you're out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

32
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:49.644
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the woman who was kind of at </v>

33
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:51.624
<v Speaker 2>the head of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got a nice little chunk of change </v>

34
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was quite odd.</v>

35
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.250
<v Speaker 1>College settled with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it was quite clear,</v>

36
00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:58.084
<v Speaker 1>she had no legal case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bit of a mystery about why </v>

37
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.743
<v Speaker 1>they would have paid her to resign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when in fact they could have just stood </v>

38
00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:07.160
<v Speaker 1>their ground.</v>

39
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.993
<v Speaker 2>She could have probably become the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of the college if she wanted </v>

40
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:10.544
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that guy had responded to the </v>

41
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:13.484
<v Speaker 2>students when they told him to put his </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands down because he was being </v>

42
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:18.250
<v Speaker 2>threatening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he put his hands up.</v>

43
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 2>He's talking them and using hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>gestures and they're like,</v>

44
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:21.674
<v Speaker 2>put your hands down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're threatening us with </v>

45
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 2>microaggressions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts his hands down.</v>

46
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.913
<v Speaker 2>They all started laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just tells you everything about </v>

47
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:32.410
<v Speaker 2>what their intent was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was really going on there and.</v>

48
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.910
<v Speaker 2>But after I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

49
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.963
<v Speaker 2>she could have been the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should've just had herbie </v>

50
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.630
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole things.</v>

51
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 2>It was a kangaroo court was mockery</v>

52
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.030
<v Speaker 1>thing was absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say I've.</v>

53
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.923
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to get the story right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of short synopsis and so for </v>

54
00:02:47.411 --> 00:02:50.110
<v Speaker 1>anybody who really wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even complete,</v>

55
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.973
<v Speaker 1>but heather and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife Heather was also a professor at </v>

56
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:53.794
<v Speaker 1>evergreen and we wrote a more complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of the story that people to see </v>

57
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>how the internal politics of the college</v>
<v Speaker 1>played out into what they ultimately saw</v>

58
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:04.534
<v Speaker 1>on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's in the Washington examiner a </v>

59
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>last Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read that and it's</v>

60
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.410
<v Speaker 2>deeply disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

61
00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:14.244
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've been paying attention and you </v>

62
00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:20.490
<v Speaker 2>know you and I and Jordan Peterson and </v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

63
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.490
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people have tried to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out what's going on today,</v>

64
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.623
<v Speaker 2>like why has this movement become so </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive and so not just aggressive </v>

65
00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:32.034
<v Speaker 2>but observed not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not logical like the way they're </v>

66
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:35.784
<v Speaker 2>approaching things is from this very </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange entitled and just oddly </v>

67
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:42.570
<v Speaker 2>fanatical way.</v>

68
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.213
<v Speaker 1>You want to be careful not to mix what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say with what they're actually up </v>

69
00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:50.940
<v Speaker 1>to because what they say is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing.</v>

70
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.803
<v Speaker 1>If it can't be parsed logically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many contradictions so close </v>

71
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:56.304
<v Speaker 1>to the surface that one has the sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are deeply confused and some </v>

72
00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:00.294
<v Speaker 1>of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is also a strategic movement </v>

73
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:04.044
<v Speaker 1>under the surface which we can't listen </v>
<v Speaker 1>into directly and it is more </v>

74
00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:09.270
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated than we think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

75
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:10.104
<v Speaker 1>it is managing to wield power in spite </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that it's explanation for </v>

76
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:16.620
<v Speaker 1>why it is entitled to wield power </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make any sense.</v>

77
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.340
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation is like?</v>

78
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:22.170
<v Speaker 2>What is their or their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least their underlying</v>

79
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.043
<v Speaker 1>plan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say we have to be careful there </v>

80
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:26.644
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of people who go along with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I would argue are tools of the </v>

81
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>movement and they are doing it's bidding</v>
<v Speaker 1>without understanding the objective,</v>

82
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.700
<v Speaker 1>but the prime movers are quite clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in taking power.</v>

83
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.383
<v Speaker 1>They want power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a superficial rationalization </v>

84
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:47.851
<v Speaker 1>for why they are entitled to power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are wielding weaponized stigma as a</v>

85
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:48.934
<v Speaker 1>mechanism for gaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you said that Nyeema could have </v>

86
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>become the president of the college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether she could have.</v>

87
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:58.414
<v Speaker 1>It would have been a very unusual path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that for more than a year </v>

88
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I watched people unable to resist </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

89
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:08.044
<v Speaker 1>She said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even people who knew better would in </v>

90
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:10.714
<v Speaker 1>faculty meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would reflectively thank her for </v>

91
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 1>anything she said no matter how absurd </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

92
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>And that was clearly a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>as the equivalent of a wolves bearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their juggler was don't hurt me.</v>

94
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't hurt me.</v>

95
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:28.351
<v Speaker 1>And so that kind of power is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a person who is cynical enough to,</v>

96
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.383
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to wield stigma to get it might cover </v>

97
00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>

98
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:37.564
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a small number of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who really do know what they're doing </v>

99
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.713
<v Speaker 1>and their point is we can wipe many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the obstacles to our having power off </v>

100
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>the map by throwing accusations at them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they cannot resist.</v>

101
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big accusation is racism.</v>

102
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 2>That that's always the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one you never want to have thrown</v>

103
00:05:58.521 --> 00:05:59.354
<v Speaker 2>your way if you are deemed a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's akin to being deemed a </v>

104
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's a false charge.</v>

105
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.364
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

106
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>most people are going to hear the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement before they ever look into the</v>

107
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.003
<v Speaker 2>possibility that you'd been exonerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you being called a racist is a </v>

108
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous thing in today's society.</v>

109
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a very dangerous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think it's important that we not do</v>

110
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 1>their bidding by inflating that danger </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond what it actually is.</v>

111
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.373
<v Speaker 1>So I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will never know for sure what the </v>

112
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 1>trajectory would have been absent what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened at Evergreen.</v>

113
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:40.181
<v Speaker 1>But I do think standing up to the mom at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evergreen and just saying,</v>

114
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.841
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

115
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're asking really important</v>

116
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.870
<v Speaker 2>for people that don't know you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are a very progressive guy.</v>

117
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.180
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're very left wing,</v>

118
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.740
<v Speaker 2>very left leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>

119
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.910
<v Speaker 2>You're not in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form a conservative and so this</v>

120
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.910
<v Speaker 2>like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the left eating itself.</v>

121
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.163
<v Speaker 1>It is the left eating itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was also in the lucky position of </v>

122
00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:04.444
<v Speaker 1>being able to imagine what was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen when that accusation broke and </v>

123
00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:11.944
<v Speaker 1>knowing that there were so many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who knew that that couldn't possibly be </v>

124
00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:17.770
<v Speaker 1>right about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was going to survive it,</v>

125
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:18.604
<v Speaker 1>and it's not as if there aren't huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers of people who still to this day </v>

126
00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:22.864
<v Speaker 1>apparently believe I'm a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in spite of the fact that nothing has </v>

127
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:26.194
<v Speaker 1>emerged in all of the time with all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the incentive for somebody to bring </v>

128
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.830
<v Speaker 1>something forward that would suggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have an issue with race somewhere</v>

129
00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:33.664
<v Speaker 1>in my history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never emerged and so people do need </v>

130
00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:40.951
<v Speaker 1>to understand that it is possible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive that accusation.</v>

131
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with your background though,</v>

132
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 2>people don't know your background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it at Yale that you had penn,</v>

133
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Penn to tell that story?</v>

134
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.981
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

135
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do the quick and dirty version.</v>

136
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm cliff notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a freshman at Penn.</v>

137
00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.173
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine was rushing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraternity and the fraternity was </v>

138
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:06.014
<v Speaker 1>holding what they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mystery event and I wasn't rushing a </v>

139
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:10.010
<v Speaker 1>fraternity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wAsn't interested,</v>

140
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.993
<v Speaker 1>but he convinced me that I didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to do that night and that I </v>

141
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:14.084
<v Speaker 1>should go with him and I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and after some relatively standard </v>

142
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:21.044
<v Speaker 1>fraternity shenanigans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the event turned into one in which the </v>

143
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:26.084
<v Speaker 1>fraternity had hired prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro black prostitutes from the local </v>

144
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:30.944
<v Speaker 1>environment and the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penn is in a pretty rough neighborhood </v>

145
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>and this was a pretty wealthy jewish </v>
<v Speaker 1>frat,</v>

146
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:39.490
<v Speaker 1>and so there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 1>something a pretty unsettling about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy jewish frat,</v>

148
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:44.504
<v Speaker 1>hiring black prostitutes from the local </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood to engage in what started </v>

149
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:50.384
<v Speaker 1>out to be a strip tease 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As this thing began to unfold and I </v>

150
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>realized I didn't have any interest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>being part of this event,</v>

151
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I made one of the bigger mistakes of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and I left the event,</v>

152
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.610
<v Speaker 1>but when my friend and other members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fraternity rolled into the dorm that</v>

153
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:05.454
<v Speaker 1>night and told me what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was absolutely appalled because what </v>

154
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:13.210
<v Speaker 1>had happened was the fraternity had </v>
<v Speaker 1>enacted a,</v>

155
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.333
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mock rape of these prostitutes using </v>

156
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:21.640
<v Speaker 1>cucumbers and ketchup and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

157
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there was anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable about a,</v>

158
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an organization that had special </v>

159
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 1>privileges on the campus behaving this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

160
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get past it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>

161
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I went to the paper and various things </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfolded.</v>

162
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:37.884
<v Speaker 1>the paper botched the story and made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like I was troubled by the fact </v>

163
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:43.884
<v Speaker 1>that there were strippers rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>troubled by what actually had ended up </v>

164
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:46.614
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

165
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up writing an editorial for the,</v>

166
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.570
<v Speaker 1>for the paper and all hell broke loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

167
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.490
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.323
<v Speaker 1>I got death threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police started tracking phone </v>

169
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>numbers on my phone to see who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening me.</v>

170
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a trial of the fraternity,</v>

171
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the college did not want to put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraternity on trial,</v>

172
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:08.970
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately public pressure forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to do it.</v>

173
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.763
<v Speaker 1>I testified at the trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although since I hadn't seen the thing </v>

174
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>directly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I could say was limited,</v>

175
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:19.170
<v Speaker 1>but while I was in the witness room with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other witnesses,</v>

176
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 1>people who had rushed the fraternity but</v>
<v Speaker 1>had not pledged it,</v>

177
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fraternity brothers,</v>

178
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:25.344
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe the president came in to the </v>

179
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:29.970
<v Speaker 1>witness room and started bullyIng these </v>
<v Speaker 1>witnesses and coaching them on what they</v>

180
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:31.840
<v Speaker 1>should say in front of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

181
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 1>this university panel.</v>

182
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.303
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately the university was the </v>

183
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.110
<v Speaker 1>university through the frat off campus </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a year,</v>

184
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.930
<v Speaker 1>forbid them from pledging a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

185
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.073
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more to the story.</v>

187
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I got an award from the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization for women actually for a,</v>

188
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot their terminology,</v>

189
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:56.880
<v Speaker 1>but for basically for standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

190
00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.840
<v Speaker 1>for women who needed to be defended or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

191
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.703
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said you've made the biggest </v>

192
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:04.140
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest mistakes of your life</v>

193
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 1>by leaving mean meaning that if you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you could have probably stopped it</v>

194
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:10.930
<v Speaker 1>or you could at least have known exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was going on there.</v>

195
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.813
<v Speaker 1>No way I could've stopped it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I left because I didn't want to be </v>

196
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.503
<v Speaker 1>party to this event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometime I think journalists know </v>

197
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:21.834
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a freshman in college so I didn't </v>

198
00:11:24.391 --> 00:11:25.224
<v Speaker 1>know it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but journalists understand that </v>

199
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:31.221
<v Speaker 1>sometimes something horrifying happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the job that you are best positioned</v>

200
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:33.444
<v Speaker 1>to do is documenting it so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world can understand how such things </v>

201
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 1>occur and do something about it and if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had understood that that was probably my</v>

202
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:42.054
<v Speaker 1>highest and best use at that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have stuck around and paid </v>

203
00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:49.710
<v Speaker 1>attention to what had happened rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than having to go through convincing the</v>

204
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 1>world that something had happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I had not directly seen.</v>

205
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how could you have known there's </v>

206
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:56.584
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it should be hard on </v>

207
00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 1>yourself at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 18,</v>

208
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:59.681
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

209
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>How could you have known?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you have known,</v>

210
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.273
<v Speaker 1>even if you were 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you have known what was going </v>

211
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.124
<v Speaker 1>to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like prostitutes and you're </v>

212
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:07.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

213
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See ya.</v>

214
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.993
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know there was going to be a </v>

215
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:12.250
<v Speaker 1>mock rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

216
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>

217
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 1>in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a mistake.</v>

218
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:16.853
<v Speaker 1>It's ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy that they let groups of </v>

219
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:22.780
<v Speaker 1>kIds live in a house together and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammered when they don't even have their</v>

220
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:25.870
<v Speaker 1>frontal cortex develop yet manage all </v>
<v Speaker 1>living together,</v>

221
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 1>feeding off of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have mob mentality.</v>

222
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.530
<v Speaker 1>All this diffusion of responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have a large group of people</v>

223
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 1>that's also like you and everybody's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bananas that,</v>

224
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 1>that is few incidents happen as they do.</v>

225
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.893
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think that those things would </v>

226
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>just be chaos the moment you opened up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the door to every frat house.</v>

227
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know there's more chaos than we </v>

228
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:48.820
<v Speaker 1>know because a lot of what takes place </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

229
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.673
<v Speaker 1>we don't fInd out about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a shame because one could take </v>

230
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:56.320
<v Speaker 1>the thing that drives people into those </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

231
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.183
<v Speaker 1>And one could use it to power something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was useful and interesting and you </v>

232
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:01.834
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really was deeply enriching and I know </v>

233
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.020
<v Speaker 1>how much flack am I going to take for </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving the fraternity system a hard tIme</v>

234
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.913
<v Speaker 1>on your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But plenty of people will tell me how </v>

235
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:14.290
<v Speaker 1>enriching their fraternity experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

236
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:15.124
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even at penn there were a couple </v>

237
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:19.010
<v Speaker 1>fraternities that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

238
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.703
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hated throughout the fraternity system </v>

239
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.063
<v Speaker 1>at penn after I had come forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there were two fraternities that </v>

240
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 1>actually didn't hate me and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcoming even in that climate.</v>

241
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.070
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to portray them as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monolith there or not.</v>

242
00:13:33.071 --> 00:13:33.904
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does seem like a wasted </v>

243
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.024
<v Speaker 1>opportunity that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of energy that goes into </v>

244
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.670
<v Speaker 1>fraternity life could be directed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something really amazing.</v>

245
00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's a shame that it doesn't happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>more often.</v>

246
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a lot of great </v>

247
00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:46.864
<v Speaker 1>comradery and it's probably a lot of fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go through that experience together </v>

248
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:49.954
<v Speaker 1>with people that are your same age and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually living in a house </v>

249
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just manage probably awesome fucking</v>

250
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:56.380
<v Speaker 1>adults in that room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

251
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it just seems like just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>limit your liability.</v>

252
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

253
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Without the 35 year olds running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and going,</v>

254
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.930
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing over there?</v>

255
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:13.140
<v Speaker 1>My fire won't be able to put that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adult like that one on fire,</v>

256
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.200
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

257
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Just crazy.</v>

258
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your situation.</v>

259
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:25.780
<v Speaker 1>So anybody that would think of you as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative or a racist,</v>

260
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:26.614
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly the evidence points to the </v>

261
00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:29.680
<v Speaker 1>contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

262
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

263
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this issue of conservatism is one that I</v>

264
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:34.594
<v Speaker 1>would like to also get right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not sure I ever say this in a </v>

265
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>way that people know what I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

266
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:40.420
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very progressive,</v>

267
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:44.350
<v Speaker 1>but I'm very progressive because I live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a world that's really screwed up.</v>

268
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.303
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that we have to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>some progress seems just transparently </v>

269
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.670
<v Speaker 1>correct me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

270
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>I would like to live in a world that</v>

271
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.813
<v Speaker 3>is so well structured that I could be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative and I don't mean a </v>

272
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 3>conservative in the sense that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological sense,</v>

273
00:14:57.861 --> 00:14:58.694
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would like to be in a world </v>
<v Speaker 3>where tinkering with it stood a better </v>

274
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 3>chance of making it worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

275
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 3>and was unnecessary and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would,</v>

276
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.113
<v Speaker 3>that would turn me into a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it would be the right thing to </v>

277
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:11.564
<v Speaker 3>be in a proper analysis would tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the time to conserve the </v>

278
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 3>structure rather than change it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in this world,</v>

279
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:19.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out I'm a,</v>

280
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.553
<v Speaker 3>I'm a progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the events that people keep telling </v>

281
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 3>me that they were sure I'm now at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>closet conservative,</v>

282
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:30.410
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I faced must have turned me against</v>

283
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 3>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not at all what happened.</v>

284
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

285
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:37.040
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've faced out myself that people say,</v>

286
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:37.883
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to turn more conservative </v>

287
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:40.070
<v Speaker 3>with all this.</v>

288
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.903
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just more resentful of these fake </v>

289
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:45.980
<v Speaker 3>progressive movement that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

290
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:47.570
<v Speaker 3>has ulterior motives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

291
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.330
<v Speaker 3>there's more to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's and it's not.</v>

292
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.493
<v Speaker 3>It's not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the portrayals of humans in in </v>

293
00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:58.040
<v Speaker 3>these movements are not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

294
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:59.303
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's normal and I think </v>

295
00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:02.414
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The game of capitalism is a very </v>

296
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:09.980
<v Speaker 3>confusing one and there's certainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly some very evil aspects to it.</v>

297
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:10.814
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that the answer is marxism </v>

298
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.950
<v Speaker 3>seems to me to be just as just as poorly</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought out it.</v>

299
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:21.903
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's at least as poorly thought out </v>

300
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.680
<v Speaker 3>marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The flaw is more obvious.</v>

301
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 3>I think the flaw is what we in biology </v>
<v Speaker 3>would call group selection.</v>

302
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.080
<v Speaker 3>The belief that if we just all row in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same direction,</v>

303
00:16:36.081 --> 00:16:37.100
<v Speaker 3>we'll get somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marvelous,</v>

304
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.943
<v Speaker 3>and that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if we did all row in the same </v>

305
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:40.844
<v Speaker 3>direction we would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a very good game theoretic </v>

306
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 3>reason that that can't be.</v>

307
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.333
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That as soon as you have everybody </v>

308
00:16:46.341 --> 00:16:47.174
<v Speaker 3>rowing in the same direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the wind goes to the person who </v>

309
00:16:49.731 --> 00:16:50.564
<v Speaker 3>figures out how not to row and gets the </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit of everybody else's rowing in </v>

310
00:16:53.181 --> 00:16:54.014
<v Speaker 3>that direction while they sweep in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prophets and so that tears apart </v>

311
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.350
<v Speaker 3>anything structured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way communism is structured.</v>

312
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's conveniently ignored.</v>

313
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.553
<v Speaker 3>I think I really have always believed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that competition is good and it's </v>

314
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 3>because I've been involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition my whole life and I think it</v>

315
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.220
<v Speaker 3>helps you understand yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're competing against other people,</v>

316
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:14.054
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately you're really competing </v>
<v Speaker 3>against yourself because you're trying </v>

317
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:21.260
<v Speaker 3>to better yourself and I believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the argument for getting children</v>

318
00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:25.610
<v Speaker 3>involved in athletics or games or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's very difficult to do.</v>

319
00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:26.444
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's chess or pool or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think things that are hard to do are </v>

320
00:17:30.261 --> 00:17:31.094
<v Speaker 3>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Competing is good for you because it </v>

321
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:37.040
<v Speaker 3>teaches you about focus and discipline </v>
<v Speaker 3>and understanding that there is.</v>

322
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:40.730
<v Speaker 3>You can reap the rewards of hard work </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

323
00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:44.660
<v Speaker 3>obviously this can get distorted and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can get these,</v>

324
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billionaire oligarchs who,</v>

325
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>control vast amounts,</v>

326
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 3>wealth and then they have</v>

327
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.023
<v Speaker 2>their family and everyone inherits it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have these fucking mutants that </v>

328
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:56.430
<v Speaker 2>are all inbred and they're all in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same bloodline mean that's,</v>

329
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.720
<v Speaker 2>that's history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

330
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:00.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean that has taken place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that</v>

331
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.930
<v Speaker 2>we should work very hard for equality of</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>

332
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I think equality of oPportunity give </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody a chance to play a game.</v>

333
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Everybody a chance to get into something</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

334
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.460
<v Speaker 2>and try to better themselves with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>endeavor and summit.</v>

335
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.830
<v Speaker 2>But whenever I hear equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I put my foot down.</v>

336
00:18:21.831 --> 00:18:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't it?</v>

337
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.533
<v Speaker 2>That's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that because some people </v>

338
00:18:25.611 --> 00:18:28.790
<v Speaker 2>work harder and if you have true </v>
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>

339
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.010
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to have equality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>

340
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Because true equality is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that are brilliant,</v>

341
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.170
<v Speaker 2>that are fantastic human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're essentially beach bums.</v>

342
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did like kick back and relax and do</v>

343
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.140
<v Speaker 2>the minimal amount of work to get things</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

344
00:18:45.141 --> 00:18:48.530
<v Speaker 2>and just enjoy life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a couple cocktails,</v>

345
00:18:48.531 --> 00:18:51.170
<v Speaker 2>go to the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have laughs with friends,</v>

346
00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:52.004
<v Speaker 2>that's what they like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I have other friends that want </v>

347
00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:54.771
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

348
00:18:54.771 --> 00:18:57.620
<v Speaker 2>world martial arts champions and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

349
00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.980
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have two different kinds of lives to</v>

350
00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:03.350
<v Speaker 2>different thing to different types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>

351
00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:04.184
<v Speaker 2>That style of human one person is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be extremely satisfied with one life </v>

352
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:08.773
<v Speaker 2>and extremely dissatisfied with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other life and you can interchange them </v>

353
00:19:11.421 --> 00:19:12.254
<v Speaker 2>back and forth.</v>

354
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said a bunch of things.</v>

355
00:19:14.811 --> 00:19:17.600
<v Speaker 1>We could spend three hours unpacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you Just said.</v>

356
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say a number of things.</v>

357
00:19:19.911 --> 00:19:20.744
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of opportunity is something I </v>

358
00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:27.530
<v Speaker 1>have yet to find the reasonable person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does not agree on this point.</v>

359
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.393
<v Speaker 1>In principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people will tell you it's not </v>

360
00:19:30.201 --> 00:19:33.860
<v Speaker 1>worth the effort of trying to pursue it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the danger of what happens if</v>

361
00:19:33.861 --> 00:19:35.420
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nobody disagrees.</v>

362
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Nobody reasonable disagrees that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be desirable to have that equality</v>

363
00:19:40.731 --> 00:19:43.460
<v Speaker 1>of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

364
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.310
<v Speaker 1>If you pursue it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up with a dystopia.</v>

365
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.563
<v Speaker 1>And even if it were possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would not be desirable for the </v>

366
00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:55.130
<v Speaker 1>reasons you point to about the benefits </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you're calling competition.</v>

367
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.540
<v Speaker 1>And I would want to tear competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a couple different values.</v>

368
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.540
<v Speaker 1>There's true competition against </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

369
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:03.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

370
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.620
<v Speaker 1>you're skiing down the slope and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to how you're doing and</v>

371
00:20:06.621 --> 00:20:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do it better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done it before,</v>

372
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

373
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's competition against others.</v>

374
00:20:12.141 --> 00:20:15.470
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that unites those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things is that the,</v>

375
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.000
<v Speaker 1>what you are trying to accomplish is </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

376
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:25.640
<v Speaker 1>It is the world telling you how </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful you are at something directly</v>

377
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.910
<v Speaker 1>rather than through some sort of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>channels,</v>

378
00:20:27.911 --> 00:20:28.744
<v Speaker 1>some sort of reward handed to you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some compliment given to you by </v>

379
00:20:31.971 --> 00:20:32.804
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a tremendous danger in a </v>

380
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:36.523
<v Speaker 1>socially mediated world in which those </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are successful are successful </v>

381
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:44.210
<v Speaker 1>because some social thing has told them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are correct because you can be</v>

382
00:20:44.211 --> 00:20:45.044
<v Speaker 1>dead wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem correct and move ahead in social </v>

383
00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:50.320
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're doing carpentry,</v>

384
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:55.321
<v Speaker 1>if you're in some sort of competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the beast is one that will</v>

385
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:56.434
<v Speaker 1>tell you when you've got it wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore it will allow you to actually </v>

386
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:02.650
<v Speaker 1>improve your insight in whatever form </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have it.</v>

387
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:03.484
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a tremendous fan of the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if your world is largely socially </v>

388
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:08.044
<v Speaker 1>mediated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make sure that some part of </v>

389
00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:11.104
<v Speaker 1>it isn't and you are confronting </v>
<v Speaker 1>something real enough to tell you when </v>

390
00:21:15.131 --> 00:21:17.920
<v Speaker 1>you're confused so that you can learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>how not to be confused,</v>

391
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.663
<v Speaker 2>but there are people in this world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>do want to push towards an equality of </v>

392
00:21:23.541 --> 00:21:24.374
<v Speaker 2>outcome and they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make it sound as if this is not </v>

393
00:21:27.741 --> 00:21:28.574
<v Speaker 2>Just logical but ethical and possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the future and that you are on the </v>

394
00:21:32.631 --> 00:21:34.940
<v Speaker 2>wrong side of history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>

395
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:35.803
<v Speaker 2>If you think that capitalism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition and all these things you </v>

396
00:21:38.571 --> 00:21:43.571
<v Speaker 2>just talked about are good and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really the best thing is to force people</v>

397
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.403
<v Speaker 2>to become some sort of utopian creature </v>
<v Speaker 2>that works together in unison and and </v>

398
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:54.190
<v Speaker 2>everybody is a egalitarian and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no need for feminism and men's rights.</v>

399
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:55.214
<v Speaker 2>Activists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everybody looks at everyone as </v>

400
00:21:56.391 --> 00:21:57.220
<v Speaker 2>an equal.</v>

401
00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two kinds of people who will </v>

402
00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:04.090
<v Speaker 1>advocate for equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One kind of person who will is confused.</v>

403
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:04.953
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand what happens if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go down this road and the other one </v>

404
00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 1>is cynical and they're using this as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse to justify something that just so</v>

405
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:12.124
<v Speaker 1>happens to reward them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but equality of opportunity isn't this </v>

406
00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:18.640
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It solves all of those problems.</v>

407
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Nobody believes that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have it ever realized in a perfect form.</v>

408
00:22:23.471 --> 00:22:24.304
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be bad luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to reduce somebody's </v>

409
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:28.503
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which don't want is any systematic bias </v>

410
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.260
<v Speaker 1>in luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

411
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.263
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to suffer some bad luck </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll all have some good luck and </v>

412
00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:39.490
<v Speaker 1>some of those things will actually shape</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trajectory of our lives,</v>

413
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.810
<v Speaker 1>which you don't want is some population </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just so happens to suffer more than</v>

414
00:22:43.811 --> 00:22:46.240
<v Speaker 1>its share of bad luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what we have now.</v>

415
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 1>So there is there just something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue here,</v>

416
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:52.510
<v Speaker 1>but we're so busy on this other </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointless conversation about equality of</v>

417
00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:53.344
<v Speaker 1>outcome that we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't get back to the thing that we </v>

418
00:22:56.591 --> 00:22:59.020
<v Speaker 1>all agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the right goal</v>

419
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.433
<v Speaker 2>and there's also some background chatter</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you'll get from the less less </v>

420
00:23:04.431 --> 00:23:05.264
<v Speaker 2>thought out where the people are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>just upset that other people have more </v>

421
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 2>and so it's is an uneducated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not very well thought out perspective on</v>

422
00:23:16.251 --> 00:23:17.084
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are upset that someone else has </v>

423
00:23:19.701 --> 00:23:20.534
<v Speaker 2>something and they're trying to somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>or another diminish the effect of their </v>

424
00:23:25.311 --> 00:23:27.920
<v Speaker 2>hard work and get something for </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

425
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine though,</v>

426
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.230
<v Speaker 1>so maybe we take a little digression </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

427
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:38.540
<v Speaker 1>My experience over the last six months </v>
<v Speaker 1>has done a bunch of things in my life.</v>

428
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:39.643
<v Speaker 1>One of them is it has put me in touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>with quite a number of black </v>

429
00:23:42.861 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I must tell you this.</v>

430
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.310
<v Speaker 1>It has changed my understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world substantially because I used to.</v>

431
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.290
<v Speaker 1>I knew there were black conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I always thought,</v>

432
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:52.843
<v Speaker 1>are they confused?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they not understanding which side </v>

433
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 1>they should be on and that is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not what's going on.</v>

434
00:23:59.060 --> 00:23:59.893
<v Speaker 1>What is going on is that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue which I couldn't hear at least </v>

435
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.270
<v Speaker 1>which looks at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can view the unfairness in the world</v>

436
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.610
<v Speaker 1>two different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look at it and you can say,</v>

437
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:11.444
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're structural unfairness in the </v>

438
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:17.501
<v Speaker 1>world and the cards that we in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>community are dealt are not fair.</v>

439
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.530
<v Speaker 1>We're not getting our share of the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>cards.</v>

440
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Or you can look at the world from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view of personal responsibility</v>

441
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:26.624
<v Speaker 1>and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

442
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.140
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of an academic question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether the cArds you got were fair.</v>

443
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.290
<v Speaker 1>You should play them as best you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them what they are.</v>

444
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:34.124
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that I didn't get was one has </v>

445
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:43.211
<v Speaker 1>almost no ability to address the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question of how the cards are dealt.</v>

446
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.520
<v Speaker 1>It's just not in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not in the range of somebody.</v>

447
00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:48.980
<v Speaker 1>An individual who discovers that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cards are unfairly dealt,</v>

448
00:24:48.981 --> 00:24:49.814
<v Speaker 1>can't do very much about that fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that individual can do a hell of a </v>

449
00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:57.131
<v Speaker 1>lot about their own position in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world by recognizing that actually you,</v>

450
00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if the cards are unfairly </v>

451
00:25:01.011 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 1>dealt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to play them very well and that</v>

452
00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:05.204
<v Speaker 1>developing the skill to play them well </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the ability to overcome at least </v>

453
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 1>some of the unfairness and how they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt.</v>

454
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.350
<v Speaker 1>And so I have now listened In on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>commerce.</v>

455
00:25:15.351 --> 00:25:16.184
<v Speaker 1>I've been invited into the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst some of these black </v>

456
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:19.274
<v Speaker 1>conservatives and this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are really saying is that </v>

457
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:22.964
<v Speaker 1>there is from the point of view of where</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put one's efforts dealing on the </v>

458
00:25:26.871 --> 00:25:29.360
<v Speaker 1>personal responsibility side pays back </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

459
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.194
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think frees us in </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization from addressing the </v>

460
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:35.420
<v Speaker 1>question of how the cards are dealt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should be focused on it,</v>

461
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:36.643
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it more or less solved the mystery in a </v>

462
00:25:39.111 --> 00:25:42.170
<v Speaker 1>way that I thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was quite fascinating.</v>

463
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.180
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

464
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm heartened that,</v>

465
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.660
<v Speaker 1>that they were willing to invite me into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that conversation.</v>

466
00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:50.900
<v Speaker 1>So I could hear it and finally figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what was what was going on.</v>

467
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.943
<v Speaker 1>So they advocate towards discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal responsibility as being core </v>

468
00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:56.600
<v Speaker 1>tenants that you should reinforce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

469
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.433
<v Speaker 1>And they are very sensitive to the issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what happens when you focus on the </v>

470
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:04.640
<v Speaker 1>unfairness of how the cards are dealt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

471
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:05.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what progressive's typically miss is </v>

472
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:12.680
<v Speaker 1>that it really does create a culture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependency if you focus on the fact that</v>

473
00:26:12.681 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 1>the cards are unfairly dealt and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you're facing a disadvantage,</v>

474
00:26:16.011 --> 00:26:18.440
<v Speaker 1>which is largely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

475
00:26:18.441 --> 00:26:23.441
<v Speaker 1>it demotivates you from pursuing success</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>

476
00:26:23.561 --> 00:26:24.394
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you recognize that you're starting at a </v>

477
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 1>disadvantage and that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're unlikely to win the game.</v>

478
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.590
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game is and what we think,</v>

479
00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:31.424
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can make progress and deliver </v>

480
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 1>your kids a head start relative to where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

481
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a win in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

482
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:41.563
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to trivialize any part of </v>

483
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:43.484
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the unfairness of the way the </v>

484
00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:47.430
<v Speaker 1>cards are dealt is really important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have obligations to address it.</v>

485
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.413
<v Speaker 1>But from the point of view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals within the community trying </v>

486
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:51.894
<v Speaker 1>to plot a course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beIng focused on the personal </v>

487
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:56.220
<v Speaker 1>responsibility side makes a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

488
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.230
<v Speaker 1>What are you thoughts on affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 1>action?</v>

489
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:59.423
<v Speaker 1>I've changed my tune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be for affirmative action </v>

490
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:06.440
<v Speaker 1>because it is justified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now the um,</v>

491
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.280
<v Speaker 1>the downsides of it are they loom very </v>
<v Speaker 1>large for me.</v>

492
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 1>And so what I would say is we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate the,</v>

493
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:19.251
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it is justified to engage</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some kind of intentional intervention</v>

494
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.980
<v Speaker 1>to fix a problem that has become </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic.</v>

495
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we separate that from what it </v>

496
00:27:26.191 --> 00:27:30.690
<v Speaker 1>is that we are advocating and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the substitute for it is something</v>

497
00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:33.480
<v Speaker 1>that anybody has properly spelled out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

498
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:38.810
<v Speaker 1>but let's just say I would be much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclined to see a substantial investment</v>

499
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:46.220
<v Speaker 1>in community that makes sense rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it applied at the individual level.</v>

500
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Because I will say before any of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to me at evergreen happen,</v>

501
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.373
<v Speaker 1>I did have the experience of having </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a number of black students in </v>

502
00:27:56.401 --> 00:28:01.401
<v Speaker 1>particular who suffered a totally a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stigma that had nothing to do with them.</v>

503
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Students who did very well on their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>merits,</v>

504
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.713
<v Speaker 1>who lived in a world that was quick to </v>
<v Speaker 1>judge them as having succeeded based on </v>

505
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 1>some advantage that for all I know they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even have.</v>

506
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

507
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the role of professor,</v>

508
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't necessarIly know how your </v>
<v Speaker 1>student ends up in front of you,</v>

509
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.713
<v Speaker 1>but I had no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some very bright students who I </v>

510
00:28:27.451 --> 00:28:31.860
<v Speaker 1>think suffered a stigma that came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that people in general imagined</v>

511
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.640
<v Speaker 1>that affirmative action was playing some</v>
<v Speaker 1>role in their world that it wasn't.</v>

512
00:28:35.641 --> 00:28:36.474
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affirmative action isn't even legal in </v>

513
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that the stigma appends pens</v>

514
00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:43.980
<v Speaker 1>to people is preposterous in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>context in particular.</v>

515
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

516
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.533
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who was a fireman who </v>
<v Speaker 2>told similar stories and he was talking </v>

517
00:28:50.891 --> 00:28:53.800
<v Speaker 2>about the resentment of the other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were on the fire force.</v>

518
00:28:53.801 --> 00:28:56.290
<v Speaker 2>If a guy got in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if a guy was qualified,</v>

519
00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.820
<v Speaker 2>if a guy was black because they assumed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he wasn't as qualified,</v>

520
00:29:00.821 --> 00:29:03.040
<v Speaker 2>and the reason why he got through it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>through affirmative action.</v>

521
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.113
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy because what it is is </v>

522
00:29:06.371 --> 00:29:10.600
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to combat racism by </v>
<v Speaker 2>fueling racism advertently</v>

523
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:11.543
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates this whole cascade of </v>

524
00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:14.334
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the question really the </v>

525
00:29:15.991 --> 00:29:20.220
<v Speaker 1>civilization wide question is what do we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do about.</v>

526
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could retune the analysis for each of</v>

527
00:29:24.031 --> 00:29:24.864
<v Speaker 1>the populations in questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the case of black people in the new </v>

528
00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:29.394
<v Speaker 1>world that is the americas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most black folks in the new world are </v>

529
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:34.524
<v Speaker 1>here via the route of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is slavery was so brutal </v>

530
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.383
<v Speaker 1>in destroying the that these people had </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to where they came from and then </v>

531
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.103
<v Speaker 1>putting them together in a synthetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that was built to serve the </v>

532
00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:55.930
<v Speaker 1>masters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

533
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.650
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denying black folks the ability to learn</v>

534
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:00.484
<v Speaker 1>to read obviously limits access to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge library of insights that happened </v>

535
00:30:07.601 --> 00:30:12.601
<v Speaker 1>to be a housed with the population that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transported these folks from,</v>

536
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.010
<v Speaker 1>from africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in any case,</v>

537
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:15.844
<v Speaker 1>my point would be that is hobbling that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was intentionally hobbling during </v>

538
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:20.104
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>

539
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.270
<v Speaker 1>The legacy of that hobbling is one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to quantify.</v>

540
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:30.271
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what role that plays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can say any population that has,</v>

541
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to speak now as I do as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologist.</v>

542
00:30:36.011 --> 00:30:36.844
<v Speaker 1>I think of us as robots that have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer on our shoulders that runs </v>

543
00:30:40.781 --> 00:30:43.450
<v Speaker 1>software and our culture is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>software.</v>

544
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.213
<v Speaker 1>If you take that robot with the computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you delete the software package and </v>

545
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:49.474
<v Speaker 1>then you install some other software </v>
<v Speaker 1>package designed to make it do one </v>

546
00:30:52.181 --> 00:30:57.181
<v Speaker 1>particular job that has tremendous harm </v>
<v Speaker 1>built into it and it's reversible,</v>

547
00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.193
<v Speaker 1>but it is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we know that we didn't </v>

548
00:31:02.831 --> 00:31:03.664
<v Speaker 1>succeed in fixing this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the emancipation did not </v>

549
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.273
<v Speaker 1>properly deal with how much harm has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been done by bringing people from </v>

550
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.673
<v Speaker 1>different parts of africa and pooling </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in one population based on </v>

551
00:31:17.771 --> 00:31:19.420
<v Speaker 1>effectively skin color alone.</v>

552
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.210
<v Speaker 1>And then at the point that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>freed it,</v>

553
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.830
<v Speaker 1>there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no,</v>

554
00:31:23.831 --> 00:31:24.664
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no understanding because our </v>

555
00:31:29.081 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 1>understanding of biology and culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't sophisticated yet.</v>

556
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.510
<v Speaker 1>It still isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

557
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.373
<v Speaker 1>I think we do at some point have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>an honest accounting of how much damage </v>

558
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.273
<v Speaker 1>happened in that process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we also have to realize that that </v>

559
00:31:45.311 --> 00:31:46.240
<v Speaker 1>damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

560
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:47.074
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know right now having been active in </v>

561
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:50.914
<v Speaker 1>trying to make the world a better place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that I'm running a foul of an </v>

562
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:55.390
<v Speaker 1>argument called white man's burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

563
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:57.640
<v Speaker 1>and so we all know that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>

564
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.890
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that white man's burden</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>

565
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:01.323
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be wielded against me for even </v>

566
00:32:02.711 --> 00:32:03.970
<v Speaker 1>saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>

567
00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:04.804
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real story of what happened </v>

568
00:32:07.871 --> 00:32:09.860
<v Speaker 1>in the americas is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

569
00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:15.220
<v Speaker 1>a nice story and the implications are </v>
<v Speaker 1>with us to this day,</v>

570
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.720
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows how deep they go because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't studied the question properly.</v>

571
00:32:19.721 --> 00:32:20.554
<v Speaker 1>And in fact many of the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left pushing the sort of naive </v>

572
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:26.343
<v Speaker 1>narrative about equality are I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>fearful of what will happen if we study </v>

573
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:34.800
<v Speaker 1>the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't share their fear now.</v>

574
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right about fearful that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

575
00:32:36.801 --> 00:32:37.634
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of like what you were </v>

576
00:32:38.741 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

577
00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.163
<v Speaker 2>with that woman bringing up ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in meetings and people just sort </v>

578
00:32:43.431 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Speaker 2>of showing their juggler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't attack.</v>

579
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 2>He got a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of us in terms of,</v>

580
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.183
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States or just this massive </v>

581
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.493
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of us as a super organism and I </v>

582
00:32:56.961 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 2>think if you had an organism that had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>broken knee,</v>

583
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.531
<v Speaker 2>he would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

584
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I got to fix that knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

585
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:07.310
<v Speaker 2>I can't just give that need less work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible to fix the knee?</v>

586
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well let's fix the knee.</v>

587
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.940
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to just give the knee </v>
<v Speaker 2>last work,</v>

588
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.220
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to make it easier for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>knee to get by.</v>

589
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.550
<v Speaker 2>What you want to do is strengthen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my thought,</v>

590
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.670
<v Speaker 2>and I've said this as a very simplistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of looking at it,</v>

591
00:33:19.671 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 2>but if you really wanted to make America</v>
<v Speaker 2>great again,</v>

592
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

593
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.013
<v Speaker 2>You really want to make America great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you would want to do is have less </v>

594
00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:27.854
<v Speaker 2>losers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'd want to go and find these </v>

595
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:31.094
<v Speaker 2>places where people are in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>economically deprived areas where </v>

596
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:37.274
<v Speaker 2>there's a ton of crime and violence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have like a real good sense </v>

597
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:48.230
<v Speaker 2>of like a potential positive outcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>from where they're at,</v>

598
00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:49.064
<v Speaker 2>where they're at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and transform that with a fraction of </v>

599
00:33:52.191 --> 00:33:53.024
<v Speaker 2>the money that we spent trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuild nations and invading </v>

600
00:33:55.761 --> 00:33:56.594
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could invest in many of our gigantic </v>

601
00:34:00.801 --> 00:34:04.520
<v Speaker 2>problems that we have in inner cities </v>
<v Speaker 2>and completely rebuild them.</v>

602
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.713
<v Speaker 2>It could be done and it could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical implications on the entire </v>

603
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:10.574
<v Speaker 2>country as a whole if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of like a place like baltimore </v>

604
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:15.531
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

605
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:16.364
<v Speaker 2>I had Michael Woods on who was a former </v>
<v Speaker 2>police officer in baltimore and he sort </v>

606
00:34:19.881 --> 00:34:23.570
<v Speaker 2>of explained all the different issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happen in baltimore,</v>

607
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:24.404
<v Speaker 2>particularly where there was areas where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they literally weren't selling homes to </v>

608
00:34:27.411 --> 00:34:28.244
<v Speaker 2>black people.</v>

609
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.120
<v Speaker 2>They would not sell homes like this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a white only area.</v>

610
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Like they had systematic racism built </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the system for a long time and just</v>

611
00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:42.290
<v Speaker 2>if someone just invested money into the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not someone,</v>

612
00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:46.280
<v Speaker 2>the United States government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we systematically invested money into</v>

613
00:34:46.281 --> 00:34:49.790
<v Speaker 2>these places and rebuilt them with </v>
<v Speaker 2>community centers,</v>

614
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 2>places where people could go where there</v>
<v Speaker 2>were safe staff,</v>

615
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:56.090
<v Speaker 2>them with a ton of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated counselors.</v>

616
00:34:56.091 --> 00:34:59.060
<v Speaker 2>The people that wanted to help give them</v>
<v Speaker 2>activities,</v>

617
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 2>give them skills and trades and show </v>
<v Speaker 2>them ways out.</v>

618
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:04.303
<v Speaker 2>Give them a design it that's not nearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>as impossible as trying to rebuild </v>

619
00:35:09.351 --> 00:35:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan or nation building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're doing that.</v>

620
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:13.670
<v Speaker 2>We're doing that all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

621
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:14.504
<v Speaker 2>halliburton got no bid contracts for </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of dollars to do shit that we </v>

622
00:35:18.351 --> 00:35:20.300
<v Speaker 2>don't even know what the fuck they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing over there.</v>

623
00:35:20.301 --> 00:35:21.134
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could have a fraction of that </v>

624
00:35:23.271 --> 00:35:24.104
<v Speaker 2>money and invested into inner cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could literally change entire </v>

625
00:35:28.431 --> 00:35:31.050
<v Speaker 2>generations of human beings that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out of there.</v>

626
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.950
<v Speaker 2>A couple things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

627
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the analogy of the busted</v>

628
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 1>knee because in fact we used to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>this mistake medically,</v>

629
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:41.903
<v Speaker 1>right until recently we didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that part of the healing </v>

630
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:45.984
<v Speaker 1>process was not protecting the knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but putting it through physical therapy </v>

631
00:35:48.601 --> 00:35:49.434
<v Speaker 1>that properly exposed it to stress this </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it rebuilt and came back strong </v>

632
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 1>and so we are making that error and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have made that error in terms of what to</v>

633
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:00.384
<v Speaker 1>do with the stratification of society in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way that locks up opportunity in some </v>

634
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:08.184
<v Speaker 1>communities and not others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should be honest with </v>

635
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 1>ourselves about why that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I agree.</v>

636
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.443
<v Speaker 1>You could make what would be massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments in communities for a </v>

637
00:36:19.141 --> 00:36:23.880
<v Speaker 1>fraction of what we spend tinkering </v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad in ways that have just spent huge</v>

638
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:25.110
<v Speaker 1>amounts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

639
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 1>of treasure on projects that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

640
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could do that.</v>

641
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:34.110
<v Speaker 1>The reason that that doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think has anything to do with it</v>

642
00:36:34.111 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 1>being an obvious that it would be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>

643
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.113
<v Speaker 1>I think it has to do with the same group</v>
<v Speaker 1>selection issue that we were talking </v>

644
00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:47.541
<v Speaker 1>about with respect to communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say if you are at the top of</v>

645
00:36:47.671 --> 00:36:48.504
<v Speaker 1>the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to educate somebody else's </v>

646
00:36:51.841 --> 00:36:56.010
<v Speaker 1>kids to compete with yours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a reason that we.</v>

647
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.023
<v Speaker 1>Why do our public schools suck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because we don't know how to make </v>

648
00:37:00.211 --> 00:37:02.040
<v Speaker 1>a school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

649
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.293
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because people know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a school when it's for their kids </v>

650
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:08.933
<v Speaker 1>and they're not so interested in making </v>
<v Speaker 1>a school for other people's kids and so </v>

651
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:16.821
<v Speaker 1>this is a deep chronic problem with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sociopolitical system.</v>

652
00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:20.730
<v Speaker 1>We have to confront that and actually I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think we have to.</v>

653
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.313
<v Speaker 1>We have to come to agreement that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually it is in the long term wise to </v>

654
00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:28.224
<v Speaker 1>educate other people's kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if in the short term it's </v>

655
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.820
<v Speaker 1>economically frightening.</v>

656
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big conspiracy about children in </v>

657
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:38.664
<v Speaker 2>schools and keeping them stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure that the school system is </v>

658
00:37:42.331 --> 00:37:43.860
<v Speaker 2>frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

659
00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:44.694
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt like that conspiracy </v>

660
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:50.520
<v Speaker 2>was really just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no motivation to make it better.</v>

661
00:37:50.521 --> 00:37:51.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

662
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:54.750
<v Speaker 2>and when you look at the amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>that teachers get paid him,</v>

663
00:37:54.751 --> 00:37:56.970
<v Speaker 2>it says disturbing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think of the,</v>

664
00:37:56.971 --> 00:37:58.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the job of,</v>

665
00:37:58.561 --> 00:38:02.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to tell you you're a god </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn teacher too deep,</v>

666
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:05.700
<v Speaker 2>but you got paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't go about it that way folks.</v>

667
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.380
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you've,</v>

668
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:08.763
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about here is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most important thing that can happen to </v>

669
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.810
<v Speaker 2>your child in the developmental phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

670
00:38:15.811 --> 00:38:19.170
<v Speaker 2>The education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like giving them a view of the world,</v>

671
00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:22.680
<v Speaker 2>explaining them all these things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had not known before.</v>

672
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:23.603
<v Speaker 2>Your first experiences with so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different subjects and topics and </v>

673
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:29.370
<v Speaker 2>concepts come from your teachers.</v>

674
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.950
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got really lucky man.</v>

675
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean I went to a public school in high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school in newton,</v>

676
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:36.304
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to newton south high school and </v>

677
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:40.210
<v Speaker 2>it was a really good school and I still </v>
<v Speaker 2>had shitty teachers.</v>

678
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I still had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

679
00:38:41.621 --> 00:38:42.454
<v Speaker 2>even in that really good school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comparatively really good because I </v>

680
00:38:45.431 --> 00:38:47.590
<v Speaker 2>went to a school before that in Jamaica </v>
<v Speaker 2>plain,</v>

681
00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 2>which was like an inner city school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was scary,</v>

682
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.840
<v Speaker 2>real dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like just,</v>

683
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like the most dangerous in boston,</v>

684
00:38:56.441 --> 00:39:00.910
<v Speaker 2>but very sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventeen year old kids in seventh grade</v>

685
00:39:00.911 --> 00:39:05.080
<v Speaker 2>that had never graduated like violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of weirdness.</v>

686
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Like I had my head down for god through </v>
<v Speaker 2>that year and then all of a sudden I was</v>

687
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:14.380
<v Speaker 2>in this what we call fast times that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hebrew high because it was predominantly</v>

688
00:39:14.381 --> 00:39:16.300
<v Speaker 2>jewish neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a.</v>

689
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Even then there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was still some terrible teachers.</v>

690
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:19.781
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

691
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:20.614
<v Speaker 2>it's just the job is so important and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country have done some weird </v>

692
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 2>thing where we've taken one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important jobs that you could ever.</v>

693
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:36.980
<v Speaker 2>You could ever hire someone to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>educate children and made it almost like</v>

694
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 2>it's inconsequential.</v>

695
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hesitant.</v>

696
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:44.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not always hesitant about </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy.</v>

697
00:39:44.201 --> 00:39:46.240
<v Speaker 1>There are conspiracies and we don't deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>well with it,</v>

698
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.990
<v Speaker 1>but one doesn't need conspiracy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain this.</v>

699
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 1>This effectively can evolve without </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody's consciously thinking I want to</v>

700
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:57.840
<v Speaker 1>sabotage somebody else's kids school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

701
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.770
<v Speaker 1>but I will say my experience in school </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

702
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.260
<v Speaker 1>it was horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>School did not work for me and maybe,</v>

703
00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:09.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every five teachers I hit one invested </v>

704
00:40:12.341 --> 00:40:13.174
<v Speaker 1>and cared and took the time to scratch </v>
<v Speaker 1>their head about why I wasn't </v>

705
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:17.490
<v Speaker 1>succeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

706
00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.493
<v Speaker 2>that must have had an impact on you </v>
<v Speaker 2>though as an educator that you remember </v>

707
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.150
<v Speaker 2>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those one out of five.</v>

708
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the</v>

709
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:27.020
<v Speaker 1>funny thing is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I was teaching,</v>

710
00:40:27.021 --> 00:40:32.021
<v Speaker 1>I taught for 14 years at evergreen and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like maybe I wasn't the only,</v>

711
00:40:34.521 --> 00:40:35.354
<v Speaker 1>but I was very nearly the only person on</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty anywhere that I could think of </v>

712
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:43.850
<v Speaker 1>who had not been a good student and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

713
00:40:43.851 --> 00:40:44.684
<v Speaker 1>but this was a very interesting window </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I became a professor because I </v>

714
00:40:50.001 --> 00:40:50.834
<v Speaker 1>loved science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the academy is where science </v>

715
00:40:53.331 --> 00:40:54.980
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not because I want it to be a teacher.</v>

716
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:55.873
<v Speaker 1>My experience in school made me want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from the thing as fast as </v>

717
00:40:58.521 --> 00:40:59.354
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having had the experience of school </v>

718
00:41:02.871 --> 00:41:06.350
<v Speaker 1>completely failing and my to my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise,</v>

719
00:41:06.351 --> 00:41:07.184
<v Speaker 1>learning how to think without school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not where I learned that I </v>

720
00:41:10.131 --> 00:41:10.964
<v Speaker 1>learned at primarily from my grandfather</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my brother and other people in my </v>

721
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:16.730
<v Speaker 1>environment who weren't associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

722
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.983
<v Speaker 1>But once I got to being a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this was only possible at </v>

723
00:41:24.261 --> 00:41:25.094
<v Speaker 1>evergreen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evergreen made no rules about what you </v>

724
00:41:27.381 --> 00:41:28.520
<v Speaker 1>did in the classroom.</v>

725
00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Literally no rule about what subject you</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught.</v>

726
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.970
<v Speaker 1>They could hire you as a biologist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>could teach dance if people showed up to</v>

727
00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:37.550
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could teach whatever you want in.</v>

728
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.660
<v Speaker 1>And the key was you could teach in </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever way you wanted.</v>

729
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.930
<v Speaker 1>And so that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

730
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like a great idea if you're super </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated,</v>

731
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:47.023
<v Speaker 1>it works two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People abused it and they would use it </v>

732
00:41:49.761 --> 00:41:50.594
<v Speaker 1>to reduce their workload to next to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing and they wouldn't invest in </v>

733
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:55.520
<v Speaker 1>their students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then other people looked at this and</v>

734
00:41:55.521 --> 00:41:56.354
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.253
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was glorious to have that kind of </v>

736
00:41:58.731 --> 00:42:01.670
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I taught in a way that would have</v>

737
00:42:01.671 --> 00:42:04.400
<v Speaker 1>worked for me if I had been a student </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

738
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:05.234
<v Speaker 1>which changed a lot of things and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually worked for a lot of bad </v>

739
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't typically become professors.</v>

740
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:16.370
<v Speaker 1>So there's almost nobody on the faculty </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere who has a clue why bad students</v>

741
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:17.780
<v Speaker 1>are the way they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

742
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.240
<v Speaker 1>They just don't intuit it because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't their experience.</v>

743
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:25.130
<v Speaker 1>But if you were like me and you were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad student and then you ended up with a</v>

744
00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:25.964
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly all sorts of bad students </v>

745
00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:29.324
<v Speaker 1>aren't uncommon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so suddenly somebody who's speaking </v>

746
00:42:31.191 --> 00:42:32.024
<v Speaker 1>to them and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you're being a bad student </v>

747
00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:36.650
<v Speaker 1>isn't synonymous with you not having </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

748
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really empowering for them.</v>

749
00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:40.150
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

750
00:42:40.151 --> 00:42:43.680
<v Speaker 1>it was an interesting experience and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

751
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:46.850
<v Speaker 1>My wife actually was a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>student.</v>

752
00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:47.684
<v Speaker 1>She loved school and we would actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>often teach the same students either </v>

753
00:42:50.781 --> 00:42:53.660
<v Speaker 1>together or we would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would take my program and then they</v>

754
00:42:53.661 --> 00:42:54.494
<v Speaker 1>would bounce over to her program next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they would get these kind of two </v>

755
00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.460
<v Speaker 1>different views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

756
00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:01.423
<v Speaker 1>each of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were both enlightened by our </v>

757
00:43:04.881 --> 00:43:06.630
<v Speaker 1>relationship with each other because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

758
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:07.483
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that I might've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismissive of the great students right </v>

759
00:43:10.761 --> 00:43:11.810
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one who,</v>

760
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was my,</v>

761
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:14.263
<v Speaker 1>my closest person on earth and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to a window into how she saw the </v>

762
00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:18.944
<v Speaker 1>world and she got a window into what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids who weren't performing well in </v>

763
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:25.070
<v Speaker 1>school might've been thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>

764
00:43:25.071 --> 00:43:25.904
<v Speaker 1>that was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very useful background to have for </v>

765
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:29.140
<v Speaker 1>teaching.</v>

766
00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.620
<v Speaker 2>There's a tremendous amount of power and</v>
<v Speaker 2>teachIng people.</v>

767
00:43:32.621 --> 00:43:33.454
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird relationship between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially when you're teaching </v>

768
00:43:37.001 --> 00:43:40.780
<v Speaker 2>someone and you're giving them credit </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards their degree.</v>

769
00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

770
00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I was very poor student in high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've wasted a ton of time just going</v>

771
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.710
<v Speaker 2>to college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people didn't think I was a loser,</v>

772
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:55.430
<v Speaker 2>but I taught at boston university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to teach taekwondo and I taught a</v>

773
00:43:55.431 --> 00:43:57.730
<v Speaker 2>credited course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pass fail a,</v>

774
00:43:57.731 --> 00:43:59.620
<v Speaker 2>but it actually counted towards your </v>
<v Speaker 2>gpa.</v>

775
00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:04.570
<v Speaker 2>So I hAd kids in my class and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell them it's really simple,</v>

776
00:44:04.571 --> 00:44:05.404
<v Speaker 2>just try and you get an a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just show up and try and I'll give you </v>

777
00:44:09.041 --> 00:44:14.041
<v Speaker 2>an a because like athletics or it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair.</v>

778
00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:16.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that are just extreme end</v>

779
00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.273
<v Speaker 2>dearborn person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their body holds onto too much fat and </v>

780
00:44:19.681 --> 00:44:20.514
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have a background in any </v>

781
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:23.650
<v Speaker 2>athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not flexible.</v>

782
00:44:23.651 --> 00:44:24.484
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult for them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how to move their body </v>

783
00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:28.210
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

784
00:44:28.211 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 2>It's essentially like trying teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone</v>

785
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.023
<v Speaker 1>to be a professional speaker where </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone has been speaking english their </v>

786
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 1>whole life where other people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning it for the first time.</v>

787
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.073
<v Speaker 1>It didn't seem fair to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to judge them in terms of the actual </v>

788
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:45.190
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like a.</v>

789
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:48.690
<v Speaker 1>It's almost contrary to what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was giving them a quality of outcome,</v>

790
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.350
<v Speaker 1>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

791
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

792
00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I know what you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing because I did the same thing.</v>

793
00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:56.183
<v Speaker 1>So I would tell students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show up and try and you are </v>

794
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:01.674
<v Speaker 1>completely safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get full credit and </v>

795
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:06.090
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a nice evaluation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wrote written evaluations to them,</v>

796
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.840
<v Speaker 1>but if you want an evaluation that raves</v>
<v Speaker 1>about you,</v>

797
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:13.620
<v Speaker 1>that talks about you know your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your extraordinary capacity,</v>

798
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:17.010
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to strive and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I wanted to do,</v>

799
00:45:17.011 --> 00:45:17.844
<v Speaker 1>which sounds like what you were doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them safe enough to discover what </v>

800
00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:21.234
<v Speaker 1>they could do because I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether this will make sense to your </v>

801
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:29.850
<v Speaker 1>audience or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we are overly concerned.</v>

802
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.600
<v Speaker 1>We have been sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the job of a teacher is to</v>

803
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:38.310
<v Speaker 1>assess how much the student has learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>that basically the job of the teacher is</v>

804
00:45:38.311 --> 00:45:42.060
<v Speaker 1>largely to report out to the world how </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualified this person has.</v>

805
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a very hard job in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplines in mind.</v>

806
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:48.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the student who did brilliantly,</v>

807
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.613
<v Speaker 1>I would know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the student who did nothing I would </v>

808
00:45:51.961 --> 00:45:52.794
<v Speaker 1>usually know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were lots of students in the </v>

809
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:54.984
<v Speaker 1>middle who might have gotten the lesson </v>
<v Speaker 1>really deeply and it might have matured </v>

810
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000
<v Speaker 1>over the course of two years after they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were no longer in contact with me.</v>

811
00:46:05.131 --> 00:46:05.964
<v Speaker 1>At the point I was writing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluation of them that might not have </v>

812
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:10.950
<v Speaker 1>been a good place to assess how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've actually learned,</v>

813
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:15.180
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I steered away from the idea that my job</v>

814
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:17.730
<v Speaker 1>was to tell the world how well this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person had done,</v>

815
00:46:17.731 --> 00:46:19.860
<v Speaker 1>unless they'd done great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they'd done really well,</v>

816
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:20.760
<v Speaker 1>if they'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

817
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:23.970
<v Speaker 1>surprise themselves and me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that they were capable of.</v>

818
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:24.803
<v Speaker 1>I loved saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to run down a student </v>

819
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.913
<v Speaker 1>who hadn't really shined in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom because there's was a totally </v>

820
00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:35.730
<v Speaker 1>artificial moment to judge how much they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had picked up.</v>

821
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No need to run them down.</v>

822
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

823
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.420
<v Speaker 1>everybody's starting off at a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

824
00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:43.254
<v Speaker 1>It's not like everybody's on the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>lIne and the gun goes off and everybody </v>

825
00:46:46.201 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 1>runs with the first step in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

826
00:46:49.531 --> 00:46:51.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

827
00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:56.640
<v Speaker 1>And there's some or many activities in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which your,</v>

828
00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:58.043
<v Speaker 1>how you do initially doesn't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>predict ultimately whether you'll be </v>

829
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.080
<v Speaker 1>unusually good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

830
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

831
00:47:04.801 --> 00:47:05.634
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with athletics is that </v>

832
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:08.814
<v Speaker 1>people who are extraordinarily gifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes don't excel because it seems </v>

833
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:17.901
<v Speaker 1>to come too easy for them and they never</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop the proper stamina for hard,</v>

834
00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.133
<v Speaker 1>difficult work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shy away from that because if </v>

835
00:47:21.391 --> 00:47:23.740
<v Speaker 1>things aren't easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know.</v>

836
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:24.623
<v Speaker 1>Here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that are really gifted in one </v>

837
00:47:27.441 --> 00:47:28.650
<v Speaker 1>asset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one martial art,</v>

838
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:29.883
<v Speaker 1>like say like</v>

839
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:30.903
<v Speaker 2>someone who's gifted as a striker will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll enter into mixed martial arts </v>

840
00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:37.360
<v Speaker 2>and find that they really are not very </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at grappling.</v>

841
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.590
<v Speaker 2>And so they don't like that feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being dominated in training.</v>

842
00:47:41.591 --> 00:47:44.920
<v Speaker 2>So they don't give it 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't throw themselves into it.</v>

843
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:45.754
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they avoid it and they try to find </v>

844
00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.100
<v Speaker 2>workarounds and they're almost always </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeated by grapplers.</v>

845
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

846
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.120
<v Speaker 2>because of the fact that they're gifted </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talented,</v>

847
00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:00.420
<v Speaker 2>they've avoided the difficult real a </v>
<v Speaker 2>character building moments.</v>

848
00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:03.760
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is interesting that you say that.</v>

849
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I was on a train in New York and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

850
00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:09.003
<v Speaker 1>looking at twitter and somebody had </v>
<v Speaker 1>posted an article that caused the dime </v>

851
00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:14.854
<v Speaker 1>to drop for me with respect to mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and why they were suddenly </v>

852
00:48:18.371 --> 00:48:20.650
<v Speaker 1>a thing in my life where they hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>

853
00:48:20.651 --> 00:48:21.484
<v Speaker 1>I had assumed that it was simply the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that I'd showed up on your podcast </v>

854
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:27.520
<v Speaker 1>and obviously you're in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so a certain number of mixed martial</v>

855
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:28.354
<v Speaker 1>arts people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're now following me and I was seeing </v>

856
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 1>their tweets and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy,</v>

857
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:33.394
<v Speaker 1>I think his name is John Kirby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posted an article that he had written </v>

858
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 1>about Bruce Lee and his argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see this article?</v>

859
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:41.563
<v Speaker 1>No argument was why I'm Bruce Lee and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts points the direction </v>

860
00:48:46.211 --> 00:48:48.490
<v Speaker 1>to how to fix our political dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

861
00:48:48.491 --> 00:48:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

862
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:51.880
<v Speaker 1>and so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his argument was,</v>

863
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:54.160
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no expert on this at all.</v>

864
00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his argument was that Bruce Lee,</v>

865
00:48:58.691 --> 00:48:59.524
<v Speaker 1>effectively the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the innovator at the beginning of mixed </v>

866
00:49:02.411 --> 00:49:03.244
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was interested in testing a martial art </v>

867
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:09.663
<v Speaker 1>against all comers rather than requiring</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person on the other side to be </v>

868
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:14.763
<v Speaker 1>practicing the same martial art and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a kind of model in that for </v>

869
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:23.380
<v Speaker 1>other disciplines than any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime,</v>

870
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:24.243
<v Speaker 1>if your debate style requires somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be debating in the same way on the </v>

871
00:49:28.811 --> 00:49:31.510
<v Speaker 1>other side of the argument that it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strong,</v>

872
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.823
<v Speaker 1>right then it's a formalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're reAlly good at arguing </v>

873
00:49:36.581 --> 00:49:39.400
<v Speaker 1>that it shouldn't really matter as long </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the person speaks the same language,</v>

874
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:42.850
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to meet them on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing field and hash stuff out.</v>

875
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:44.170
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

876
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.113
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a number of things linked up in </v>

877
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:48.964
<v Speaker 1>this way that there is a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial boundary placed between </v>

878
00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 1>things and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who are interested in tearing down</v>

879
00:49:57.941 --> 00:49:58.774
<v Speaker 1>those boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though that opens up a huge range </v>

880
00:50:01.511 --> 00:50:02.344
<v Speaker 1>of things that they may face often have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to teach in their particular </v>

881
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.220
<v Speaker 1>realm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

882
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think of other examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this and a lars anderson archer.</v>

883
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a place where you're an expert,</v>

884
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think of lars anderson?</v>

885
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.593
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does like a lot of weird trick shots </v>

886
00:50:23.731 --> 00:50:26.130
<v Speaker 2>with archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of fun to watch.</v>

887
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:26.993
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he's essentially done is he </v>

888
00:50:29.451 --> 00:50:30.284
<v Speaker 2>believes he has not reinvented but </v>
<v Speaker 2>rediscovered a method of holding arrows </v>

889
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:40.270
<v Speaker 2>in your fingers so that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with practice repeat here,</v>

890
00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:41.123
<v Speaker 2>jamie's got video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this character that you could release a </v>

891
00:50:45.141 --> 00:50:50.141
<v Speaker 2>bunch of arrows in a row and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's capable of shooting like way faster</v>

892
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:53.660
<v Speaker 2>than the average person and multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows.</v>

893
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:54.673
<v Speaker 2>He can throw things in the air and hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>it with multiple arrows before it hits </v>

894
00:50:57.921 --> 00:50:58.754
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>

895
00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my thought here is that this is,</v>

896
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I have a number of different examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is throwing them.</v>

897
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here he's going to throw a bottle cap in</v>

898
00:51:10.211 --> 00:51:12.760
<v Speaker 1>the air and he hits it with an arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

899
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Even if there are lots of cuts here with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

900
00:51:15.551 --> 00:51:16.384
<v Speaker 1>we're not seeing where he misses the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that he can do this with enough </v>

901
00:51:19.151 --> 00:51:22.000
<v Speaker 1>reliability to make a video to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

902
00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:22.893
<v Speaker 1>You can tell there are enough things </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he hits two things in one shot </v>

903
00:51:25.061 --> 00:51:26.890
<v Speaker 1>that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't be completely fiction.</v>

904
00:51:26.891 --> 00:51:27.724
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at his explanatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he took a lot of crap for this from </v>

905
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.133
<v Speaker 1>people who were in the archery world who</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't like the way he violated all of </v>

906
00:51:35.771 --> 00:51:38.020
<v Speaker 1>the rules about what good archery form </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>

907
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.980
<v Speaker 1>And so he made a response video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English isn't his first langUage,</v>

908
00:51:41.981 --> 00:51:43.030
<v Speaker 1>so it's a little hard to follow.</v>

909
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.863
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

910
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:47.950
<v Speaker 1>but any way it's pretty clear that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done is he's just said,</v>

911
00:51:47.951 --> 00:51:49.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

912
00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:50.770
<v Speaker 1>there are bose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're arrows.</v>

913
00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:51.663
<v Speaker 1>What is the best way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things from the point of view of </v>

914
00:51:53.681 --> 00:51:56.410
<v Speaker 1>solving these different problems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's discovered a whole landscape of</v>

915
00:51:56.411 --> 00:52:01.300
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I don't think you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover if you took archery and took it</v>

916
00:52:01.301 --> 00:52:05.020
<v Speaker 1>seriously and learned from a master who </v>
<v Speaker 1>had good form.</v>

917
00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:07.030
<v Speaker 1>You'd never discover it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

918
00:52:07.031 --> 00:52:08.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm there.</v>

919
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Might as well put the other examples on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the table.</v>

920
00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

921
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:18.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a danny macaskill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bicyclist.</v>

922
00:52:18.881 --> 00:52:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Are you aware of this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've heard that name before.</v>

923
00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Scottish kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very young.</v>

924
00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at some point,</v>

925
00:52:26.021 --> 00:52:26.854
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately he became a surprise </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise sensation on youtube and red </v>

926
00:52:31.121 --> 00:52:34.060
<v Speaker 1>bull figured out that he was a money </v>
<v Speaker 1>maker and they sort of pushed him.</v>

927
00:52:34.061 --> 00:52:36.610
<v Speaker 1>So he's now had a couple of serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidents.</v>

928
00:52:36.611 --> 00:52:37.550
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

929
00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.553
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he Is capable of doing things on a </v>

930
00:52:40.571 --> 00:52:42.010
<v Speaker 1>bicycle especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

931
00:52:42.011 --> 00:52:44.260
<v Speaker 1>in an urban environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopping from</v>

932
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.190
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy exists.</v>

933
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:50.770
<v Speaker 2>did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of these guys,</v>

934
00:52:50.771 --> 00:52:52.810
<v Speaker 2>these daredevil youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god's just died.</v>

935
00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:55.150
<v Speaker 2>a guy in China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh god,</v>

936
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gets out of his,</v>

937
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:58.910
<v Speaker 2>out of his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>BuT I mean,</v>

938
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.910
<v Speaker 2>check that out for people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>

939
00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Only this guy's on a rooftop and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing these stents where he's riding his</v>

940
00:53:05.501 --> 00:53:06.334
<v Speaker 2>bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing flips from one side of the </v>

941
00:53:08.741 --> 00:53:09.574
<v Speaker 2>building to the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's riding on the edges of the </v>

942
00:53:12.071 --> 00:53:13.810
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking down,</v>

943
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:17.010
<v Speaker 2>hitting the brakes certain death on </v>
<v Speaker 2>either side.</v>

944
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

945
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a hard time looking at that.</v>

946
00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.770
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty rough.</v>

947
00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:24.810
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

948
00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 2>and it's fallen and hurt</v>

949
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.320
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a bmx bike either.</v>

950
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a regular bike.</v>

951
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:30.510
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

952
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:32.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not quite standard,</v>

953
00:53:32.821 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more mountain bike proportions,</v>

954
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.593
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

955
00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.460
<v Speaker 1>it's probably has to b to b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rugged,</v>

956
00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:39.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

957
00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:40.443
<v Speaker 1>It's souped up in particular ways so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it can endure the kind of forces </v>

958
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:44.810
<v Speaker 1>that he's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>

959
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.420
<v Speaker 1>he's discovered stuff about what you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with a bicycle that I think you just.</v>

960
00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:50.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

961
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:51.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the era we grew up,</v>

962
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:53.810
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know that these things were </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible and you know,</v>

963
00:53:53.811 --> 00:53:55.890
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing emerged from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

964
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:57.263
<v Speaker 1>from observed trials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a very regimented kind of </v>

965
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:01.980
<v Speaker 1>competition for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for mountain bikers.</v>

966
00:54:01.981 --> 00:54:02.940
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

967
00:54:02.941 --> 00:54:03.774
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's discovered a landscape of </v>

968
00:54:04.771 --> 00:54:05.604
<v Speaker 1>possibilities on a bicycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unlike the lamps landscape of </v>

969
00:54:08.251 --> 00:54:11.210
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that lars anderson has </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered in a,</v>

970
00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:15.600
<v Speaker 1>in archery park who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is another place where,</v>

971
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up,</v>

972
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that all that was possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>

973
00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

974
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:22.253
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that olympic gymnastics was </v>

975
00:54:23.791 --> 00:54:24.630
<v Speaker 1>pretty interesting.</v>

976
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:25.853
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I look at olympic gymnastics and I </v>

977
00:54:27.361 --> 00:54:30.480
<v Speaker 1>think that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

978
00:54:30.481 --> 00:54:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's team.</v>

979
00:54:32.221 --> 00:54:33.054
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is it has one advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that everything is so </v>

980
00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:39.510
<v Speaker 1>standardized that you can compare to </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitors.</v>

981
00:54:39.511 --> 00:54:40.344
<v Speaker 1>If you want to award a medal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it maybe it has to look like olympic </v>

982
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:43.590
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

983
00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:44.923
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these guys who can look at an urban </v>

984
00:54:47.311 --> 00:54:48.144
<v Speaker 1>environment and figure out how they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make use of these objects and their </v>

985
00:54:52.591 --> 00:54:54.660
<v Speaker 1>relationship to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

986
00:54:54.661 --> 00:54:57.690
<v Speaker 1>are discovering something about what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human body is capable of.</v>

987
00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.760
<v Speaker 1>That isn't the obvioUs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

988
00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.320
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

989
00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.870
<v Speaker 1>if there isn't somebody to pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are innovators.</v>

990
00:55:03.871 --> 00:55:04.704
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if we know who the </v>
<v Speaker 1>initial innovators are with something </v>

991
00:55:07.351 --> 00:55:09.450
<v Speaker 1>like park who are probably somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

992
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.433
<v Speaker 1>Russians could be russian kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen those videos of them </v>

993
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.120
<v Speaker 1>hanging off of the side of buildings?</v>

994
00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I really think that they were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovators of this,</v>

995
00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:18.423
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the first stuff that we ever </v>

996
00:55:19.471 --> 00:55:21.720
<v Speaker 1>saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe french word,</v>

997
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:23.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's our core french?</v>

998
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

999
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>

1000
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>

1001
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:29.220
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1002
00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:30.030
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1003
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.260
<v Speaker 1>when you asked me to come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1004
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.273
<v Speaker 1>we decided we would talk a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what to do about planet earth </v>

1005
00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.870
<v Speaker 1>because I had mentioned the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on your show that,</v>

1006
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:38.170
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1007
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:39.870
<v Speaker 1>an employee from parker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1008
00:55:39.871 --> 00:55:40.704
<v Speaker 1>but my feeling is actually this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is about parker and my point is </v>

1009
00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.353
<v Speaker 1>where we are with civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're stuck and we are on a trajectory </v>

1010
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.713
<v Speaker 1>that you don't have to be deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable to recognize that it is </v>

1011
00:56:00.271 --> 00:56:05.271
<v Speaker 1>unstable on enough different fronts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't go on like this much longer.</v>

1012
00:56:05.281 --> 00:56:08.740
<v Speaker 1>We're playing with powerful enough tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were in tremendous danger.</v>

1013
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Something going wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the question is,</v>

1014
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:16.260
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to imagine how you use </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal tools,</v>

1015
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to win an election and get</v>

1016
00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 1>policy through congress that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change the world and suddenly make us,</v>

1017
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.900
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that happening.</v>

1018
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a park core kind of innovation,</v>

1019
00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:35.500
<v Speaker 1>something that is not obvious to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1020
00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.540
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The city was always there.</v>

1021
00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 1>People were not always doing park who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are with the objects in it,</v>

1022
00:56:40.691 --> 00:56:44.260
<v Speaker 1>but they could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so are we missing the obvious?</v>

1023
00:56:44.261 --> 00:56:45.094
<v Speaker 1>Is it in front of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're supposed to do to take a </v>

1024
00:56:46.871 --> 00:56:47.704
<v Speaker 1>civilization that's hurdling out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>control with too many people consuming </v>

1025
00:56:51.611 --> 00:56:53.050
<v Speaker 1>too fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1026
00:56:53.051 --> 00:56:58.051
<v Speaker 1>and using mechanisms that are dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a route to put us back on track</v>

1027
00:57:00.551 --> 00:57:01.384
<v Speaker 1>to something reasonable that looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these innovations that you don't </v>

1028
00:57:04.391 --> 00:57:07.330
<v Speaker 1>know it existed until somebody shows you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's there?</v>

1029
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:12.170
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think those things are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1030
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I assume there's more than one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1031
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:15.753
<v Speaker 1>There's more than one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the conversation doesn't </v>

1032
00:57:18.731 --> 00:57:23.731
<v Speaker 1>sound familiar and I don't think anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the answer to that question.</v>

1033
00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:27.173
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1034
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:31.930
<v Speaker 1>before I go deeply into this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably say something a little</v>

1035
00:57:31.931 --> 00:57:32.764
<v Speaker 1>bit self protective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is talking about the question of </v>

1036
00:57:37.151 --> 00:57:42.151
<v Speaker 1>what to do with planet earth can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be an idol of discussion,</v>

1037
00:57:42.641 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 1>in which case there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing to be navigated,</v>

1038
00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:46.923
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to do it seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a danger of triggering a kind </v>

1039
00:57:51.491 --> 00:57:52.860
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1040
00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.240
<v Speaker 1>reflective penalty that we all carry </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1041
00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.960
<v Speaker 1>So arrogance is something that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1042
00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.823
<v Speaker 1>people don't like to hear people being </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogant and so we all have like a </v>

1043
00:58:03.401 --> 00:58:05.200
<v Speaker 1>detector for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>

1044
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.820
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we listen.</v>

1045
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:07.773
<v Speaker 1>And when somebody strays into arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it goes off in order to have a </v>

1046
00:58:11.531 --> 00:58:14.470
<v Speaker 1>conversation about what to do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet earth.</v>

1047
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.333
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we're talking about very </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious stuff and for anybody to </v>

1048
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:19.924
<v Speaker 1>contemplate that they might know or </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be tuned into a conversation that </v>

1049
00:58:25.121 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 1>could find its way to some new answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are in danger of triggering that.</v>

1050
00:58:29.681 --> 00:58:30.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

1051
00:58:30.611 --> 00:58:33.430
<v Speaker 1>that's arrogant circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at some level,</v>

1052
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.350
<v Speaker 1>in order to have this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

1053
00:58:35.351 --> 00:58:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to turn off my own sensitivity to</v>

1054
00:58:39.821 --> 00:58:42.640
<v Speaker 1>hearing that little warning bell in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>own head.</v>

1055
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1056
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:49.900
<v Speaker 1>if the conversation is preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fine,</v>

1057
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:52.780
<v Speaker 1>that's something a reasonable person </v>
<v Speaker 1>could conclude about.</v>

1058
00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who was talking about changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the world functions.</v>

1059
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is preposterous and I leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>that possibility open.</v>

1060
00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:00.370
<v Speaker 1>And the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1061
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have kids,</v>

1062
00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I can do the math myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>on how much danger we're in.</v>

1063
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:07.623
<v Speaker 1>I may not know the full extent of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell that we're in enough </v>

1064
00:59:10.001 --> 00:59:10.834
<v Speaker 1>danger that we have to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter intuitive and different enough </v>

1065
00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:20.311
<v Speaker 1>that it stands a chance of changing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the place functions or my kids.</v>

1066
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 1>and your kids are in serious trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1067
00:59:23.331 --> 00:59:26.180
<v Speaker 1>that's why I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would go down this road,</v>

1068
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.273
<v Speaker 1>but I have to do it in that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>context where I'm not too worried about </v>

1069
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:34.460
<v Speaker 1>whether people hear this as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1070
00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.620
<v Speaker 1>me being full of myself or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1071
00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Does that makes sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would,</v>

1072
00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:41.770
<v Speaker 1>why would I get it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lack.</v>

1073
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Those self protective instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just spout off.</v>

1074
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:45.500
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

1075
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.240
<v Speaker 1>But go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1076
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 1>so there are a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I should say where,</v>

1077
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:52.334
<v Speaker 1>where does this all come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My initial foray into this style of </v>

1078
00:59:57.891 --> 01:00:02.330
<v Speaker 1>thinking actually starts with erIc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you had on your podcast.</v>

1079
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I saw a lot of feedback about him on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast was great.</v>

1080
01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>People were really jazzed about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

1081
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:12.260
<v Speaker 1>You have brilliant brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have all noticed that he is absolutely</v>

1082
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:17.390
<v Speaker 1>amazing and there's no place to hide </v>
<v Speaker 1>from him because he is so good across,</v>

1083
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:20.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all levels of analysis.</v>

1084
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>So he obviously even on your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was playing around in biology space.</v>

1085
01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Very adeptly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

1086
01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I can't go over into math space and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same favor for him.</v>

1087
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

1088
01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

1089
01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:33.943
<v Speaker 1>he's a very interesting thinker and </v>
<v Speaker 1>across many more levels than I think </v>

1090
01:00:38.631 --> 01:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>anybody else I've encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

1091
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some years ago,</v>

1092
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.264
<v Speaker 1>after the financial collapse of 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he decIded that there needed to be a </v>

1093
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:51.463
<v Speaker 1>proactive discussion about what had gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and economic space that had </v>

1094
01:00:57.291 --> 01:00:58.124
<v Speaker 1>allowed that catastrophe to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he and some collaborators put </v>

1095
01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>together a conference called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic manhattan project.</v>

1096
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:11.420
<v Speaker 1>It was at the perimeter institute in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Canada.</v>

1097
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:17.170
<v Speaker 1>And so I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I attended this conference and it was,</v>

1098
01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:18.643
<v Speaker 1>it was the first place I encountered an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentional conversation about changing </v>

1099
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:23.563
<v Speaker 1>a large enough piece of the puzzle to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually fix the way the world works to </v>

1100
01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:30.710
<v Speaker 1>prevent another financial collapse like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that happened in 2008.</v>

1101
01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:31.993
<v Speaker 1>And I also met people at that conference</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have continued on in these </v>

1102
01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1103
01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>I joined occupy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1104
01:01:41.451 --> 01:01:43.130
<v Speaker 1>not that there was anything really to </v>
<v Speaker 1>join,</v>

1105
01:01:43.131 --> 01:01:43.964
<v Speaker 1>but I participated in it in hopes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would turn into something capable of </v>

1106
01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:49.094
<v Speaker 1>changIng the way we functioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I ended up being very disappointed </v>

1107
01:01:52.131 --> 01:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>and frustrated by the quality of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation inside of,</v>

1108
01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.720
<v Speaker 1>of occupy wall street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

1109
01:01:58.721 --> 01:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it revealed some things to me.</v>

1110
01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>And then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

1111
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of people who gathered in a </v>

1112
01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>something that ultimately was called </v>
<v Speaker 1>game be end.</v>

1113
01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Game b is really where the thinking that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you about emerged most</v>

1114
01:02:17.661 --> 01:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Game be no longer exists,</v>

1115
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>but a group of us from across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political spectrum,</v>

1116
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>various different kinds of expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had tech people,</v>

1117
01:02:29.221 --> 01:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>we had professors from various different</v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplines.</v>

1118
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:32.813
<v Speaker 1>We had a buddhist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we really had a lot of different </v>

1119
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>people who were united basically by an </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that,</v>

1120
01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:40.403
<v Speaker 1>that they had each arrived at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory we were on was so dangerous </v>

1121
01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>that it required us to take action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we tried out various different ideas</v>

1122
01:02:48.901 --> 01:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>about what might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what might be sufficient to,</v>

1123
01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:54.363
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to avert the danger we were heading </v>

1124
01:02:56.401 --> 01:03:01.401
<v Speaker 1>towards and give humanity more time to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find a way to exist on the planet.</v>

1125
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:03.683
<v Speaker 1>So I should probably say something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what game b means and it carries a </v>

1126
01:03:08.141 --> 01:03:10.530
<v Speaker 1>relevance into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into what we might do in the present.</v>

1127
01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:12.083
<v Speaker 1>Game b was basically proceeded from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that what we live in is a game </v>

1128
01:03:17.911 --> 01:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>theoretic landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1129
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:20.963
<v Speaker 1>That the winners in this game theoretic </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape are individuals who have </v>

1130
01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:24.864
<v Speaker 1>figured out where there's a niche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them have figured out how to </v>

1131
01:03:28.561 --> 01:03:29.394
<v Speaker 1>engage in something called rent seeking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which rent seeking basically means </v>

1132
01:03:32.161 --> 01:03:37.161
<v Speaker 1>making money without producing some </v>
<v Speaker 1>without producing value.</v>

1133
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:38.363
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of stuff that goes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our economy that is not productive </v>

1134
01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:43.350
<v Speaker 1>and good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless generates fortunes.</v>

1135
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:46.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's rent seeking as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation or productivity.</v>

1136
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about like hedge fund </v>
<v Speaker 1>type stuff,</v>

1137
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:51.300
<v Speaker 1>moving money around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1138
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:52.134
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a little careful about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is quite possible for things </v>

1139
01:03:56.761 --> 01:03:57.594
<v Speaker 1>like hedge funds to actually correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>inefficiencies in the economy in a way </v>

1140
01:04:01.261 --> 01:04:02.094
<v Speaker 1>that is productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that that's the average </v>

1141
01:04:03.991 --> 01:04:05.010
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's two things.</v>

1142
01:04:05.011 --> 01:04:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Are you referring to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1143
01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1144
01:04:07.081 --> 01:04:08.040
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take the,</v>

1145
01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:10.620
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate example that will make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

1146
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:15.020
<v Speaker 1>A warlord is not responsible for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1147
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.253
<v Speaker 1>for building the road that they then </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand by the side of and extort money </v>

1148
01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:20.064
<v Speaker 1>from people who want to travel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cable company may produce some </v>

1149
01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:28.194
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They obviously have infrastructure that </v>

1150
01:04:29.791 --> 01:04:30.624
<v Speaker 1>allows you to get content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what fraction of what you're paying </v>

1151
01:04:33.451 --> 01:04:34.284
<v Speaker 1>for is actually about them delivering a </v>
<v Speaker 1>service at some price and making some </v>

1152
01:04:38.401 --> 01:04:39.090
<v Speaker 1>reasonable profit.</v>

1153
01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:39.923
<v Speaker 1>And what fraction of it is about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that they are an economic goliath </v>

1154
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:46.500
<v Speaker 1>and that you don't have enough choice to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to negotiate a decent price with</v>

1155
01:04:46.501 --> 01:04:48.990
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's some fraction of what they're</v>

1156
01:04:48.991 --> 01:04:49.824
<v Speaker 1>producing that is productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's a large amount of </v>

1157
01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>profit there that isn't about </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity or innovation.</v>

1158
01:04:55.441 --> 01:04:59.040
<v Speaker 1>It's about the fact that they own a </v>
<v Speaker 1>choke point and you can't get around it.</v>

1159
01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:00.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't know what fraction of the </v>

1160
01:05:03.991 --> 01:05:08.991
<v Speaker 1>economy is a rent seeking and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraction of it is productive.</v>

1161
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:10.583
<v Speaker 1>But there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if one is broadminded about </v>

1162
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:15.780
<v Speaker 1>thinking about all the ways that one can</v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in rent seeking.</v>

1163
01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.393
<v Speaker 1>One can actually be destructive of value</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you destroy future wellbeing for our </v>

1164
01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>descendants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may look productive in the present,</v>

1165
01:05:26.861 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually destructive.</v>

1166
01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>So that's a kind of rent seeking that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even typically model.</v>

1167
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

1168
01:05:36.941 --> 01:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>where are we headed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1169
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we live in a game theoretic landscape</v>

1170
01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.610
<v Speaker 1>that's both good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you point out,</v>

1171
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:46.444
<v Speaker 1>competition is a healthy thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition in markets produces a huge </v>

1172
01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>amount of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hear people,</v>

1173
01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.330
<v Speaker 1>deriding capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I always want to make the same point</v>

1174
01:05:58.331 --> 01:05:59.164
<v Speaker 1>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you've got two things glued </v>

1175
01:06:01.151 --> 01:06:06.151
<v Speaker 1>together and you are challenging them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a package,</v>

1176
01:06:06.431 --> 01:06:08.950
<v Speaker 1>but there's no reason they have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>packaged.</v>

1177
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:11.530
<v Speaker 1>So we would be foolish to give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>markets.</v>

1178
01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Markets are amazingly powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Engines of innovation.</v>

1179
01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:19.570
<v Speaker 1>they are capable of solving problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we cannot solve deliberately,</v>

1180
01:06:19.571 --> 01:06:22.450
<v Speaker 1>even if we want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we need markets,</v>

1181
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.823
<v Speaker 1>but we don't want markets ruling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet and deciding that anything that </v>

1182
01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:28.414
<v Speaker 1>spits out a profit is therefore good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we should be exposed to whatever </v>

1183
01:06:31.751 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>the market discovers can be a viable.</v>

1184
01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:39.190
<v Speaker 1>So what we want is ultimately to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide,</v>

1185
01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:43.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide incentive structures that caused</v>

1186
01:06:43.601 --> 01:06:46.210
<v Speaker 1>the market to produce things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for us,</v>

1187
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:48.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1188
01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:51.550
<v Speaker 1>have you tell the market that you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>the solution to some problem,</v>

1189
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.413
<v Speaker 1>the market can figure out how to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem and it will do it very </v>

1190
01:06:54.971 --> 01:06:55.804
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you allow the market to decide </v>

1191
01:06:58.241 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 1>what problems to solve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may end up,</v>

1192
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:03.400
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicting you to your phone,</v>

1193
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:04.623
<v Speaker 1>right addicting to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your phone in a way that harms your </v>

1194
01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:07.770
<v Speaker 1>social relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harms your,</v>

1195
01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:08.653
<v Speaker 1>your parenting of your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harms all kinds of things that are </v>

1196
01:07:11.081 --> 01:07:11.914
<v Speaker 1>really important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks the ability of your children to </v>

1197
01:07:14.081 --> 01:07:18.160
<v Speaker 1>have a educational experience in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want the market discovering how</v>

1198
01:07:18.161 --> 01:07:18.994
<v Speaker 1>to disrupt useful functioning of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want the market to stay out of that </v>

1199
01:07:22.991 --> 01:07:26.440
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to provide us benefits that,</v>

1200
01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only,</v>

1201
01:07:27.401 --> 01:07:28.234
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can provide like all of the mechanisms </v>

1202
01:07:31.541 --> 01:07:36.541
<v Speaker 1>that now allow us to navigate seamlessly</v>
<v Speaker 1>in places that we've never been avoiding</v>

1203
01:07:36.731 --> 01:07:39.040
<v Speaker 1>traffic that we wouldn't know to worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1204
01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:39.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1205
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.353
<v Speaker 1>Those are huge benefits and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of taking a city that is to </v>

1206
01:07:44.591 --> 01:07:45.424
<v Speaker 1>snarled with traffic and reducing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to which it is snarled with </v>

1207
01:07:47.861 --> 01:07:49.210
<v Speaker 1>traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're very powerful,</v>

1208
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.630
<v Speaker 1>but we shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't throw the baby out with the</v>

1209
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.490
<v Speaker 1>bathwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>markets are good.</v>

1210
01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.593
<v Speaker 1>Allowing markets to discover any and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every mechanism for exploiting you is </v>

1211
01:08:00.731 --> 01:08:02.680
<v Speaker 1>not good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

1212
01:08:02.681 --> 01:08:06.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a large part of why we're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicament that we're in,</v>

1213
01:08:06.071 --> 01:08:06.904
<v Speaker 1>is that we let the market decide what </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems to solve and then if it solves </v>

1214
01:08:11.111 --> 01:08:13.810
<v Speaker 1>them and they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lucrative,</v>

1215
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>there's no way to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I say attractive to people.</v>

1216
01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons why a phone,</v>

1217
01:08:20.021 --> 01:08:20.854
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so addictive is because it's attractive </v>

1218
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>because you can get access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>information at the drop of a hat.</v>

1219
01:08:25.221 --> 01:08:29.780
<v Speaker 1>So you just constantly one of feed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine it constantly to like,</v>

1220
01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:30.614
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1221
01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>what can I do?</v>

1222
01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Can I play a game on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1223
01:08:32.661 --> 01:08:34.100
<v Speaker 1>can I take a picture of myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1224
01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:36.090
<v Speaker 1>can I give myself a dog knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1225
01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But imagine.</v>

1226
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1227
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing to me that it's even hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do this thought experiment,</v>

1228
01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:43.890
<v Speaker 1>but put yourself in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1229
01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:49.420
<v Speaker 1>in your own mind 15 years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>present yourself the deal that the phone</v>

1230
01:08:52.281 --> 01:08:53.960
<v Speaker 1>represents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1231
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:55.490
<v Speaker 1>hey joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

1232
01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:57.440
<v Speaker 1>check this phone out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1233
01:08:57.441 --> 01:09:00.950
<v Speaker 1>This phone is going to allow you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>navigate in a place you've never been.</v>

1234
01:09:00.951 --> 01:09:05.390
<v Speaker 1>It's going to connect you with all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people who share your interest.</v>

1235
01:09:05.391 --> 01:09:06.224
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be able to say a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence that you think is clever and </v>

1236
01:09:09.201 --> 01:09:12.690
<v Speaker 1>suddenly hundreds or thousands of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be able to react to it.</v>

1237
01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean all sorts of marvelous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

1238
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:16.790
<v Speaker 1>And then the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1239
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.710
<v Speaker 1>here's the downside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1240
01:09:18.711 --> 01:09:19.544
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be hooked into mega </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations that are going to study </v>

1241
01:09:23.421 --> 01:09:24.254
<v Speaker 1>your psychology and they are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete in order to keep you paying </v>

1242
01:09:28.011 --> 01:09:28.844
<v Speaker 1>attention to their site and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to become so sophisticated that </v>

1243
01:09:32.181 --> 01:09:35.840
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lose control over your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own mind.</v>

1244
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:36.733
<v Speaker 1>You are going to become addicted to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way that you might become </v>

1245
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:40.910
<v Speaker 1>addicted to nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1246
01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:43.850
<v Speaker 1>so that that's a pretty high cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's more,</v>

1247
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:44.893
<v Speaker 1>you are going to surveil yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to surveil yourself and </v>

1248
01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.043
<v Speaker 1>your only protection from surveilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself are going to be end user </v>

1249
01:09:54.201 --> 01:09:55.034
<v Speaker 1>license agreements that you're not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be legally sophisticated enough to </v>

1250
01:09:57.051 --> 01:09:57.884
<v Speaker 1>understand and so you're going to be at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mercy of whoever has access to your </v>

1251
01:10:02.061 --> 01:10:03.650
<v Speaker 1>phone camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your metadata,</v>

1252
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:04.611
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1253
01:10:04.611 --> 01:10:06.470
<v Speaker 1>all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is,</v>

1254
01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.460
<v Speaker 1>if you sAid this to you 15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd know to be afraid of it,</v>

1255
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably wouldn't be like,</v>

1256
01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:16.220
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it down if I don't like it.</v>

1257
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.473
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1258
01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:18.733
<v Speaker 1>I must tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you told me that I was going to be </v>

1259
01:10:20.541 --> 01:10:24.470
<v Speaker 1>bugging myself with a sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>device like that,</v>

1260
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.510
<v Speaker 1>that I know I can't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even turn it upside down because</v>

1261
01:10:28.511 --> 01:10:33.511
<v Speaker 1>of the camera on both sides of the dams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the cost is really high,</v>

1262
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:38.060
<v Speaker 1>but we signed up for it incrementally in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way that never left the ability to say</v>

1263
01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:42.740
<v Speaker 1>no and what's worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not inconceivable.</v>

1264
01:10:42.741 --> 01:10:43.574
<v Speaker 1>If we discovered that the net cost of </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a device exceeded the value of it </v>

1265
01:10:47.961 --> 01:10:50.600
<v Speaker 1>by 10 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still couldn't get rid of them.</v>

1266
01:10:50.601 --> 01:10:52.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't pull them back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't unmake them.</v>

1267
01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:54.470
<v Speaker 2>There's too much benefit to them though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1268
01:10:54.471 --> 01:10:55.304
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making it seem as if it's only a </v>

1269
01:10:56.551 --> 01:10:58.710
<v Speaker 2>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not only a negative,</v>

1270
01:10:58.711 --> 01:10:59.544
<v Speaker 2>it's also answering every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>question you could ever have about </v>

1271
01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.950
<v Speaker 2>anything technical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything involving history,</v>

1272
01:11:04.951 --> 01:11:09.951
<v Speaker 2>anything involving facts and obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>in today's day and age with hashtag fake</v>

1273
01:11:10.741 --> 01:11:11.574
<v Speaker 2>news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a lot of bullshit </v>

1274
01:11:12.331 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 2>facts in there as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just</v>

1275
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:14.873
<v Speaker 1>the sheer access to information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be able to ability to contact </v>

1276
01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:19.830
<v Speaker 1>each other instantaneously as a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pros to it.</v>

1277
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Huge number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm believe me,</v>

1278
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:24.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not underwriting the value of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just,</v>

1279
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pointed to it yourself.</v>

1280
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Having even just wikipedia in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket is like,</v>

1281
01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.253
<v Speaker 1>that's such a fantastic gift to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that access to information not only on </v>

1282
01:11:35.371 --> 01:11:37.500
<v Speaker 1>your home computer but right there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your pocket.</v>

1283
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:38.334
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying the benefit isn't </v>

1284
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:40.914
<v Speaker 1>spectacular and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've signed up for it like everybody </v>

1285
01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:46.830
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cost is very high end.</v>

1286
01:11:46.831 --> 01:11:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Didn't have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1287
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:49.733
<v Speaker 1>if you had set the bounds in which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>market was going to solve this problem </v>

1288
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.620
<v Speaker 1>so that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1289
01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:00.540
<v Speaker 1>prevented it from breaching our ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect our own privacy.</v>

1290
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:01.523
<v Speaker 1>You could have had the benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia and instant communication and </v>

1291
01:12:04.801 --> 01:12:07.320
<v Speaker 1>all of these things without the huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>downside.</v>

1292
01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:11.580
<v Speaker 1>So the privacy issue being cookies or </v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras like which.</v>

1293
01:12:11.581 --> 01:12:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Which one are you referring to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1294
01:12:13.441 --> 01:12:14.274
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the cameras are a bit of a red </v>

1295
01:12:15.091 --> 01:12:16.420
<v Speaker 1>herring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody at.</v>

1296
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:17.263
<v Speaker 1>First of all there's a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>data involved in video to the extent </v>

1297
01:12:20.731 --> 01:12:21.564
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be more about the microphone </v>

1298
01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:24.983
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that it can listen in to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations and basically track who's </v>

1299
01:12:27.991 --> 01:12:28.824
<v Speaker 1>thinking what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's so much power in that </v>

1300
01:12:30.211 --> 01:12:31.320
<v Speaker 1>potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that even,</v>

1301
01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:32.543
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not being used presently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only a matter of time before </v>

1302
01:12:35.491 --> 01:12:36.324
<v Speaker 1>somebody taps into that data and starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>using it to shape things they are not </v>

1303
01:12:40.591 --> 01:12:42.920
<v Speaker 1>entitled to shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1304
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.490
<v Speaker 1>so how do we fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1305
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.800
<v Speaker 1>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten a little off track here.</v>

1306
01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Game a is what we live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1307
01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:52.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a market in which we decide how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>

1308
01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:55.800
<v Speaker 1>And if we have insight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we come out ahead.</v>

1309
01:12:56.010 --> 01:13:00.720
<v Speaker 1>If we don't have correct insight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we lose.</v>

1310
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.890
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1311
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:02.780
<v Speaker 1>that's gay may.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1312
01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:04.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the market as we find it.</v>

1313
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Game b was the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1314
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.433
<v Speaker 1>that there are ways that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>restructure the deal we have with each </v>

1315
01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:19.041
<v Speaker 1>other so that you could compete in game </v>
<v Speaker 1>a's terms without losing to game.</v>

1316
01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.020
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conclusion.</v>

1317
01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:25.883
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>game b is not a live organization </v>

1318
01:13:27.901 --> 01:13:28.734
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a place in which a lot of </v>

1319
01:13:29.641 --> 01:13:30.474
<v Speaker 1>work was done that I think feeds into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation about what we do very </v>

1320
01:13:33.181 --> 01:13:37.470
<v Speaker 1>clearly in order to change the way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world functions.</v>

1321
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:38.753
<v Speaker 1>Most of the mechanisms that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fUnctioned in the past are no longer </v>

1322
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:43.703
<v Speaker 1>viable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is almost inconceivable to imagine that </v>

1323
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.353
<v Speaker 1>you could have a revolution in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard sense that would successfully </v>

1324
01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.960
<v Speaker 1>capture power and then wielded wisely.</v>

1325
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:56.333
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine it happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So game b is the idea that one needs to </v>

1326
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.590
<v Speaker 1>create an entity that is capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing in the market.</v>

1327
01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:12.630
<v Speaker 1>It is capable of competing in game a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his terms and winning against game a,</v>

1328
01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:14.553
<v Speaker 1>so game a is the way things run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Game b is an alternative that can </v>

1329
01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:23.530
<v Speaker 1>compete in today's terms and when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that sounds first time you hear it,</v>

1330
01:14:23.531 --> 01:14:24.364
<v Speaker 1>it sounds preposterous because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system has so much inertia in it that </v>

1331
01:14:27.911 --> 01:14:31.360
<v Speaker 1>you would think it is completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>impervious to any challenge,</v>

1332
01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:32.733
<v Speaker 1>but there's a hidden factor which I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is evident in those various </v>

1333
01:14:37.571 --> 01:14:38.404
<v Speaker 1>examples we were looking at in parker </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lars anderson and his archery </v>

1334
01:14:42.221 --> 01:14:43.054
<v Speaker 1>innovations and danny macaskill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also say jane goodall and her </v>

1335
01:14:48.971 --> 01:14:51.640
<v Speaker 1>success at sorting out what was going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>with chimps.</v>

1336
01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:58.320
<v Speaker 1>The point is systems that become very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to dislodge,</v>

1337
01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:04.870
<v Speaker 1>that have great inertia are almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably feeble.</v>

1338
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:09.960
<v Speaker 1>In a particular fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is true of academic disciplines,</v>

1339
01:15:10.181 --> 01:15:11.014
<v Speaker 1>to if a discipline becomes stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very hard to get a hearing within </v>

1340
01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:18.514
<v Speaker 1>the discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the discipline loses track of where </v>

1341
01:15:23.891 --> 01:15:24.724
<v Speaker 1>it has made assumptions that aren't true</v>
<v Speaker 1>or aren't certain and so it becomes </v>

1342
01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:31.100
<v Speaker 1>relatively easy to compete against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1343
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.770
<v Speaker 1>if you're not requiring it to validate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your perspective.</v>

1344
01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:40.330
<v Speaker 1>So that feebleness is a feature of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1345
01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Our system is delivering the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goods to people at a low rate.</v>

1346
01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Most people are dissatisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're unhealthy,</v>

1347
01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:53.800
<v Speaker 1>they are not well protected from things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like bad luck.</v>

1348
01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:58.570
<v Speaker 1>ANd those are all problems that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>solved by a,</v>

1349
01:15:58.571 --> 01:16:02.980
<v Speaker 1>an entity that is capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>restructuring the deals between peOple.</v>

1350
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:06.280
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take an obvious one.</v>

1351
01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Like insurance insurance is not well </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered by a market and there's a very</v>

1352
01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.234
<v Speaker 1>good reason it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that the strategy for winning </v>

1353
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:20.620
<v Speaker 1>in the delivery of insurance is </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly obvious.</v>

1354
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:21.783
<v Speaker 1>You want to insure people who need it </v>
<v Speaker 1>very little and you want to uninsured </v>

1355
01:16:24.821 --> 01:16:27.610
<v Speaker 1>people who needed a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you win the insurance game.</v>

1356
01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:32.610
<v Speaker 1>So the insurance industry is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to make that deal with the world</v>

1357
01:16:32.611 --> 01:16:34.070
<v Speaker 1>and that's always looking to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>

1358
01:16:34.230 --> 01:16:35.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1359
01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.620
<v Speaker 1>to disengage or those who are most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to need it.</v>

1360
01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:42.220
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide a risk pool.</v>

1361
01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:45.820
<v Speaker 1>The risk pool just means you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to get a brain tumor.</v>

1362
01:16:45.821 --> 01:16:46.654
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get a brain tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how about we both agree to pay for </v>

1363
01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:49.653
<v Speaker 1>whoever's treatment needs it and whoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the bad luck wins in that deal and </v>

1364
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:53.524
<v Speaker 1>whoever has the good luck loses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because we don't know who it is </v>

1365
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.370
<v Speaker 1>ahead of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a win for both of us,</v>

1366
01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.233
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that structure is one that you can </v>

1367
01:17:00.641 --> 01:17:04.810
<v Speaker 1>build inside of this competitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>architecture.</v>

1368
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:07.600
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm,</v>

1369
01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:08.493
<v Speaker 1>what I'm getting at is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation of people that has </v>

1370
01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:14.144
<v Speaker 1>coalesced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are discussing the question </v>

1371
01:17:16.701 --> 01:17:17.534
<v Speaker 1>of how to make things function in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that solves the problems that we all </v>

1372
01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:23.640
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1373
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:24.853
<v Speaker 1>without having to win some unimaginable </v>
<v Speaker 1>electoral victory or to challenge these </v>

1374
01:17:31.431 --> 01:17:32.264
<v Speaker 1>governments outright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That conversation centers around a game </v>

1375
01:17:36.831 --> 01:17:38.810
<v Speaker 1>theoretic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1376
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:44.050
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something I mentioned before</v>

1377
01:17:44.151 --> 01:17:44.984
<v Speaker 1>that I had participated in occupy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been quite disappointed and really </v>

1378
01:17:49.161 --> 01:17:54.161
<v Speaker 1>where I was before I ran into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation was I was,</v>

1379
01:17:55.190 --> 01:17:56.023
<v Speaker 1>if I'm honest with myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was becoming a little desperate </v>

1380
01:17:57.501 --> 01:17:59.690
<v Speaker 1>because I could see how much trouble we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in,</v>

1381
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.823
<v Speaker 1>but every mechanism that you might use </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fix it seemed very unlikely to </v>

1382
01:18:04.401 --> 01:18:07.460
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I heard a presentation that said,</v>

1383
01:18:07.461 --> 01:18:08.294
<v Speaker 1>actually there's a mechanism that does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not go through any of the familiar </v>

1384
01:18:10.881 --> 01:18:15.881
<v Speaker 1>historical means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uses tools that we all see deployed,</v>

1385
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:22.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same tools that caused a facebook to</v>

1386
01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:26.510
<v Speaker 1>be successful can be used to repair the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1387
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:31.730
<v Speaker 1>That begins to sound plausible to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make any sense</v>

1388
01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:34.240
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is,</v>

1389
01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:36.310
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're on a long road.</v>

1390
01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way to boil this down?</v>

1391
01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try an example.</v>

1392
01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:42.970
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about bitcoin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A?</v>

1393
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fascinating.</v>

1394
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:46.810
<v Speaker 2>You wish you had more of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1395
01:18:46.811 --> 01:18:48.190
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some of it,</v>

1396
01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:51.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's not mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all donated towards a fight for the</v>

1397
01:18:51.701 --> 01:18:53.890
<v Speaker 2>forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're building wells in the Congo.</v>

1398
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:55.123
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had andreas antonopoulos on and he </v>

1399
01:18:57.281 --> 01:19:00.580
<v Speaker 2>introduced me to bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he set up a bitcoin wallet for me.</v>

1400
01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I took donations from people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't think it was right.</v>

1401
01:19:03.341 --> 01:19:05.470
<v Speaker 2>They just gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very little at the time,</v>

1402
01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:06.753
<v Speaker 2>but I said I'll just give this to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend justin who builds wells in the </v>

1403
01:19:10.031 --> 01:19:10.864
<v Speaker 2>Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now it's worth with it with like 70 </v>

1404
01:19:12.551 --> 01:19:16.720
<v Speaker 2>grand or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1405
01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.450
<v Speaker 2>But he's got to figure out when he wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cash out.</v>

1406
01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.300
<v Speaker 2>It's up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1407
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:22.893
<v Speaker 2>so far they've gotten at least 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of it and we've built a bunch of </v>

1408
01:19:28.301 --> 01:19:30.940
<v Speaker 2>wells with that money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's great in that regard.</v>

1409
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:34.960
<v Speaker 2>It's served an amazing purpose for those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the Congo.</v>

1410
01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:35.953
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people were actually mad at me that </v>

1411
01:19:37.091 --> 01:19:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I didn't buy those things with bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 2>that instead used the,</v>

1412
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:43.020
<v Speaker 2>the acap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bitcoin,</v>

1413
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:45.370
<v Speaker 2>but gave him the money value of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>

1414
01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.630
<v Speaker 2>They were upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1415
01:19:46.631 --> 01:19:48.070
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you just pay for it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin?</v>

1416
01:19:48.071 --> 01:19:48.904
<v Speaker 2>But about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see as an experiment where </v>

1417
01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:51.244
<v Speaker 2>the bitcoin goes and turns out it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lucky guess on my part and now it's </v>

1418
01:19:55.181 --> 01:19:58.780
<v Speaker 2>worth far more because what was worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>

1419
01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:00.370
<v Speaker 2>at the time is now</v>

1420
01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.760
<v Speaker 1>a hundred grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1421
01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.950
<v Speaker 1>So we don't all like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1422
01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whether it's bitcoin or not,</v>

1423
01:20:07.681 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 1>there's something clearly happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1424
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:13.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the blockchain cryptocurrency.</v>

1425
01:20:13.801 --> 01:20:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>

1426
01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:15.733
<v Speaker 1>the world is trying to figure out which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of these currencies is going to </v>

1427
01:20:17.821 --> 01:20:18.654
<v Speaker 1>function at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's blockchain is looking the most </v>

1428
01:20:20.491 --> 01:20:23.880
<v Speaker 1>promising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are obstacles to add functioning.</v>

1429
01:20:23.881 --> 01:20:28.100
<v Speaker 1>There are ways in which those obstacles </v>
<v Speaker 1>are being addressed and you know,</v>

1430
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It'd be pointless to get into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>details of it community.</v>

1431
01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the idea behind it.</v>

1432
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:34.343
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like things that don't have a whole </v>

1433
01:20:37.891 --> 01:20:40.620
<v Speaker 1>lot of rules where people sort of figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what's right.</v>

1434
01:20:41.010 --> 01:20:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1435
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000
<v Speaker 1>So if we take 'em bitcoin as an example </v>
<v Speaker 1>of something that addresses the problems</v>

1436
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:52.740
<v Speaker 1>of fiat currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lIke the dollar,</v>

1437
01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.890
<v Speaker 1>nobody asked permission to build it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1438
01:20:55.891 --> 01:20:57.080
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know who innovated it.</v>

1439
01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:01.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a pseudonym that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know whose identity it is.</v>

1440
01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.690
<v Speaker 1>recently someone thought it was elon </v>
<v Speaker 1>musk,</v>

1441
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:06.360
<v Speaker 1>which I would not be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that crazy guy,</v>

1442
01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:07.801
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1443
01:21:07.801 --> 01:21:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it,</v>

1444
01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:14.180
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't much matter what we know is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that somebody without asking permission,</v>

1445
01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:15.503
<v Speaker 1>found a better model for a currency that</v>
<v Speaker 1>addressed issues that we all face and </v>

1446
01:21:22.441 --> 01:21:25.260
<v Speaker 1>we're not individually capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing ourselves.</v>

1447
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:26.423
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty clear that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something in this realm is going to win </v>

1448
01:21:29.281 --> 01:21:31.410
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to become an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>

1449
01:21:31.411 --> 01:21:34.500
<v Speaker 1>if not the important player on the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage currency wise.</v>

1450
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:39.830
<v Speaker 1>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an entity which exists in game a space,</v>

1451
01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can convert bitcoin to dollars.</v>

1452
01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:48.240
<v Speaker 1>That's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin functions inside of this realm.</v>

1453
01:21:48.241 --> 01:21:50.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

1454
01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:51.293
<v Speaker 1>It's reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problems had been solved by people </v>

1455
01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:53.874
<v Speaker 1>because solving those problems made </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that it enriched them for doing </v>

1456
01:21:57.721 --> 01:21:57.930
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1457
01:21:57.930 --> 01:22:00.090
<v Speaker 1>They made their currency more </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional.</v>

1458
01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:05.210
<v Speaker 1>So that entity is a solution that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior to game a,</v>

1459
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.800
<v Speaker 1>but it functions in gamer terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's winning in gay terms at the moment.</v>

1460
01:22:13.141 --> 01:22:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying it isn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crash.</v>

1461
01:22:14.941 --> 01:22:15.774
<v Speaker 1>It probably is going to crash because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably overinflated at the </v>

1462
01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:19.680
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much will the crash?</v>

1463
01:22:19.681 --> 01:22:20.514
<v Speaker 1>Will it come back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to go through repeated </v>

1464
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:27.240
<v Speaker 1>bubbles and bitcoin will still went out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't nobody clearly nobody knows,</v>

1465
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:28.583
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that it is a superior </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution invented inside this other </v>

1466
01:22:33.271 --> 01:22:38.100
<v Speaker 1>system that is winning against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar at the moment.</v>

1467
01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:42.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a fine example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>

1468
01:22:42.001 --> 01:22:45.480
<v Speaker 1>you could use wikipedia as a fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

1469
01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:49.110
<v Speaker 1>This is an entity that is functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

1470
01:22:49.111 --> 01:22:52.800
<v Speaker 1>It is competing with the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>encyclopedias that is competing with for</v>

1471
01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:56.280
<v Speaker 1>profit services that would deliver </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and uh,</v>

1472
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:58.920
<v Speaker 1>frankly it's winning because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior.</v>

1473
01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:00.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a perfect no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1474
01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:01.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

1475
01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:02.543
<v Speaker 1>it's a demonstration that you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>things inside this space that in fact </v>

1476
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>have reorganized our relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1477
01:23:10.961 --> 01:23:12.370
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1478
01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:17.050
<v Speaker 1>in a way that we don't typically </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge is challenging the,</v>

1479
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.240
<v Speaker 1>the academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1480
01:23:19.241 --> 01:23:20.074
<v Speaker 1>maybe part of why the academy was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeble at the point that this social </v>

1481
01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:27.160
<v Speaker 1>justice madness started to challenge it </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to do with the fact that without the</v>

1482
01:23:27.161 --> 01:23:30.910
<v Speaker 1>academy's permission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>information became free.</v>

1483
01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:32.613
<v Speaker 1>The fact that everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a level playing field for </v>

1484
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:34.963
<v Speaker 1>information meant that the academy </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to figure out what it was going </v>

1485
01:23:38.871 --> 01:23:39.704
<v Speaker 1>to deliver on top of that information </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't figure it out and I would </v>

1486
01:23:42.221 --> 01:23:44.260
<v Speaker 1>say there was an obvious answer which it</v>
<v Speaker 1>missed.</v>

1487
01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.990
<v Speaker 1>It needed to deliver stuff that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>

1488
01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.030
<v Speaker 1>It needed to teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1489
01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.273
<v Speaker 1>insight and critical thinking and how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wield that information properly rather </v>

1490
01:23:53.231 --> 01:23:54.064
<v Speaker 1>than continuing to deliver textbook </v>
<v Speaker 1>level information when effectively </v>

1491
01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:58.120
<v Speaker 1>textbooks are obsolete.</v>

1492
01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are,</v>

1493
01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:04.900
<v Speaker 1>these are examples of successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitivelY successful,</v>

1494
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.730
<v Speaker 1>innovative challenges to the model that </v>
<v Speaker 1>preexisted them.</v>

1495
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:11.303
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can that set of models be systematized </v>

1496
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:18.130
<v Speaker 1>so that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1497
01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:19.083
<v Speaker 1>without having to do the impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply replaces the system as it stands </v>

1498
01:24:24.911 --> 01:24:25.744
<v Speaker 1>because it delivers the things to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system claims to deliver more </v>

1499
01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:30.170
<v Speaker 1>successfully than the system delivers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1500
01:24:30.171 --> 01:24:31.004
<v Speaker 1>Like what things are we talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about insulation from bad </v>

1501
01:24:37.901 --> 01:24:38.734
<v Speaker 1>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luck is a tremendously negative </v>

1502
01:24:41.171 --> 01:24:43.090
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like insurance,</v>

1503
01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:43.983
<v Speaker 1>but ensuring that we collectively </v>
<v Speaker 1>utilize correct something that we </v>

1504
01:24:47.381 --> 01:24:51.550
<v Speaker 1>collectively utilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you could have wonderful</v>

1505
01:24:51.551 --> 01:24:52.384
<v Speaker 1>insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that in signing up for that </v>

1506
01:24:54.731 --> 01:24:55.564
<v Speaker 1>insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were agreeing to some sort of a </v>

1507
01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:58.833
<v Speaker 1>larger social entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like your taxes would go towards a </v>

1508
01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.160
<v Speaker 1>life insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but meaning like things that go wrong in</v>

1509
01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:06.994
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some part of what you would spend </v>

1510
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:13.300
<v Speaker 1>on things would be attributed to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fund.</v>

1511
01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1512
01:25:14.531 --> 01:25:15.364
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1513
01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.233
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we unfortunately default to </v>

1514
01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:20.440
<v Speaker 1>thinking of everything in monetary </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

1515
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:24.690
<v Speaker 1>You could also invest in such an entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let you know.</v>

1516
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the question of </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers that you were pointing out.</v>

1517
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Why are good teachers so few and far </v>
<v Speaker 1>between?</v>

1518
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:31.833
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we pay at a level that we get </v>

1519
01:25:33.821 --> 01:25:34.654
<v Speaker 1>exactly what we ordered and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the few good teachers that we run into </v>

1520
01:25:37.541 --> 01:25:38.374
<v Speaker 1>are by and large people who are doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in spite of the fact that they're being </v>

1521
01:25:40.901 --> 01:25:45.220
<v Speaker 1>economically penalized for doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if your,</v>

1522
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:47.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your insurance,</v>

1523
01:25:47.681 --> 01:25:48.514
<v Speaker 1>your access to excellent insurance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly hedged out the danger of bad </v>

1524
01:25:52.451 --> 01:25:53.284
<v Speaker 1>medical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad luck came with some sort of social </v>

1525
01:25:56.561 --> 01:25:59.080
<v Speaker 1>obligation in which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1526
01:25:59.890 --> 01:26:00.723
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three years after you had gone to </v>

1527
01:26:03.051 --> 01:26:03.884
<v Speaker 1>graduate school and gotten your advanced</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree in something you spent teaching </v>

1528
01:26:06.711 --> 01:26:07.544
<v Speaker 1>in some school that needed that so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't sideline yourself from the </v>

1529
01:26:10.821 --> 01:26:11.654
<v Speaker 1>economy for the rest of your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching in some school where you were </v>

1530
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 1>forever going to be hobbled by bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrators,</v>

1531
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:20.870
<v Speaker 1>but you decided to take some period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and invested in,</v>

1532
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.793
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your community or somebody else's </v>

1533
01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:25.200
<v Speaker 1>community using expertise that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1534
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:28.160
<v Speaker 1>that you got that you'll be highly paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>for later.</v>

1535
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:33.080
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like you have mandatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>military service manager.</v>

1536
01:26:33.150 --> 01:26:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It mandatory military service is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1537
01:26:36.021 --> 01:26:36.854
<v Speaker 1>it is one version of a much larger space</v>
<v Speaker 1>of potential agreements that you could </v>

1538
01:26:41.451 --> 01:26:45.140
<v Speaker 1>sign up for an exchange for benefits </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't.</v>

1539
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Most of us cannot negotiate on the open </v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

1540
01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:50.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1541
01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.193
<v Speaker 1>to get your education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would agree to use that education </v>

1542
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:57.710
<v Speaker 1>for the good of the community for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of time.</v>

1543
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1544
01:26:59.361 --> 01:27:00.194
<v Speaker 1>So instead of walking away with massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>debt that is going to hobble you in </v>

1545
01:27:06.201 --> 01:27:07.034
<v Speaker 1>economic terms as you're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find your niche that you would sign </v>

1546
01:27:10.821 --> 01:27:12.980
<v Speaker 1>up for some agreement that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1547
01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.340
<v Speaker 1>but wouldn't that still benefit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite?</v>

1548
01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Because what of scrooge mcduck has a kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>and scrooge mcduck kid,</v>

1549
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:22.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pays for his kids education.</v>

1550
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:23.623
<v Speaker 1>I listened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>

1551
01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.150
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do any service which</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to do is use those three years</v>

1552
01:27:26.151 --> 01:27:26.960
<v Speaker 1>to get ahead.</v>

1553
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.090
<v Speaker 1>And those little fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get out of that service,</v>

1554
01:27:29.091 --> 01:27:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I've got to be working for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>

1555
01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:33.710
<v Speaker 1>They throw the gold coins up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1556
01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.040
<v Speaker 1>So this is another place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nice look.</v>

1557
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:45.040
<v Speaker 1>This is another place where two things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fused together that we need to tease</v>

1558
01:27:45.081 --> 01:27:45.914
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1559
01:27:46.730 --> 01:27:49.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Eric May have actually said this</v>

1560
01:27:49.101 --> 01:27:50.570
<v Speaker 1>on your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1561
01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.430
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said it elsewhere,</v>

1562
01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:56.930
<v Speaker 1>but elites is not a good category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1563
01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Elites takes two things that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>belong together and it decides that they</v>

1564
01:28:00.951 --> 01:28:01.784
<v Speaker 1>are one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the scrooge mcduck thing becomes </v>

1565
01:28:06.190 --> 01:28:10.580
<v Speaker 1>it blocks the other thing we want people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to innovate.</v>

1566
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:16.120
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons that equality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome is absolutely not desirable,</v>

1567
01:28:16.761 --> 01:28:21.320
<v Speaker 1>even if you could arrange it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the inequality of outcome is the</v>

1568
01:28:21.321 --> 01:28:22.154
<v Speaker 1>incentive that drives people to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing stuff that we want them to </v>

1569
01:28:25.161 --> 01:28:25.710
<v Speaker 1>achieve.</v>

1570
01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:26.543
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1571
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:31.070
<v Speaker 1>So how far ahead of everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 1>should you end up?</v>

1572
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:32.143
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a difficult problem because you </v>

1573
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:38.540
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that somebody earns a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortune because they've,</v>

1574
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have innovated in a,</v>

1575
01:28:41.781 --> 01:28:42.614
<v Speaker 1>in an important way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they have gone on to be a rent </v>

1576
01:28:45.201 --> 01:28:47.960
<v Speaker 1>seeker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want them re rewarded for their</v>

1577
01:28:47.961 --> 01:28:48.794
<v Speaker 1>rent seeking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do want them rewarded for their </v>

1578
01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:51.070
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1579
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:52.363
<v Speaker 1>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is the elite is two </v>

1580
01:28:56.871 --> 01:29:01.871
<v Speaker 1>different things and even worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals are members of the elite are</v>

1581
01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:04.013
<v Speaker 1>composites of both things where you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the elite because you innovated </v>

1582
01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:09.384
<v Speaker 1>something amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the degree to which you had been </v>

1583
01:29:11.581 --> 01:29:13.650
<v Speaker 1>rewarded is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1584
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 percent,</v>

1585
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.260
<v Speaker 1>the result of rent seeking rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you innovate.</v>

1586
01:29:18.261 --> 01:29:19.080
<v Speaker 1>It meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1587
01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.930
<v Speaker 1>for people who are just tuning into us </v>
<v Speaker 1>now rent seeking meaning,</v>

1588
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:26.520
<v Speaker 1>doing things to which you extract money </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the system without any real benefit</v>

1589
01:29:26.521 --> 01:29:27.690
<v Speaker 1>to the people that are around you.</v>

1590
01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's anytime that you get paid without </v>

1591
01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:35.340
<v Speaker 1>producing something of value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either innovation or productivity itself</v>

1592
01:29:35.341 --> 01:29:37.800
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how would you regulate that?</v>

1593
01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:38.634
<v Speaker 1>How would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you figure out a way to </v>

1594
01:29:39.901 --> 01:29:43.980
<v Speaker 1>regulate the amount of profit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone could like if you have a system,</v>

1595
01:29:44.010 --> 01:29:44.843
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you build something and then you </v>

1596
01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:46.950
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1597
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:47.783
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a residual benefit from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that system because you built it and so </v>

1598
01:29:50.521 --> 01:29:51.354
<v Speaker 1>you're not really doing anything but </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just constantly collecting money </v>

1599
01:29:53.371 --> 01:29:54.204
<v Speaker 1>from this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you stop that or regulate </v>

1600
01:29:56.041 --> 01:29:57.480
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1601
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:58.950
<v Speaker 1>as aN example of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I just,</v>

1602
01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:00.900
<v Speaker 1>the way I just described it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1603
01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty good example.</v>

1604
01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:03.371
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1605
01:30:03.371 --> 01:30:04.204
<v Speaker 1>we do want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very tough conversation </v>

1606
01:30:07.891 --> 01:30:08.724
<v Speaker 1>because one has to be very careful that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't remove an incentive to do </v>

1607
01:30:13.261 --> 01:30:14.094
<v Speaker 1>something valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the value of it may be very </v>

1608
01:30:17.191 --> 01:30:17.640
<v Speaker 1>subtle.</v>

1609
01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:18.473
<v Speaker 1>So the example of investment like </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the stock market might look on </v>

1610
01:30:24.381 --> 01:30:25.214
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to the extent that you are </v>

1611
01:30:26.461 --> 01:30:27.294
<v Speaker 1>correcting the fact that certain things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are undervalued and other things are </v>

1612
01:30:29.821 --> 01:30:30.654
<v Speaker 1>overvalued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually doing a kind of service </v>

1613
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:33.383
<v Speaker 1>that is not as obvious on the outsIde </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you've spent time thinking about </v>

1614
01:30:36.961 --> 01:30:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the logic of why you want the market to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be efficient.</v>

1615
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't want to,</v>

1616
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1617
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:44.123
<v Speaker 1>declare that certain things are In and </v>
<v Speaker 1>of themselves bad because we can't see </v>

1618
01:30:48.241 --> 01:30:50.460
<v Speaker 1>the obvious value of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

1619
01:30:50.461 --> 01:30:51.294
<v Speaker 1>there's an awful lot of stuff that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>either totally valueless for which </v>

1620
01:30:54.421 --> 01:30:57.450
<v Speaker 1>people are very handsomely paid or </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

1621
01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>

1622
01:30:59.431 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Destructive of value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1623
01:31:01.411 --> 01:31:02.244
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take waste and you get paid to </v>

1624
01:31:05.191 --> 01:31:06.024
<v Speaker 1>dispose of it and you dispose of it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that it creates cancers where you </v>

1625
01:31:09.361 --> 01:31:12.030
<v Speaker 1>can't detect that they have been created</v>
<v Speaker 1>by what you've done.</v>

1626
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:14.490
<v Speaker 1>But it's not that you solved the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that waste,</v>

1627
01:31:14.491 --> 01:31:18.480
<v Speaker 1>you just caused cancers in random homes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that won't be able to trace their,</v>

1628
01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:21.510
<v Speaker 1>their misfortune to your action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

1629
01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.720
<v Speaker 1>not only is that unproductive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's counterproductive.</v>

1630
01:31:24.721 --> 01:31:29.490
<v Speaker 1>It's harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you address these questions?</v>

1631
01:31:29.491 --> 01:31:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a you.</v>

1632
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.253
<v Speaker 1>this is a much harder problem if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that what you want to do is fix </v>

1633
01:31:38.401 --> 01:31:39.234
<v Speaker 1>the landscape that you're walking into </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say you're a rent seeker and you're </v>

1634
01:31:42.001 --> 01:31:44.850
<v Speaker 1>productive and you're 30 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>

1635
01:31:44.851 --> 01:31:47.970
<v Speaker 1>but 70 percent of rent secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody believes you can do that.</v>

1636
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:52.080
<v Speaker 1>What you can do is restructure things so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that going forward,</v>

1637
01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:57.260
<v Speaker 1>what is rewarded is actual productivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not harmful or actual innovation</v>

1638
01:31:58.291 --> 01:31:59.950
<v Speaker 1>that is not harmful</v>

1639
01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:03.940
<v Speaker 3>and what is panelized and what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really want.</v>

1640
01:32:03.941 --> 01:32:05.530
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the system is to function,</v>

1641
01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:07.173
<v Speaker 3>what you want is a disincentIve to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that hurts other people that </v>

1642
01:32:11.681 --> 01:32:16.681
<v Speaker 3>has a net negative impact on the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bp oil spill,</v>

1643
01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 3>bp oil spill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the aliso canyon,</v>

1644
01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:25.580
<v Speaker 3>a leak the mile island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three mile island fukushima 10th degree.</v>

1645
01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.153
<v Speaker 3>So how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still confused as to what's </v>

1646
01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:31.180
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's going on here?</v>

1647
01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:35.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is going on is that if you,</v>

1648
01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:38.193
<v Speaker 3>if you array incentives so that at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point you have solved a problem that is </v>

1649
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:44.133
<v Speaker 3>good to solve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the wellbeing starts flowing in </v>

1650
01:32:47.891 --> 01:32:49.780
<v Speaker 3>your direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You made it perfect widget.</v>

1651
01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

1652
01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:52.990
<v Speaker 3>this fixes my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1653
01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:54.850
<v Speaker 3>I love this widget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by a bunch of them,</v>

1654
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:56.330
<v Speaker 3>you start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start bawling,</v>

1655
01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:59.740
<v Speaker 3>get Paul Wall grill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1656
01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as you start moving in the direction</v>

1657
01:33:03.701 --> 01:33:06.610
<v Speaker 3>of doing something that interferes with </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people's wellbeing,</v>

1658
01:33:06.611 --> 01:33:08.110
<v Speaker 3>but nonetheless they can't help </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

1659
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:12.400
<v Speaker 3>If you're innovating how to addict </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to their phone,</v>

1660
01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:15.940
<v Speaker 3>then actually you're hurting people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want you to do that.</v>

1661
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Now it's very hard again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going to tell facebook?</v>

1662
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:23.550
<v Speaker 3>You know what it's allowed to study and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also people that have good intentions,</v>

1663
01:33:24.191 --> 01:33:27.250
<v Speaker 3>but it turns out that they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook is a perfect example.</v>

1664
01:33:27.490 --> 01:33:30.580
<v Speaker 3>One of the executives from facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just reading on dig the other day.</v>

1665
01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.170
<v Speaker 3>There was an article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1666
01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:35.740
<v Speaker 3>where he was sorry for what they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

1667
01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:37.450
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the original guys from </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook.</v>

1668
01:33:37.451 --> 01:33:38.284
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think that we've done a </v>

1669
01:33:38.861 --> 01:33:42.070
<v Speaker 3>terrible thing with facebook and we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>made people addicted to social media.</v>

1670
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.233
<v Speaker 3>Facebook is seems to me to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly addictive and I'm not </v>

1671
01:33:46.511 --> 01:33:48.850
<v Speaker 3>exactly sure what they've done different</v>
<v Speaker 3>than anybody else,</v>

1672
01:33:48.851 --> 01:33:51.580
<v Speaker 3>but so much so that I kind of avoid </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook,</v>

1673
01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:52.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny how many conversations I've </v>

1674
01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:54.544
<v Speaker 3>had in the last month in which somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>has said that they're avoiding facebook </v>

1675
01:33:56.971 --> 01:33:57.804
<v Speaker 3>and including me.</v>

1676
01:33:57.860 --> 01:33:58.693
<v Speaker 3>I like instagram because I just see </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures and they look pretty and </v>

1677
01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.570
<v Speaker 3>simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1678
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.621
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1679
01:34:05.621 --> 01:34:08.050
<v Speaker 3>each of these things has their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1680
01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:09.850
<v Speaker 3>their value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not on instagram.</v>

1681
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:12.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on twitter too.</v>

1682
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:13.241
<v Speaker 3>full.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

1683
01:34:13.241 --> 01:34:14.520
<v Speaker 3>what's good about it is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1684
01:34:14.570 --> 01:34:16.690
<v Speaker 3>you're being programmed former facebook </v>
<v Speaker 3>executive.</v>

1685
01:34:16.691 --> 01:34:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Warren's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for my business,</v>

1686
01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.220
<v Speaker 3>it's very important to let people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1687
01:34:21.221 --> 01:34:26.221
<v Speaker 3>bret weinstein is going to be on today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I said it right earlier,</v>

1688
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:33.330
<v Speaker 3>bret weinstein is going to be on today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People tune in and you know,</v>

1689
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:36.280
<v Speaker 3>now there's people that are listening </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now because of social media.</v>

1690
01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.450
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1691
01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy shows that I have coming out,</v>

1692
01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:41.980
<v Speaker 3>but it works for me and a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

1693
01:34:41.981 --> 01:34:46.981
<v Speaker 3>But as time has gone on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've pushed it away and most otherwIse.</v>

1694
01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the thing,</v>

1695
01:34:49.721 --> 01:34:50.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1696
01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.470
<v Speaker 3>the interview that you just referenced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw it too and was quite blown away by</v>

1697
01:34:54.471 --> 01:34:55.120
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1698
01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:58.220
<v Speaker 3>I've been tuned into that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>tristan harris is a friend</v>

1699
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.860
<v Speaker 1>of mine and tristan harris is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1700
01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:01.694
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paul revere on this issue who has </v>

1701
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.903
<v Speaker 1>pointed out how much danger we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually in and I must say he's a very </v>

1702
01:35:08.391 --> 01:35:13.391
<v Speaker 1>interesting guy because his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his other area of expertise is magic.</v>

1703
01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.640
<v Speaker 1>And so he's very interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1704
01:35:16.641 --> 01:35:18.020
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1705
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.910
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1706
01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:21.470
<v Speaker 1>he's watched as an insider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as these,</v>

1707
01:35:21.610 --> 01:35:22.443
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic goliath have conspired to not </v>

1708
01:35:25.041 --> 01:35:30.041
<v Speaker 1>let us go and to turn their product from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a facilitator of social interaction into</v>

1709
01:35:30.081 --> 01:35:30.980
<v Speaker 1>a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1710
01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:31.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a slot machine or something like </v>

1711
01:35:33.411 --> 01:35:34.244
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1712
01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:36.350
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1713
01:35:37.090 --> 01:35:37.923
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you penalize them then say if </v>

1714
01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:42.790
<v Speaker 2>there's this new system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would that work?</v>

1715
01:35:42.791 --> 01:35:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Say if you came up with this new widget </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this new widget does amazing things,</v>

1716
01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:50.440
<v Speaker 2>but turns out it also makes you addicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to widgets.</v>

1717
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm speaking only for myself here.</v>

1718
01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I would not penalize facebook or </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

1719
01:35:57.150 --> 01:35:57.983
<v Speaker 1>but what I would want to see is somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>generate the alternative that has the </v>

1720
01:36:03.151 --> 01:36:04.860
<v Speaker 1>benefit of not doing that.</v>

1721
01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a new facebook that doesn't work with</v>

1722
01:36:08.551 --> 01:36:09.384
<v Speaker 2>likes and all these things are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not constantly checking in the </v>

1723
01:36:11.531 --> 01:36:12.780
<v Speaker 2>likes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wouldn't be.</v>

1724
01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:13.673
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be a successful people love </v>

1725
01:36:15.811 --> 01:36:16.644
<v Speaker 2>likes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why girls stick their butt out </v>

1726
01:36:17.341 --> 01:36:19.440
<v Speaker 2>and those pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to get those likes.</v>

1727
01:36:19.441 --> 01:36:24.441
<v Speaker 2>That's what that's all about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've said first of all,</v>

1728
01:36:26.401 --> 01:36:29.520
<v Speaker 2>that people that do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what those things are called,</v>

1729
01:36:29.730 --> 01:36:32.340
<v Speaker 2>which things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When girls stick their butt out and they</v>

1730
01:36:32.341 --> 01:36:35.130
<v Speaker 2>have traps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirst traps,</v>

1731
01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know about that.</v>

1732
01:36:36.151 --> 01:36:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about thirst traps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you,</v>

1733
01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:43.890
<v Speaker 2>thirst traps are you look for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are thirsty.</v>

1734
01:36:43.891 --> 01:36:44.850
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ooh girl,</v>

1735
01:36:44.851 --> 01:36:46.260
<v Speaker 2>you look good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You look good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who are like extra thirsty,</v>

1737
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:53.730
<v Speaker 2>thirsty means you never get thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1738
01:36:53.731 --> 01:36:54.564
<v Speaker 2>You're married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been around intellectuals and </v>

1739
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:59.760
<v Speaker 2>trapped up in progressive pacific </v>
<v Speaker 2>northwest.</v>

1740
01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:01.950
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to embarrass their </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend.</v>

1741
01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:02.813
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry.</v>

1742
01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:07.680

<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

1743
01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:08.713
<v Speaker 2>like like you're not the type person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you saw someone who is a beautiful </v>

1744
01:37:11.341 --> 01:37:13.710
<v Speaker 2>girl who was in a bikini,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would say,</v>

1745
01:37:13.711 --> 01:37:16.230
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a beautiful girl in a bikini and</v>

1746
01:37:16.231 --> 01:37:18.210
<v Speaker 2>what an incredible body she has and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would move on.</v>

1747
01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:20.370
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn girl,</v>

1748
01:37:20.371 --> 01:37:24.090
<v Speaker 2>you look so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can I get what you did?</v>

1749
01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.310
<v Speaker 2>You would be super thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1750
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:28.920
<v Speaker 2>That would be thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying too hard.</v>

1751
01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.193
<v Speaker 2>But the internet is filled with thirsty </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and so a lot of these girls </v>

1752
01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:39.960
<v Speaker 2>become famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's girls that you've never heard of</v>

1753
01:37:39.961 --> 01:37:40.830
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1754
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:41.783
<v Speaker 2>I had a bit about it and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my last special about there was a girl </v>

1755
01:37:44.971 --> 01:37:45.661
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

1756
01:37:45.661 --> 01:37:46.494
<v Speaker 2>all she does is take pictures of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but and at the time she had 7 million </v>

1757
01:37:50.191 --> 01:37:52.560
<v Speaker 2>followers now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's got 100 million or something.</v>

1758
01:37:52.561 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that these people become</v>

1759
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:57.743
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these places where everybody goes to </v>

1760
01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:01.374
<v Speaker 1>stare at their butt and these pictures </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and their bodies and all these </v>

1761
01:38:05.761 --> 01:38:06.594
<v Speaker 1>different things are traps for all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird people that lack normal social </v>

1762
01:38:12.331 --> 01:38:17.250
<v Speaker 1>skills and their uber thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A thirst trap.</v>

1763
01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.173
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this.</v>

1764
01:38:18.630 --> 01:38:19.463
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole reason why these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>use things like instagram and she that </v>

1765
01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:26.430
<v Speaker 1>thirst trap had a thirst trap on </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram with cardi,</v>

1766
01:38:26.431 --> 01:38:27.510
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>

1767
01:38:28.090 --> 01:38:28.651
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ty.</v>

1768
01:38:28.651 --> 01:38:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the kids today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl,</v>

1769
01:38:32.251 --> 01:38:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm beginning to think maybe we can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>save the world,</v>

1770
01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can save the world,</v>

1771
01:38:36.091 --> 01:38:36.924
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is we have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognizant of normal human desires and </v>

1772
01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.810
<v Speaker 1>like the the traps thirst traps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1773
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:46.703
<v Speaker 1>so this is actually the perfect place to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go then because one of the biggest </v>

1774
01:38:50.130 --> 01:38:50.963
<v Speaker 1>obstacles to fixing the world is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>although a huge fraction of the </v>

1775
01:38:55.291 --> 01:38:56.124
<v Speaker 1>population is actually aware that things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are off and they would like it to be </v>

1776
01:38:59.731 --> 01:39:00.564
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much low level stuff that </v>

1777
01:39:02.941 --> 01:39:03.774
<v Speaker 1>keeps us trapped in these unproductive </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of cycles and one of the things </v>

1778
01:39:09.961 --> 01:39:10.794
<v Speaker 1>that I keep running into now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm now being included in all of these </v>

1779
01:39:13.561 --> 01:39:18.561
<v Speaker 1>conversations with folks who do aspire </v>
<v Speaker 1>to something better,</v>

1780
01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:20.693
<v Speaker 1>but everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean really just about everybody </v>

1781
01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.350
<v Speaker 1>has stuff that to them is sacred and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to take it off the table.</v>

1782
01:39:28.590 --> 01:39:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1783
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:30.173
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very interested in the </v>

1784
01:39:30.571 --> 01:39:32.520
<v Speaker 1>conversation about how we might fix the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1785
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:34.820
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're a libertarian,</v>

1786
01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:35.673
<v Speaker 1>the point is as soon as you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even finish the word regulate </v>

1787
01:39:39.090 --> 01:39:39.930
<v Speaker 1>and they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1788
01:39:39.931 --> 01:39:40.764
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1789
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who watches the watchers?</v>

1790
01:39:43.710 --> 01:39:44.543
<v Speaker 1>And the point that it's a bitter pill </v>
<v Speaker 1>for just about everybody who's got some </v>

1791
01:39:48.601 --> 01:39:53.601
<v Speaker 1>sacred thing that they're holding onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>is you are.</v>

1792
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:55.223
<v Speaker 1>If we deploy something that functions </v>
<v Speaker 1>well and is capable of replacing the </v>

1793
01:40:00.421 --> 01:40:01.254
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have without some gigantic </v>

1794
01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:07.440
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe necessary in order to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the transition.</v>

1795
01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:12.780
<v Speaker 1>The whole point is to everyone's net </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit,</v>

1796
01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:14.213
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If liberty is your thing and I'm </v>

1797
01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:19.890
<v Speaker 1>virtually sure liberty is your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it is my thing,</v>

1798
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:22.403
<v Speaker 1>that you will get more liberty net </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty will go up in a system that </v>

1799
01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:30.960
<v Speaker 1>functions well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the things that caused us not to</v>

1800
01:40:30.961 --> 01:40:34.290
<v Speaker 1>be free have nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>governmental regulation.</v>

1801
01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:35.123
<v Speaker 1>They have to do with expectations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been created by a market that does </v>

1802
01:40:38.941 --> 01:40:39.774
<v Speaker 1>not have our interests at heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're tracking net liberty </v>

1803
01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:46.200
<v Speaker 1>than a system that functions well </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberates you.</v>

1804
01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:50.100
<v Speaker 1>It may have more regulation in it than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one we currently have,</v>

1805
01:40:50.250 --> 01:40:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but that regulation is liberating rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressing and so anyway,</v>

1806
01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:56.053
<v Speaker 1>with libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them to imagine to wrap their </v>

1807
01:41:00.671 --> 01:41:04.150
<v Speaker 1>minds around the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation that they wouldn't hate.</v>

1808
01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:05.373
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we are all so experienced now living </v>

1809
01:41:08.531 --> 01:41:12.370
<v Speaker 1>in a world of malignant government where</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

1810
01:41:13.450 --> 01:41:18.450
<v Speaker 1>government action almost can't be useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it is natural to rebel against it</v>

1811
01:41:19.601 --> 01:41:21.190
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want any more of that.</v>

1812
01:41:21.191 --> 01:41:24.970
<v Speaker 1>The less the better because the actions </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be predatory,</v>

1813
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.073
<v Speaker 1>but that is not the inherent nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation and so constructing a set of </v>

1814
01:41:31.601 --> 01:41:32.434
<v Speaker 1>incentives that caused the market to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliver you the good parts of what a </v>

1815
01:41:36.371 --> 01:41:37.204
<v Speaker 1>phone does without secretly addicting </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to something that you know we now </v>

1816
01:41:42.371 --> 01:41:42.700
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1817
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know how many people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley have now issued a note of</v>

1818
01:41:47.021 --> 01:41:50.230
<v Speaker 1>caution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are many have switched to flip</v>

1819
01:41:50.231 --> 01:41:51.850
<v Speaker 1>phones themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>

1820
01:41:51.851 --> 01:41:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is nature's way of telling you that</v>

1821
01:41:55.451 --> 01:41:58.420
<v Speaker 1>these algorithms have escaped our </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

1822
01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.433
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the people who are in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position to make a phone call and no </v>

1823
01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:05.620
<v Speaker 1>more or less what the algorithm does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't even protect themselves,</v>

1824
01:42:06.110 --> 01:42:06.943
<v Speaker 1>ought to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ought to set off warning bells for </v>

1825
01:42:08.591 --> 01:42:09.550
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1826
01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:10.443
<v Speaker 1>Those people are in the best position to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect themselves and the fact that </v>

1827
01:42:12.371 --> 01:42:13.204
<v Speaker 1>they are bending over backwards there </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are externalizing decision making </v>

1828
01:42:17.681 --> 01:42:18.514
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're having their secretaries tell </v>

1829
01:42:19.421 --> 01:42:23.170
<v Speaker 1>them when they can interact with certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>sites in order to keep them from getting</v>

1830
01:42:23.171 --> 01:42:26.530
<v Speaker 1>into habits that they can't manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1831
01:42:26.531 --> 01:42:28.180
<v Speaker 1>this is the only warning we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

1832
01:42:28.330 --> 01:42:31.270
<v Speaker 1>This was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could still do something about it,</v>

1833
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 1>but this is only getting more </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>

1834
01:42:33.850 --> 01:42:36.820
<v Speaker 1>And so if we do want to restructure </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1835
01:42:36.821 --> 01:42:41.680
<v Speaker 1>and I would argue that even though I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>market fundamentalists will,</v>

1836
01:42:41.681 --> 01:42:42.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear their little sacred sacred thing </v>

1837
01:42:44.171 --> 01:42:45.004
<v Speaker 1>being challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we really want to do is free </v>

1838
01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:48.693
<v Speaker 1>markets to do what the brochure says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they do while eliminating what the </v>

1839
01:42:54.221 --> 01:42:55.570
<v Speaker 1>brochure never mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brochure.</v>

1840
01:42:55.571 --> 01:42:56.404
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mention the fact that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally free market produces predators </v>

1841
01:43:01.391 --> 01:43:04.450
<v Speaker 1>and parasites at a huge rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1842
01:43:04.570 --> 01:43:05.980
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can.</v>

1843
01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:07.293
<v Speaker 1>We can structure things such that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>predator is not viable so that it a </v>

1844
01:43:10.181 --> 01:43:13.180
<v Speaker 1>predator has nothing to eat and if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>predator has nothing to eat,</v>

1845
01:43:13.181 --> 01:43:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the habitat won't have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1846
01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:20.760
<v Speaker 1>So that is the perspective that all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

1847
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:22.630
<v Speaker 1>if we would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1848
01:43:22.710 --> 01:43:24.400
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are abstract ideas,</v>

1849
01:43:24.401 --> 01:43:24.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1850
01:43:24.970 --> 01:43:27.160
<v Speaker 1>How would we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would we eliminate predators?</v>

1851
01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would we eliminate predators?</v>

1852
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:34.950
<v Speaker 1>You would eliminate predators by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disincentive.</v>

1853
01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:41.160
<v Speaker 1>So your question actually has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hidden assumption built into it.</v>

1854
01:43:42.011 --> 01:43:42.844
<v Speaker 1>You've seen the market as a mature </v>
<v Speaker 1>entity with lots of full grown </v>

1855
01:43:47.051 --> 01:43:49.420
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just as it is with biology,</v>

1856
01:43:49.421 --> 01:43:52.910
<v Speaker 1>all of those predators started with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something simple.</v>

1857
01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And what happened was they tapped into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>niche and because that niche was allowed</v>

1858
01:44:00.861 --> 01:44:02.690
<v Speaker 1>to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1859
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:03.643
<v Speaker 1>the predators grow and they get more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sophisticated at doing what they </v>

1860
01:44:07.271 --> 01:44:09.980
<v Speaker 1>are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to see the predators,</v>

1861
01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:10.993
<v Speaker 1>you eliminate the niche for predation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sounds like it would be functional </v>

1862
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:17.390
<v Speaker 1>with if there was like 100 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1863
01:44:17.391 --> 01:44:18.224
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the primary questions in </v>

1864
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:21.403
<v Speaker 1>the various conversations where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to figure out how to </v>

1865
01:44:23.751 --> 01:44:24.584
<v Speaker 1>bootstrap such a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we have what's called dunbar's </v>

1866
01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:29.160
<v Speaker 1>number and numbers.</v>

1867
01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Numbers basically a limit in the low </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of how many people you can keep</v>

1868
01:44:34.371 --> 01:44:35.270
<v Speaker 1>in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1869
01:44:35.271 --> 01:44:36.104
<v Speaker 1>And so the point is we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are adapted to that and that number </v>

1870
01:44:38.481 --> 01:44:39.314
<v Speaker 1>is probably an indicator of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the number of people that you can </v>

1871
01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:46.820
<v Speaker 1>adaptively interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in other words,</v>

1872
01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:48.673
<v Speaker 1>if you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was really the motivation </v>

1873
01:44:50.271 --> 01:44:53.240
<v Speaker 1>for your question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had 150 people and somebody was a</v>

1874
01:44:53.241 --> 01:44:54.074
<v Speaker 1>bad actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their reputation would proceed them and </v>

1875
01:44:56.361 --> 01:44:57.194
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would detect I should be careful </v>

1876
01:44:58.371 --> 01:45:02.240
<v Speaker 1>interacting with that person so that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure would be set up for tribes,</v>

1877
01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:03.193
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially how we evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what dunbar's number essentially </v>

1878
01:45:05.871 --> 01:45:09.710
<v Speaker 1>reveals is that we evolve growing up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of,</v>

1879
01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:11.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 to a couple hundred people and those </v>

1880
01:45:13.131 --> 01:45:15.500
<v Speaker 1>are the amount of people that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep in your mind.</v>

1881
01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1882
01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:19.670
<v Speaker 1>So hard drive space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially we do,</v>

1883
01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:20.533
<v Speaker 1>but we also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are very good at taking a </v>

1884
01:45:25.311 --> 01:45:30.311
<v Speaker 1>technological solution and kludging or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hacking a,</v>

1885
01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:33.710
<v Speaker 1>a remedy for a problem like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1886
01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:34.753
<v Speaker 1>you on board in your mind have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to track something like 150 </v>

1887
01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:39.463
<v Speaker 1>individuals with respect to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation so that you know how much to </v>

1888
01:45:42.561 --> 01:45:45.410
<v Speaker 1>trust in any given interaction in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of,</v>

1889
01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1500,</v>

1890
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:49.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

1891
01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:53.930
<v Speaker 1>reputation can accumulate in some way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can check it through people who</v>

1892
01:45:53.931 --> 01:45:57.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people whose reputations are directly</v>

1893
01:45:57.621 --> 01:46:00.220
<v Speaker 1>known to you are capable of giving you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference and in fact you,</v>

1894
01:46:00.221 --> 01:46:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you know that this works because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpersonally.</v>

1895
01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:07.070
<v Speaker 1>If somebody you trusted to a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent,</v>

1896
01:46:07.490 --> 01:46:09.260
<v Speaker 1>gave you a recommendation of somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

1897
01:46:09.261 --> 01:46:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would know how to evaluate it.</v>

1898
01:46:12.230 --> 01:46:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So we are unfortunately for for both </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and worse,</v>

1899
01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:18.433
<v Speaker 1>we are living in a technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape that doesn't look like </v>

1900
01:46:21.111 --> 01:46:21.944
<v Speaker 1>anything that our ancestors faced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>provides mechanisms for building </v>

1901
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:31.723
<v Speaker 1>solutions to problems that in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestral environment would not have </v>

1902
01:46:35.151 --> 01:46:35.900
<v Speaker 1>been possible.</v>

1903
01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:36.733
<v Speaker 1>And this is not new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the library at alexandria is a </v>

1904
01:46:40.281 --> 01:46:44.000
<v Speaker 1>technological solution to the problem of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Information.</v>

1905
01:46:44.001 --> 01:46:44.834
<v Speaker 1>having expanded to a level of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind couldn't hold it and ironically </v>

1906
01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.940
<v Speaker 1>burned down by ideologues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sure.</v>

1907
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:52.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1908
01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to build a structure that is</v>

1909
01:46:55.861 --> 01:46:56.694
<v Speaker 1>robust to challenge and have all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that would have to be true for a </v>

1910
01:46:59.821 --> 01:47:02.190
<v Speaker 1>replacement system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1911
01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:03.083
<v Speaker 1>for planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the key is understanding that there </v>

1912
01:47:06.211 --> 01:47:09.960
<v Speaker 1>are certain values that all reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>people agree on it.</v>

1913
01:47:09.970 --> 01:47:10.803
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use to diagnose who's </v>

1914
01:47:12.061 --> 01:47:12.894
<v Speaker 1>reasonable.</v>

1915
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:16.040
<v Speaker 2>So assuming that we don't all start at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same starting point,</v>

1916
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.903
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's from our cognitive ability </v>

1917
01:47:19.341 --> 01:47:23.780
<v Speaker 2>or education or opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you stop predators?</v>

1918
01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.810
<v Speaker 2>How would you stop people from preying </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the weak?</v>

1919
01:47:26.811 --> 01:47:27.644
<v Speaker 2>How would you stop like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are predators who they </v>

1920
01:47:31.161 --> 01:47:34.310
<v Speaker 2>themselves are unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mentally.</v>

1921
01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:35.533
<v Speaker 2>They themselves have a deficit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and we're dealing with such </v>

1922
01:47:39.681 --> 01:47:40.514
<v Speaker 2>numbers when we're dealing with 300 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever million people we have in this </v>

1923
01:47:43.551 --> 01:47:46.850
<v Speaker 2>country alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of dummies that you could</v>

1924
01:47:46.851 --> 01:47:47.410
<v Speaker 2>pray on.</v>

1925
01:47:47.410 --> 01:47:48.243
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that you would want to </v>

1926
01:47:49.031 --> 01:47:54.031
<v Speaker 1>do is you would want to build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you came to me and you said I have</v>

1927
01:47:54.190 --> 01:47:55.023
<v Speaker 1>a social network and it provides 85 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the functionality of </v>

1928
01:47:59.831 --> 01:48:00.664
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it insulates you completely from a </v>

1929
01:48:04.690 --> 01:48:07.690
<v Speaker 1>dopamine traps being used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick dicked you,</v>

1930
01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I'd sign up in a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1931
01:48:09.771 --> 01:48:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1932
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.393
<v Speaker 2>But you are an intellectual and you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>rare in that regard that you're worried </v>

1933
01:48:15.601 --> 01:48:16.434
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people that are in silicon valley </v>

1934
01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:19.073
<v Speaker 2>that are talking about the dangers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that they've created </v>

1935
01:48:20.761 --> 01:48:22.470
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're rare.</v>

1936
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Most people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all the likes,</v>

1937
01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:26.733
<v Speaker 2>dislikes.</v>

1938
01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>

1939
01:48:28.481 --> 01:48:30.250
<v Speaker 1>so there's some sort of bored at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1940
01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.320
<v Speaker 1>In one check their likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1941
01:48:32.321 --> 01:48:33.810
<v Speaker 1>But I mean mike's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pIck,</v>

1942
01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:37.000
<v Speaker 1>that's what a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must have a nice butt.</v>

1943
01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:38.940
<v Speaker 1>My butt's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1944
01:48:39.730 --> 01:48:41.380
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1945
01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:47.040
<v Speaker 1>first of all things spread in waves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1946
01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:51.460
<v Speaker 1>it is possible to just look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape and say,</v>

1947
01:48:51.461 --> 01:48:52.294
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only intellectuals are gonna get why </v>

1948
01:48:54.071 --> 01:48:55.900
<v Speaker 1>they should want such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's really,</v>

1949
01:48:55.901 --> 01:48:56.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1950
01:48:56.921 --> 01:48:57.754
<v Speaker 1>for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is talking about blockchain </v>

1951
01:48:59.441 --> 01:49:00.080
<v Speaker 1>currency.</v>

1952
01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:02.600
<v Speaker 2>The world is not talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>blockchain currency.</v>

1953
01:49:02.601 --> 01:49:05.750
<v Speaker 2>A very small percentage of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about blockchain currency,</v>

1954
01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:08.420
<v Speaker 2>the same amount that it talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth being flat.</v>

1955
01:49:10.150 --> 01:49:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I bet it is,</v>

1956
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:13.833
<v Speaker 1>but I would say I grant your point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not a huge percentage of </v>

1957
01:49:16.781 --> 01:49:18.550
<v Speaker 1>people who are talking about blockchain </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>

1958
01:49:18.551 --> 01:49:22.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's enough that on the network news</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are talking about blockchain.</v>

1959
01:49:22.210 --> 01:49:23.043
<v Speaker 1>Is it a bubble?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is beginning to penetrate the </v>

1960
01:49:27.670 --> 01:49:28.503
<v Speaker 1>public consciousness and it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>penetrating it because people have to </v>

1961
01:49:31.571 --> 01:49:36.571
<v Speaker 1>navigate lives in which economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluctuation jeopardize us them,</v>

1962
01:49:36.731 --> 01:49:39.010
<v Speaker 1>and so there's an incentive if there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something over there.</v>

1963
01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Blockchain is not a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a joke anymore.</v>

1964
01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that blockchain</v>

1965
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 2>people that are involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in comprehensively understand</v>

1966
01:49:48.191 --> 01:49:49.024
<v Speaker 2>what blockchain is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there more or less of them than </v>

1967
01:49:52.751 --> 01:49:53.770
<v Speaker 2>people that are in cults?</v>

1968
01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.410
<v Speaker 3>There are vastly more paying attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>then people in cults.</v>

1969
01:50:00.930 --> 01:50:02.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you have to default?</v>

1970
01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:07.130
<v Speaker 3>That's way off because I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a billion catholics.</v>

1971
01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:08.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna call catholicism.</v>

1972
01:50:08.991 --> 01:50:11.420
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1973
01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:14.030
<v Speaker 3>A hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a coat with a billion people.</v>

1974
01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you got a guy who dresses like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a wizard,</v>

1975
01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.670
<v Speaker 3>he's sitting on a golden throne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>

1976
01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:21.913
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1977
01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:22.893
<v Speaker 2>But that is why this is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's many people that live </v>

1978
01:50:26.621 --> 01:50:31.621
<v Speaker 2>their lives by these ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies that are illogical.</v>

1979
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going,</v>

1980
01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna challenge you on this tech </v>
<v Speaker 3>them from predators and facebook likes.</v>

1981
01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:41.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to challenge you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swedes do.</v>

1982
01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Catholicism is not a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the difference between a cult?</v>

1983
01:50:45.110 --> 01:50:46.700
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a bit for my act.</v>

1984
01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:47.593
<v Speaker 3>Let me just make sure a call is bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's created by one person and he </v>

1985
01:50:51.951 --> 01:50:55.460
<v Speaker 3>knows it's bullshit in a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's dead.</v>

1986
01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:57.953
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1987
01:50:59.070 --> 01:51:00.220
<v Speaker 3>so let me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1988
01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:01.710
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is rough territory,</v>

1989
01:51:01.711 --> 01:51:02.990
<v Speaker 3>but for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1990
01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Let's say this is every let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Let's say moses comes down the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the tablets.</v>

1992
01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dude.</v>

1993
01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:10.163
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if moses did come down the </v>

1994
01:51:11.071 --> 01:51:12.360
<v Speaker 3>mountain with the tablets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't think he did.</v>

1995
01:51:12.361 --> 01:51:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1996
01:51:13.590 --> 01:51:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did he,</v>

1997
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:16.010
<v Speaker 3>did he know he was bullshitting people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1998
01:51:16.011 --> 01:51:16.340
<v Speaker 3>do you know</v>

1999
01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:17.470
<v Speaker 2>religious scholars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

2000
01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:20.330
<v Speaker 2>believe in jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually believe that was all about now.</v>

2001
01:51:20.331 --> 01:51:23.360
<v Speaker 2>The whole burning bush tell me they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in is the acacia butch,</v>

2002
01:51:23.361 --> 01:51:24.194
<v Speaker 2>which is rich and dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they think the metaphor of the </v>

2003
01:51:27.051 --> 01:51:27.884
<v Speaker 2>burning bush was actually a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and that moses during this </v>

2004
01:51:31.641 --> 01:51:32.474
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic dmt experience came back </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the other dimension that you go </v>

2005
01:51:35.481 --> 01:51:39.320
<v Speaker 2>into when you go into the dmt trance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With all this</v>

2006
01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:44.120
<v Speaker 2>really standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standard messages that I myself have</v>

2007
01:51:44.121 --> 01:51:44.954
<v Speaker 2>gotten from these psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences that you have to treat each </v>

2008
01:51:46.821 --> 01:51:50.840
<v Speaker 2>other as if we're all one and that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>separations are all illusions.</v>

2009
01:51:50.841 --> 01:51:51.674
<v Speaker 2>That you are literally living a life </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if I was born in your body and it </v>

2010
01:51:57.061 --> 01:51:57.894
<v Speaker 2>had your genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be you and you would be me </v>

2011
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:03.260
<v Speaker 2>because we're all the same and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences are really what the Illusion</v>

2012
01:52:03.261 --> 01:52:04.094
<v Speaker 2>is when we were these temporary beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that negative thinking and negative </v>

2013
01:52:07.761 --> 01:52:08.594
<v Speaker 2>feelings and all these things manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves in negative actions and </v>

2014
01:52:11.151 --> 01:52:11.984
<v Speaker 2>negative thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can change that and you can </v>

2015
01:52:13.281 --> 01:52:15.380
<v Speaker 2>change the frequency in which you exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this world.</v>

2016
01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:16.553
<v Speaker 2>Like this is essentially what the 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>year old version of moses or more than </v>

2017
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:23.810
<v Speaker 2>that moses has tablets were that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

2018
01:52:24.130 --> 01:52:26.210
<v Speaker 2>that god was the burning bush.</v>

2019
01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:28.060
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

2020
01:52:28.130 --> 01:52:28.963
<v Speaker 3>So can I ask you a question?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've done some holistic </v>

2021
01:52:30.531 --> 01:52:31.364
<v Speaker 3>hallucinogenics oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've had some insight and that </v>

2022
01:52:33.551 --> 01:52:36.410
<v Speaker 3>insight had something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>treating people well.</v>

2023
01:52:36.411 --> 01:52:37.570
<v Speaker 3>So it definitelY did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2024
01:52:37.571 --> 01:52:38.404
<v Speaker 3>Was it true?</v>

2025
01:52:39.490 --> 01:52:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely has benefited me.</v>

2026
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:44.320
<v Speaker 2>True or false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you asked me,</v>

2027
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:49.830
<v Speaker 2>is it true that you have had a positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences from psychedelic drugs</v>

2028
01:52:49.930 --> 01:52:53.710
<v Speaker 1>where you have interpreted those </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences and improve your life?</v>

2029
01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2030
01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:55.373
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So If you now go and you convey that </v>

2031
01:52:57.581 --> 01:53:01.420
<v Speaker 1>thing to somebody who hasn't had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience themselves,</v>

2032
01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:02.680
<v Speaker 1>is it bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2033
01:53:02.681 --> 01:53:03.270
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right</v>

2034
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:05.910
<v Speaker 2>about psychedelics as opposed to all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other ideologies,</v>

2035
01:53:05.911 --> 01:53:08.910
<v Speaker 2>is that they're very repeatable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to believe in dmt.</v>

2036
01:53:08.911 --> 01:53:09.744
<v Speaker 2>If you smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to experience it whether </v>

2037
01:53:10.621 --> 01:53:11.270
<v Speaker 2>you believe in it or</v>

2038
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:12.260
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2039
01:53:12.261 --> 01:53:13.590
<v Speaker 1>And actually I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2040
01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I am a cautious fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say cautious because I don't think.</v>

2041
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:20.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of the idea that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>substances should be used </v>

2042
01:53:23.361 --> 01:53:25.070
<v Speaker 1>recreationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a mistake.</v>

2043
01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2044
01:53:26.031 --> 01:53:26.864
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fine to have a great time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that these things are so powerful </v>

2045
01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:34.040
<v Speaker 1>that one should be deliberate about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2046
01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:35.670
<v Speaker 1>don't do it with a tv only</v>

2047
01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:37.443
<v Speaker 2>about doing it recreationally is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to get more people to do it </v>

2048
01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.810
<v Speaker 2>and that if you think it's recreational </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you do it,</v>

2049
01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:45.120
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a certain percentage</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those people that go.</v>

2050
01:53:45.150 --> 01:53:47.880
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I thought it was.</v>

2051
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:51.210
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going in there to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a good time and I just communicated with</v>

2052
01:53:51.211 --> 01:53:52.044
<v Speaker 2>god.</v>

2053
01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Air quotes.</v>

2054
01:53:53.971 --> 01:53:54.810
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2055
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Air quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2056
01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:56.333
<v Speaker 1>but air quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god is marvelous because air quotes god </v>

2057
01:53:59.641 --> 01:54:01.380
<v Speaker 1>is the real deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2058
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:03.840
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a dude on a cloud.</v>

2059
01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:05.003
<v Speaker 1>It's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a metaphor for something lodged </v>

2060
01:54:07.921 --> 01:54:11.040
<v Speaker 1>very deep in the mind where you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>find it directly.</v>

2061
01:54:11.041 --> 01:54:11.874
<v Speaker 1>And this is a hack that many cultures </v>
<v Speaker 1>have used to access that layer and it's </v>

2062
01:54:15.661 --> 01:54:16.381
<v Speaker 1>all very familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2063
01:54:16.381 --> 01:54:16.590
<v Speaker 1>To</v>

2064
01:54:16.590 --> 01:54:17.423
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you talk to people that have </v>

2065
01:54:18.961 --> 01:54:19.794
<v Speaker 2>studied dmt in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why I think it's so </v>

2066
01:54:22.051 --> 01:54:23.520
<v Speaker 2>familiar to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2067
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:24.383
<v Speaker 2>when you have this experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things that happens is </v>

2068
01:54:26.251 --> 01:54:27.084
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you've been there before </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they believed that this is because </v>

2069
01:54:30.270 --> 01:54:32.790
<v Speaker 2>during rem sleep your brain produces </v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt.</v>

2070
01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to monitor,</v>

2071
01:54:34.861 --> 01:54:38.310
<v Speaker 2>but they have been able to through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cottonwood research foundation,</v>

2072
01:54:38.970 --> 01:54:39.803
<v Speaker 2>which all started from the work of dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>rick strassman out of the university of </v>

2073
01:54:42.721 --> 01:54:45.540
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico who wrote a book called dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spirit molecule,</v>

2074
01:54:46.170 --> 01:54:49.620
<v Speaker 2>which was one of the very first times </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a dea,</v>

2075
01:54:49.621 --> 01:54:50.454
<v Speaker 2>allowed them to do clinical studies on </v>
<v Speaker 2>people with intravenous </v>

2076
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.090
<v Speaker 2>dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking serious shit.</v>

2077
01:54:57.150 --> 01:55:00.150
<v Speaker 2>So instead of like this 10 to 15 minute </v>
<v Speaker 2>trip,</v>

2078
01:55:00.151 --> 01:55:04.740
<v Speaker 2>You're gone for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half hour plus and deep deep experiences</v>

2079
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:07.260
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of these people mirrored.</v>

2080
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:12.060
<v Speaker 2>They all had like super similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

2081
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:14.430
<v Speaker 2>But through the cottonwood research </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation,</v>

2082
01:55:14.431 --> 01:55:18.840
<v Speaker 2>they found that live rats are producing </v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt in their pineal gland.</v>

2083
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:22.560
<v Speaker 2>this has been proven now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was really just speculation.</v>

2084
01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:24.180
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was anecdotal evidence,</v>

2085
01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:25.193
<v Speaker 2>but now they know that rats produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>this so they don't know exactly when </v>

2086
01:55:28.051 --> 01:55:28.884
<v Speaker 2>people do it because they would have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the same thing they do to rats would </v>

2087
01:55:30.481 --> 01:55:31.314
<v Speaker 2>have to open your brain up until they </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop some sort of sophisticated </v>

2088
01:55:33.841 --> 01:55:34.674
<v Speaker 2>detection methods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just speculation as to when the </v>

2089
01:55:38.341 --> 01:55:41.220
<v Speaker 2>brain's producing this incredibly potent</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drug,</v>

2090
01:55:41.221 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's producing it.</v>

2091
01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>We</v>

2092
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.140
<v Speaker 1>know it's produced in the liver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's produced in the lungs.</v>

2093
01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:49.320
<v Speaker 1>It's endogenous to the human system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know why.</v>

2094
01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:50.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2095
01:55:50.490 --> 01:55:52.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I have a good insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>into why,</v>

2096
01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:53.993
<v Speaker 1>but for the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's pursue the issue of what the </v>

2097
01:55:56.461 --> 01:55:59.040
<v Speaker 1>implications are going to hold onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>while cross my fingers.</v>

2098
01:55:59.041 --> 01:56:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Cross your fingers on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2099
01:56:01.710 --> 01:56:02.543
<v Speaker 1>the story of just told is perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>plausible whether it's 100 percent </v>

2100
01:56:06.361 --> 01:56:08.370
<v Speaker 1>accurate or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know,</v>

2101
01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:09.293
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But thE idea that your mind contains </v>

2102
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:17.730
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms that go into some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic state without your conscious</v>

2103
01:56:17.731 --> 01:56:18.564
<v Speaker 1>mind being able to tap into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your conscious mind walks around </v>

2104
01:56:20.341 --> 01:56:21.174
<v Speaker 1>during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not realizing that you're tripping at </v>

2105
01:56:22.201 --> 01:56:26.280
<v Speaker 1>some other moments for some purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all very interesting.</v>

2106
01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:30.750
<v Speaker 1>You're not tripping in your sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind for no reason at all.</v>

2107
01:56:30.810 --> 01:56:33.840
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it for productive reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logically speaking,</v>

2108
01:56:33.841 --> 01:56:34.674
<v Speaker 1>it has to be the case that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning energy and going through the </v>

2109
01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:43.920
<v Speaker 1>costly exercise of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the psychedelic way,</v>

2110
01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:45.630
<v Speaker 1>that it's happening for a reason.</v>

2111
01:56:46.050 --> 01:56:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that we have carried this</v>

2112
01:56:47.641 --> 01:56:48.474
<v Speaker 1>with us from an ancestral state into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern state and we now have molecules </v>

2113
01:56:52.531 --> 01:56:55.140
<v Speaker 1>that we can trigger it when we want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2114
01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:56.993
<v Speaker 1>that gives you access to a style of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you're telling me has </v>

2115
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:06.390
<v Speaker 1>altered your understanding of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to other people and that it</v>

2116
01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:11.520
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically lines up with what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>often hear delivered in religious terms,</v>

2117
01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:13.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abstractly,</v>

2118
01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:14.813
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>RigHt.</v>

2119
01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:18.450
<v Speaker 1>And so when you say catholicism is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cult,</v>

2120
01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:19.913
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree because catholicism </v>
<v Speaker 1>historically must have been delivering </v>

2121
01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:26.873
<v Speaker 1>messages that caused people to correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>their thinking in ways that made them </v>

2122
01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:32.753
<v Speaker 1>collaborate more effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that made them better able to find the </v>

2123
01:57:35.971 --> 01:57:36.804
<v Speaker 1>opportunities in their environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not advocating that we should sign </v>

2124
01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:46.400
<v Speaker 1>up for belief systems that are at odds </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our modern environment,</v>

2125
01:57:47.730 --> 01:57:48.563
<v Speaker 1>but one thing we can say I believe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure is that religions that have stood </v>

2126
01:57:54.361 --> 01:57:55.194
<v Speaker 1>the test of time did so because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>value to the people who believed in </v>

2127
01:57:59.671 --> 01:57:59.880
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2128
01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:04.880
<v Speaker 1>It was so great that those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that disbelieved were out competed now.</v>

2129
01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:10.580
<v Speaker 1>So we get into trouble in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance because we can look at many</v>

2130
01:58:10.651 --> 01:58:11.484
<v Speaker 1>of the teachings of any of these ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions and we can compare them to </v>

2131
01:58:14.671 --> 01:58:17.940
<v Speaker 1>what we learned scientifically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>detect that there's something not right.</v>

2132
01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Can I stop you there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure scientology.</v>

2133
01:58:20.281 --> 01:58:25.281
<v Speaker 1>Is tHat a cult too early to tell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2134
01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:26.760
<v Speaker 1>But let's stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2135
01:58:26.761 --> 01:58:27.330
<v Speaker 1>that whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2136
01:58:27.330 --> 01:58:29.130
<v Speaker 1>the guy who created it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we do,</v>

2137
01:58:29.131 --> 01:58:31.450
<v Speaker 1>but we all have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me drag you back it.</v>

2138
01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:32.293
<v Speaker 1>So by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very uncomfortable with scientology </v>

2139
01:58:34.981 --> 01:58:37.020
<v Speaker 1>and what it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is,</v>

2140
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:40.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as scientology itself points out,</v>

2141
01:58:40.681 --> 01:58:44.050
<v Speaker 1>if you at the inception of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the catholic church,</v>

2142
01:58:44.051 --> 01:58:46.150
<v Speaker 1>you might be equally troubled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2143
01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Which is why I think they're both calls </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2144
01:58:48.611 --> 01:58:50.080
<v Speaker 1>but let's be careful about that.</v>

2145
01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:53.160
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think are cult is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think you called it?</v>

2146
01:58:53.470 --> 01:58:54.303
<v Speaker 1>I cult is the predatory version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is tapping into people's natural </v>

2147
01:59:00.371 --> 01:59:04.060
<v Speaker 1>tendency to believe in what I call a </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical truths.</v>

2148
01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And it is using it very often to extract</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources from them to church.</v>

2149
01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2150
01:59:11.230 --> 01:59:12.063
<v Speaker 1>not like the catholic here at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>catholic church is so long standing and </v>

2151
01:59:14.321 --> 01:59:15.154
<v Speaker 1>the population that has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I would say is if a </v>

2152
01:59:19.031 --> 01:59:19.864
<v Speaker 1>population succeeds by believing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things than cult is not the </v>

2153
01:59:24.521 --> 01:59:26.560
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2154
01:59:26.561 --> 01:59:27.394
<v Speaker 1>And I have different terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were we using different definitions of </v>

2155
01:59:29.801 --> 01:59:31.060
<v Speaker 1>the word called done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let me.</v>

2156
01:59:31.061 --> 01:59:31.581
<v Speaker 1>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2157
01:59:31.581 --> 01:59:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a very interesting comparison.</v>

2158
01:59:34.091 --> 01:59:34.924
<v Speaker 1>So Joseph Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who started the mormon church had a </v>

2159
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:39.550
<v Speaker 1>turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2160
01:59:39.790 --> 01:59:41.840
<v Speaker 1>He had a competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2161
01:59:42.490 --> 01:59:45.340
<v Speaker 1>at the time as a book called the kingdom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mathias,</v>

2162
01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:47.500
<v Speaker 1>right about his competitor at the time.</v>

2163
01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:50.020
<v Speaker 1>And to me the two looked equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>plausible.</v>

2164
01:59:50.021 --> 01:59:51.310
<v Speaker 1>The story that they were selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2165
01:59:51.311 --> 01:59:56.311
<v Speaker 1>mathias never had more than 30 followers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his religion died out and joseph and</v>

2166
01:59:57.311 --> 02:00:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Smith one and in the mormon </v>
<v Speaker 1>church is obviously a real thing.</v>

2167
02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:02.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these sets of beliefs are advanced </v>

2168
02:00:06.611 --> 02:00:07.444
<v Speaker 1>by somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether those somebodies are cynical </v>

2169
02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>when they do it or whether they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>earnest.</v>

2170
02:00:13.571 --> 02:00:14.404
<v Speaker 1>I think many of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that we have that have lasted </v>

2171
02:00:18.191 --> 02:00:19.024
<v Speaker 1>for long periods of time have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced by somebody who was in one way </v>

2172
02:00:22.331 --> 02:00:23.164
<v Speaker 1>or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious or not dmt or not tapped into </v>

2173
02:00:27.161 --> 02:00:27.994
<v Speaker 1>something that when delivered to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people actually constituted a kind of </v>

2174
02:00:31.361 --> 02:00:33.910
<v Speaker 1>insight now as opposed to being a con </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2175
02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2176
02:00:35.250 --> 02:00:36.083
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the origins of the catholic church </v>

2177
02:00:39.451 --> 02:00:43.500
<v Speaker 2>most likely came from some desire for </v>
<v Speaker 2>order and,</v>

2178
02:00:43.530 --> 02:00:44.363
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a scaffolding of how to behave and to </v>

2179
02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:47.663
<v Speaker 2>give people rules and structure for how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get through this life with the most </v>

2180
02:00:52.351 --> 02:00:53.184
<v Speaker 2>amount of positivity and love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by disciplining them and having </v>

2181
02:00:56.641 --> 02:01:00.390
<v Speaker 2>these grave punishments being held over </v>
<v Speaker 2>their head,</v>

2182
02:01:00.391 --> 02:01:02.940
<v Speaker 2>burning in the fires of the pits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>

2183
02:01:03.210 --> 02:01:07.740
<v Speaker 2>If they decide to have sex with another </v>
<v Speaker 2>man or were two different types of cloth</v>

2184
02:01:07.741 --> 02:01:08.574
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other silly things that were in the </v>

2185
02:01:10.651 --> 02:01:14.190
<v Speaker 2>old testament by doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they've essentially tried to do was</v>

2186
02:01:14.250 --> 02:01:15.540
<v Speaker 2>offer people structure.</v>

2187
02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really structure.</v>

2188
02:01:18.250 --> 02:01:19.083
<v Speaker 1>It is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an analog for truths that can't be </v>

2189
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:24.183
<v Speaker 1>spoken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally because nobody knows how </v>

2190
02:01:26.651 --> 02:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>to phrase them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

2191
02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:32.050
<v Speaker 1>let's deal with the church on the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and moses on the other.</v>

2192
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Moses is obviously important in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2193
02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>in jewish history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If moses</v>

2194
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.113
<v Speaker 3>ate some dmt from the acacia bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was smoke and he smells why </v>

2195
02:01:45.021 --> 02:01:45.854
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing and the burning bush say</v>
<v Speaker 3>he smoked it and let's say he was super </v>

2196
02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:49.634
<v Speaker 3>savvy and farsighted and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously he didn't know anything about </v>

2197
02:01:52.851 --> 02:01:57.851
<v Speaker 3>molecules that suppose that he had some </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient model of something and he said,</v>

2198
02:01:58.410 --> 02:01:59.243
<v Speaker 3>there must have been something in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>plant that caused crazy things to </v>

2199
02:02:02.121 --> 02:02:02.954
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's suppose he didn't believe that he </v>

2200
02:02:03.891 --> 02:02:07.370
<v Speaker 3>had contacted god or that god had </v>
<v Speaker 3>contacted him.</v>

2201
02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:10.460
<v Speaker 3>But you woke up from the thing and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2202
02:02:10.670 --> 02:02:11.503
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what these people are doing </v>

2203
02:02:12.651 --> 02:02:13.370
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

2204
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Write it down and tell them came from </v>
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>

2205
02:02:16.590 --> 02:02:21.440
<v Speaker 3>but his judaism now a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're all cults.</v>

2206
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:24.710
<v Speaker 3>I think all ideologies are cults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

2207
02:02:24.711 --> 02:02:25.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2208
02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:30.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there is any one person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who wrote,</v>

2209
02:02:30.230 --> 02:02:35.030
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're dealing with a christianity,</v>

2210
02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:36.830
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with translations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2211
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Or judaIsm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

2212
02:02:37.711 --> 02:02:38.544
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with like ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>translations of languages that aren't </v>

2213
02:02:41.421 --> 02:02:42.650
<v Speaker 3>even spoken anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2214
02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:43.873
<v Speaker 3>and you're also dealing with an oral </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition of who knows how many years </v>

2215
02:02:47.541 --> 02:02:49.220
<v Speaker 3>before it was ever bothered to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>written down,</v>

2216
02:02:49.650 --> 02:02:50.483
<v Speaker 3>but write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but written down by people and then </v>

2217
02:02:53.181 --> 02:02:55.910
<v Speaker 3>people decide what stays in and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't.</v>

2218
02:02:56.090 --> 02:02:56.923
<v Speaker 3>They changed the rules like the priest </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be able to marry priests in the </v>

2219
02:03:00.051 --> 02:03:02.120
<v Speaker 3>catholic church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pope used to have wives.</v>

2220
02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:04.320
<v Speaker 3>They ran armies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2221
02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:05.193
<v Speaker 3>this is clearly something that human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings have a hand in manipulating and </v>

2222
02:03:09.531 --> 02:03:10.364
<v Speaker 3>changing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they do it for the benefit of the </v>

2223
02:03:11.691 --> 02:03:12.524
<v Speaker 3>structure itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing it for the benefit of </v>

2224
02:03:13.971 --> 02:03:14.804
<v Speaker 3>the human beings that are part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it for the benefit of the </v>

2225
02:03:16.851 --> 02:03:18.290
<v Speaker 3>structure itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2226
02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:20.720
<v Speaker 3>that I don't agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's what case.</v>

2227
02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:23.570
<v Speaker 3>We'll do like the money and the amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

2228
02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:25.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you don't havE corruption</v>

2229
02:03:25.730 --> 02:03:27.830
<v Speaker 3>in all of these structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>

2230
02:03:28.050 --> 02:03:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I am saying that there is an immune.</v>

2231
02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:34.070
<v Speaker 3>This is exactly parallel to what we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about before.</v>

2232
02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.233
<v Speaker 3>There is the predatory version which I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would call a cult and there is the </v>

2233
02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:42.620
<v Speaker 3>earnest version which I would not call a</v>
<v Speaker 3>call now.</v>

2234
02:03:42.621 --> 02:03:43.454
<v Speaker 3>I'm very uncomfortable with any of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things governing policy in the present </v>

2235
02:03:46.671 --> 02:03:47.504
<v Speaker 3>because none of them have a literal </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with reality that allows </v>

2236
02:03:51.381 --> 02:03:52.214
<v Speaker 3>them to deal with the fact that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got all these new problems for which </v>

2237
02:03:54.921 --> 02:03:56.690
<v Speaker 3>there are no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no religious wisdom.</v>

2238
02:03:56.900 --> 02:04:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there'S a problem in the word </v>
<v Speaker 3>called maYbe,</v>

2239
02:04:00.051 --> 02:04:00.884
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should just say a structure </v>

2240
02:04:06.531 --> 02:04:10.970
<v Speaker 3>created by human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically all structures,</v>

2241
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.950
<v Speaker 3>all structures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

2242
02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:16.960
<v Speaker 3>all models of behavior where you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>adhere to certain things.</v>

2243
02:04:18.051 --> 02:04:18.884
<v Speaker 3>But thE problem with religion and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a lot of cults is these supposed </v>

2244
02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:26.870
<v Speaker 3>grave consequences for deviated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2245
02:04:27.110 --> 02:04:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so alright,</v>

2246
02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:29.210
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

2247
02:04:29.210 --> 02:04:32.720
<v Speaker 3>let's pick up catholicism because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>easy because so much of the structure is</v>

2248
02:04:32.721 --> 02:04:33.554
<v Speaker 3>visible to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would argue that catholicism is going </v>

2249
02:04:37.811 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 3>to be true</v>

2250
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>of all of christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be true of judaism,</v>

2251
02:04:41.441 --> 02:04:42.274
<v Speaker 1>but catholicism is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is easy to see how it would </v>

2252
02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:47.483
<v Speaker 1>facilitate collaboration that </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively it would recreate in some </v>

2253
02:04:51.391 --> 02:04:52.224
<v Speaker 1>sense the insight that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about from dmt and that it would </v>

2254
02:04:55.411 --> 02:04:56.244
<v Speaker 1>instantiate it in the population in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful way that would facilitate </v>

2255
02:05:00.271 --> 02:05:05.271
<v Speaker 1>collaboration and disrupt processes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause infighting springing before.</v>

2256
02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:08.783
<v Speaker 1>It might be a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the scaffolding for human behavior </v>

2257
02:05:11.221 --> 02:05:12.250
<v Speaker 1>and ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2258
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:14.420
<v Speaker 1>But imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we can see it in catholicism.</v>

2259
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know where it is.</v>

2260
02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:16.313
<v Speaker 1>So every week you have to go and confess</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit you're doing wrong to the dude </v>

2261
02:05:21.061 --> 02:05:22.710
<v Speaker 1>in the box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2262
02:05:23.130 --> 02:05:25.440
<v Speaker 1>That's how they used to spy on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what that was for.</v>

2263
02:05:25.441 --> 02:05:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why are they spying on you?</v>

2264
02:05:26.731 --> 02:05:27.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2265
02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:29.550
<v Speaker 1>they want to make sure that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get overthrown.</v>

2266
02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:30.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2267
02:05:30.791 --> 02:05:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're too cynical.</v>

2268
02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:32.701
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2269
02:05:32.701 --> 02:05:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Because what do you think they're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2270
02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.630
<v Speaker 1>so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a biologist.</v>

2271
02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:37.493
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are these priests who don't marrY </v>

2272
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:42.210
<v Speaker 1>passing on their genes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

2273
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

2274
02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>

2275
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:45.263
<v Speaker 1>This snaky know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitating the stability of the </v>

2276
02:05:48.930 --> 02:05:53.370
<v Speaker 1>lineage that they are in charge of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is they don't pass on their</v>

2277
02:05:53.371 --> 02:05:54.204
<v Speaker 1>genes directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're passing on their genes </v>

2278
02:05:55.620 --> 02:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>indirectly through the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their interests are synonymized with the</v>

2279
02:06:00.871 --> 02:06:03.480
<v Speaker 1>population that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2280
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:07.170
<v Speaker 1>they are preaching to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you tell the dude in the box,</v>

2281
02:06:07.171 --> 02:06:09.480
<v Speaker 1>which we've been doing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine it's adultery.</v>

2282
02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2283
02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:14.550
<v Speaker 1>if I die before next week and I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>confessed my adults,</v>

2284
02:06:14.551 --> 02:06:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you'd go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to hell.</v>

2285
02:06:15.871 --> 02:06:16.704
<v Speaker 1>That dad had a very unpleasant place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tell guy it doesn't get to have </v>

2286
02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:20.160
<v Speaker 1>someone to tell him.</v>

2287
02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:22.590
<v Speaker 1>So now the person I've been committing </v>
<v Speaker 1>adultery with his thinking,</v>

2288
02:06:22.591 --> 02:06:24.300
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I was going to keep this a secret,</v>

2289
02:06:24.301 --> 02:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>but now the priest is going to know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been committing adultery.</v>

2290
02:06:27.831 --> 02:06:29.580
<v Speaker 1>They're going to hear from the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

2291
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:32.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I better confess too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the priest has a sense of like,</v>

2292
02:06:32.761 --> 02:06:35.280
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an adultery problem in the,</v>

2293
02:06:35.281 --> 02:06:37.770
<v Speaker 1>in the congregation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the priest is,</v>

2294
02:06:37.771 --> 02:06:39.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flipping through the book and thinking,</v>

2295
02:06:39.570 --> 02:06:40.291
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this week,</v>

2296
02:06:40.291 --> 02:06:41.580
<v Speaker 1>what should we talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2297
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:42.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the priest then gets up at the pulpit </v>

2298
02:06:44.370 --> 02:06:45.181
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2299
02:06:45.181 --> 02:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>turn your book to on whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2300
02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:49.613
<v Speaker 1>and starts going on about adultery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in the congregation who are </v>

2301
02:06:54.631 --> 02:06:56.580
<v Speaker 1>engaged in adultery or thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

2302
02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:57.653
<v Speaker 1>this is god talking to me directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God knows what I've been up to and he's </v>

2303
02:07:01.111 --> 02:07:03.330
<v Speaker 1>not happy and that's why we'Re reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>this psalm.</v>

2304
02:07:03.570 --> 02:07:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I better cut it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out,</v>

2305
02:07:05.310 --> 02:07:07.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my poInt is,</v>

2306
02:07:08.130 --> 02:07:11.910
<v Speaker 1>the dude in the box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's taken a vow of poverty.</v>

2307
02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:15.570
<v Speaker 1>He's living in the church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does well when the town does well.</v>

2308
02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:16.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2309
02:07:16.770 --> 02:07:21.770
<v Speaker 1>he's not having babies of his own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he can't really get ahead by himself.</v>

2310
02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:23.273
<v Speaker 1>He gets ahead genetically speaking when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the town does well and he's in a </v>

2311
02:07:27.091 --> 02:07:27.924
<v Speaker 1>position to spot what's going wrong in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the town and he doesn't have a dog in </v>

2312
02:07:30.691 --> 02:07:32.640
<v Speaker 1>that fight because he's not involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

2313
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:36.240
<v Speaker 1>He's not involved in a meeting and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being a little salt</v>

2314
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:37.143
<v Speaker 3>relatively recent when it comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>catholic church in the last couple of </v>

2315
02:07:39.491 --> 02:07:40.324
<v Speaker 3>hundred dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would argue if you look back at </v>

2316
02:07:41.710 --> 02:07:42.543
<v Speaker 3>any of these traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of the ones that worked will </v>

2317
02:07:44.231 --> 02:07:45.064
<v Speaker 3>successfully have addressed the question</v>
<v Speaker 3>of how you prevent corruption from </v>

2318
02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:51.430
<v Speaker 3>emerging apparently was sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>corruption.</v>

2319
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:52.533
<v Speaker 3>These guys were rock stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the priests were essentially the </v>

2320
02:07:54.821 --> 02:07:55.654
<v Speaker 3>guys who had the direct line to god and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like professors have been known to </v>

2321
02:07:59.351 --> 02:08:00.184
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not you,</v>

2322
02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:01.293
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some have sex with their students </v>

2323
02:08:03.860 --> 02:08:05.860
<v Speaker 3>because the students like look at them </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2324
02:08:05.890 --> 02:08:06.723
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that professor sitting </v>

2325
02:08:08.321 --> 02:08:09.154
<v Speaker 3>down here with my work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very minor connection in </v>

2326
02:08:13.241 --> 02:08:14.074
<v Speaker 3>comparison to the connection to god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who's going to have anybody </v>

2327
02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:19.550
<v Speaker 3>who's going to have power is in danger </v>
<v Speaker 3>of abusing it.</v>

2328
02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's interesting that in the</v>

2329
02:08:22.961 --> 02:08:25.500
<v Speaker 3>catholic church and in other traditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

2330
02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:26.413
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a marriage and making money are </v>

2331
02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:34.510
<v Speaker 3>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these appear to be a evolved.</v>

2332
02:08:35.110 --> 02:08:36.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the word?</v>

2333
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2334
02:08:39.230 --> 02:08:42.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>error correction or,</v>

2335
02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:44.380
<v Speaker 3>or protection from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a virus.</v>

2336
02:08:44.381 --> 02:08:45.214
<v Speaker 3>So an outbreak of corruption in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>church is a bad thing from the point of </v>

2337
02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:52.090
<v Speaker 3>view of the wellbeing of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>congregation and a something that says,</v>

2338
02:08:52.091 --> 02:08:52.924
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a priest in your spending </v>

2339
02:08:53.861 --> 02:08:54.960
<v Speaker 3>money in town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are gonna,</v>

2340
02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:56.920
<v Speaker 3>look at you funny because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to have money.</v>

2341
02:08:57.250 --> 02:08:58.310
<v Speaker 3>And if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2342
02:08:58.510 --> 02:09:01.080
<v Speaker 3>hanging around with cute girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are gonna.</v>

2343
02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Look at you funny because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be havIng sex.</v>

2344
02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:08.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this limits their ability to get away</v>

2345
02:09:08.501 --> 02:09:09.970
<v Speaker 3>with stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sAying it's zero,</v>

2346
02:09:09.971 --> 02:09:10.804
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that there will be </v>

2347
02:09:11.981 --> 02:09:14.190
<v Speaker 3>protections in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2348
02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:15.093
<v Speaker 3>in each tradition for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that religions that don't successfully </v>

2349
02:09:18.791 --> 02:09:23.791
<v Speaker 3>protect against abuses of power will </v>
<v Speaker 3>succumb in competition to religions that</v>

2350
02:09:25.061 --> 02:09:25.894
<v Speaker 3>do it effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're absolutely correct that </v>

2351
02:09:29.021 --> 02:09:33.730
<v Speaker 3>all of the changes in religious texts </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people believe in those,</v>

2352
02:09:33.731 --> 02:09:34.564
<v Speaker 3>that's all human beings making decisions</v>
<v Speaker 3>about what to keep and what to throw </v>

2353
02:09:37.541 --> 02:09:37.990
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2354
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:41.200
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not arguing anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I am arguing as those that have</v>

2355
02:09:41.201 --> 02:09:42.034
<v Speaker 3>been insightful about what to keep from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the point of view of the particular </v>

2356
02:09:45.641 --> 02:09:48.580
<v Speaker 3>problems faced by the population that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are in,</v>

2357
02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:49.593
<v Speaker 3>we'll have a competitive advantage </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they will function more </v>

2358
02:09:52.991 --> 02:09:57.991
<v Speaker 3>cohesively than a population of atheists</v>
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't have somebody looking out to</v>

2359
02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:03.900
<v Speaker 3>prevent outbreaks of competition inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lineage or outbreaks of infighting.</v>

2360
02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:08.170
<v Speaker 3>So if you were looking at it in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective way,</v>

2361
02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:09.033
<v Speaker 3>like say if you were an alien from </v>
<v Speaker 3>another planet that didn't understand </v>

2362
02:10:11.351 --> 02:10:14.320
<v Speaker 3>the language and you just observing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

2363
02:10:14.530 --> 02:10:17.110
<v Speaker 3>you would see as error correction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the structure would say,</v>

2364
02:10:17.111 --> 02:10:17.944
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they realized there was an issue here </v>

2365
02:10:18.761 --> 02:10:19.594
<v Speaker 3>with power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they error corrected by making </v>

2366
02:10:21.581 --> 02:10:22.414
<v Speaker 3>these priests be celibate and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out a way to keep them from </v>

2367
02:10:25.541 --> 02:10:28.330
<v Speaker 3>having money and that'll keep them from </v>
<v Speaker 3>being invested in.</v>

2368
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:29.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2369
02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:30.753
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's very misleading to </v>

2370
02:10:32.261 --> 02:10:33.094
<v Speaker 3>people who analyze things the way you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would because there's so much </v>

2371
02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:40.730
<v Speaker 3>hocus pocus associated with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures that,</v>

2372
02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:43.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like constantly putting a finger in</v>

2373
02:10:43.281 --> 02:10:45.680
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the eye of an analytical person.</v>

2374
02:10:45.681 --> 02:10:46.311
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2375
02:10:46.311 --> 02:10:47.660
<v Speaker 3>just the way they dress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2376
02:10:47.661 --> 02:10:48.494
<v Speaker 3>I mean just the wearing the wizard </v>
<v Speaker 3>costume and holding the staff and </v>

2377
02:10:51.141 --> 02:10:54.020
<v Speaker 3>sitting on the golden throne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of it.</v>

2378
02:10:54.021 --> 02:10:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the pageantry to it.</v>

2379
02:10:55.521 --> 02:10:57.290
<v Speaker 3>It's all preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2380
02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:59.720
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking at it as a modern person,</v>

2381
02:10:59.750 --> 02:11:02.030
<v Speaker 3>it looks preposterous to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

2382
02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:04.430
<v Speaker 3>there is no way I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2383
02:11:04.431 --> 02:11:06.740
<v Speaker 3>most of my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure would disagree with this,</v>

2384
02:11:06.741 --> 02:11:08.400
<v Speaker 3>but I hope to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2385
02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:11.360
<v Speaker 3>to show them to be wrong on this front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2386
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:12.223
<v Speaker 3>there is no way that the huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>effort and resource that is invested in </v>

2387
02:11:17.751 --> 02:11:20.450
<v Speaker 3>these structures was an error.</v>

2388
02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Cannot have been an evolutionary error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if it was,</v>

2389
02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:25.273
<v Speaker 3>the huge investment that is put into </v>
<v Speaker 3>these structures is an opportunity for </v>

2390
02:11:29.541 --> 02:11:32.270
<v Speaker 3>some population that behaves in exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way.</v>

2391
02:11:32.271 --> 02:11:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Except it doesn't make that error to </v>
<v Speaker 3>win,</v>

2392
02:11:34.730 --> 02:11:37.250
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you get power and then you have</v>

2393
02:11:37.251 --> 02:11:38.084
<v Speaker 3>the momentum of that power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm overcoming the population and then </v>

2394
02:11:42.471 --> 02:11:43.304
<v Speaker 3>you have positions where the behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns are extremely restrictive and </v>

2395
02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:53.300
<v Speaker 3>you have to behave inside these behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns or there's grave consequences.</v>

2396
02:11:53.650 --> 02:11:54.483
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could conceivably run that for a </v>

2397
02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:58.880
<v Speaker 3>thousand years without any error </v>
<v Speaker 3>correction,</v>

2398
02:11:59.060 --> 02:12:01.010
<v Speaker 3>and that's what you've got with islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2399
02:12:01.011 --> 02:12:01.844
<v Speaker 3>You've got a very ancient form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion that michael shermer wrote a </v>

2400
02:12:06.441 --> 02:12:07.274
<v Speaker 3>piece about it that's pretty interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he was talking about how it's the </v>

2401
02:12:09.951 --> 02:12:10.784
<v Speaker 3>only religion that didn't go through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment and he makes these </v>

2402
02:12:13.521 --> 02:12:14.354
<v Speaker 3>comparisons to like the corrections that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been had with other religions as </v>

2403
02:12:18.981 --> 02:12:21.440
<v Speaker 3>time has gone on that haven't happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2404
02:12:21.441 --> 02:12:23.750
<v Speaker 3>and you could equate it to resource </v>
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>

2405
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:26.660
<v Speaker 3>You could equate it to the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world in which they live.</v>

2406
02:12:26.661 --> 02:12:28.790
<v Speaker 3>You could equate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of different ways that you</v>

2407
02:12:28.791 --> 02:12:30.650
<v Speaker 3>could try to figure out why this </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

2408
02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:34.610
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is that that thing has </v>
<v Speaker 3>not changed.</v>

2409
02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:37.340
<v Speaker 3>That structure has not changed for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

2410
02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:41.780
<v Speaker 3>I think you've hit on exactly the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

2411
02:12:42.170 --> 02:12:47.170
<v Speaker 3>M islams mechanism for preventing </v>
<v Speaker 3>outbreaks of chain parasitism was to,</v>

2412
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:56.290
<v Speaker 3>to hard code the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a tragedy because it,</v>

2413
02:12:56.450 --> 02:12:57.283
<v Speaker 3>what it means is that where islam needs </v>
<v Speaker 3>to update it doesn't have the mechanism </v>

2414
02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:02.300
<v Speaker 3>for doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2415
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:03.583
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also has a built in way to keep </v>

2416
02:13:06.651 --> 02:13:07.484
<v Speaker 3>people aboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you become an apostate that </v>

2417
02:13:09.411 --> 02:13:10.910
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kill them.</v>

2418
02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And kill apostates which is,</v>

2419
02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:15.530
<v Speaker 3>there is no other religion that we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now that operates like,</v>

2420
02:13:15.531 --> 02:13:18.980
<v Speaker 3>that has draconian imagines of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology.</v>

2421
02:13:18.981 --> 02:13:20.960
<v Speaker 3>Did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2422
02:13:20.961 --> 02:13:21.794
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean scientology obviously has a huge </v>

2423
02:13:23.391 --> 02:13:26.390
<v Speaker 3>number of completely unacceptable </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanisms to keep people from leaving,</v>

2424
02:13:26.490 --> 02:13:27.323
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how is that not a cult since it was </v>

2425
02:13:28.671 --> 02:13:31.920
<v Speaker 3>created by a science fiction writer </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally</v>

2426
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:33.600
<v Speaker 2>out of nowhere.</v>

2427
02:13:33.690 --> 02:13:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be horrified if I said it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't too early to tell.</v>

2428
02:13:38.770 --> 02:13:40.470
<v Speaker 1>So how is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2429
02:13:40.650 --> 02:13:41.420
<v Speaker 1>So that could be</v>

2430
02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:42.253
<v Speaker 2>benefits in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If scientology continues to evolve and </v>

2431
02:13:45.111 --> 02:13:45.944
<v Speaker 2>self self-correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could get to the point where it's a </v>

2432
02:13:47.871 --> 02:13:48.704
<v Speaker 2>behavior pattern that could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>complimentary and perhaps even </v>

2433
02:13:52.311 --> 02:13:53.480
<v Speaker 2>beneficial to people.</v>

2434
02:13:53.660 --> 02:13:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe that this is where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is headed.</v>

2435
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:56.743
<v Speaker 1>But if a thousand years from now it had </v>
<v Speaker 1>flourished and the population that </v>

2436
02:14:03.111 --> 02:14:08.030
<v Speaker 1>believed these things was successfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing,</v>

2437
02:14:08.031 --> 02:14:08.870
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2438
02:14:08.871 --> 02:14:10.160
<v Speaker 1>there's something in that set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>

2439
02:14:10.161 --> 02:14:11.780
<v Speaker 1>It's working for these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2440
02:14:12.230 --> 02:14:13.063
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not arguing that it isn't the </v>

2441
02:14:14.771 --> 02:14:15.604
<v Speaker 1>called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has lots of hallmarks that make me </v>

2442
02:14:17.181 --> 02:14:18.014
<v Speaker 1>think</v>

2443
02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm troubled by including much like </v>
<v Speaker 2>mormonism.</v>

2444
02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:22.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who made it,</v>

2445
02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:24.340
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike mormonism,</v>

2446
02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:27.430
<v Speaker 2>which was an 1820,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have video,</v>

2447
02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:29.110
<v Speaker 2>we see l,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ron hubbard,</v>

2448
02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:32.060
<v Speaker 2>bad teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his fucking captain's outfit on with</v>

2449
02:14:32.061 --> 02:14:33.570
<v Speaker 2>a metals that he gave himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

2450
02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:35.620
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

2451
02:14:35.710 --> 02:14:36.431
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2452
02:14:36.431 --> 02:14:36.881
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2453
02:14:36.881 --> 02:14:38.430
<v Speaker 2>you get a planet when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or</v>

2454
02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:40.350
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a cult to me.</v>

2455
02:14:40.351 --> 02:14:41.280
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2456
02:14:41.281 --> 02:14:42.114
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got the mormons get a planet when </v>

2457
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:47.940
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry scientologists don't get a planet.</v>

2458
02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:48.491
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2459
02:14:48.491 --> 02:14:49.324
<v Speaker 2>The mormons do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was one of the osman brothers </v>

2460
02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:55.690
<v Speaker 2>albums,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all went to these planets.</v>

2461
02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Like in the album,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the album is.</v>

2462
02:14:58.300 --> 02:15:00.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a hilarious album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you open it up,</v>

2463
02:15:00.491 --> 02:15:03.580
<v Speaker 2>it's all planets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the album,</v>

2464
02:15:03.581 --> 02:15:08.470
<v Speaker 2>the name of the album is this concept </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you get a planet when you die</v>

2465
02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:13.530
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the universe is so big,</v>

2466
02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:14.710
<v Speaker 1>we can each afforded.</v>

2467
02:15:15.070 --> 02:15:17.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2468
02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:20.620
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is some joseph smith's shit,</v>

2469
02:15:21.190 --> 02:15:23.530
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wonderful book.</v>

2470
02:15:23.550 --> 02:15:24.670
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read the,</v>

2471
02:15:24.671 --> 02:15:27.610
<v Speaker 2>the actual origins of mormonism people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are listening to go,</v>

2472
02:15:27.611 --> 02:15:28.660
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they believe?</v>

2473
02:15:29.170 --> 02:15:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe some wacky stuff.</v>

2474
02:15:31.090 --> 02:15:32.200
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2475
02:15:32.201 --> 02:15:33.034
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a golden or a seer stone rather </v>

2476
02:15:35.950 --> 02:15:38.320
<v Speaker 2>that allowed him to read the golden </v>
<v Speaker 2>tablets.</v>

2477
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:39.303
<v Speaker 2>The seer stone was a special magic rock </v>
<v Speaker 2>that allowed him to read these golden </v>

2478
02:15:43.091 --> 02:15:45.070
<v Speaker 2>tablets that contained the last work of </v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus.</v>

2479
02:15:45.250 --> 02:15:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Is that the inside of the album with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other planets?</v>

2480
02:15:47.170 --> 02:15:50.350
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was actually illiterate.</v>

2481
02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And that was a con man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was murdered,</v>

2482
02:15:52.841 --> 02:15:53.674
<v Speaker 1>put a sheet over his head and dictated </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was supposedly reading to </v>

2483
02:15:57.131 --> 02:15:59.290
<v Speaker 1>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my understanding of it.</v>

2484
02:15:59.291 --> 02:16:00.124
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2485
02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:04.120
<v Speaker 1>it was a charismatic person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many people have created cults.</v>

2486
02:16:04.121 --> 02:16:04.954
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

2487
02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:08.153
<v Speaker 2>I think what they did right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mormons are some of the nicest people </v>

2488
02:16:10.571 --> 02:16:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have an amazing sense of community.</v>

2489
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:16.210
<v Speaker 2>They're super nice and I've always said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if I was going to join a cult,</v>

2490
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:17.223
<v Speaker 2>I think I joined the mormons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where they fucked up is they </v>

2491
02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:23.680
<v Speaker 2>regulations came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started restricting the market.</v>

2492
02:16:24.010 --> 02:16:24.843
<v Speaker 2>They started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regulators came in and stop these </v>

2493
02:16:26.261 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 2>people from having nine wives and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be so nice anymore.</v>

2494
02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:31.413
<v Speaker 3>The reason why they were so nice is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they have these crazy </v>

2495
02:16:33.431 --> 02:16:34.264
<v Speaker 3>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were having orgies every night at </v>

2496
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:38.650
<v Speaker 3>nine people living in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they allowed to have sex with.</v>

2497
02:16:38.651 --> 02:16:43.030
<v Speaker 3>It was a problem with your day because </v>
<v Speaker 3>for everybody who had nine wives,</v>

2498
02:16:43.031 --> 02:16:43.864
<v Speaker 3>they were eight dudes who had not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys got to get their shit </v>

2499
02:16:46.121 --> 02:16:49.390
<v Speaker 3>together and start their own call on gas</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you know,</v>

2500
02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:50.440
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they are gay.</v>

2501
02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2502
02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:53.570
<v Speaker 3>what about the women too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2503
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:56.200
<v Speaker 3>How about a woman who has 10 husbands?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2504
02:16:56.340 --> 02:16:58.210
<v Speaker 3>this is bullshit for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't happen.</v>

2505
02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:01.180
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should right now be possible.</v>

2506
02:17:01.210 --> 02:17:01.601
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2507
02:17:01.601 --> 02:17:03.250
<v Speaker 3>See there's a really good biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

2508
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.720
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you already.</v>

2509
02:17:07.530 --> 02:17:08.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

2510
02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:10.750
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go polyandrous on me.</v>

2511
02:17:10.751 --> 02:17:11.584
<v Speaker 3>He went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went way far away from our original </v>

2512
02:17:13.751 --> 02:17:14.770
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

2513
02:17:14.771 --> 02:17:15.604
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could figure out a way to </v>

2514
02:17:17.171 --> 02:17:19.490
<v Speaker 3>restructure with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2515
02:17:20.470 --> 02:17:22.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to call it plan b because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the abortion</v>

2516
02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:23.433
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be.</v>

2517
02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2518
02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say it.</v>

2519
02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:27.940
<v Speaker 1>There is no game b at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2520
02:17:27.941 --> 02:17:28.774
<v Speaker 1>There is a conversation that emerged </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this and the basic point is that </v>

2521
02:17:31.930 --> 02:17:32.763
<v Speaker 1>one constructure a superior deal to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are able to work out for </v>

2522
02:17:37.481 --> 02:17:42.481
<v Speaker 1>themselves and it can function inside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system and it can gain adherence for</v>

2523
02:17:43.751 --> 02:17:44.584
<v Speaker 1>the very same reason that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying bitcoin for the same reason that </v>

2524
02:17:47.951 --> 02:17:48.784
<v Speaker 1>people have decided to get smartphones </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the same reason people have signed </v>

2525
02:17:52.481 --> 02:17:54.490
<v Speaker 1>up for facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>

2526
02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:56.493
<v Speaker 1>with the exception of bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are game examples and they are </v>

2527
02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:05.110
<v Speaker 1>predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could provide a version that was</v>

2528
02:18:05.111 --> 02:18:05.944
<v Speaker 1>not predatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would function in a superior way </v>

2529
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:10.750
<v Speaker 1>with respect to how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2530
02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:15.460
<v Speaker 1>how it enhanced your ability to function</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and rational people.</v>

2531
02:18:15.461 --> 02:18:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2532
02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:16.893
<v Speaker 1>you make a good point.</v>

2533
02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:18.273
<v Speaker 1>It's not that we have billions of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are sophisticated enough to know </v>

2534
02:18:22.451 --> 02:18:25.300
<v Speaker 1>that they should be looking for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative and who will jump on it.</v>

2535
02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:30.480
<v Speaker 1>But to the extent that you have people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are sophisticated,</v>

2536
02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:34.510
<v Speaker 1>are aware that their lives are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupted by forces.</v>

2537
02:18:34.511 --> 02:18:39.511
<v Speaker 1>That they're incapable of managing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>these dopamine traps and the like,</v>

2538
02:18:40.050 --> 02:18:42.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who will embrace these technologies?</v>

2539
02:18:42.641 --> 02:18:43.474
<v Speaker 1>Because they themselves are looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mechanism to insulate from the </v>

2540
02:18:46.810 --> 02:18:49.360
<v Speaker 1>predatory things that have emerged in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the market.</v>

2541
02:18:49.570 --> 02:18:50.403
<v Speaker 1>What You will get is the spread of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies and if there's one sort of </v>

2542
02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:55.893
<v Speaker 1>key message here about all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objections that one might raise about </v>

2543
02:18:58.901 --> 02:18:59.734
<v Speaker 1>the difficulty of creating such </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternatives and getting them to be </v>

2544
02:19:03.461 --> 02:19:04.294
<v Speaker 1>adopted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of things that we have </v>

2545
02:19:06.311 --> 02:19:07.144
<v Speaker 1>already adopted because we got something</v>
<v Speaker 1>for her cell phone being the perfect </v>

2546
02:19:10.961 --> 02:19:11.794
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have to tell people to get a </v>

2547
02:19:13.481 --> 02:19:14.230
<v Speaker 1>cell phone.</v>

2548
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:15.063
<v Speaker 1>People got a cell phone because of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that they could see that it </v>

2549
02:19:17.111 --> 02:19:17.944
<v Speaker 1>did for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that same drive to pick up some new </v>

2550
02:19:22.750 --> 02:19:26.380
<v Speaker 1>technology or agreement because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhances your life.</v>

2551
02:19:26.381 --> 02:19:29.480
<v Speaker 1>It solves some problem for you in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that's good.</v>

2552
02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:33.800
<v Speaker 1>That causes the thing to be adopted out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of self interest and that,</v>

2553
02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:38.540
<v Speaker 1>that is what the mechanism for change is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to look like.</v>

2554
02:19:38.630 --> 02:19:43.630
<v Speaker 1>His self interest causing people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace a shift in the,</v>

2555
02:19:44.190 --> 02:19:45.023
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunities and obligations that </v>

2556
02:19:46.971 --> 02:19:49.160
<v Speaker 1>they're signed up for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2557
02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the problems that I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this is that,</v>

2558
02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:53.823
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always assumed that this is going to </v>

2559
02:19:55.311 --> 02:19:58.910
<v Speaker 1>be like on january the first we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>switching over to the new system,</v>

2560
02:19:58.970 --> 02:20:00.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't be camp,</v>

2561
02:20:00.801 --> 02:20:01.634
<v Speaker 1>can't be a ba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be almost like a natural </v>

2562
02:20:04.850 --> 02:20:09.850
<v Speaker 1>chain of events or it has to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>water flowing down hill.</v>

2563
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:11.473
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can speak scientifically about my </v>

2564
02:20:14.991 --> 02:20:17.020
<v Speaker 1>own field because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2565
02:20:17.070 --> 02:20:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did enough training that I,</v>

2566
02:20:18.810 --> 02:20:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know where the bodies are buried.</v>

2567
02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:25.520
<v Speaker 1>When you're in a field and that field is</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck,</v>

2568
02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:27.253
<v Speaker 1>it is impossible to move the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get a hearing that will allow </v>

2569
02:20:31.491 --> 02:20:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you to change the way the field thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can step outside the field.</v>

2570
02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:41.030
<v Speaker 1>You can leave the reservation as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

2571
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:44.280
<v Speaker 1>and you can proceed by other means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

2572
02:20:44.570 --> 02:20:46.670
<v Speaker 1>what happens is the same thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2573
02:20:46.671 --> 02:20:47.504
<v Speaker 1>lars anderson discovered with archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that once you're no longer signed up </v>

2574
02:20:51.531 --> 02:20:52.364
<v Speaker 1>for what good form looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are all kinds of ways to </v>

2575
02:20:55.431 --> 02:20:59.570
<v Speaker 1>accomplish things that are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>documented.</v>

2576
02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:05.020
<v Speaker 1>And so finding those alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay may is not serving people's needs.</v>

2577
02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:09.230
<v Speaker 1>We are all unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2578
02:21:09.250 --> 02:21:11.780
<v Speaker 1>even if we find a way to be physically </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

2579
02:21:11.781 --> 02:21:12.614
<v Speaker 1>we are all overwhelmed by so much social</v>
<v Speaker 1>noise and so much a choice that is </v>

2580
02:21:19.251 --> 02:21:20.084
<v Speaker 1>meaningless that we end up wasting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge fraction of our time spending a </v>

2581
02:21:24.021 --> 02:21:24.854
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of our mental effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>on puzzles that aren't interesting or </v>

2582
02:21:27.981 --> 02:21:29.360
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile or productive.</v>

2583
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:30.583
<v Speaker 1>and so we are all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of us has a giant opportunity to </v>

2584
02:21:34.671 --> 02:21:35.504
<v Speaker 1>upgrade our lives by simply removing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of the noise by getting the </v>

2585
02:21:40.251 --> 02:21:44.480
<v Speaker 1>systems that are supposed to function in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our interest to do so more effectively.</v>

2586
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:48.470
<v Speaker 1>And therefore we are a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to use the word consumers,</v>

2587
02:21:48.471 --> 02:21:49.304
<v Speaker 1>but we would be willing consumers for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better alternative or to show up for us </v>

2588
02:21:53.420 --> 02:21:57.680
<v Speaker 1>and presenting that alternative so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people find it,</v>

2589
02:21:57.890 --> 02:22:00.710
<v Speaker 1>they experiment with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And upon discovering that actually,</v>

2590
02:22:00.711 --> 02:22:01.544
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am better off when I participate in </v>

2591
02:22:03.711 --> 02:22:06.350
<v Speaker 1>this way than that way that that causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>adoption.</v>

2592
02:22:06.470 --> 02:22:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't take very many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2593
02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:11.540
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin obviously started with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2594
02:22:11.810 --> 02:22:14.990
<v Speaker 1>an ambitious person who set the thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>motion,</v>

2595
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:17.690
<v Speaker 1>what's the currency with only one person</v>
<v Speaker 1>using it,</v>

2596
02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:19.153
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now it's not a currency with one </v>

2597
02:22:20.751 --> 02:22:21.530
<v Speaker 1>person using it.</v>

2598
02:22:21.530 --> 02:22:23.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've used it.</v>

2599
02:22:23.151 --> 02:22:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I've used it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2600
02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:25.293
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is possible to get adoption based on </v>

2601
02:22:27.091 --> 02:22:30.930
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the thing solves problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are otherwise stuck with.</v>

2602
02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that because things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving so quickly today,</v>

2603
02:22:33.811 --> 02:22:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that like new ideas are </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented so fast.</v>

2604
02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:38.153
<v Speaker 1>New concepts are accepted so quickly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that something like this where it </v>

2605
02:22:41.611 --> 02:22:45.480
<v Speaker 1>might've taken several decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few decades ago,</v>

2606
02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:49.320
<v Speaker 1>would only take a few years today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2607
02:22:49.480 --> 02:22:51.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it become a thing.</v>

2608
02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:53.160
<v Speaker 1>There are two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2609
02:22:53.370 --> 02:22:54.203
<v Speaker 1>there is the possibility that things </v>
<v Speaker 1>will change very rapidly and then there </v>

2610
02:22:56.731 --> 02:23:00.750
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that they must,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the trajectory we're on,</v>

2611
02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:02.323
<v Speaker 1>we are playing with such powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies and being operated at such </v>

2612
02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:11.000
<v Speaker 1>a high rate with such high throughput </v>
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

2613
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:13.320
<v Speaker 1>those of us who have started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2614
02:23:13.410 --> 02:23:14.243
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a mistake to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems of the world as individual </v>

2615
02:23:17.371 --> 02:23:17.790
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

2616
02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:18.623
<v Speaker 1>It's much more effective to look at them</v>
<v Speaker 1>as symptoms of problems that don't have </v>

2617
02:23:22.951 --> 02:23:23.784
<v Speaker 1>names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have an economic system that </v>

2618
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:28.463
<v Speaker 1>generates technologies that create great</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits in the short term at some </v>

2619
02:23:32.851 --> 02:23:36.420
<v Speaker 1>massive cost in the long term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have no mechanism.</v>

2620
02:23:36.421 --> 02:23:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Once they've generated massive profits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no ability to shut them off,</v>

2621
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:42.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem that has many,</v>

2622
02:23:42.121 --> 02:23:44.360
<v Speaker 1>many symptoms that we could name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2623
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:49.410
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we in effect don't have much time.</v>

2624
02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:50.453
<v Speaker 1>That the rate at which we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquidating the wellbeing of the planet </v>

2625
02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:58.590
<v Speaker 1>at present is so fast that effectively </v>
<v Speaker 1>we need,</v>

2626
02:23:58.980 --> 02:24:00.870
<v Speaker 1>we need to change quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And It doesn't mean.</v>

2627
02:24:01.710 --> 02:24:02.543
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's the other thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't said yet is nobody including me </v>

2628
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.983
<v Speaker 1>thinks that we're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spell out an answer in the present that </v>

2629
02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:11.273
<v Speaker 1>is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we can do is navigate in the </v>

2630
02:24:15.391 --> 02:24:16.224
<v Speaker 1>direction of the answer that is correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can discover what that answer </v>

2631
02:24:19.471 --> 02:24:20.130
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>

2632
02:24:20.130 --> 02:24:20.963
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right model is not the writing down </v>

2633
02:24:24.991 --> 02:24:25.824
<v Speaker 1>of the new rules of the world and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace of them because you get </v>

2634
02:24:29.581 --> 02:24:33.540
<v Speaker 1>benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is prototyping what the new structure</v>

2635
02:24:33.541 --> 02:24:34.374
<v Speaker 1>would be and then you institute the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prototype and some group of people who </v>

2636
02:24:38.191 --> 02:24:39.024
<v Speaker 1>have signed up for it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover what you didn't know about it </v>

2637
02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:42.353
<v Speaker 1>that you needed to know and you correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>those problems so that what you get is </v>

2638
02:24:45.481 --> 02:24:50.481
<v Speaker 1>effectively evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Building an elegant solution rather than</v>

2639
02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:54.840
<v Speaker 1>what progressives often accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>invite,</v>

2640
02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:55.913
<v Speaker 1>which is good intentions that produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrifying outcomes because you didn't </v>

2641
02:25:00.301 --> 02:25:02.880
<v Speaker 1>know what they were actually going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you set them in motion.</v>

2642
02:25:03.170 --> 02:25:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Communism being a great example,</v>

2643
02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:07.890
<v Speaker 1>you think communism is going to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problems of the world.</v>

2644
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:09.180
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it creates,</v>

2645
02:25:10.130 --> 02:25:10.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive harm and kills millions because </v>

2646
02:25:16.441 --> 02:25:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you didn't understand what it would do </v>
<v Speaker 1>in motion.</v>

2647
02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:21.060
<v Speaker 1>So we don't want to ever face that </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2648
02:25:21.061 --> 02:25:25.990
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to be utopians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you engage in utopianism,</v>

2649
02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:28.570
<v Speaker 1>if you set it in motion and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create a dystopia,</v>

2650
02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:29.433
<v Speaker 1>it's virtually guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way to avoid that is not to imagine </v>

2651
02:25:32.861 --> 02:25:33.191
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2652
02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:34.024
<v Speaker 1>the answer gets to define what objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want the system to reach and then </v>

2653
02:25:39.610 --> 02:25:41.110
<v Speaker 1>navigate towards it.</v>

2654
02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:45.313
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you think this could be </v>

2655
02:25:46.001 --> 02:25:47.770
<v Speaker 1>implemented?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2656
02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:51.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires capital frankly,</v>

2657
02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:57.180
<v Speaker 1>and it requires capital and people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what the problems are.</v>

2658
02:25:58.060 --> 02:25:58.893
<v Speaker 1>Most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires people who understand game </v>

2659
02:26:03.041 --> 02:26:03.874
<v Speaker 1>theory because what we keep doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting systems in motion that have the </v>

2660
02:26:09.761 --> 02:26:12.880
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that guarantee </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

2661
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:14.703
<v Speaker 1>There are only four of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you set a system in motion that </v>

2662
02:26:16.901 --> 02:26:20.560
<v Speaker 1>has those four characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will get adaptive evolution and what</v>

2663
02:26:20.561 --> 02:26:22.800
<v Speaker 1>it will produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no control over it.</v>

2664
02:26:22.801 --> 02:26:25.610
<v Speaker 1>It will produce whatever the niche space</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows.</v>

2665
02:26:26.010 --> 02:26:26.843
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you need people who are aware of the </v>

2666
02:26:30.491 --> 02:26:34.900
<v Speaker 1>game theoretic parameters of the space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who understand,</v>

2667
02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:40.600
<v Speaker 1>essentially the game theory is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important topic.</v>

2668
02:26:41.020 --> 02:26:41.853
<v Speaker 1>It's less complicated than people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There aren't as many games as you would </v>

2669
02:26:44.231 --> 02:26:45.064
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a few canonical ones and then </v>

2670
02:26:46.571 --> 02:26:47.404
<v Speaker 1>there a bunch of variations on a theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but understanding those things so that </v>

2671
02:26:51.281 --> 02:26:52.114
<v Speaker 1>you can use so you can effectively </v>
<v Speaker 1>harness the power of evolution to build </v>

2672
02:26:57.101 --> 02:26:57.934
<v Speaker 1>a functional system rather than build a </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and then suffer the consequences </v>

2673
02:27:02.891 --> 02:27:04.750
<v Speaker 1>of evolution that you didn't anticipate.</v>

2674
02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:05.613
<v Speaker 1>That's what we keep doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We built an economY and a political </v>

2675
02:27:07.901 --> 02:27:08.734
<v Speaker 1>system that evolve out from under us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they create monstrous phenomena that we </v>

2676
02:27:14.171 --> 02:27:16.060
<v Speaker 1>didn't anticipate because they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the plan.</v>

2677
02:27:16.510 --> 02:27:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that it's possible that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the radical change?</v>

2678
02:27:20.890 --> 02:27:21.723
<v Speaker 1>The social change has happened just over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last couple months since the harvey </v>

2679
02:27:24.581 --> 02:27:28.630
<v Speaker 1>weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see what's happened?</v>

2680
02:27:28.631 --> 02:27:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean it literally is probably stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual harassment dead in his tracks.</v>

2681
02:27:33.940 --> 02:27:34.773
<v Speaker 1>Women who work in these workplaces that </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to deal with the consequences of </v>

2682
02:27:37.781 --> 02:27:38.614
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of those sexual harassment </v>

2683
02:27:41.291 --> 02:27:44.620
<v Speaker 1>episodes is probably been radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced like that.</v>

2684
02:27:44.650 --> 02:27:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it temporary though?</v>

2685
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

2686
02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:48.333
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because my only concern is that </v>

2687
02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:55.353
<v Speaker 1>with false accusations or overreactions </v>
<v Speaker 1>or people that are just not treating </v>

2688
02:28:01.871 --> 02:28:02.704
<v Speaker 1>this like the incredibly powerful medium</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is the medium for change and </v>

2689
02:28:08.171 --> 02:28:09.004
<v Speaker 1>then using it to their own benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people could get greedy and corrupt </v>

2690
02:28:11.621 --> 02:28:12.730
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2691
02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:15.190
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's already happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2692
02:28:15.430 --> 02:28:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2693
02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:17.940
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2694
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:19.090
<v Speaker 1>A couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2695
02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like every other man,</v>

2696
02:28:22.431 --> 02:28:23.264
<v Speaker 1>I am hesitant to put my weight on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice with anybody because who knows what </v>

2697
02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:27.200
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2698
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:32.410
<v Speaker 1>But I've seen several stories now that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>find very disturbing.</v>

2699
02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:34.490
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I must say,</v>

2700
02:28:34.491 --> 02:28:37.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a topic of conversation with me</v>

2701
02:28:37.281 --> 02:28:38.114
<v Speaker 1>and my friends is I'm guessing it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been with you and your friends and </v>

2702
02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:42.573
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2703
02:28:43.730 --> 02:28:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I feel weird saying this on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

2704
02:28:45.421 --> 02:28:46.440
<v Speaker 1>but herod comes,</v>

2705
02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:54.270
<v Speaker 1>my friends and I have discussed this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a kind of reaction which was,</v>

2706
02:28:55.050 --> 02:28:55.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to have been a really good </v>

2707
02:28:58.681 --> 02:29:01.740
<v Speaker 1>decision never to grope anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't into it.</v>

2708
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2709
02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:05.280
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2710
02:29:05.281 --> 02:29:07.380
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the reason that we didn't grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>up anybody,</v>

2711
02:29:07.381 --> 02:29:08.214
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless it turns out to have </v>

2712
02:29:11.461 --> 02:29:12.294
<v Speaker 1>been a benefit that we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not worried about what's gonna </v>

2713
02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:15.560
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2714
02:29:16.350 --> 02:29:17.183
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw this garrison keillor </v>

2715
02:29:18.901 --> 02:29:19.760
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2716
02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And suddenly I didn't feel so safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore because it's in keilor.</v>

2717
02:29:23.131 --> 02:29:26.040
<v Speaker 1>One is the most disturbing one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not actually,</v>

2718
02:29:26.041 --> 02:29:27.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2719
02:29:28.110 --> 02:29:30.150
<v Speaker 1>there's one more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a worse one.</v>

2720
02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Tell everybody that garrison keillor </v>
<v Speaker 1>story story.</v>

2721
02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:34.980
<v Speaker 1>So by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing we have,</v>

2722
02:29:34.981 --> 02:29:35.814
<v Speaker 1>so he was fired from a Minnesota public </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio is radio program was not only </v>

2723
02:29:40.650 --> 02:29:44.760
<v Speaker 1>renamed but the old ones were </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

2724
02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:45.593
<v Speaker 1>And mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a damn about garrison </v>

2725
02:29:46.531 --> 02:29:47.970
<v Speaker 1>keillor's radio program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2726
02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:53.010
<v Speaker 1>But the only thing we have as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation is his own account.</v>

2727
02:29:53.490 --> 02:29:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there another side of the story?</v>

2728
02:29:56.311 --> 02:29:57.144
<v Speaker 1>I can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I must say the account had the ring </v>

2729
02:29:59.161 --> 02:30:04.050
<v Speaker 1>of truth to it because it would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been very devastating if some compelling</v>

2730
02:30:04.110 --> 02:30:04.943
<v Speaker 1>counter narrative that emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the story he told was that he had </v>

2731
02:30:08.371 --> 02:30:10.890
<v Speaker 1>been comforting a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she may have lost somebody.</v>

2732
02:30:11.330 --> 02:30:14.880
<v Speaker 1>He had been comforting a woman and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had leaned in,</v>

2733
02:30:14.881 --> 02:30:15.714
<v Speaker 1>I guess to hug her and put his hand on </v>
<v Speaker 1>her back and he said to her shirt was </v>

2734
02:30:20.911 --> 02:30:21.744
<v Speaker 1>open and he touched her back and he said</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hand went up about six inches that </v>

2735
02:30:26.431 --> 02:30:30.180
<v Speaker 1>she recoiled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He apologized in the moment.</v>

2736
02:30:30.660 --> 02:30:33.750
<v Speaker 1>He then sent her an email apologizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

2737
02:30:33.870 --> 02:30:34.800
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>

2738
02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:35.633
<v Speaker 1>It's not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that he and she were </v>

2739
02:30:39.031 --> 02:30:44.031
<v Speaker 1>friendly until he got a contact from her</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers and how long after the event was</v>

2740
02:30:45.931 --> 02:30:46.764
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't say,</v>

2741
02:30:47.460 --> 02:30:50.970
<v Speaker 1>but my feeling is let's take the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible interpretation,</v>

2742
02:30:50.971 --> 02:30:53.980
<v Speaker 1>the least generous to keilor </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of this.</v>

2743
02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Groped her a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2744
02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he lost his place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2745
02:30:57.631 --> 02:31:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just leaned in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He leaned in for a moment.</v>

2746
02:31:01.141 --> 02:31:05.400
<v Speaker 1>He had a sexual thought or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You touched her back and then you know,</v>

2747
02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:08.550
<v Speaker 1>he did what he should've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just apologized.</v>

2748
02:31:08.970 --> 02:31:11.580
<v Speaker 1>She accepted the apology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He still felt bad about it.</v>

2749
02:31:11.581 --> 02:31:14.300
<v Speaker 1>He apologized again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

2750
02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:15.970
<v Speaker 1>just a back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2751
02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:18.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just batching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

2752
02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:19.343
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying zero in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that the guy's entire </v>

2753
02:31:21.781 --> 02:31:26.781
<v Speaker 1>career is being erased from the radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>archives because of this one story.</v>

2754
02:31:28.380 --> 02:31:29.490
<v Speaker 1>If there's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more,</v>

2755
02:31:29.491 --> 02:31:31.680
<v Speaker 1>But if there ain't more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really disturbing.</v>

2756
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:35.240
<v Speaker 2>This would not have happened if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't for like harvey weinstein,</v>

2757
02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:40.600
<v Speaker 2>harvey weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's his actions were so disgusting and</v>

2758
02:31:41.301 --> 02:31:42.134
<v Speaker 2>so egregious and so numerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so despicable that it went so far this </v>

2759
02:31:46.611 --> 02:31:51.611
<v Speaker 2>way that anything even remotely gross </v>
<v Speaker 2>got shifted into that category.</v>

2760
02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Like into the kevin spacey category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin spacey's grabbing dixon</v>

2761
02:31:59.590 --> 02:32:00.423
<v Speaker 1>for now until our story came out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same day of the garrison keillor story </v>

2762
02:32:03.591 --> 02:32:06.920
<v Speaker 1>and that one is truly disturbing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really just,</v>

2763
02:32:07.540 --> 02:32:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape presumably legally,</v>

2764
02:32:12.141 --> 02:32:15.170
<v Speaker 1>but even if it wasn't what is described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2765
02:32:15.171 --> 02:32:17.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a believer in due process.</v>

2766
02:32:17.391 --> 02:32:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I thought I just had affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2767
02:32:19.611 --> 02:32:20.031
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2768
02:32:20.031 --> 02:32:22.880
<v Speaker 1>There's really disturbing stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>including him.</v>

2769
02:32:23.090 --> 02:32:23.923
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a little cautious about </v>

2770
02:32:25.401 --> 02:32:27.420
<v Speaker 1>this business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about him having a button under.</v>

2771
02:32:27.450 --> 02:32:29.750
<v Speaker 1>They all have buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really common thing.</v>

2772
02:32:29.751 --> 02:32:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And nbc it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2773
02:32:30.941 --> 02:32:31.774
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2774
02:32:32.180 --> 02:32:32.571
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2775
02:32:32.571 --> 02:32:34.640
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem with these chrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the story,</v>

2776
02:32:34.730 --> 02:32:37.700
<v Speaker 1>but also it's not something you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go into and start reading.</v>

2777
02:32:37.701 --> 02:32:38.534
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're gross is gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say there was one story </v>

2778
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:45.380
<v Speaker 1>whether that button is a commonplace </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's been misinterpreted.</v>

2779
02:32:45.381 --> 02:32:46.214
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is some story in which some </v>

2780
02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:52.640
<v Speaker 1>woman came into his office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had her bend over his desk,</v>

2781
02:32:53.480 --> 02:32:54.313
<v Speaker 1>he had sex with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she fainted and he had his assistant </v>

2782
02:32:58.071 --> 02:32:59.570
<v Speaker 1>take her to the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

2783
02:33:00.470 --> 02:33:02.860
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2784
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:05.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now,</v>

2785
02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:07.640
<v Speaker 1>because I can't establish that any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff is true,</v>

2786
02:33:07.641 --> 02:33:08.474
<v Speaker 1>but I will say that killer story doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound like the loudest or it doesn't </v>

2787
02:33:11.061 --> 02:33:14.180
<v Speaker 1>sound like the harvey weinstein story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2788
02:33:14.181 --> 02:33:15.440
<v Speaker 1>or kevin spacey</v>

2789
02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:16.680
<v Speaker 2>like al franken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

2790
02:33:16.681 --> 02:33:19.650
<v Speaker 2>one of the women said that he grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 2>her waist,</v>

2791
02:33:19.651 --> 02:33:20.484
<v Speaker 2>he squoze the fat around her waist when </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was disturbed because even her </v>

2792
02:33:25.711 --> 02:33:28.410
<v Speaker 2>husband is not allowed to touch her like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in public.</v>

2793
02:33:28.730 --> 02:33:29.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to come back to al franken </v>

2794
02:33:30.201 --> 02:33:31.034
<v Speaker 1>separately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe we need a very separate </v>

2795
02:33:32.091 --> 02:33:33.430
<v Speaker 1>category for franken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2796
02:33:33.790 --> 02:33:34.623
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to tell you what was worse </v>

2797
02:33:35.451 --> 02:33:37.310
<v Speaker 1>than the keeler story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

2798
02:33:37.970 --> 02:33:41.060
<v Speaker 1>So the killer story is disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I heard that one,</v>

2799
02:33:41.061 --> 02:33:41.894
<v Speaker 1>suddenly my feeling of safety based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I haven't grown up to </v>

2800
02:33:45.501 --> 02:33:46.334
<v Speaker 1>anybody who didn't want to be groped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vanished because suddenly it was open </v>

2801
02:33:50.121 --> 02:33:51.550
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2802
02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:57.320
<v Speaker 1>but the story that disturbs me even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the matt taibbi story.</v>

2803
02:33:58.530 --> 02:34:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know who matt tilapia.</v>

2804
02:34:00.810 --> 02:34:01.643
<v Speaker 1>So matt taibbi rolling stone reporter </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's been really excellent at </v>

2805
02:34:05.631 --> 02:34:06.464
<v Speaker 1>confronting power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the financial sector and </v>

2806
02:34:09.050 --> 02:34:11.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been very consistent on this,</v>

2807
02:34:11.390 --> 02:34:12.223
<v Speaker 1>apparently is a young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in Russia and he was publishing </v>

2808
02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:20.920
<v Speaker 1>satirical magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was,</v>

2809
02:34:21.370 --> 02:34:23.380
<v Speaker 1>and the sotiro satirical magazine.</v>

2810
02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:26.133
<v Speaker 1>so there's the story that came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that he had written all of </v>

2811
02:34:30.101 --> 02:34:32.210
<v Speaker 1>these things about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2812
02:34:32.530 --> 02:34:37.530
<v Speaker 1>about assaulting women and mocking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turned out he didn't do the writing.</v>

2813
02:34:38.961 --> 02:34:39.794
<v Speaker 1>He wAs his partner and that he and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner were engaged in producing the </v>

2814
02:34:43.511 --> 02:34:48.511
<v Speaker 1>satirical publication that was in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>mocking the culture of americans who had</v>

2815
02:34:50.021 --> 02:34:50.854
<v Speaker 1>gone over to Russia and were snort and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tons of coke and a living it up as they </v>

2816
02:34:55.811 --> 02:35:00.811
<v Speaker 1>were corrupting the society that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently been freed from communism.</v>

2817
02:35:01.151 --> 02:35:02.710
<v Speaker 1>And so the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

2818
02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:04.173
<v Speaker 1>this was a case in which the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>against type ab was ironic because it </v>

2819
02:35:08.471 --> 02:35:09.304
<v Speaker 1>was really tight eeb critiquing this bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior amongst other men and so the </v>

2820
02:35:13.421 --> 02:35:14.590
<v Speaker 1>reason that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2821
02:35:14.591 --> 02:35:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know what to make of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>story except that the person,</v>

2822
02:35:16.931 --> 02:35:21.570
<v Speaker 1>the journalist who started sorting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>out interviewed both matt taibbi,</v>

2823
02:35:21.571 --> 02:35:22.404
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend who worked at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>publication and other women in the </v>

2824
02:35:25.181 --> 02:35:26.014
<v Speaker 1>office soliciting stories about what had</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the office and the women in </v>

2825
02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:31.654
<v Speaker 1>the office universally reported these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys were honorable and they weren't </v>

2826
02:35:35.081 --> 02:35:36.010
<v Speaker 1>behaving this way.</v>

2827
02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:40.000
<v Speaker 1>And this was all about a satire of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad folks.</v>

2828
02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:43.600
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a way in which this story creeps</v>

2829
02:35:43.601 --> 02:35:48.040
<v Speaker 1>me out beyond any other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the danger of losing.</v>

2830
02:35:48.041 --> 02:35:48.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>matt taibbi.</v>

2831
02:35:48.821 --> 02:35:52.690
<v Speaker 1>There isn't another one in what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is important and he's amazing.</v>

2832
02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:54.340
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2833
02:35:54.341 --> 02:35:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2834
02:35:56.230 --> 02:35:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I was a going to be pretty surprised if </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was behaving this way,</v>

2835
02:35:59.021 --> 02:35:59.854
<v Speaker 1>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been surprised by a few of these </v>

2836
02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:04.180
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't even necessarily behaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was writing,</v>

2837
02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:06.460
<v Speaker 1>it was writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that there's no,</v>

2838
02:36:06.461 --> 02:36:07.294
<v Speaker 1>they're there when you pursue the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no women who were in a position </v>

2839
02:36:10.481 --> 02:36:11.111
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2840
02:36:11.111 --> 02:36:14.380
<v Speaker 1>actually he was kind of a dick said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2841
02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:15.393
<v Speaker 1>He didn't write it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was designed to lampoon people who </v>

2842
02:36:18.521 --> 02:36:19.354
<v Speaker 1>were behaving badly in this context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in exactly the way that the me too </v>

2843
02:36:22.331 --> 02:36:24.720
<v Speaker 1>movement should applaud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

2844
02:36:25.090 --> 02:36:25.923
<v Speaker 2>tweeted and quoted a woman who wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and I retweeted it as well </v>

2845
02:36:29.021 --> 02:36:30.430
<v Speaker 2>when you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which she said,</v>

2846
02:36:31.210 --> 02:36:32.043
<v Speaker 2>here's an unpopular opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually not at all concerned about </v>

2847
02:36:35.891 --> 02:36:40.000
<v Speaker 2>men who are falsely accused of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>assault slash harassment.</v>

2848
02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:43.390
<v Speaker 2>And you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rethink this.</v>

2849
02:36:43.420 --> 02:36:44.253
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the idea that honorable men who </v>

2850
02:36:46.571 --> 02:36:47.404
<v Speaker 2>are on your side could get caught up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and you're not even remotely </v>

2851
02:36:49.631 --> 02:36:51.180
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2852
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you follow the thread </v>
<v Speaker 2>before she turned her page too private,</v>

2853
02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:57.940
<v Speaker 2>but one of the more hilarious things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they turned it on her saying,</v>

2854
02:36:57.941 --> 02:37:02.050
<v Speaker 2>what about men of color who are falsely </v>
<v Speaker 2>accused and know we're not men of color?</v>

2855
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Why she felt the racism coming her way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Immediately acquiesced it was,</v>

2856
02:37:06.610 --> 02:37:09.370
<v Speaker 2>it was fascinating because I'm watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social dance,</v>

2857
02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:13.210
<v Speaker 2>this weird peacocking of morals and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2858
02:37:13.211 --> 02:37:15.900
<v Speaker 2>it's so odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that it's just</v>

2859
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:19.340
<v Speaker 3>like we're talking about what other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things systems correct themselves.</v>

2860
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:23.150
<v Speaker 3>You find this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one terrible example,</v>

2861
02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:24.163
<v Speaker 3>and then everything sort of like it gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>washed out because of this one terrible </v>

2862
02:37:28.131 --> 02:37:30.410
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I feel like it'll settle,</v>

2863
02:37:31.030 --> 02:37:32.960
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2864
02:37:32.961 --> 02:37:36.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm just guessing you're the biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

2865
02:37:37.130 --> 02:37:40.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm disturbed that particular tweet </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about about,</v>

2866
02:37:40.460 --> 02:37:42.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if some innocent men go </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

2867
02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:46.370
<v Speaker 3>is based on one relatively easy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>

2868
02:37:46.371 --> 02:37:48.860
<v Speaker 3>concluded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it misses the more important one.</v>

2869
02:37:49.130 --> 02:37:53.180
<v Speaker 3>So what she's effectively saying is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been a ton of carnage.</v>

2870
02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:54.073
<v Speaker 3>Lots of women have suffered awful stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the hands of men who weren't </v>

2871
02:37:56.241 --> 02:37:57.074
<v Speaker 3>accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a few men who suffer some bad </v>

2872
02:37:58.521 --> 02:38:00.890
<v Speaker 3>stuff is tiny in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all get that,</v>

2873
02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:06.020
<v Speaker 3>but that's a terrible idea because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a team thing then is them.</v>

2874
02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:07.153
<v Speaker 3>It's the worst idea because what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want is a system in which men are </v>

2875
02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:16.300
<v Speaker 3>honorable and if you allow men who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>honorable to be skewered,</v>

2876
02:38:17.331 --> 02:38:21.770
<v Speaker 3>simply because some person often cynIcal</v>
<v Speaker 3>decides to go after them.</v>

2877
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.823
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to eliminate all of the </v>

2878
02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:27.320
<v Speaker 3>courageous men from the system because </v>
<v Speaker 3>all those people have enemies.</v>

2879
02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:28.573
<v Speaker 3>And so the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody with an enemy suddenly has to </v>

2880
02:38:30.141 --> 02:38:32.180
<v Speaker 3>fear an accusation that has no truth in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2881
02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:35.510
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be reflexively believed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you want the system to work,</v>

2882
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:36.463
<v Speaker 3>the last thing you want to do is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide it's fine for innocent people to </v>

2883
02:38:40.161 --> 02:38:41.330
<v Speaker 3>go down with the ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2884
02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:44.270
<v Speaker 3>And to not have any respect for due </v>
<v Speaker 3>process is just crazy.</v>

2885
02:38:44.271 --> 02:38:45.104
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're going to go back to </v>

2886
02:38:46.221 --> 02:38:47.054
<v Speaker 3>the mccarthy era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go to the salem witch </v>

2887
02:38:48.021 --> 02:38:49.070
<v Speaker 3>trials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is that,</v>

2888
02:38:49.370 --> 02:38:50.480
<v Speaker 3>it is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is that.</v>

2889
02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2890
02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:53.113
<v Speaker 3>I just hope it keeps our daughters and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wives and girlfriends and mom's from </v>

2891
02:38:59.271 --> 02:39:00.770
<v Speaker 3>being groped at work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2892
02:39:00.771 --> 02:39:02.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean it might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might look the,</v>

2893
02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:03.873
<v Speaker 3>I've always said this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment of an office is so </v>

2894
02:39:06.741 --> 02:39:07.574
<v Speaker 3>fucking entirely unnatural that it takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible restraint just to key people </v>

2895
02:39:12.021 --> 02:39:12.854
<v Speaker 3>from behaving in the way that they would</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were surrounded by these people </v>

2896
02:39:15.951 --> 02:39:16.820
<v Speaker 3>on a regular basis.</v>

2897
02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:19.670
<v Speaker 3>And like we were talking about before </v>
<v Speaker 3>with professors,</v>

2898
02:39:19.671 --> 02:39:21.470
<v Speaker 3>the relationship that a professor has </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the student,</v>

2899
02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:25.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's even more so with a boss and an</v>
<v Speaker 3>employee,</v>

2900
02:39:25.910 --> 02:39:27.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>a secretary,</v>

2901
02:39:27.470 --> 02:39:31.060
<v Speaker 3>someone who makes a fraction of what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>make or someone who's under,</v>

2902
02:39:31.061 --> 02:39:31.894
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the below you in the office food chain </v>

2903
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:38.830
<v Speaker 3>and you kind of can dictate whether or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not they do well in life.</v>

2904
02:39:39.950 --> 02:39:44.950
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not they advance your input </v>
<v Speaker 3>can change the course of their career,</v>

2905
02:39:45.381 --> 02:39:46.214
<v Speaker 3>how much money they make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether there'll be able to go on </v>

2906
02:39:47.361 --> 02:39:49.760
<v Speaker 3>vacations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they can live comfortably pursue</v>

2907
02:39:49.761 --> 02:39:50.790
<v Speaker 3>their dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2908
02:39:50.930 --> 02:39:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a crazy environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The office environment is a very bizarre</v>

2909
02:39:55.161 --> 02:39:57.890
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super dangerous.</v>

2910
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:58.783
<v Speaker 3>And what I keep waiting for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe somebody who's written it and I </v>

2911
02:40:00.861 --> 02:40:03.150
<v Speaker 3>haven't read it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

2912
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:07.400
<v Speaker 3>the deep question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have to deal with the issue of men</v>

2913
02:40:07.401 --> 02:40:10.130
<v Speaker 3>behaving this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it's completely unacceptable.</v>

2914
02:40:10.220 --> 02:40:12.670
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have two dangers.</v>

2915
02:40:12.671 --> 02:40:13.504
<v Speaker 3>We've got</v>

2916
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:17.430
<v Speaker 1>people cynically wielding these </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusations and we also have,</v>

2917
02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:19.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory behavior,</v>

2918
02:40:19.561 --> 02:40:23.850
<v Speaker 1>crucifying people for infractions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't amount to,</v>

2919
02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:26.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same tragedy,</v>

2920
02:40:26.101 --> 02:40:27.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2921
02:40:27.690 --> 02:40:30.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those issues are important.</v>

2922
02:40:30.241 --> 02:40:35.241
<v Speaker 1>But what I want to see is that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened is actually a consequence of an</v>

2923
02:40:36.270 --> 02:40:37.103
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy truth of our system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually goes back to the </v>

2924
02:40:40.141 --> 02:40:40.974
<v Speaker 1>conversation we were having before where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of men like harvey weinstein </v>

2925
02:40:46.741 --> 02:40:51.741
<v Speaker 1>and matt lauer comes from a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnatural concentration of opportunity.</v>

2926
02:40:53.430 --> 02:40:58.430
<v Speaker 1>So women have been compromised because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the news business at was at</v>

2927
02:40:58.651 --> 02:41:03.390
<v Speaker 1>nbc and matt lauer tells you to open </v>
<v Speaker 1>your blouse,</v>

2928
02:41:03.630 --> 02:41:06.420
<v Speaker 1>suddenly you're staring at a major </v>
<v Speaker 1>career decision,</v>

2929
02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:08.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you say no?</v>

2930
02:41:09.180 --> 02:41:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Or do you say yes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one person is not supposed to</v>

2931
02:41:15.091 --> 02:41:15.924
<v Speaker 1>have that much power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to walk out of nbc </v>

2932
02:41:19.381 --> 02:41:20.214
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not working there anymore because </v>

2933
02:41:21.210 --> 02:41:24.060
<v Speaker 1>matt lauer's and ass and go somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

2934
02:41:24.061 --> 02:41:24.894
<v Speaker 1>but if matt lauer is not only has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power to make a or well to make your </v>

2935
02:41:29.851 --> 02:41:30.684
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also has the power to break you </v>

2936
02:41:31.741 --> 02:41:33.840
<v Speaker 1>because you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't endure.</v>

2937
02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Having said no to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's a tragedy.</v>

2938
02:41:36.750 --> 02:41:37.583
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you read the selma high x story on </v>

2939
02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:42.120
<v Speaker 1>harvey weinstein?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>

2940
02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:44.080
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

2941
02:41:44.081 --> 02:41:44.914
<v Speaker 1>I mean a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was very courageous of her </v>

2942
02:41:46.171 --> 02:41:47.004
<v Speaker 1>to write it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she didn't need to because </v>

2943
02:41:48.690 --> 02:41:51.270
<v Speaker 1>weinstein was already understood to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the monster today was.</v>

2944
02:41:51.271 --> 02:41:53.160
<v Speaker 1>And I actually thought she did a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

2945
02:41:53.250 --> 02:41:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean he is a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she went.</v>

2946
02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:00.840
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he was her monster,</v>

2947
02:42:00.900 --> 02:42:01.733
<v Speaker 1>in her words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said that there were two harvey </v>

2948
02:42:06.091 --> 02:42:07.890
<v Speaker 1>weinstein's and you didn't know which </v>
<v Speaker 1>one you were going to get.</v>

2949
02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:08.753
<v Speaker 1>So she actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she dealt with the part of him that </v>

2950
02:42:11.251 --> 02:42:12.084
<v Speaker 1>wasn't this way apparently honorably </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to say that when nobody else was </v>

2951
02:42:15.031 --> 02:42:18.450
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't wish to resurrect anything rv</v>

2952
02:42:18.451 --> 02:42:19.284
<v Speaker 1>weinstein here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the guy is getting what he </v>

2953
02:42:20.311 --> 02:42:24.030
<v Speaker 1>deserves and even though due process is </v>
<v Speaker 1>super important in this case,</v>

2954
02:42:24.031 --> 02:42:26.730
<v Speaker 1>there's so many stories that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to imagine.</v>

2955
02:42:26.790 --> 02:42:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just stories,</v>

2956
02:42:27.991 --> 02:42:31.080
<v Speaker 1>it's actually written into his contract </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the settlements,</v>

2957
02:42:31.460 --> 02:42:32.293
<v Speaker 1>but the sexual harassment clauses in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract with the craziest things I've </v>

2958
02:42:35.401 --> 02:42:37.350
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they literally said,</v>

2959
02:42:37.351 --> 02:42:38.184
<v Speaker 1>if you have one infraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this amount of money to </v>

2960
02:42:39.451 --> 02:42:41.520
<v Speaker 1>infractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's half a million dollars,</v>

2961
02:42:41.521 --> 02:42:44.670
<v Speaker 1>three infractions monetized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

2962
02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:45.533
<v Speaker 1>And the point is while there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy about a system that creates </v>

2963
02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:50.393
<v Speaker 1>somebody so powerful that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of just treating their own </v>

2964
02:42:54.241 --> 02:42:58.170
<v Speaker 1>sexual assault of other people as a cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing business by writing it into the</v>

2965
02:42:58.171 --> 02:43:01.110
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so w w we have to fix.</v>

2966
02:43:01.111 --> 02:43:01.944
<v Speaker 1>Not only do we hAve to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a man and you behaved this </v>

2967
02:43:04.741 --> 02:43:05.880
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not safe.</v>

2968
02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:07.073
<v Speaker 1>We also have to fix the system that let </v>
<v Speaker 1>this go on so long by concentrating </v>

2969
02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:13.990
<v Speaker 1>opportunity so that any person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to say,</v>

2970
02:43:13.991 --> 02:43:14.824
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually things are not healthy here </v>

2971
02:43:16.090 --> 02:43:21.090
<v Speaker 1>would have been a not listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody else had stuff to lose</v>

2972
02:43:21.251 --> 02:43:23.410
<v Speaker 1>if harvey weinstein didn't like ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2973
02:43:24.010 --> 02:43:28.900
<v Speaker 1>and so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curing the concentration of opportunity.</v>

2974
02:43:28.901 --> 02:43:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Problem is part and parcel of solving </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sexual</v>

2975
02:43:33.380 --> 02:43:35.250
<v Speaker 2>assault problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2976
02:43:35.310 --> 02:43:39.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's also this giant enterPrise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2977
02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:42.140
<v Speaker 2>And when you have one person who's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>king,</v>

2978
02:43:42.590 --> 02:43:47.590
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they behave like kings have classically.</v>

2979
02:43:48.270 --> 02:43:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what kings do.</v>

2980
02:43:51.021 --> 02:43:51.570
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2981
02:43:51.570 --> 02:43:54.020
<v Speaker 2>they want everyone they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2982
02:43:54.030 --> 02:43:54.863
<v Speaker 2>You hear horrible stories throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of things that men do when they </v>

2983
02:43:58.101 --> 02:43:58.934
<v Speaker 2>have ultimate power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The old phrase ultimate power corrupts </v>

2984
02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:05.000
<v Speaker 2>absolute power corrupts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2985
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2986
02:44:06.050 --> 02:44:06.883
<v Speaker 2>there's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like in less there's full </v>

2987
02:44:09.951 --> 02:44:14.951
<v Speaker 2>disclosure and less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I firmly believe that all of this is.</v>

2988
02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:21.160
<v Speaker 2>There's two things going going on right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now that we are in sort of an adolescent</v>

2989
02:44:21.681 --> 02:44:26.681
<v Speaker 2>stage of human evolution in terms of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture that we're working out,</v>

2990
02:44:26.781 --> 02:44:28.490
<v Speaker 2>how we Interact and behave with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

2991
02:44:28.850 --> 02:44:32.600
<v Speaker 2>That information and the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange information is highlighting all</v>

2992
02:44:32.601 --> 02:44:33.434
<v Speaker 2>these flaws and these natural systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have with these alpha chimps </v>

2993
02:44:36.260 --> 02:44:38.560
<v Speaker 2>that are running these giant groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2994
02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:44.080
<v Speaker 2>but then I think this technology is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exposing us is going to give way to</v>

2995
02:44:44.121 --> 02:44:44.954
<v Speaker 2>something that's even scarier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my number one fear over the last </v>

2996
02:44:48.590 --> 02:44:50.470
<v Speaker 2>year has been artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2997
02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm tremendously troubled by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more scared of it every day.</v>

2998
02:44:54.430 --> 02:44:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Every day I wake up thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we just sleeping while this thing is</v>

2999
02:44:58.701 --> 02:44:59.534
<v Speaker 2>about to go live?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we literally are in a fucking </v>

3000
02:45:02.241 --> 02:45:03.110
<v Speaker 2>terminator movie.</v>

3001
02:45:04.470 --> 02:45:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it's both better and worse than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3002
02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:10.560
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's happening already.</v>

3003
02:45:10.860 --> 02:45:12.990
<v Speaker 1>And because it's not robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't see it.</v>

3004
02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening in your phone.</v>

3005
02:45:14.390 --> 02:45:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your phone.</v>

3006
02:45:15.740 --> 02:45:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

3007
02:45:16.950 --> 02:45:19.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gi,</v>

3008
02:45:20.140 --> 02:45:22.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So age being general.</v>

3009
02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fear,</v>

3010
02:45:24.361 --> 02:45:26.730
<v Speaker 1>the one that we have sentient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3011
02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:27.593
<v Speaker 1>that the thing is smart enough to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking on its own and that it might </v>

3012
02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:33.960
<v Speaker 1>come up with its own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be creative,</v>

3013
02:45:34.230 --> 02:45:36.930
<v Speaker 1>it might be creative and either </v>
<v Speaker 1>misunder,</v>

3014
02:45:36.931 --> 02:45:37.764
<v Speaker 1>you know the paperclip problem is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell it to make as many paperclips as </v>

3015
02:45:40.831 --> 02:45:41.664
<v Speaker 1>possible and it sees your attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn it off or reprogram it as an </v>

3016
02:45:45.031 --> 02:45:48.600
<v Speaker 1>obstacle to making paperclips and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just starts to liquidating the universe.</v>

3017
02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:52.140
<v Speaker 1>So that's not a malevolent ai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a confused ai.</v>

3018
02:45:53.310 --> 02:45:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Malevolent ai is also possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we've got is a baby version.</v>

3019
02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:01.133
<v Speaker 1>The algorithms causing us to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to our phones and to do damage </v>

3020
02:46:05.551 --> 02:46:10.551
<v Speaker 1>to our lives is ai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These algorithms that are developing,</v>

3021
02:46:10.751 --> 02:46:13.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean frankly it doesn't even matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether People are reprogramming them or</v>

3022
02:46:13.791 --> 02:46:14.624
<v Speaker 1>whether they are reprogramming </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and it is undoubtedly a </v>

3023
02:46:16.671 --> 02:46:17.504
<v Speaker 1>mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we have is a evolutionary system </v>

3024
02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:25.580
<v Speaker 1>that the winner will be the site that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manages to capture your attention in the</v>

3025
02:46:25.581 --> 02:46:26.414
<v Speaker 1>face of competitors who are tryIng to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing and they will build </v>

3026
02:46:28.970 --> 02:46:31.700
<v Speaker 1>anything and everything into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithm to get you to do it,</v>

3027
02:46:31.940 --> 02:46:34.910
<v Speaker 1>which means there's nothing in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sacred right.</v>

3028
02:46:35.060 --> 02:46:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Your life can be liquidated to get you </v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to that side on the phone.</v>

3029
02:46:39.140 --> 02:46:39.973
<v Speaker 1>What we have now is a case where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithms aren't so good that we can't </v>

3030
02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:44.713
<v Speaker 1>have this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that this is a danger we've </v>

3031
02:46:47.421 --> 02:46:49.700
<v Speaker 1>created for ourselves and address it.</v>

3032
02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:50.533
<v Speaker 1>we could address it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we don't realize that the phone </v>

3033
02:46:54.110 --> 02:46:58.220
<v Speaker 1>algorithm addiction problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the warning shot,</v>

3034
02:46:58.250 --> 02:47:02.570
<v Speaker 1>this is the place where we get a chance </v>
<v Speaker 1>to recognize where we're headed and deal</v>

3035
02:47:02.571 --> 02:47:06.680
<v Speaker 1>with it before it's agi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't do that,</v>

3036
02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:08.293
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>EveryBody who's serious and has thought </v>

3037
02:47:10.521 --> 02:47:13.010
<v Speaker 1>about this question has had the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

3038
02:47:13.011 --> 02:47:18.011
<v Speaker 1>rational conclusion is that we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no stopping this.</v>

3039
02:47:18.900 --> 02:47:19.733
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can rationally debate how far off it </v>

3040
02:47:21.381 --> 02:47:24.320
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once it gets going,</v>

3041
02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:28.520
<v Speaker 1>there's essentially no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no good way out,</v>

3042
02:47:28.521 --> 02:47:30.920
<v Speaker 1>so there's no one that's going to agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop right now.</v>

3043
02:47:31.730 --> 02:47:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too much competition involved in.</v>

3044
02:47:33.801 --> 02:47:38.660
<v Speaker 1>In terms of the the you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many resources that are on on</v>

3045
02:47:38.661 --> 02:47:41.000
<v Speaker 1>so much resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much power.</v>

3046
02:47:41.150 --> 02:47:46.150
<v Speaker 1>There's so much money on the line to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can come up with the best version of</v>

3047
02:47:46.671 --> 02:47:47.504
<v Speaker 1>this and do it the quickest and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this mad race towards the edge of a </v>

3048
02:47:50.181 --> 02:47:53.330
<v Speaker 1>cliff and no one exactly knows whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not we're going to be able to use the</v>

3049
02:47:53.331 --> 02:47:54.050
<v Speaker 1>brakes.</v>

3050
02:47:54.050 --> 02:47:54.883
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so in some ways I think this is the </v>

3051
02:47:57.440 --> 02:47:58.273
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate demonstration of where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and what we must contemplate in </v>

3052
02:48:03.591 --> 02:48:04.424
<v Speaker 1>order to save ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if we can agree that the ai </v>

3053
02:48:07.821 --> 02:48:12.290
<v Speaker 1>problem has the potential to destroy us </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that given time,</v>

3054
02:48:12.291 --> 02:48:13.124
<v Speaker 1>it will have the power to destroy us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are vague at best on what </v>

3055
02:48:17.451 --> 02:48:20.270
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms might prevent it from doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

3056
02:48:20.271 --> 02:48:23.990
<v Speaker 1>But then we've got this loophole which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is well as oppose.</v>

3057
02:48:23.991 --> 02:48:24.824
<v Speaker 1>You took 99 percent of the ai projects </v>
<v Speaker 1>and manage to correctly build in some </v>

3058
02:48:29.810 --> 02:48:33.470
<v Speaker 1>algorithm that prevented them from going</v>
<v Speaker 1>rogue in one way or the other,</v>

3059
02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:38.560
<v Speaker 1>but somebody else decides not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to confront this at the level</v>

3060
02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:42.260
<v Speaker 1>of what is allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3061
02:48:42.261 --> 02:48:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't like hearing myself say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I hear people turning off on the</v>

3062
02:48:46.161 --> 02:48:47.510
<v Speaker 1>other end when they hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3063
02:48:47.511 --> 02:48:51.740
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to allow us to innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the survival of the species,</v>

3064
02:48:51.741 --> 02:48:52.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's imperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have.</v>

3065
02:48:53.020 --> 02:48:53.853
<v Speaker 1>We have about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no choice and so scared that </v>

3066
02:48:56.241 --> 02:48:57.074
<v Speaker 1>we're caught up in all this other </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense and we're thinking about so </v>

3067
02:48:59.451 --> 02:49:01.220
<v Speaker 1>much stupid shit and our life like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3068
02:49:01.250 --> 02:49:05.240
<v Speaker 1>whether or not kim and kanye stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and in the middle of all this,</v>

3069
02:49:05.540 --> 02:49:08.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a lab right now and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting</v>

3070
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:08.873
<v Speaker 2>these wires and connecting these dots </v>
<v Speaker 2>and reprogramming and accelerating the </v>

3071
02:49:12.691 --> 02:49:13.524
<v Speaker 2>evolution of this thing and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to turn off and that life as we </v>

3072
02:49:17.851 --> 02:49:18.684
<v Speaker 2>know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will only have a few layers left to </v>

3073
02:49:20.221 --> 02:49:21.054
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really feel like we're in a fucking </v>

3074
02:49:21.961 --> 02:49:22.794
<v Speaker 2>science fiction movie and we're at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the movie where </v>

3075
02:49:24.901 --> 02:49:27.230
<v Speaker 2>everything's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got problems,</v>

3076
02:49:27.250 --> 02:49:30.110
<v Speaker 2>we got a lot of dudes out there pinch </v>
<v Speaker 2>and butts and some.</v>

3077
02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Some dudes are pretty rapey and we got </v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of the kevin spacey,</v>

3078
02:49:33.811 --> 02:49:34.644
<v Speaker 2>got taken out of that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing pretty good and then in the </v>

3079
02:49:36.211 --> 02:49:37.044
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile there's fucking robots that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are being built by boss dynamic that </v>

3080
02:49:40.471 --> 02:49:43.680
<v Speaker 2>does back flips and they're gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to think for themselves and they're</v>

3081
02:49:43.681 --> 02:49:44.514
<v Speaker 2>going to have machine guns for hands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their body's going to be filled with </v>

3082
02:49:46.801 --> 02:49:47.940
<v Speaker 2>bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What could go wrong?</v>

3083
02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:49.193
<v Speaker 2>It'S fucking crazy because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening at such an accelerated rate </v>

3084
02:49:52.890 --> 02:49:55.890
<v Speaker 2>that it's literally what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be sitting around,</v>

3085
02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll be playing with my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be hanging out and I'll be like,</v>

3086
02:49:59.311 --> 02:50:00.990
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they making robots right now?</v>

3087
02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we.</v>

3088
02:50:02.050 --> 02:50:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Are we like a year away from this being </v>
<v Speaker 2>a real problem?</v>

3089
02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Well this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kinda what I'm getting at.</v>

3090
02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Is that the ai problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways,</v>

3091
02:50:12.481 --> 02:50:13.314
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's good because it's causing us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to focus on one of these </v>

3092
02:50:17.131 --> 02:50:19.980
<v Speaker 1>hazards to us that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

3093
02:50:20.130 --> 02:50:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Once you've seen why this was a risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you've really made eye contact with</v>

3094
02:50:23.881 --> 02:50:24.714
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't talk yourself into why it's </v>

3095
02:50:25.861 --> 02:50:26.760
<v Speaker 1>safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3096
02:50:26.761 --> 02:50:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Because it can't possibly be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if 99 percent of them are safe,</v>

3097
02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:32.310
<v Speaker 1>one percent is enough to create the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

3098
02:50:32.610 --> 02:50:35.580
<v Speaker 1>So once you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you've got that information,</v>

3099
02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:36.593
<v Speaker 1>you can then begin to extrapolate to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the other problems that don't have </v>

3100
02:50:40.261 --> 02:50:41.820
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3101
02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:44.460
<v Speaker 1>the same intrigue around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3102
02:50:44.461 --> 02:50:49.461
<v Speaker 1>there's something sam harris makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point that as you talk about the,</v>

3103
02:50:49.831 --> 02:50:51.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ai apocalypse,</v>

3104
02:50:51.530 --> 02:50:54.550
<v Speaker 1>it is simultaneously horrifying but kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fun to,</v>

3105
02:50:55.170 --> 02:50:56.580
<v Speaker 1>to get into because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3106
02:50:56.581 --> 02:50:57.414
<v Speaker 1>because it is sort of scifi and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the whole landscape that we have </v>

3107
02:51:02.071 --> 02:51:03.160
<v Speaker 1>built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3108
02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:04.073
<v Speaker 1>Our sociopolitical landscape was built </v>
<v Speaker 1>by people who had never heard of </v>

3109
02:51:08.370 --> 02:51:10.410
<v Speaker 1>darwinists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no darwinism.</v>

3110
02:51:10.830 --> 02:51:11.663
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they Built a bunch of ecosystems </v>

3111
02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:18.840
<v Speaker 1>in which stuff evolves and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know to worry about it.</v>

3112
02:51:19.260 --> 02:51:24.210
<v Speaker 1>So the ai problem is a very concentrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of a very general problem,</v>

3113
02:51:24.211 --> 02:51:25.044
<v Speaker 1>which is if you build a habitat and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>install into it those features which </v>

3114
02:51:28.171 --> 02:51:32.790
<v Speaker 1>caused evolution to occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will occur and what it will create is</v>

3115
02:51:32.791 --> 02:51:36.120
<v Speaker 1>entirely a question of what the niches </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like that you have left open.</v>

3116
02:51:36.630 --> 02:51:37.463
<v Speaker 1>So we are living that we are suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of an economic </v>

3117
02:51:41.221 --> 02:51:42.054
<v Speaker 1>environment that is evolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that creates a giant rent seeking </v>

3118
02:51:46.681 --> 02:51:50.640
<v Speaker 1>monsters who are liquidating our </v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing and putting it into their bank</v>

3119
02:51:50.641 --> 02:51:51.474
<v Speaker 1>accounts and we've created a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparatus that has the same </v>

3120
02:51:54.330 --> 02:51:55.163
<v Speaker 1>characteristics and now we're facing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>robot version that actually has the </v>

3121
02:52:00.451 --> 02:52:03.000
<v Speaker 1>potential to very rapidly push us over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cliff.</v>

3122
02:52:03.240 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 1>My real issue with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something</v>

3123
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:08.770
<v Speaker 2>that I've been battling again with for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of years now,</v>

3124
02:52:08.830 --> 02:52:09.663
<v Speaker 2>is that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we do and it's one of the </v>

3125
02:52:11.921 --> 02:52:14.920
<v Speaker 2>reasons why we're so fascinated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological innovation.</v>

3126
02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:15.993
<v Speaker 2>I mean they literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are the caterpillar that is becoming </v>

3127
02:52:18.941 --> 02:52:19.774
<v Speaker 2>the electronic butterfly and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize it while we're doing it and </v>

3128
02:52:22.481 --> 02:52:24.400
<v Speaker 2>we're so obsessed with the newest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>latest,</v>

3129
02:52:24.401 --> 02:52:26.560
<v Speaker 2>greatest phone that really doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>change your life at all.</v>

3130
02:52:26.890 --> 02:52:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this new iphone.</v>

3131
02:52:28.211 --> 02:52:29.410
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

3132
02:52:29.710 --> 02:52:31.810
<v Speaker 2>I eat do the same shit I did in my old </v>
<v Speaker 2>iphone,</v>

3133
02:52:31.811 --> 02:52:33.310
<v Speaker 2>but I was so pumped to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3134
02:52:33.580 --> 02:52:34.413
<v Speaker 2>But you're in some ways facilitating the</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution of this technology that will </v>

3135
02:52:38.350 --> 02:52:41.410
<v Speaker 2>ultimately lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you follow it to an end point,</v>

3136
02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:43.990
<v Speaker 2>it's going to lead to something very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bizarre.</v>

3137
02:52:43.991 --> 02:52:45.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're ray kurzweil,</v>

3138
02:52:45.371 --> 02:52:46.204
<v Speaker 2>you think it's going to be wonderful and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be able to download your </v>

3139
02:52:47.801 --> 02:52:50.320
<v Speaker 2>brain into a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you were a lot of other people,</v>

3140
02:52:50.321 --> 02:52:53.740
<v Speaker 2>you think it's an absolutely terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's going to eventually lead to</v>

3141
02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:55.030
<v Speaker 2>us being irrelevant</v>

3142
02:52:55.440 --> 02:52:56.273
<v Speaker 1>and this is unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So likely we won't have time to go very </v>

3143
02:53:01.081 --> 02:53:01.914
<v Speaker 1>far into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have an alternative and I think </v>

3144
02:53:05.701 --> 02:53:09.210
<v Speaker 1>it does look a little bit like lars </v>
<v Speaker 1>anderson with his fancy archery,</v>

3145
02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:10.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is we are just on the cusp of </v>

3146
02:53:13.801 --> 02:53:14.634
<v Speaker 1>understanding enough about what a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being is and how it functions for us to </v>

3147
02:53:18.841 --> 02:53:23.841
<v Speaker 1>actually take control of our structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to turn it to our,</v>

3148
02:53:25.090 --> 02:53:30.090
<v Speaker 1>to basically creating a stable non </v>
<v Speaker 1>utopian abundant system.</v>

3149
02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:34.620
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that we are all pursuing,</v>

3150
02:53:35.100 --> 02:53:35.933
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got your first smartphone and it </v>

3151
02:53:37.681 --> 02:53:38.514
<v Speaker 1>changed everything and it was marvelous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then your second one didn't change </v>

3152
02:53:41.341 --> 02:53:42.174
<v Speaker 1>that much in your third one was no big </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal on your fourth one is barely a </v>

3153
02:53:44.281 --> 02:53:45.120
<v Speaker 1>blip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3154
02:53:45.420 --> 02:53:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing that we are pursuing,</v>

3155
02:53:48.511 --> 02:53:52.380
<v Speaker 1>the wellbeing that we felt the burst of </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we got our first,</v>

3156
02:53:52.650 --> 02:53:57.180
<v Speaker 1>our first smart phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing can be made to.</v>

3157
02:53:57.990 --> 02:53:58.823
<v Speaker 1>The system can be made such that we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly getting the signals of </v>

3158
02:54:02.521 --> 02:54:07.410
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing and the liberty to do things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are of consequence.</v>

3159
02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:08.993
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not beyond our current </v>

3160
02:54:10.891 --> 02:54:11.724
<v Speaker 1>understanding to build a system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of getting you to innovate </v>

3161
02:54:16.651 --> 02:54:18.960
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a huge burst of dopamine and then</v>

3162
02:54:18.961 --> 02:54:21.600
<v Speaker 1>it wears out and you're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for the next one.</v>

3163
02:54:21.810 --> 02:54:25.760
<v Speaker 1>It is possible to build a system that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3164
02:54:27.270 --> 02:54:28.103
<v Speaker 1>is structured such that your intuitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction with it is healthy so that </v>

3165
02:54:32.401 --> 02:54:35.250
<v Speaker 1>you are feeling about that is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to engage with.</v>

3166
02:54:35.251 --> 02:54:36.084
<v Speaker 1>That is something I don't feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging with actually leads you </v>

3167
02:54:38.251 --> 02:54:39.084
<v Speaker 1>correctly through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would free your mind to think </v>

3168
02:54:42.301 --> 02:54:44.550
<v Speaker 1>about interesting things rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about,</v>

3169
02:54:44.850 --> 02:54:48.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which news magazine is the least fake,</v>

3170
02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:54.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm architecting a system that is,</v>

3171
02:54:56.130 --> 02:54:56.963
<v Speaker 1>that understands what a human being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that understands we are not built to be </v>

3172
02:55:01.410 --> 02:55:02.243
<v Speaker 1>happy and therefore pursuing happiness </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if we were built to be happy is a </v>

3173
02:55:07.821 --> 02:55:08.654
<v Speaker 1>hazard.</v>

3174
02:55:08.990 --> 02:55:09.823
<v Speaker 1>We should be pursuing something else And</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should recognize that happiness is a </v>

3175
02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:15.260
<v Speaker 1>carrot on a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

3176
02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:16.273
<v Speaker 1>that evolution built into us in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get us to pursue objectives which were </v>

3177
02:55:19.581 --> 02:55:20.414
<v Speaker 1>not stable wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were actually the spread of our </v>

3178
02:55:23.571 --> 02:55:26.120
<v Speaker 1>genomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can attach to technology.</v>

3179
02:55:26.121 --> 02:55:26.954
<v Speaker 1>This pursuit of happiness is the pursuit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of material possessions and we </v>

3180
02:55:30.801 --> 02:55:33.590
<v Speaker 1>facilitate that with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertisements that make every new thing</v>

3181
02:55:33.591 --> 02:55:36.350
<v Speaker 1>look like this is the one that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take me over the top.</v>

3182
02:55:36.410 --> 02:55:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to finally reach the promised </v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

3183
02:55:38.810 --> 02:55:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

3184
02:55:39.950 --> 02:55:40.783
<v Speaker 1>Technology is one thing really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are built to pursue a something that </v>

3185
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:48.583
<v Speaker 1>economists called growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say human beings like all </v>

3186
02:55:52.341 --> 02:55:53.174
<v Speaker 1>creatures are built to detect </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities that they can capitalize </v>

3187
02:55:57.111 --> 02:55:59.840
<v Speaker 1>on and those opportunities can look like</v>
<v Speaker 1>various different things.</v>

3188
02:55:59.841 --> 02:56:01.810
<v Speaker 1>It can look like a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3189
02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:02.653
<v Speaker 1>for some creature foraging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be some food that it happens </v>

3190
02:56:05.700 --> 02:56:06.530
<v Speaker 1>onto.</v>

3191
02:56:06.530 --> 02:56:09.740
<v Speaker 1>For a population of humans that can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new continent.</v>

3192
02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:12.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge opportunity for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

3193
02:56:12.891 --> 02:56:13.724
<v Speaker 1>It can also be a new technology that </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes whatever opportunity you have and </v>

3194
02:56:16.821 --> 02:56:18.260
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It allows you to do more with it.</v>

3195
02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:19.453
<v Speaker 1>But we are wired to search for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and the pursuit of those things </v>

3196
02:56:24.111 --> 02:56:29.111
<v Speaker 1>has produced a great many marvelous </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovations and discoveries,</v>

3197
02:56:30.530 --> 02:56:31.363
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that we do not understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are mindlessly pursuing these </v>

3198
02:56:36.291 --> 02:56:37.124
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when they are not available causes </v>

3199
02:56:38.571 --> 02:56:39.404
<v Speaker 1>us to do all sorts of harm to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So understanding these things as We </v>

3200
02:56:44.091 --> 02:56:44.924
<v Speaker 1>finally are beginning to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could buIld a civilization that did </v>

3201
02:56:47.811 --> 02:56:51.920
<v Speaker 1>not leave us on the hedonic treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing happiness which cannot possibly</v>

3202
02:56:51.921 --> 02:56:52.754
<v Speaker 1>be reached,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but would allow us to be fulfilled and </v>

3203
02:56:56.451 --> 02:56:57.284
<v Speaker 1>to to utilize the amazing brain capacity</v>
<v Speaker 1>that evolution has given us for </v>

3204
02:57:01.431 --> 02:57:05.570
<v Speaker 1>something that's actually worthy of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bret weinstein on that note,</v>

3205
02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:07.130
<v Speaker 1>let's wrap this bitch up.</v>

3208
02:57:10.670 --> 02:57:13.010
<v Speaker 1>I hope someone can actually do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it can be done.</v>

3209
02:57:13.070 --> 02:57:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't have</v>

3212
02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:21.390
<v Speaker 5>but those other things and don't use </v>
<v Speaker 5>those other terrible technology.</v>
