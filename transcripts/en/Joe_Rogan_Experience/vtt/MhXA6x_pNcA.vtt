00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.760
<v Speaker 1>but that's how you fucking create a middle class.</v>

3
00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>She'd take the ship from the top and move it to the metal.</v>

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>So they just Bosch it at everybody and you know,</v>

5
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:09.311
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

6
00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:09.991
<v Speaker 1>they use the,</v>

7
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:10.331
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

8
00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>the way they always use,</v>

9
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>they use a lot of racism and they use an absolute class as them to divide people</v>

10
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>against each other and do their fundraising shit or you know,</v>

11
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:19.940
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

12
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

13
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>and all the laws that they changed since Reagan were deregulation laws and it</v>

14
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:25.350
<v Speaker 1>was so that there were,</v>

15
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>they deregulated the insurance company,</v>

16
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>so like bosses can take peasant insurance out on their employees and so if they</v>

17
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:32.161
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>

18
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>they get a kickback.</v>

19
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Judges get a kickback,</v>

20
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>they took public money and put it in private pockets and they did it all in</v>

22
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>through their lobbyists who sit in Congress and have nothing to do with serving</v>

23
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>the needs of the people who sent them there.</v>

24
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Now that is some bullshit that's fucking hilarious or what it is sometimes.</v>

25
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't write comedy like that.</v>

26
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's hilarious.</v>

27
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Disgusting.</v>

28
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>But I agree with you that it's hilarious.</v>

29
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking transparent it is.</v>

30
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you breaking it down like that is going to let people sort of</v>

31
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>look at it from the ones that they got everybody fired by boat Flag Bible Bible</v>

32
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:09.744
<v Speaker 1>flag.</v>

35
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like just a fun catch phrases of bullshit slogans.</v>

36
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.151
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean shit.</v>

37
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get shit for it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's all fucking bullshit.</v>

75
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Truth is scary because it's simple and they can't stand simple cause they don't</v>

76
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>feel smart and less.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

81
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>the simple truth is fucking overwhelming to them because they're fucking liars.</v>

82
00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

83

85
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>How am I going to do that?</v>

86
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I won't be getting paid for that.</v>

87
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the people themselves that are addicted to the bullshit,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what does what street?</v>

91
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I say I don't use it.</v>

92
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

93
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>they have convoluted hope until beam all you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's hope that you're gonna make it.</v>

95
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:18.821
<v Speaker 1>There's hope.</v>

96
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You're going to climb out of that hole.</v>

97
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.831
<v Speaker 1>There's hope,</v>

98
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a payoff.</v>

99
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:22.151
<v Speaker 1>There's hope.</v>

100
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>You're going to win in the casino.</v>

101
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>There isn't any fucking help.</v>

102
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>All there is is Jess,</v>

103
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>United and with other people helping each other to get rid of fucking criminals</v>

105
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>that are robbing us.</v>

106
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Well that's certainly the best hope.</v>

107
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.003
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

108
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>So I hope that people will fucking wake the fuck up.</v>

109
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>That's where I hope,</v>

110
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.413
<v Speaker 1>I think they are.</v>

111
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.290
