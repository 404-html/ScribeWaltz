<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

39
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.813
<v Speaker 1>It was basically the same as the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times I can say basically in </v>

00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 1>things to strive to want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

120
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they took it down to the lowest</v>

121
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>common denominator made.</v>

122
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 1>It made us go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

123
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>thank god they took away all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we can just be normal again.</v>

124
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can be hopeless.</v>

125
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought it down a snuggie.</v>

126
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

127
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:20.230
<v Speaker 1>they went from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it went from people that you could never</v>

128
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:21.810
<v Speaker 1>guys like macgyver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Gets out of every situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's confusing too though,</v>

130
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:27.604
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because People start thinking that they </v>

131
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>can be macgyver or that they can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain moving.</v>

132
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>It kind of gives a little jog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you think sideways,</v>

133
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:36.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gives you the opportunity to </v>

134
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:39.124
<v Speaker 1>think laterally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you've got a dummy just saying </v>

135
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>things that you want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

136
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

137
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.403
<v Speaker 1>I can turn it off now guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing that confuses me </v>

138
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:47.524
<v Speaker 1>the most about Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know there were that many </v>

139
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.760
<v Speaker 1>assholes out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I kind of knew,</v>

140
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.810
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize it.</v>

141
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird to me that,</v>

142
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:56.254
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you meet people that you're </v>

143
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:57.544
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought were levelheaded thinking </v>

144
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

190
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 1>but it was about some sort of head </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma can make your brain,</v>

191
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relate everything to a joke after.</v>

192
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a book that sam kinison,</v>

193
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>his brother wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother sam,</v>

194
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about how sam.</v>

195
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about sam,</v>

196
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big part of it is how sam changed when</v>

197
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you got hit by a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a little kid and he got nailed by</v>

198
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:51.881
<v Speaker 1>a car and really fucked up and from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point on he became this maniac,</v>

199
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.690
<v Speaker 1>this wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

200
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:54.524
<v Speaker 1>reckless motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like before that he was like a normal </v>

201
00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:57.104
<v Speaker 1>kid and bang one hard shot to the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden he's like all the </v>

202
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.493
<v Speaker 1>crazy ranting and the sermons he used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give when I guess when you get close to </v>

203
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:09.140
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at it one of two ways,</v>

204
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:09.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

205
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's it.</v>

206
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's traumatic brain injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

207
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

208
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 1>your brain goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

209
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we didn't suffer through that.</v>

210
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Now let's just enjoy the rest of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be nice if that was,</v>

211
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 1>if that made sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was a fact.</v>

212
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like making up my own.</v>

213
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I think what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia damage,</v>

214
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I think damage to the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like actual physical damage effects,</v>

215
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:35.900
<v Speaker 1>impulse control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has something to do with that and</v>

216
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.280
<v Speaker 1>getting angry quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

217
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.123
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of factors that come </v>
<v Speaker 1>into play that you see with football </v>

218
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:42.284
<v Speaker 1>players to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Maybe they are.</v>

223
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.710

<v Speaker 1>they become too stupid to talk.</v>

224
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.120

<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

<v Speaker 1>bright if they were big and giant and </v>

228

236
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look what happened to him.</v>

237
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Keith hackney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch slapped coma.</v>

238
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he break his wrist on that bitch?</v>

239
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Slap upside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>

240
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well once he got them down,</v>

241
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:29.874
<v Speaker 1>he was hammer fist and he was like one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the first guys to do the hammerfest </v>

242
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 1>in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing that going,</v>

243
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's effective.</v>

244
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 1>You know what's cool about a hammer </v>
<v Speaker 1>fist,</v>

245
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:39.294
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can do this to the table </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this oak table and doesn't hurt </v>

246
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 1>your hand at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you did that with your knuckles,</v>

247
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:45.850
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

248
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.703
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird that we punched with our </v>

249
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.330
<v Speaker 1>knuckles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

250
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>if know we just associate this soft </v>
<v Speaker 1>padded part is not going to hurt you.</v>

251
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fucking hurts a lot.</v>

252
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Like hammer fists are very effective.</v>

253
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Have you hammer fisted anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

254
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.890
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never hammer fist anybody.</v>

255
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Not that I can remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went into fisting real quick.</v>

256
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 1>When you spinning back fist somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways to do it.</v>

257
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>You could do it with the actual back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hand that hurts.</v>

258
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Like if you hit someone's very tender </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

259
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hit someone's chin with the very </v>

260
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:18.774
<v Speaker 1>back of your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could fuck your and you could break </v>

261
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:20.424
<v Speaker 1>your hand for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the right way to do a spinning back </v>

262
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>fist is with the hand down with the palm</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the hand facing down with the fist.</v>

263
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:29.420
<v Speaker 1>So in that way you are hammerfest </v>
<v Speaker 1>summit.</v>

264
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.363
<v Speaker 1>You really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really offended him more than a </v>

265
00:10:32.161 --> 00:10:33.690
<v Speaker 1>spinning back fist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to do it,</v>

266
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never done a spinning back fist.</v>

267
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.353
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

268
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a brutal move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you got a really time.</v>

269
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 1>That one right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

270
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:42.080
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotta be you gotta.</v>

271
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Be very confident knowing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning your back on the guy real quick.</v>

272
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how the different ways people</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to fuck people up.</v>

273
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.170
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a street fight today </v>
<v Speaker 1>between these two checks here for.</v>

274
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:54.631
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

275
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:55.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

276
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.400
<v Speaker 1>It was on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on instagram.</v>

277
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it the one where the girl said,</v>

278
00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.890

<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

279
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.080

<v Speaker 2>You said you were gonna kick my ass.</v>

280
00:11:02.081 --> 00:11:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Kicked my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>black girls listened because my wife was</v>

282
00:11:07.131 --> 00:11:08.300
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just watched two,</v>

283
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:10.880
<v Speaker 1>a blonde girl and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her head,</v>

<v Speaker 1>she even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

285
00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.330
<v Speaker 1>it uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she throws her to the ground.</v>

286
00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:19.480
<v Speaker 1>She kinda like kinda curves are a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit too.</v>

287
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Just beats the fuck out of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she got attacked.</v>

288
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 1>She got attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She totally turned around,</v>

289
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.203
<v Speaker 1>beat that girl's ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she kept chasing her and that girl </v>

290
00:11:26.781 --> 00:11:28.490
<v Speaker 1>kept talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

291
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.020
<v Speaker 1>While I was getting the fuck out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

292
00:11:30.021 --> 00:11:30.411
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:31.244
<v Speaker 1>if he hit her on the jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe she'd go to sleep and wouldn't </v>

294
00:11:32.421 --> 00:11:34.550
<v Speaker 1>have to hear her talk anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the girl.</v>

295
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.413
<v Speaker 1>My point was when she had her down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's hammerfest and people know that's </v>

296
00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:39.164
<v Speaker 1>a legit move now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like mma has changed street fighting </v>

297
00:11:41.691 --> 00:11:43.190
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really has.</v>

298
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.070
<v Speaker 1>People know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what to do now,</v>

299
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could see like,</v>

300
00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:48.734
<v Speaker 1>especially with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a ton of videos of trained kids </v>

301
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.543
<v Speaker 1>who actually know how to fight and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get by someone who doesn't know how to </v>

302
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:56.780
<v Speaker 1>fight and they wind up arm barnum or </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting him in a month.</v>

303
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like the kid that did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cat williams.</v>

304
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

305
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Well it was a wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

306
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 17.</v>

307
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.120
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was only 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

308
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.400
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a teenager.</v>

309
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got and he got him in a nice seat,</v>

310
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:12.640
<v Speaker 1>stretched them out and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got his back and just stretched.</v>

311
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is wrong with katt </v>
<v Speaker 1>williams?</v>

312
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

313
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 1>He's one of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's he doing?</v>

314
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of us,</v>

315
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 1>but he's also one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like.</v>

316
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:21.004
<v Speaker 1>Who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

317
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.960
<v Speaker 1>who's hitting that pipe every now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>

318
00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:23.794
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't confirm nor deny those </v>

319
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>allegations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely some stimulants involved.</v>

320
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 1>There's something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's gone awry.</v>

321
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:31.883
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by him because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the best comics alive in </v>

322
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:36.670
<v Speaker 1>bursts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in moments,</v>

323
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.623
<v Speaker 1>but then he'll have these horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>wretched shows where there's class </v>

324
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>action lawsuits or money back and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends up leaving,</v>

325
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 1>but then he gets it back together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some amazing stories.</v>

326
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.063
<v Speaker 1>Like he'll put together a special and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have amazing stories based on all the </v>

327
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:54.280
<v Speaker 1>fucked up shit he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he does it on purpose.</v>

328
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

329
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like he could read,</v>

330
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.340
<v Speaker 1>he could write the ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he just like,</v>

331
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:01.174
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm staring into the wind steer steers </v>

332
00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 1>into the wind and that he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

333
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:05.450
<v Speaker 1>that did not work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gotta,</v>

334
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.680
<v Speaker 1>we gotta get the cat williams boat back </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

335
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 1>We've got to turn this around as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>iceberg coming and he figures out how to</v>

336
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:12.940
<v Speaker 1>right the ship and then he comes back </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

337
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:13.923
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's on he's fucking funny because </v>

338
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:19.720
<v Speaker 1>he's fearless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

339
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fearless.</v>

340
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely does not give a fuck.</v>

341
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.513
<v Speaker 1>And with his hair is the something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that conked out hair and the sweat </v>

342
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 1>profusely sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'S that molly sweat.</v>

346
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 1>It was real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like they were touring together.</v>

347
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.123
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense to me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve harwood go on first and then kat </v>

348
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:54.004
<v Speaker 1>williams would go on second and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they were like talking shit </v>

349
00:13:57.461 --> 00:13:58.294
<v Speaker 1>about each other leading up to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So steve harvey goes on and then kat </v>

350
00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:06.961
<v Speaker 1>williams spends the first 10 minutes </v>

<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

450
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I told her that once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

451
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:55.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sarah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>not one of my favorite female comics,</v>

453
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:00.360
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite comics as a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being comic.</v>

454
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I saw her at the store maybe a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was murdering just murdering.</v>

455
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.380
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

456
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.190
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I forget how good she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You forget how good she is,</v>

457
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:13.140
<v Speaker 1>how great her jokes are written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

458
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get through this.</v>

459
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I go through this little phase when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

460
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.123
<v Speaker 1>now I'm back at the zero point with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>material and I've been going out every </v>

461
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.270
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I might.</v>

462
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:25.650
<v Speaker 1>My trick is to go and host so that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not too much expectation on.</v>

463
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd move.</v>

464
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can get my confidence back and then</v>

465
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:29.904
<v Speaker 1>I could see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the level of talent around me and </v>

466
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.200
<v Speaker 1>in what way everybody's thinking and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

524
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 1>So do you like just keep banging it out </v>

<v Speaker 1>Start booking shit or do you get in like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few months and you go all right and </v>

<v Speaker 1>writing a new specialist,</v>

531
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.433
<v Speaker 1>very importantly to putting a special </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and then chuck in it and then </v>

532
00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:09.004
<v Speaker 1>writing all new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so important because otherwise we </v>

533
00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:13.840
<v Speaker 1>all know those guys that had been around</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever doing the same material.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

537
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.010

<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

576
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Believing that if these women aren't </v>

<v Speaker 1>when you keep them separated,</v>

579
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.013
<v Speaker 1>if you keep them from men all the time </v>

583
00:23:29.681 --> 00:23:32.500
<v Speaker 1>but I don't even think they recognize it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as homosexual because they're like,</v>

584
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:33.663
<v Speaker 1>I'm not attracted to men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just get horny and they just start </v>

585
00:23:35.651 --> 00:23:37.960
<v Speaker 1>jerking each other off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that for sure,</v>

586
00:23:37.961 --> 00:23:38.794
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that as as a possibility if </v>

587
00:23:41.471 --> 00:23:44.710
<v Speaker 1>you're just around dudes all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>just repressed.</v>

588
00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know dudes who have been in the </v>

589
00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:51.251
<v Speaker 1>military who've done tours and they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>overseas to the middle east and they say</v>

590
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:53.900
<v Speaker 1>that guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck young boys all the time.</v>

591
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.073
<v Speaker 1>It's weiRd to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you think that that's a like a </v>

592
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.980
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the separation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the men and the women?</v>

593
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I don't know what it is.</v>

594
00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:06.230
<v Speaker 1>It's weird to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I did the show,</v>

595
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:07.064
<v Speaker 1>I played right down the aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stood where the aisle was when I was </v>

596
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 1>on stage and stood where the hail was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't really Pick a side.</v>

597
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Can you turn like a sprinkler?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept turning like that.</v>

598
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I was just trying to water half the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawn.</v>

599
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.203
<v Speaker 1>Now when you do shows lIke that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever worry about doing something </v>

600
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:24.314
<v Speaker 1>that get you in trouble?</v>

601
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:25.983
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not so much that I worry about </v>

602
00:24:28.051 --> 00:24:28.884
<v Speaker 3>doing stuff that'll get me in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's doing stuff that they may deem as </v>

603
00:24:32.041 --> 00:24:32.874
<v Speaker 3>offensive because I know what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive and then then you gotta worry </v>

604
00:24:36.841 --> 00:24:40.080
<v Speaker 3>about people's sensitivities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll always ask the promoter,</v>

605
00:24:40.081 --> 00:24:41.010
<v Speaker 3>lIke straight up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

606
00:24:41.011 --> 00:24:44.420

607
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.580
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion dimension,</v>

608
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.500
<v Speaker 3>the royal family and try to keep sex to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a minimum.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No religion can just mock.</v>

611
00:24:55.211 --> 00:24:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Mormons can make fun of mormons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably could.</v>

612
00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't give a fuck.</v>

613
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.760
<v Speaker 3>they would again wouldn't know what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mormon was.</v>

614
00:25:00.761 --> 00:25:02.820
<v Speaker 3>They would think of as a sect really </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

615
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:03.663
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they wouldn't know what a </v>

616
00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:07.000
<v Speaker 3>mormon is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mormons very specific to this</v>

617
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.060
<v Speaker 1>part of the world wasn't created here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you perform in Utah lot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once or twice?</v>

631
00:25:38.721 --> 00:25:39.554
<v Speaker 1>like really cool people that are sick of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mormons bullshit and they surround </v>

<v Speaker 1>him too.</v>

634
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 1>It's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're really nice.</v>

635
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.820
<v Speaker 1>They're like some of the nicest cult </v>
<v Speaker 1>members ever.</v>

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.090
<v Speaker 3>tough line to walk because you're not,</v>

<v Speaker 3>convert you,</v>

641
00:26:00.591 --> 00:26:02.210

<v Speaker 1>where they get together called more than</v>

649
00:26:19.801 --> 00:26:24.750

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Utah.</v>

655
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I walked a lot when I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would walk from the hotel to the gig.</v>

656
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

657
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was nice.</v>

658
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Nice air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Needed.</v>

659
00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:48.720
<v Speaker 1>The exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

660
00:26:48.721 --> 00:26:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Salt lake city is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

661
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.793
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird when you associate a place </v>

662
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 1>with something like san francisco used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be gay.</v>

663
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like even the gaze can't afford it </v>

664
00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not Really gay anymore.</v>

665
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they out price the gaze.</v>

666
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

667
00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.580
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

668
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's definitely some rich gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>folk out there,</v>

669
00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like having a community of</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific people,</v>

670
00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:16.610
<v Speaker 1>it's more tech tech millionaires and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

671
00:27:16.611 --> 00:27:20.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of that and a lotta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lotta and there's a lot of old</v>

672
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:21.810
<v Speaker 1>money there too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

673
00:27:21.811 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Speaker 1>people have just been there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

674
00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:27.960
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like the amount that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things cost in san francisco,</v>

675
00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:32.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the most obscene I've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like real estate and what it</v>

676
00:27:32.221 --> 00:27:33.880
<v Speaker 1>costs to buy a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

677
00:27:33.881 --> 00:27:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Because if you want to be in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

678
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

679
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.253
<v Speaker 1>But that's pretty much aNy city if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be in it's gonna cost you a lot </v>

680
00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:40.530
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will cost you a lot more.</v>

681
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.200
<v Speaker 1>But in west hollywooD it new york's </v>
<v Speaker 1>insanity,</v>

682
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.110
<v Speaker 1>but you could live in west hollywood and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of makes sense.</v>

683
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.480
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rent in west hollywood.</v>

684
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:49.973
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to own in west hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like everything has been </v>

685
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:57.410
<v Speaker 1>purchased by somebody and they just rent</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything out at a absorb.</v>

686
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Extremely high rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

687
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I guess that makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's stuff for sale,</v>

688
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.283
<v Speaker 1>but it just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's California so strange because of </v>

689
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 1>the earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's all spread out,</v>

690
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.950
<v Speaker 1>like nothing stacked on top of each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

691
00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have downtown but downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rare.</v>

692
00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:16.020
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

693
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Well it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's becominG new again.</v>

694
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're.</v>

695
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.030
<v Speaker 1>They're real estate downtowns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>very expensive now too.</v>

696
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.190
<v Speaker 1>I remember when they started doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 10 years ago,</v>

697

<v Speaker 1>cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dummy didn't even get a prenuptial,</v>

<v Speaker 1>First time.</v>

712
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.291
<v Speaker 1>First time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

713
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:03.270
<v Speaker 1>but I was only married for 14 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it didn't matter.</v>

714
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.240
<v Speaker 1>They can't fuck you if you're only </v>
<v Speaker 1>married for 14 months.</v>

715
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.710
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Eight dollars million.</v>

718
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.370
<v Speaker 1>He's got five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which he just sold one of them.</v>

719
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Is it 12 point seven each or in total?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Total for all five.</v>

720
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not too bad then.</v>

721
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not stacked.</v>

722
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.193
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just they are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take the top couple floors of one </v>

723
00:29:26.311 --> 00:29:27.800
<v Speaker 1>of those buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five units.</v>

724
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.180
<v Speaker 1>It's all him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is he doing?</v>

725
00:29:30.181 --> 00:29:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Buying all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked pretty cool.</v>

726
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.323
<v Speaker 1>I think you guys buy all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the money starts flowing in and </v>

727
00:29:35.851 --> 00:29:36.540
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

728
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.510
<v Speaker 1>he's got some baller fucking houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy shiT.</v>

729
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's some cool shit.</v>

730
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is amazing.</v>

731
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.590
<v Speaker 1>What a cool looking place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three of them are connected.</v>

732
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:47.080
<v Speaker 1>The other two I guess are separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

733
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:47.914
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we selling those two and the other </v>

734
00:29:48.831 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with apartment living is</v>

735
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:52.084
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wind up paying all that money and </v>

736
00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 1>then the neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right next door has a party.</v>

737
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you listen to his bullshit.</v>

738
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why he bought all those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that way he was his own neighbor.</v>

739
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>

740
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.503
<v Speaker 1>But you're still an also then if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in downtown la one day the earth is </v>

741

<v Speaker 1>your end's going to be useless.</v>

743
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna be able to fix that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

744
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 1>To get a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be structural issues.</v>

745
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.053
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to vacate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire thing and you're going to get </v>

746
00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:27.280
<v Speaker 1>fucked out of all your hard earned cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that jack sparrow money.</v>

748
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:35.140
<v Speaker 1>His earth is shaking already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's hooked up with elon musk.</v>

749
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Has she really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

750
00:30:36.641 --> 00:30:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she'll leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she'll cut them some slack.</v>

751
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I understand that she was with elon </v>
<v Speaker 1>musk.</v>

752
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm a smarter than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

753
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.820
<v Speaker 1>you would think that guy's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>genius.</v>

754
00:30:48.821 --> 00:30:51.760
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a thinker.</v>

755
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.450
<v Speaker 1>He's a thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he likes pussy.</v>

756
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all liked posting while he was </v>

757
00:30:57.851 --> 00:30:58.684
<v Speaker 1>dating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was married to some actress before </v>

758
00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 1>that apparently didn't have a prenuptial</v>
<v Speaker 1>with her.</v>

759
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:03.583
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible billionaire and the baby elan </v>

760
00:31:07.361 --> 00:31:10.390
<v Speaker 1>musk relentlessly pursued and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>infatuated with amber.</v>

761
00:31:10.391 --> 00:31:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Heard sending repeated emails requesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to meet the actress.</v>

762
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:14.973
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the way that's phrased </v>

763
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.830
<v Speaker 1>because that's the work of some asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

764
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like he wanted to grab her </v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy.</v>

765
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Who wrote that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a girl,</v>

766
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:27.590
<v Speaker 1>a girl or guy wrote that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chris.</v>

767
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.840
<v Speaker 1>So it could be either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

768
00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked how you did that.</v>

769
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 1>It was written by pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember?</v>

770
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It's pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't do that today.</v>

771
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would call you transphobic.</v>

772
00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's every phobic now.</v>

773
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:43.030
<v Speaker 1>She's not gender binary or zs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not gender binary.</v>

774
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a from your part of town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>university of toronto.</v>

775
00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:50.110
<v Speaker 1>There's this embattled professor who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

776
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.860
<v Speaker 1>He's like standing his ground against </v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness in,</v>

777
00:31:53.861 --> 00:31:54.740
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

778
00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:55.993
<v Speaker 1>in toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the kids are going crazy to try and </v>

779
00:31:58.501 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 1>get him removed.</v>

780
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.650
<v Speaker 1>He just refuses to use the 28 different </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender pronouns.</v>

781
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.920
<v Speaker 1>He refuses to let people choose what </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender pronouns they want to be called.</v>

782
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.621
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

783
00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call men men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call women women like,</v>

784
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:12.244
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>censorship like you're trying to change </v>

785
00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:15.934
<v Speaker 1>people's behavior with the pr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem is that people now </v>

786
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.550
<v Speaker 1>with with all these free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new liberty,</v>

787
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:27.470
<v Speaker 1>they are just choosing to do things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to actually being a certain way.</v>

788
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.830
<v Speaker 1>And I saw this story about this kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>gavin something or another,</v>

789
00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in North Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken.</v>

790
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was born a girl,</v>

791
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.830
<v Speaker 1>but when you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it 14 or 15 year old?</v>

792
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Now he identifies as a male and when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>

793
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:46.940
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

794
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.200
<v Speaker 1>he's a boy lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

795
00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:49.323
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason for me to not believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is the right way for this </v>

796
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 1>person to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it should be case to case.</v>

797
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:56.960
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be.</v>

798
00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 1>He can't just blanket statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

799
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:00.110
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be.</v>

800
00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:01.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that you,</v>

801
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:02.443
<v Speaker 1>it has to be genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just do it because that's the </v>

802
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:04.600
<v Speaker 1>thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

803
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.880
<v Speaker 4>And does have to be genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you opened it up like that,</v>

804
00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:11.780
<v Speaker 4>then it gives people who legitimately </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like during the wrong gender,</v>

805
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 4>it gives them the opportunity to express</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves in a different gender.</v>

806
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:18.830
<v Speaker 4>What's fucked up is that you're born a </v>
<v Speaker 4>boy and you're a fucking boy.</v>

807
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.210
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're born a girl,</v>

808
00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:23.210
<v Speaker 4>you're a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you were born a girl and he feels</v>

809
00:33:23.211 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 4>like you're a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd never really going to be a boy,</v>

810
00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:26.623
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I call you a boy and he'd take a </v>

811
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:30.200
<v Speaker 4>bunch of hormones and everything,</v>

<v Speaker 4>happen?</v>

814

<v Speaker 4>There's going to be a way that they can </v>

<v Speaker 4>flower.</v>

827
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:11.480
<v Speaker 4>They're to be rose because rose is like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the king of the flower.</v>

828
00:34:11.481 --> 00:34:12.470
<v Speaker 4>So It's a lot of pressure.</v>

829
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.693
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you don't to be orchid because </v>

00:34:14.551 --> 00:34:17.140
<v Speaker 1>that's the more expensive work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more expensive than roses.</v>

831
00:34:17.141 --> 00:34:17.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

832
00:34:17.881 --> 00:34:19.170
<v Speaker 1>they're very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

833
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.320
<v Speaker 1>How do you know this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because my fiance loves orchids.</v>

834
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the good thing with those is you buy</v>

835
00:34:25.771 --> 00:34:29.090
<v Speaker 1>one and they last for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can keep those alive really?</v>

836
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.630
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

837
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:31.523
<v Speaker 1>the way they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wrap them around the stick and they </v>

838
00:34:33.151 --> 00:34:35.790
<v Speaker 1>just keep growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

839
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.340
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you ask them,</v>

840
00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.040
<v Speaker 1>are they in dirt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

841
00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.050
<v Speaker 1>You got them in dirt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

842
00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.780
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So rosa is you buy them and they're in a</v>

843
00:34:41.781 --> 00:34:44.060
<v Speaker 4>bush,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they died quick.</v>

844
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:44.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

845
00:34:44.931 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 4>It's that life support system thing they</v>
<v Speaker 4>do when they put it in water,</v>

846
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:50.000
<v Speaker 4>like kci throw some water to keep them </v>
<v Speaker 4>fresh.</v>

847
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.760
<v Speaker 4>We pulled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we pulled them.</v>

848
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.480
<v Speaker 4>Should we pull the plug on these houses </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet?</v>

849
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.110
<v Speaker 4>You know what I found out recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about this the other day</v>

850
00:34:57.111 --> 00:35:00.830
<v Speaker 4>that you can take the stem of one plant </v>
<v Speaker 4>and plant it on another plant.</v>

851
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:01.993
<v Speaker 4>I goes at this ranch and theY had </v>
<v Speaker 4>pistachio trees and the arms of the </v>

852
00:35:04.761 --> 00:35:08.120
<v Speaker 4>pistachio trees are grafted onto an </v>
<v Speaker 4>avocado tree.</v>

853
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.110
<v Speaker 1>So that stem cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

854
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just try to make a pun out it.</v>

855
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I betcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't all be good,</v>

856
00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:18.424
<v Speaker 1>joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to spit them out so that way </v>

857
00:35:18.851 --> 00:35:20.440
<v Speaker 1>they get out there and you find out if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good or not,</v>

858
00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:23.560
<v Speaker 1>but you can't take a rose like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone gives you a rose has been cut.</v>

859
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't make that thing stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenya,</v>

860
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:28.270
<v Speaker 1>can you plan it in dirt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

861
00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:29.163
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs.</v>

862
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.130
<v Speaker 1>It needs the roots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to grow roots right now.</v>

863
00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.700
<v Speaker 1>It can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it can grow roots.</v>

864
00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:35.370
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

865
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of the bud,</v>

866
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

867
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.590
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can flourish still.</v>

868
00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.690
<v Speaker 1>The flower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flower itself can do what?</v>

869
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.690
<v Speaker 1>It can still flourish for a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>

870
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but the body is dead basically in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stems.</v>

871
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:48.991
<v Speaker 1>Dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

872
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:50.200
<v Speaker 1>The stems dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

873
00:35:50.201 --> 00:35:53.130
<v Speaker 1>but you can't take the flour and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody dies like,</v>

874
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:53.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an increments.</v>

875
00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.400
<v Speaker 1>It's dead from tHe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the cut point I would imagine.</v>

876
00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:57.443
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is?</v>

877
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:58.361
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

878
00:35:58.361 --> 00:35:59.194
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming it'd be dead from the cut </v>

879
00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:03.390
<v Speaker 1>point and then it just slowly dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way up that.</v>

880
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

881
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.023
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

882
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.920
<v Speaker 1>So I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

883
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you can regrow a rose once you cut it </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the stem for real.</v>

884
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not a horticulturalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

885
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.533
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to watch people who </v>

886
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:19.260
<v Speaker 1>know flowers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what to trim and whatnot.</v>

887
00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.113
<v Speaker 1>The trim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly like cutting pieces </v>

888
00:36:22.171 --> 00:36:23.004
<v Speaker 1>off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they do what they do and we </v>

889
00:36:24.811 --> 00:36:25.740
<v Speaker 1>just pay them to do.</v>

890
00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:28.683
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing.</v>

891
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.600
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

892
00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Use it doing it using potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

893
00:36:33.811 --> 00:36:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

894
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rose stems,</v>

895
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.130
<v Speaker 1>you stick it in a potato and what does a</v>
<v Speaker 1>potato do?</v>

896
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:44.040
<v Speaker 1>It probably helps give it a root base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

897
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make it again.</v>

898
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.330
<v Speaker 1>People hear you right now in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

899
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.263
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys can hear me right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they won't do that in la because </v>

900
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:54.630
<v Speaker 1>people tend to avoid potatoes and carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they do.</v>

901
00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the newest thing.</v>

902
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Have you been on that yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

903
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Avoiding carbs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

904
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.433
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at me.</v>

905
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.470

<v Speaker 1>Avoided the fuck did I do I just fucking</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally,</v>

921
00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:33.564
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exaggerating when I say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would spar 12 rounds boxing and then </v>

922
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 1>1212 with 32nd breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

923
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And then after that an hour and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>of corp comm on my god,</v>

924
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:46.974
<v Speaker 1>I'm dying and I would let it really get </v>
<v Speaker 1>home and just be in bed for the rest of </v>

925
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:50.934
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

926
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.220
<v Speaker 1>So all that core stuff that pack out </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

927
00:37:53.221 --> 00:37:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you've got all that from </v>
<v Speaker 1>him?</v>

928
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine so because I was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering.</v>

929
00:37:57.301 --> 00:37:58.134
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>packet was addicted to that though.</v>

932
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.540
<v Speaker 1>We would have to tell pacbio don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sit ups today.</v>

933
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.040

<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

934
00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.960
<v Speaker 1>you take a day off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let your muscles rest.</v>

935
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.281
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

936
00:38:14.281 --> 00:38:15.114
<v Speaker 1>he would just catch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just doing them all the time and he </v>

937
00:38:15.871 --> 00:38:18.210
<v Speaker 1>would do like a thousand sit ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something stupid.</v>

938
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.153
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get him to stop doing sit </v>

939
00:38:22.231 --> 00:38:23.100
<v Speaker 1>ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't stop.</v>

940
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.010
<v Speaker 1>He was addicted to doing sit ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so bizarre.</v>

941
00:38:26.011 --> 00:38:27.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing that most people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it would appear.</v>

981
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:49.990
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think anybody would want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake that one.</v>

982
00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:52.643
<v Speaker 1>Usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when somebody dies of aids and they </v>

983
00:39:53.651 --> 00:39:55.420
<v Speaker 1>don't want to say it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

986
00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:01.090
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a difficult way to get it.</v>

987
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Will chamberlain didn't get aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does anybody have aids?</v>

994
00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:21.070

<v Speaker 1>apparently you can get the hiv to such a</v>

995
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 1>level that your body doesn't detect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hilarious guy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you eat it,</v>

1152
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:03.753
<v Speaker 4>it's processed by your liver and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>produces something called 11 hydroxy </v>

1153
00:47:07.541 --> 00:47:11.650
<v Speaker 4>metabolite that's five times more </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive than thc.</v>

1154
00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:12.723
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

1251
00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:29.040
<v Speaker 3>You can drink some water</v>

00:52:26.861 --> 00:52:29.230
<v Speaker 4>I could feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like weakened</v>

<v Speaker 3>I feel fine.</v>

1278
00:52:30.731 --> 00:52:32.800
<v Speaker 3>The next day you're a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's open.</v>

1279
00:52:32.801 --> 00:52:33.790
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just just drink.</v>

1280
00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.950
<v Speaker 3>drink it straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1281
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.430
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to give it in.</v>

1282
00:52:38.431 --> 00:52:41.140
<v Speaker 3>This terrible event is you don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have like fucking,</v>

1283
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:42.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 of them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I have maybe two glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sip.</v>

1286
00:52:46.601 --> 00:52:48.350

1287
00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.910
<v Speaker 4>two shot before every show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does one shot before every show.</v>

1288
00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:52.803
<v Speaker 4>That seems like a damn good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a bad idea because your body </v>

1289
00:52:55.151 --> 00:52:57.670
<v Speaker 4>really doesn't have a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 4>processing one shot of whiskey,</v>

1290
00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:00.100
<v Speaker 4>like one shot of whiskey is like no big </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal.</v>

1291
00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.220
<v Speaker 4>IT's when you go like three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four,</v>

1293
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:09.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mess around like that.</v>

1294
00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:14.070
<v Speaker 4>It's just straight tequila.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge hunter s thompson fan and one</v>

1295
00:53:14.351 --> 00:53:15.184
<v Speaker 4>of the saddest things to me is watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>thompson from the time he was a really </v>

1296
00:53:18.371 --> 00:53:19.204
<v Speaker 4>young man when he first started making </v>
<v Speaker 4>it as a journalist and a writer to the </v>

1297
00:53:24.161 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 4>way was as he older and</v>

1298
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 8>I think a big,</v>
<v Speaker 8>big part of it was the alcohol.</v>

1299
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:34.540
<v Speaker 8>Like he just drank so much booze that at</v>
<v Speaker 8>the end he was almost incoherent.</v>

1300
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:35.843
<v Speaker 8>He would go on letterman and conan </v>
<v Speaker 8>o'brien and you've barely understood </v>

1301
00:53:38.431 --> 00:53:40.860
<v Speaker 8>what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He just saw it.</v>

1302
00:53:40.861 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that stuff will fuck it.</v>

1303
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:44.093
<v Speaker 8>Get you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know who almost sounded drunk with </v>

<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1305
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:47.964
<v Speaker 8>Well he was drunk a lot drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was drunk a lot and he smoked </v>

1306
00:53:51.391 --> 00:53:52.224
<v Speaker 8>cigarettes as well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is just so unfortunate for such a </v>

1307
00:53:54.031 --> 00:53:55.090
<v Speaker 8>brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 8>You know he did smoke cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1309
00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.320
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he sounded like he did.</v>

<v Speaker 8>out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Somebody tweeted,</v>

1360
00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:15.560
<v Speaker 8>I forgot who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it was hilarious.</v>

1361
00:56:15.561 --> 00:56:16.394
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can't wait for them to see the series </v>

1362
00:56:18.201 --> 00:56:22.820
<v Speaker 8>finale of of America.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

1363
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:26.730
<v Speaker 8>It really almost feels like it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know you're going to vote,</v>

1364
00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1365
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:32.200
<v Speaker 8>I guess we'll vote for Gary Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think even though he doesn't know what</v>

1366
00:56:32.201 --> 00:56:33.034
<v Speaker 8>aleppo is,</v>

1367
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you know,</v>

1368
00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:36.140
<v Speaker 3>even though you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

1369
00:56:36.141 --> 00:56:37.310
<v Speaker 3>when I heard him ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>

1370
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.930
<v Speaker 3>when I heard them ask them that </v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

1371
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:44.090
<v Speaker 3>it sounded like they wanted to know what</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thought about something called leppo.</v>

1372
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about aleppo?</v>

1373
00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.620
<v Speaker 3>I think he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do about it?</v>

1374
00:56:48.621 --> 00:56:50.150
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do about aleppo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

1375
00:56:50.151 --> 00:56:50.984
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think the question just confused </v>

1376
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:53.703
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1377
00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.980
<v Speaker 8>It's a really important thing to know if</v>
<v Speaker 8>you want to be elite.</v>

1378
00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.080
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what has he been doing?</v>

1379
00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:03.930
<v Speaker 8>He's running for president now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That takes up all of his time,</v>

1380
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:07.530
<v Speaker 8>but how much was he doing when he was </v>
<v Speaker 8>the governor of New Mexico?</v>

1381
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:10.740
<v Speaker 8>As far as like paying attention to world</v>
<v Speaker 8>issues,</v>

1382
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:14.400
<v Speaker 8>I don't know how much you have to want </v>
<v Speaker 8>to know more than a regular person.</v>

1383
00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.150
<v Speaker 3>it's always weird that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1384
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.310
<v Speaker 3>we'd get these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1385
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:20.960
<v Speaker 3>these people running for president that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are from states where you're like,</v>

1386
00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:23.660
<v Speaker 3>do they think about the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world there right now?</v>

1387
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:26.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas and New Mexico.</v>

1388
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:27.283
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1389
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:28.363
<v Speaker 8>WeLl some.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think more people do now than ever </v>

1390
00:57:30.111 --> 00:57:30.944
<v Speaker 8>before.</v>
<v Speaker 8>More people definitely think about the </v>

1391
00:57:33.201 --> 00:57:37.310
<v Speaker 8>rest of the world now than they did say </v>
<v Speaker 8>a 20 or 30 years ago.</v>

1392
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:39.950
<v Speaker 8>Just because we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're in contact with people more,</v>

1393
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:43.340
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the internet is given people more ideas,</v>

1394
00:57:43.341 --> 00:57:45.680
<v Speaker 8>more things to look up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>more things to think about.</v>

1395
00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:51.580
<v Speaker 8>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not knowing aleppo,</v>

1396
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:52.503
<v Speaker 8>you got to know all that.</v>

1397
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:54.700
<v Speaker 3>And it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I didn't know it,</v>

1398
00:57:54.701 --> 00:57:56.300
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what at the time I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know it.</v>

1399
00:57:56.301 --> 00:57:58.720
<v Speaker 3>I knew that there was tremendous issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Syria.</v>

1400
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:02.540
<v Speaker 3>The name of the city was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounded like a nickname for something</v>

1401
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:05.420
<v Speaker 3>leppo and then I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1402
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:06.290
<v Speaker 3>being indian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1403
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:08.990
<v Speaker 3>how long it was the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other</v>

1404
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:10.430
<v Speaker 8>one though where he,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1405
00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.430
<v Speaker 8>didn't know any world leaders and that's</v>
<v Speaker 8>a problem.</v>

1406
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:14.323
<v Speaker 8>That's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that's a bigger problem than not </v>

1407
00:58:15.441 --> 00:58:16.920
<v Speaker 8>knowing aleppo.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 8>damn thing about baseball,</v>

1430
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:09.583
<v Speaker 8>but doesn't this seem like a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it seems like a ridiculous sporting </v>

1431
00:59:11.631 --> 00:59:13.280
<v Speaker 8>event.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We really almost does.</v>

<v Speaker 8>It's almost like an who who can.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I demean an insult more to diminish them</v>

1433
00:59:18.831 --> 00:59:21.230
<v Speaker 8>more contest.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like if you really thought</v>

1434
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:22.873
<v Speaker 4>like that about like part of it is like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd go for the worst aspects of each </v>

1435
00:59:28.851 --> 00:59:31.670
<v Speaker 4>other and they try to like do it on live</v>
<v Speaker 4>tv.</v>

1436
00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.640
<v Speaker 4>It's an ugly precedent to set for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>

1437
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:35.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1438
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:36.530
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1439
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:37.603
<v Speaker 3>when they try to justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think by looking at the rest of the </v>

1440
00:59:39.741 --> 00:59:40.574
<v Speaker 3>world when they have elections in how it</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets really violent and all these other </v>

1441
00:59:43.161 --> 00:59:44.600
<v Speaker 3>parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1442
00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 3>you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember when some leaders,</v>

1443
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:48.440
<v Speaker 3>I forget what country it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somewhere in europe,</v>

1444
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:51.970
<v Speaker 3>the leaders get into fights with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other at the end and they're a</v>

1445
00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.180
<v Speaker 4>in their government offices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1446
00:59:55.181 --> 00:59:58.000
<v Speaker 4>They have fucking crazy gang fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1447
00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 4>There's one in</v>

1448
00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.740
<v Speaker 3>parliament or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in China.</v>

1449
01:00:00.741 --> 01:00:03.500
<v Speaker 3>Was it in China or there might've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>China or Korea.</v>

1450
01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I think it was curriculum again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the guy throw a cow.</v>

1451
01:00:05.331 --> 01:00:07.400
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they went nuts on each other.</v>

1452
01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.440
<v Speaker 3>He started fucking crane member.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Ukraine is not the place you want to</v>

1453
01:00:12.811 --> 01:00:13.644
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what if fatality clips goes to </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1456
01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Ukraine people are</v>

1457
01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.133
<v Speaker 4>cut from a different cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those people from that part of the </v>

1458
01:00:23.081 --> 01:00:23.914
<v Speaker 4>world are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's something like extra strong </v>

<v Speaker 3>some man and his wife from siberia.</v>

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.400
<v Speaker 4>as alexander karelin the wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1474
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:59.170
<v Speaker 4>I could not confirm or deny this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1475
01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.013
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not do maybe the scariest guy of </v>

1476
01:01:02.841 --> 01:01:06.440
<v Speaker 4>all time in the history of russian </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletes.</v>

1477
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.633
<v Speaker 4>There's one guy who stands out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only wrestling match he lost in the </v>

1478
01:01:11.031 --> 01:01:11.864
<v Speaker 4>olympics was to rule on gardner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was the only in his entire </v>

1479
01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:17.970
<v Speaker 4>amateur career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

1480
01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:22.250
<v Speaker 4>I might be wrong about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know he lost to in the olympics.</v>

1481
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:23.203
<v Speaker 4>And the only reason why I lost to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like some new rule where if you </v>

1482
01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:26.444
<v Speaker 4>separated the hands it would be a point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the first time that was ever in </v>

1483
01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:32.540
<v Speaker 4>the olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're [inaudible] the greco roman</v>

1484
01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:35.720
<v Speaker 4>cable grip and greco roman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do a bunch of shit,</v>

1485
01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:39.050
<v Speaker 4>but it's mostly upper body grappling and</v>
<v Speaker 4>collar ties.</v>

1486
01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:39.883
<v Speaker 4>They don't shoot doubles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's a different style of </v>

1487
01:01:41.511 --> 01:01:45.800
<v Speaker 4>wrestling and corella and excelled at it</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he was a freak specimen.</v>

1488
01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.380
<v Speaker 4>But he's from siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was like six foot,</v>

1489

1505
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.293
<v Speaker 4>Something close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he almost went into mma in the 19 </v>

1506
01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:48.774
<v Speaker 4>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It may have been the early two </v>

1507
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:51.063
<v Speaker 4>thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was thinking about doing it </v>

1508
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:53.683
<v Speaker 4>because there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there were some offers and he </v>

1509
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:57.390
<v Speaker 4>feel like he did some Pro wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1510
01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:01.590
<v Speaker 4>I think he might've done some like fake </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling thing,</v>

1511
01:03:01.591 --> 01:03:04.350
<v Speaker 4>like for money or something like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>with dude,</v>

1512
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:05.184
<v Speaker 4>he was a four week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a freak and he would throw guys </v>

1513
01:03:10.051 --> 01:03:13.050
<v Speaker 4>around and this really ridiculous way </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they just,</v>

1514
01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.153
<v Speaker 4>they were like little children because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a big giant do like the size of </v>

1515
01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Speaker 4>that mother guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was also really agile,</v>

1516
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.193
<v Speaker 4>like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like these roles that he could do these </v>

1517
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.043
<v Speaker 4>dives.</v>

1518
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:29.430
<v Speaker 4>He was so gentle anD a lot of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>movements but freakishly strong.</v>

1519
01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:30.264
<v Speaker 4>So he had achieved this spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 4>balance of incredible technique but </v>

1520
01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:38.790
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous freakish human athletic </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability.</v>

1521
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.253
<v Speaker 4>So he had like the combination of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things like look at his technique and </v>

1522
01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 4>everything is perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's also tremendously strong.</v>

1523
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:48.263
<v Speaker 4>Like The russian wrestling coach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's rustling a russian wrestling is </v>

1524
01:03:54.181 --> 01:03:55.014
<v Speaker 4>incredibly technical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While they're just the eastern bloc </v>

1525
01:03:58.111 --> 01:03:58.944
<v Speaker 4>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they have a super high level of </v>

1526
01:04:00.541 --> 01:04:01.860
<v Speaker 4>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>technical,</v>

1527
01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.570
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>technical skill.</v>

1528
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:04.783
<v Speaker 4>Like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons why george st </v>

1529
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:06.533
<v Speaker 4>pierre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So good because he was Training with </v>

1530
01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:10.710
<v Speaker 4>these russian nationals that came over </v>
<v Speaker 4>and lived in montreal.</v>

1531
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 4>That's where st pierre learned how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestle.</v>

1532
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:15.450
<v Speaker 4>He has a solid base to have these </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible.</v>

1533
01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:16.523
<v Speaker 4>For a guy that is coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that he keeps thinking </v>

1534
01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:20.454
<v Speaker 4>about it and talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I'm sure you've heard the </v>

1535
01:04:22.231 --> 01:04:23.064
<v Speaker 4>rumors.</v>

1536
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:23.963
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they're talking about like a super </v>

1537
01:04:24.511 --> 01:04:26.940
<v Speaker 4>fight with anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't knoW.</v>

1538
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.801
<v Speaker 4>In toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1539
01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:30.600
<v Speaker 4>no one's told that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have not heard that.</v>

1540
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.270
<v Speaker 4>I heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've not heard it from a human.</v>

1541
01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:36.060
<v Speaker 4>If I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I was george and I was thinking right</v>

1542
01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:37.410
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think george st pierre is.</v>

1543
01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:38.763
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's only a small handful of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people as famous in the world of mma as </v>

1544
01:04:43.111 --> 01:04:44.610
<v Speaker 4>a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As george st pierre.</v>

1545
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:48.510
<v Speaker 4>There's connor who's the most famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's rhonda who's right up there.</v>

1546
01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:51.840
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda and connor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost interchangeable in my eyes as far</v>

1547
01:04:51.841 --> 01:04:52.674
<v Speaker 4>as like how famous they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe more conor because he's famous </v>

1548
01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.240
<v Speaker 4>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1549
01:04:57.241 --> 01:04:58.560
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super close.</v>

1550
01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:01.260
<v Speaker 4>I think rhonda affected her legacy by </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking that year off.</v>

1551
01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't matter.</v>

1552
01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:05.690
<v Speaker 4>She comes back with a storm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She beats Amanda Nunez,</v>

1553
01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.200
<v Speaker 4>get to the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's bigger than ever.</v>

1554
01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:09.120
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a verY tough one,</v>

1555
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:10.800
<v Speaker 4>but if she does do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's bigger than ever.</v>

1556
01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.890
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's got that whatever it is,</v>

1557
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.560
<v Speaker 4>that Dynamic personality that people get</v>
<v Speaker 4>attracted to and there's about</v>

1558
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.320
<v Speaker 8>her losing and maybe even losing like </v>
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>

1559
01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:23.200
<v Speaker 8>that could even make it more attractive </v>
<v Speaker 8>to some folks,</v>

1560
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:24.620
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

1561
01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:27.400
<v Speaker 8>it makes her more human,</v>
<v Speaker 8>makes them more vulnerable.</v>

1562
01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:28.253
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of the things that people didn't </v>

1563
01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:31.330
<v Speaker 8>like about her was how confident and </v>
<v Speaker 8>strong she was.</v>

1564
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:32.570
<v Speaker 8>Very invincible at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1565
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:35.830
<v Speaker 8>and she was also like really aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 8>about it with other girls,</v>

1566
01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:36.820
<v Speaker 8>but you ain't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1567
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:37.833
<v Speaker 8>in her eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>those girls will try and take something </v>

1568
01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:41.540
<v Speaker 8>from her when she was the Mike Tyson of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1569
01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.870
<v Speaker 8>of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of mma.</v>

1570
01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:47.020
<v Speaker 8>That's the only way you get to be a </v>
<v Speaker 8>champion is if you have like that insane</v>

1571
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:47.854
<v Speaker 8>belief in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But when you lose the way she lost to </v>

1572
01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:51.041
<v Speaker 8>holly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is,</v>

1573
01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a devastating knockout.</v>

1574
01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 8>It's always inTeresting to see how </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone rebounds.</v>

1575
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:57.363
<v Speaker 8>Some people rebound that become better.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They come back tougher and stronger and </v>

1576
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:02.860
<v Speaker 8>that's what we're hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let's you're hoping for.</v>

1577
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:04.420
<v Speaker 8>But that was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or some people come back,</v>

1578
01:06:04.421 --> 01:06:07.390
<v Speaker 8>they fight smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That was george st pierre when george st</v>

1579
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 8>pierre got beaten up by matt serra.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Matt serra clobbered them,</v>

1580
01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.630
<v Speaker 8>just collaboratiVe,</v>
<v Speaker 8>clipped him,</v>

1581
01:06:13.631 --> 01:06:14.464
<v Speaker 8>heard him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>got on top of a mountain and punishment </v>

1582
01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:16.600
<v Speaker 8>of face,</v>
<v Speaker 8>bam tap.</v>

1583
01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:20.860
<v Speaker 8>And he'd beat the shit out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And george came back better than ever.</v>

1584
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:21.993
<v Speaker 8>He just regrouped.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But george also didn't take a year off </v>

1585
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:24.970
<v Speaker 8>in between there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's true.</v>

1586
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.330
<v Speaker 8>It's true on tv and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1587
01:06:28.331 --> 01:06:30.720
<v Speaker 8>list for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I just think was a different person.</v>

1588
01:06:30.721 --> 01:06:31.690
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I love rhonda,</v>

1589
01:06:31.691 --> 01:06:32.720
<v Speaker 8>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just,</v>

1590
01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.480
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm hoping,</v>

1591
01:06:34.481 --> 01:06:35.314
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for her,</v>

1592
01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:36.243
<v Speaker 8>for her,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm a big fan of taking a long time off </v>

1593
01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:43.210
<v Speaker 8>when you get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think I understand that and think it's</v>

1594
01:06:43.211 --> 01:06:45.070
<v Speaker 8>real important.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is very important.</v>

1595
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:45.933
<v Speaker 8>However,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what you do in that time and how you </v>

1596
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:50.770
<v Speaker 8>present yourself in that time is also </v>
<v Speaker 8>important.</v>

1597
01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.210
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she really do much.</v>

1598
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.340
<v Speaker 8>She kind of laid low,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1599
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.560
<v Speaker 8>which I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nah,</v>

1600
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:58.810
<v Speaker 8>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think so.</v>

1601
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:00.970
<v Speaker 8>I see your point.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But I disagree.</v>

1602
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:03.010
<v Speaker 8>I think she'd do whatever the fuck she </v>
<v Speaker 8>wants,</v>

1603
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.331
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1604
01:07:04.331 --> 01:07:06.820
<v Speaker 8>I don't know that it really affected her</v>
<v Speaker 8>brand so much,</v>

1605
01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:09.650
<v Speaker 8>but he's telling me a marketing genius.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what I'm just thinking.</v>

1606
01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.500
<v Speaker 8>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You should have a startup.</v>

1607
01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.780
<v Speaker 8>We should have a startup together.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's do it.</v>

1608
01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:16.430
<v Speaker 8>What do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'd do.</v>

1609
01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:19.990
<v Speaker 8>What do you think is wrong with taking a</v>
<v Speaker 8>year off?</v>

1610
01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.610
<v Speaker 8>Like nothings wrong with taking a year </v>
<v Speaker 8>off,</v>

1611
01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:22.444
<v Speaker 8>but you know that allen interview where </v>
<v Speaker 8>she was talking about contemplating </v>

1612
01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.460
<v Speaker 8>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1613
01:07:25.461 --> 01:07:27.880
<v Speaker 8>I forgot about.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean I think those are the things that</v>

1614
01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:28.714
<v Speaker 8>showed the mental makeup and that's </v>
<v Speaker 8>where I think that's what's putting the </v>

1615
01:07:31.601 --> 01:07:32.890
<v Speaker 8>doubt and everybody's mind now.</v>

1616
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:35.130
<v Speaker 8>If I had to do a brendan schaub right </v>
<v Speaker 8>now,</v>

1617
01:07:35.131 --> 01:07:38.230
<v Speaker 8>I'd say for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't do your first interview with ellen</v>

1618
01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:39.260
<v Speaker 8>on tv.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1619
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 8>And cry.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1620
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.620
<v Speaker 8>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I think I think those,</v>

1621
01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.513
<v Speaker 8>those tv formats,</v>
<v Speaker 8>although I've done them and I enjoyed </v>

1622
01:07:48.571 --> 01:07:50.200
<v Speaker 8>them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you do those things,</v>

1623
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:53.200
<v Speaker 8>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't be yourself in seven minutes.</v>

1624
01:07:53.201 --> 01:07:54.034
<v Speaker 8>It's not enough time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Especially if they don't know you and </v>

1625
01:07:56.771 --> 01:07:58.030
<v Speaker 8>the people you're talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1626
01:07:58.031 --> 01:07:58.864
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You either as a giant crowd of people </v>

1627
01:07:59.861 --> 01:08:03.740
<v Speaker 8>and their lights that say applause and </v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a guy had left.</v>

1628
01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:04.633
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the clapping instead of laughing at a </v>

1629
01:08:06.161 --> 01:08:11.161
<v Speaker 8>warm up guy walks around.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Guys who were coming back live.</v>

1630
01:08:11.201 --> 01:08:13.780
<v Speaker 8>You guys are super excited.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're excited to have you.</v>

1631
01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.370
<v Speaker 8>Thanks for all your enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're really appreciate</v>

1632
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:17.300
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to need it.</v>

1633
01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:19.490
<v Speaker 4>Let's just 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 percent more folks.</v>

1634
01:08:19.730 --> 01:08:20.690
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can do this.</v>

1635
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.320
<v Speaker 4>So whatever you got and add 30 to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1636
01:08:24.321 --> 01:08:25.154
<v Speaker 4>rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell us about your head trauma and all </v>

1637
01:08:26.451 --> 01:08:27.141
<v Speaker 4>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I mean,</v>

1638
01:08:27.141 --> 01:08:28.940
<v Speaker 4>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bizarre.</v>

1639
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.460
<v Speaker 4>It's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a bizarre way to talk to people.</v>

1640
01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 4>I think what you should have done was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to somebody in the fight game.</v>

1641
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:38.150
<v Speaker 4>It would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would have been received a little bit</v>

1642
01:08:38.151 --> 01:08:38.984
<v Speaker 4>better because then she would have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking to somebody knowledgeable </v>

1643
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1644
01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.460
<v Speaker 4>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She can do whatever she wants to do.</v>

1645
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:47.323
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what was going on in her </v>

1646
01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:51.650
<v Speaker 4>head during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

1647
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:52.723
<v Speaker 4>with taking a year off getting your head</v>
<v Speaker 4>together and she also had some injuries </v>

1648
01:08:56.211 --> 01:08:57.080
<v Speaker 4>she had to take care of.</v>

1649
01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.210
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think she should have trained,</v>

1650
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:02.030
<v Speaker 4>changed her a training camp?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what she's doing.</v>

1651
01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.030
<v Speaker 4>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's still right back at glendale fight</v>

1652
01:09:05.031 --> 01:09:05.800
<v Speaker 4>club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

1653
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:10.800
<v Speaker 4>what whether or not that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>edmond has had success with some of his.</v>

1654
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.310
<v Speaker 4>Some of his students who like what </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues they've had.</v>

1655
01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.760
<v Speaker 4>You can't deny that he's worked wonders </v>
<v Speaker 4>with her hands like her.</v>

1656
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Her striking ability when she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>warming up for that batch code,</v>

1657
01:09:21.821 --> 01:09:22.654
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fight,</v>

1658
01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:23.503
<v Speaker 4>and they were in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were on the sand and they're doing </v>

1659
01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:29.210
<v Speaker 4>these pad drills together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just look fantastic.</v>

1660
01:09:29.211 --> 01:09:30.044
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at her when she first started </v>

1661
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:32.000
<v Speaker 4>striking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at it until now.</v>

1662
01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 4>That's a big percentage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is those two working together so there's</v>

1663
01:09:35.751 --> 01:09:38.960
<v Speaker 4>no denying there's some merit to what he</v>
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>

1664
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Unquestionably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's definitely helping her.</v>

1665
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.120
<v Speaker 4>You would have to examine the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>camp,</v>

1666
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:46.190
<v Speaker 4>like a scientist.</v>

1667
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:48.290
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to sit down to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1668
01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.320
<v Speaker 4>like you've got a world class world </v>
<v Speaker 4>championship level racehorse and a woman</v>

1669
01:09:54.201 --> 01:09:55.490
<v Speaker 4>like rhonda rousey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1670
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:59.480
<v Speaker 4>Or any fighter for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you were the overseer,</v>

1671
01:09:59.481 --> 01:10:01.160
<v Speaker 4>if you were someone who could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1672
01:10:01.161 --> 01:10:03.650
<v Speaker 4>what is the best course of this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you,</v>

1673
01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:06.590
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to address technical issues.</v>

1674
01:10:06.591 --> 01:10:09.340
<v Speaker 4>You got to address psychological issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got address,</v>

1675
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:11.690
<v Speaker 4>comfort and attrition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different things.</v>

1676
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.310
<v Speaker 4>You'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1677
01:10:13.311 --> 01:10:15.890
<v Speaker 4>technically a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we trying to achieve?</v>

1678
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:16.783
<v Speaker 4>Victory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1679
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:17.683
<v Speaker 4>Like what is her best options?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is she training with the best kind </v>

1680
01:10:20.661 --> 01:10:24.380
<v Speaker 4>of sparring partners?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is you don't fucking know,</v>

1681
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:28.130
<v Speaker 4>like one person could do it one way and </v>
<v Speaker 4>be super successful and everyone says,</v>

1682
01:10:28.131 --> 01:10:28.964
<v Speaker 4>well that's the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't spar and you only do drills </v>

1683
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.940
<v Speaker 4>and then your ride bikes and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 4>donald cerrone has been doing.</v>

1684
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:37.580
<v Speaker 4>Or you could go the eddie alvarez route,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1685
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:41.720
<v Speaker 4>And y'all responded like a 150 rounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>preparing for wholesale dos anjos.</v>

1686
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:43.880
<v Speaker 4>So he went the other route.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just said,</v>

1687
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.310
<v Speaker 4>we're going fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to go old school.</v>

1688
01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:48.680
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to go in there and brawl and</v>

1689
01:10:48.681 --> 01:10:49.514
<v Speaker 4>just be comPletely prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So ronnie doesn't continuously train </v>

1690
01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:53.990
<v Speaker 4>without sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does he?</v>

1691
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:55.110
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1692
01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:56.003
<v Speaker 4>How long has he been doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Since the fight with dos anjos he was </v>

1693
01:10:59.001 --> 01:10:59.834
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said you take too much punishment in </v>

1694
01:11:01.551 --> 01:11:02.384
<v Speaker 4>the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're taking too much </v>

1695
01:11:03.321 --> 01:11:04.340
<v Speaker 4>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sparring.</v>

1696
01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.550
<v Speaker 4>And he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had some issues where I think he said</v>

1697
01:11:07.551 --> 01:11:08.384
<v Speaker 4>he closed his eyes and the equilibrium </v>
<v Speaker 4>was given out and he was falling and he </v>

1698
01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:12.710
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1699
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 4>He realized it was he found out</v>

1700
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.660
<v Speaker 8>later.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is he an inner ear issue?</v>

1701
01:11:15.661 --> 01:11:19.440
<v Speaker 8>I think he was right here in like a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like a vertigo type thing.</v>

1702
01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:20.453
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was so good dose clogging one that </v>

1703
01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:24.990
<v Speaker 8>had affected his inner ear.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it was like an infection in some</v>

1704
01:11:24.991 --> 01:11:26.400
<v Speaker 8>way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>but um,</v>

1705
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:27.743
<v Speaker 8>so he decided just let's just do drills.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know how to fight and he's had </v>

1706
01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:35.130
<v Speaker 8>incredible results.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I think someone else is doing that.</v>

1707
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.670
<v Speaker 8>The frequency that serone fights it as </v>
<v Speaker 8>well.</v>

1708
01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:39.683
<v Speaker 8>He,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he can probably get by without doing </v>

1709
01:11:41.071 --> 01:11:41.904
<v Speaker 8>that because he's in the ring enough </v>
<v Speaker 8>where he doesn't need to be in the ring </v>

1710
01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:48.180
<v Speaker 8>extra.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think you're right.</v>

1711
01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:51.360
<v Speaker 8>I think there's that too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like a comfortable balance and it's</v>

1712
01:11:51.361 --> 01:11:53.310
<v Speaker 8>probably one of the reasons why he likes</v>
<v Speaker 8>to fight so much.</v>

1713
01:11:53.311 --> 01:11:54.144
<v Speaker 8>He's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's easily the most active fighter in </v>

1714
01:11:56.371 --> 01:11:58.200
<v Speaker 8>the game.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He definitely tries to be.</v>

1715
01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.390
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But the problem also is like right now,</v>

1716
01:12:00.391 --> 01:12:03.390
<v Speaker 8>like setting up the right fight for a </v>
<v Speaker 8>guy like him is probably not that easy,</v>

1717
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:05.700
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean he's always ready,</v>

1718
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:09.540
<v Speaker 8>but he's always ready and um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but setting up a fight for him,</v>

1719
01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:10.171
<v Speaker 8>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1720
01:12:10.171 --> 01:12:12.960
<v Speaker 8>it's a high profile fight,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's also a dangerous fight.</v>

1721
01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:14.250
<v Speaker 8>So you've got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

1722
01:12:14.251 --> 01:12:16.740
<v Speaker 8>well who do you set them up with?</v>
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible] after you see what he did to</v>

1723
01:12:16.741 --> 01:12:18.180
<v Speaker 8>rick story,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you go,</v>

1724
01:12:18.181 --> 01:12:20.600
<v Speaker 8>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like donald at one seventies,</v>

1725
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:22.060
<v Speaker 8>like some new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1726
01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:25.230
<v Speaker 8>He's a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like he's away healthier cyst.</v>

1727
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:29.580
<v Speaker 8>It kills me to think that guy was </v>
<v Speaker 8>starving himself for all those years.</v>

1728
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.160
<v Speaker 8>He's a big dude.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's not small,</v>

1729
01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.173
<v Speaker 8>but at 1:55</v>
<v Speaker 8>he just didn't have the durability and </v>

1730
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.350
<v Speaker 8>one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 8>god damn.</v>

1731
01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:38.940

<v Speaker 8>and you know,</v>

1737
01:12:47.341 --> 01:12:48.174
<v Speaker 8>when you get to know the fighters and </v>
<v Speaker 8>stuff and you get a little inside </v>

1738

<v Speaker 8>you realized when you,</v>

1741
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.213
<v Speaker 8>when you meet them and you and you talk </v>
<v Speaker 8>to them that they're just guys doing a </v>

1742
01:12:58.471 --> 01:13:01.260
<v Speaker 8>job.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're not looking at it as I just want</v>

<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1745
01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:09.180
<v Speaker 8>there's definitely that aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but there's also the guys that just want</v>

1746
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:12.150
<v Speaker 8>to go in there and be the toughest guy </v>
<v Speaker 8>in the world as well.</v>

1747
01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:14.430
<v Speaker 8>Those are usually the new guys </v>
<v Speaker 8>sometimes.</v>

1748
01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:16.050
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The older guys are like,</v>

1749
01:13:16.051 --> 01:13:16.884
<v Speaker 8>look,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I already know I'm tough and everybody </v>

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:20.530
<v Speaker 8>I got to monetize this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1752
01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.770
<v Speaker 8>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's so many factors at play.</v>

1753
01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:24.810
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and when it comes to fighting,</v>

1754
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:27.540
<v Speaker 8>there's genetics which plays a giant </v>
<v Speaker 8>role.</v>

1755
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.480
<v Speaker 8>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's certain guys that are,</v>

1756
01:13:29.481 --> 01:13:32.040
<v Speaker 8>is built better for it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They just got a lucky roll,</v>

1757
01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:36.720
<v Speaker 8>the dice and they have better.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just the design of their bodies better.</v>

1758
01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.010
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The shape is better.</v>

1759
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.720
<v Speaker 8>It works better.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They can hit you harder.</v>

1760
01:13:39.721 --> 01:13:41.970
<v Speaker 8>their jaws bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They can take more punishment.</v>

1761
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:43.360
<v Speaker 8>Genetics on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1762
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.740
<v Speaker 8>There's always gonna be guys like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So You're seeing guys like that now,</v>

1763
01:13:46.741 --> 01:13:49.560
<v Speaker 8>but then you seem like the mental aspect</v>
<v Speaker 8>of it.</v>

1764
01:13:49.561 --> 01:13:52.800
<v Speaker 8>How many gUys have mental coaches now </v>
<v Speaker 8>and hypnotists and chet?</v>

1765
01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:54.960
<v Speaker 8>It's such a weird game,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

1767
01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.310
<v Speaker 8>very different than it was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1768
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:02.010
<v Speaker 8>in the eighties when I was training </v>
<v Speaker 8>boxing,</v>

1769
01:14:02.011 --> 01:14:04.080
<v Speaker 8>there was no nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was no.</v>

1770
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:06.340
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would to.</v>

1771
01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.840
<v Speaker 8>I think I might have said it before my </v>
<v Speaker 8>car get to the gym.</v>

1772
01:14:08.841 --> 01:14:10.430
<v Speaker 8>I coach me like go run and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

01:14:10.431 --> 01:14:11.440
<v Speaker 8>I just want to box.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's like,</v>

1774

<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we gotta go</v>

1775
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 3>run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I would make all right and go,</v>

1776
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.870
<v Speaker 3>where do I run to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes running up to,</v>

1777
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tour bram and,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and seven and come back and I'm like,</v>

1779
01:14:21.221 --> 01:14:22.054
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And right at that intersection was </v>

1780
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 3>mcdonald's just a little bit down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would run to the mcdonald's and get</v>

1781
01:14:28.691 --> 01:14:29.524
<v Speaker 3>a milkshake and then I would walk back </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I made sure I ran there as fast </v>

1782
01:14:34.361 --> 01:14:35.194
<v Speaker 3>as I could to get a milkshake walk back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they would run on the issue in </v>

1783
01:14:39.161 --> 01:14:39.994
<v Speaker 3>the last half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would be sweating it out a little </v>

1784
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:43.423
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit out of breath when I got </v>

1785
01:14:44.111 --> 01:14:44.944
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about this Amanda </v>

1786
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Nunez?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ronda rousey fight man doesn't do.</v>

1787
01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.670
<v Speaker 3>She's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's bad.</v>

1788
01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:52.773
<v Speaker 3>She's bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would feel more comfortable if </v>

1789
01:14:54.551 --> 01:14:57.640
<v Speaker 3>she was coming back against meesha or </v>
<v Speaker 3>even a rematch against holly.</v>

1790
01:14:57.641 --> 01:14:58.680
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>amanda scares me dude.</v>

1792
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:00.933
<v Speaker 8>Before holly knocked out rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I had said that I just thought holly </v>

1793
01:15:05.321 --> 01:15:09.190
<v Speaker 8>holm needed more fights in the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like more people to know who she is.</v>

1794
01:15:09.610 --> 01:15:10.443
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I go and I think Amanda Nunez the more </v>

1795
01:15:12.071 --> 01:15:15.010
<v Speaker 8>dangerous fight because Amanda Nunez is </v>
<v Speaker 8>a black belt in jujitsu.</v>

1796
01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:17.380
<v Speaker 8>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and she has fucking hard man.</v>

1797
01:15:17.381 --> 01:15:19.000
<v Speaker 8>She looks like she hits like a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1798
01:15:19.001 --> 01:15:21.850
<v Speaker 8>She had so much harder than most of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>women in that division.</v>

1799
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.823
<v Speaker 8>She's super aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 8>got shorter arms and she looks like she </v>

1800
01:15:24.881 --> 01:15:26.530
<v Speaker 8>can crank,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1801
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:29.440
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this whole cyborg thing,</v>

1802
01:15:29.441 --> 01:15:30.274
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>everybody wants cyborg to fight in the </v>

1803
01:15:32.411 --> 01:15:36.250
<v Speaker 8>ufc and trying to set up a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would like cyborG defined nunez.</v>

1804
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:37.703
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was just thinking that like much </v>

1805
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:39.643
<v Speaker 8>confide in my pack on some weight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So thing about cyborg is she struggles </v>

1806
01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:44.600
<v Speaker 8>to get to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1807
01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:47.830
<v Speaker 8>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she's so drained.</v>

1808
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:50.380
<v Speaker 8>Is there a way above that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>There should be.</v>

1809
01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:55.410
<v Speaker 8>There should be a 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 8>or even give her the title at 1:45.</v>

1810
01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:59.710
<v Speaker 8>Who is denying that she's the toughest </v>
<v Speaker 8>145 pound woman on the planet.</v>

1811
01:15:59.711 --> 01:16:00.544
<v Speaker 8>Who's denying that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think there's a shit ton of fights </v>

1812
01:16:03.161 --> 01:16:05.890
<v Speaker 8>waiting to happen at 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One 50.</v>

1813
01:16:05.891 --> 01:16:08.950
<v Speaker 8>Even one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Victor has a whole 145 pound division.</v>

1814
01:16:08.951 --> 01:16:09.784
<v Speaker 8>A bunch of them were messaging me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There were tweeting at me after we were </v>

1815
01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:16.060
<v Speaker 8>talking about bringing this still around</v>
<v Speaker 8>the ufc owns it.</v>

1816
01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:18.853
<v Speaker 8>I thiNk the or the own part of it or </v>
<v Speaker 8>something or it's on fight pass or </v>

1817
01:16:21.251 --> 01:16:23.320
<v Speaker 8>something like those science.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But um,</v>

1818
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.760
<v Speaker 8>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she's a,</v>

1819
01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.190
<v Speaker 8>she's a a destroyer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1820
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.030
<v Speaker 8>so I work as a destroyer.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yup.</v>

1821
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:32.260
<v Speaker 8>She's so terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The way she attacks these chicks,</v>

1822
01:16:32.261 --> 01:16:35.800
<v Speaker 8>like that's the 145 pound world champion</v>
<v Speaker 8>and she looks like mickey rourke.</v>

1823
01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:38.400
<v Speaker 8>So I think she's a little prettier </v>
<v Speaker 8>mickey,</v>

1824
01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:40.240
<v Speaker 8>right bro,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're being rude.</v>

1825
01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.970
<v Speaker 8>I meant the lips.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can't take this.</v>

1826
01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.240
<v Speaker 8>I can't take this in a tweet tour after </v>
<v Speaker 8>an apologize.</v>

1827
01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:50.780
<v Speaker 8>Apologize for kicking the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 8>me.</v>

1828
01:16:51.610 --> 01:16:55.090
<v Speaker 8>But what's interesting is I wonder if </v>
<v Speaker 8>there is a 55,</v>

1829
01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.540
<v Speaker 8>is there a 55 pound division to be had?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maybe one.</v>

1830
01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.870
<v Speaker 8>I'd go up to 1:48.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One 50 at the most I would say.</v>

1831
01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:04.330
<v Speaker 8>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I wonder,</v>

1832
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.901
<v Speaker 8>because,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1833
01:17:04.901 --> 01:17:05.734
<v Speaker 8>I think cyborgs,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of her coaches were saying that if </v>

1834
01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:11.180
<v Speaker 8>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 8>her the right division will be 1:55,</v>

1835
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:15.170
<v Speaker 8>I doubt would be the division where she </v>
<v Speaker 8>would feel that the healthiest because I</v>

1836
01:17:15.171 --> 01:17:18.620
<v Speaker 8>think she walks around at like one 70 </v>
<v Speaker 8>something probably she's,</v>

1837
01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:19.760
<v Speaker 8>but she's all muscled,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1838
01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:22.040
<v Speaker 8>it's not like she's walking around like </v>
<v Speaker 8>me.</v>

1839
01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:24.350
<v Speaker 8>She's walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 8>She's yoked.</v>

1840
01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:28.280
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But I'm Amanda Nunez is not that big.</v>

1841
01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.980
<v Speaker 8>It's just not as big as her know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that would be,</v>

1842
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.593
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wouldn't be the wisest fight because </v>

1843
01:17:34.251 --> 01:17:37.250
<v Speaker 8>Amanda Nunez is like legitimate 135 </v>
<v Speaker 8>pounder,</v>

1844
01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:42.580
<v Speaker 8>but she's a 135 pounder that hits like a</v>
<v Speaker 8>dude and she's very solidly built.</v>

1845
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:46.520
<v Speaker 8>She's very.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's all very compact.</v>

1846
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:47.383
<v Speaker 8>Did you see her fight with cat zingano?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I did not see how fucking ferocious cat </v>

1847
01:17:51.201 --> 01:17:52.034
<v Speaker 8>zingano is because she had cats and </v>
<v Speaker 8>gunnel hurt in the first round and she </v>

1848
01:17:55.941 --> 01:17:59.150
<v Speaker 8>was getting beat up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like real bad.</v>

1849
01:17:59.151 --> 01:17:59.984
<v Speaker 8>The first round was real bad for cat and</v>
<v Speaker 8>she made it out of that round and she </v>

1850
01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:06.770
<v Speaker 8>stopped her and either the second or the</v>
<v Speaker 8>third,</v>

1851
01:18:06.771 --> 01:18:07.604
<v Speaker 8>I can't really remember.</v>
<v Speaker 8>See if you can remember that or you </v>

1852
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:11.894
<v Speaker 8>don't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I Want to say she stopped her in the </v>

1853
01:18:13.341 --> 01:18:14.174
<v Speaker 8>third,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it was just brutal fucking exchange </v>

1854
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:21.920
<v Speaker 8>and she eventually beat Amanda Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Cats in Ghana is also knocked out.</v>

1855
01:18:21.921 --> 01:18:23.600
<v Speaker 8>Me should take people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Forget about that.</v>

1856
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.920
<v Speaker 8>Canceling jada's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've.</v>

1857
01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.650
<v Speaker 8>What's that third round?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Tko cat stopped amanda.</v>

1858
01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.680
<v Speaker 8>But the first round did she had to </v>
<v Speaker 8>survive.</v>

1859
01:18:33.681 --> 01:18:36.820
<v Speaker 8>She was getting beat the fuck up and he </v>
<v Speaker 8>saw and that's all stand up.</v>

1860
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.610
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible].</v>

<v Speaker 8>standup,</v>

1862
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:40.363
<v Speaker 8>but I think most of it was ground and </v>
<v Speaker 8>pound on the ground if I remember </v>

1863
01:18:42.681 --> 01:18:43.514

1865
01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:50.983

<v Speaker 8>like she really knows how to be in the </v>

1866
01:18:53.841 --> 01:18:58.841
<v Speaker 8>right position and she drops full,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like nothing punches on girls.</v>

1867
01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.150
<v Speaker 8>Like she really turned over.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was a distance.</v>

1912
01:20:36.451 --> 01:20:39.000
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would just like to see one tune up.</v>

1913
01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:40.320
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1914
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:41.101
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tune up.</v>

1915
01:20:41.101 --> 01:20:44.130
<v Speaker 4>Finds this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does not boxing.</v>

1916
01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.570
<v Speaker 4>Ufc doesn't give you enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>

1917
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:51.930
<v Speaker 4>It's just a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I will say though,</v>

1918
01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:55.770
<v Speaker 4>that the women have proven to have far </v>
<v Speaker 4>more resilience in the men.</v>

1919
01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.293
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times they're just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their willingness to not tap and their </v>

1920
01:20:59.701 --> 01:21:00.534
<v Speaker 4>willingness to get in there and I prefer</v>
<v Speaker 4>to not compare them gender to gender </v>

1921
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:06.443
<v Speaker 4>because I'm not one of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I just wanna let you know that </v>

1922
01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.560
<v Speaker 4>objectified them in my own little wake </v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

1923
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:15.420
<v Speaker 4>not knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no need to even compare them to the men.</v>

1924
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:16.583
<v Speaker 4>What I'll say is there's amazing </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletes and amazing champions in both </v>

1925
01:21:21.991 --> 01:21:26.490
<v Speaker 4>the men and the women's division summit </v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting legitimately now like there's.</v>

1926
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:29.130
<v Speaker 4>There's no denying that there's world </v>
<v Speaker 4>class talent,</v>

1927
01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:33.720
<v Speaker 4>but there's also no denying that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highest levels of male talent.</v>

1928
01:21:33.721 --> 01:21:34.554
<v Speaker 4>There's a bigger pool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's natural because there's more </v>

1929
01:21:36.181 --> 01:21:39.420
<v Speaker 4>men that are interested in competing in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a male dominated sport,</v>

1930
01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:44.340
<v Speaker 4>but the women's side is growing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting a lot of like really high</v>

1931
01:21:44.341 --> 01:21:47.100
<v Speaker 4>level moitai fighters like valentino,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chef chanko,</v>

1932
01:21:47.101 --> 01:21:47.934
<v Speaker 4>so multiple time world champion who </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes over and now she's fighting and </v>

1933
01:21:51.451 --> 01:21:52.284
<v Speaker 4>she just beat holly holmes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'd beat holly holm and she really </v>

1934
01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:57.780
<v Speaker 4>like outclassed or with standup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that was a big aspect of that was a</v>

1935
01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.270
<v Speaker 4>that I did see that and that was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was a big shock for me.</v>

1936
01:22:00.271 --> 01:22:03.680
<v Speaker 4>I thought hollywood outbox or no </v>
<v Speaker 4>valentino's nasty dude.</v>

1937
01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.990
<v Speaker 4>Just get that beautiful check right hook</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's.</v>

1938
01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:09.600
<v Speaker 4>She's real sneakY or their leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's got excellent timing.</v>

1939
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.613
<v Speaker 4>She's a really dangerous fighter for </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody in that division because if you </v>

1940
01:22:13.081 --> 01:22:13.914
<v Speaker 4>can't take her to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's highly unlikely that you're going </v>

1941
01:22:16.701 --> 01:22:18.640
<v Speaker 4>to stand with her and not get cracked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're Gonna.</v>

1942
01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:19.493
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start getting real apprehensive about </v>

1943
01:22:22.141 --> 01:22:24.790
<v Speaker 4>your movements because she throws that </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful check.</v>

1944
01:22:24.791 --> 01:22:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Right hook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or at least she did with holly.</v>

1945
01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:28.220
<v Speaker 4>She counters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well dude,</v>

1946
01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:29.093
<v Speaker 4>she's just real high level striker and </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can't get into the ground and </v>

1947
01:22:31.711 --> 01:22:32.544
<v Speaker 4>even if you can get to the ground like </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's been working on her ground game </v>

1948
01:22:34.171 --> 01:22:37.200
<v Speaker 4>and she is very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's suit like that.</v>

1949
01:22:37.201 --> 01:22:39.780
<v Speaker 4>Fight for a title shot though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1950
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:40.501
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:22:40.501 --> 01:22:41.334
<v Speaker 4>She has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure who she's fighting me should </v>

1952
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:44.980
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck is.</v>

1953
01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:45.813
<v Speaker 4>She was writing me should I think me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was fighting someBody in mass note </v>

1954
01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:52.470
<v Speaker 4>and reaches fighting.</v>

<v Speaker 4>like he's in the mix.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to.</v>

2087
01:28:25.841 --> 01:28:28.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm a chubby fucking indian guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to.</v>

2088
01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:30.100
<v Speaker 3>it's fun to be around those places </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2089
01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what,</v>

2090
01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.430
<v Speaker 3>that's what does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go and you see everybody go,</v>

2091
01:28:33.730 --> 01:28:34.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2092
01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not built for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2093
01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:37.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hobbyist.</v>

2094
01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:39.130
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys are lifers.</v>

2095
01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:42.520
<v Speaker 3>You have to have the most insane </v>
<v Speaker 3>dedication,</v>

2096
01:28:42.521 --> 01:28:43.354
<v Speaker 3>I think for any athletic endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think below 40 and I would have gone </v>

2097
01:28:47.190 --> 01:28:48.610
<v Speaker 3>and trained with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know them then.</v>

2098
01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.473
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2099
01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:53.450
<v Speaker 4>what's just a weird thing to dabble in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like dabbling in mma?</v>

2100
01:28:53.451 --> 01:28:56.830
<v Speaker 4>It's be really can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be.</v>

2101
01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.160
<v Speaker 4>Unless you're some freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always exceptions.</v>

2102
01:29:00.161 --> 01:29:01.720
<v Speaker 4>There's always people that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>

2103
01:29:01.721 --> 01:29:05.490
<v Speaker 4>F like apparently that's what jon jones </v>
<v Speaker 4>was for the longest time before he moved</v>

2104
01:29:05.491 --> 01:29:06.324
<v Speaker 4>to albuquerque.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would take time off and go back to </v>

2105
01:29:08.281 --> 01:29:09.390
<v Speaker 4>New York and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2106
01:29:09.391 --> 01:29:11.550
<v Speaker 4>train some out there but not trained </v>
<v Speaker 4>with anybody.</v>

2107
01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:13.470
<v Speaker 4>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who's training with,</v>

2108
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:15.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forest fights.</v>

2109
01:29:15.361 --> 01:29:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's out there in albuquerque </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

2110
01:29:17.281 --> 01:29:18.180
<v Speaker 4>Try it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2111
01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:20.610
<v Speaker 4>Well he moved there and then once he </v>
<v Speaker 4>moved there,</v>

2112
01:29:20.611 --> 01:29:22.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think everything went up to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next level,</v>

2113
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:23.873
<v Speaker 4>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a guy that could take all that </v>

2114
01:29:25.261 --> 01:29:27.060
<v Speaker 4>time off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come back and still fuck everybody up.</v>

2115
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:30.770
<v Speaker 4>Just just a freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he as well?</v>

2116
01:29:30.850 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 4>So they lifted his band or.</v>

2117
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:33.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2118
01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:37.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you'd Be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sentenced him if he got sentenced,</v>

2119
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:41.040
<v Speaker 4>sentenced conner $150,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a fucking water bottle.</v>

2120
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seemed a little access.</v>

2121
01:29:42.330 --> 01:29:43.270
<v Speaker 4>A tiny bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huh?</v>

2122
01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:44.600
<v Speaker 4>Why they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2123
01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:45.443
<v Speaker 4>it's not like he's a habitual bottle </v>
<v Speaker 4>thrower that we are finally punishing </v>

2124
01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:50.670
<v Speaker 4>you for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sick of all of that bottle.</v>

2125
01:29:50.671 --> 01:29:55.200
<v Speaker 4>Throwing row is a stupid thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2126
01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.940
<v Speaker 4>And it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2127
01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:58.013
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you really think he going to hit </v>

2128
01:29:58.501 --> 01:29:59.700
<v Speaker 4>them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2129
01:30:00.170 --> 01:30:01.710
<v Speaker 4>it's too far away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't.</v>

2130
01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.573
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was just hyped for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight and it's just how I ended up </v>

2131
01:30:04.471 --> 01:30:06.020
<v Speaker 4>finding a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you threw a glass bottle.</v>

2132
01:30:06.021 --> 01:30:06.854
<v Speaker 4>He threw a fucking water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Refuses to fight in las vegas after </v>

2133
01:30:09.031 --> 01:30:10.500
<v Speaker 4>$150,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fine.</v>

2134
01:30:10.501 --> 01:30:11.334
<v Speaker 4>That's fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's a good thing to get the vegas </v>

2135
01:30:13.561 --> 01:30:16.260
<v Speaker 4>people to recognize there's consequences</v>
<v Speaker 4>to this.</v>

2136
01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:21.260
<v Speaker 4>But the ufc so big right now they sell </v>
<v Speaker 4>out no matter who's fighting.</v>

2137
01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.350
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ones 50 hours of community service.</v>

2138
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifty hours is a real weak.</v>

2139
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:30.510
<v Speaker 4>So weak were the work flux you got to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

2140
01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:32.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2141
01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:35.030
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2142
01:30:35.410 --> 01:30:36.243
<v Speaker 4>flex and flex and they really shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have thrown water bottles at each other </v>

2143
01:30:39.301 --> 01:30:42.330
<v Speaker 4>and monster energy drinks or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>they did that shit stupid.</v>

2144
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:45.570
<v Speaker 4>You've got to fight eventually throw </v>
<v Speaker 4>things at each other.</v>

2145
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:47.123
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a little amped up their young </v>

2146
01:30:48.391 --> 01:30:49.224
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2147
01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:53.310
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately I think $150,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine is worth it for them.</v>

2148
01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:56.070
<v Speaker 4>The amount of money that they all made </v>
<v Speaker 4>that everybody made,</v>

2149
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>

2150
01:30:56.931 --> 01:31:01.350
<v Speaker 4>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the athletic commission gets to step in,</v>

2151
01:31:01.810 --> 01:31:04.560
<v Speaker 4>slapping a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take a little cash,</v>

2152
01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:06.180
<v Speaker 4>make a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a stink out of it.</v>

2153
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:07.560
<v Speaker 4>They get to protest it.</v>

2154
01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:08.543
<v Speaker 4>But the fact is that that press </v>
<v Speaker 4>conference where he threw that water </v>

2155
01:31:11.521 --> 01:31:14.850
<v Speaker 4>bottle at nate diaz is probably worth </v>
<v Speaker 4>$400,000</v>

2156
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:17.390
<v Speaker 4>as far as profit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2157
01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.990
<v Speaker 4>how many more people got hyped up for </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

2158
01:31:18.991 --> 01:31:21.150
<v Speaker 4>People love a fight at a press </v>
<v Speaker 4>conference.</v>

2159
01:31:21.151 --> 01:31:23.100
<v Speaker 4>They love when someone throws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't do it.</v>

2160
01:31:23.101 --> 01:31:24.060
<v Speaker 4>Folks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're listening,</v>

2161
01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:25.163
<v Speaker 4>jon jones and daniel cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was one of the reasons why that </v>

2162
01:31:27.121 --> 01:31:29.440
<v Speaker 4>fight became such a big deal because at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the face off,</v>

2163
01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:31.200
<v Speaker 4>did they have to pay any fines after?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah,</v>

2164
01:31:31.201 --> 01:31:32.460
<v Speaker 4>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2165
01:31:32.490 --> 01:31:34.380
<v Speaker 4>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much they paid.</v>

2166
01:31:34.670 --> 01:31:35.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's what the problem is.</v>

2167
01:31:35.911 --> 01:31:38.010
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they want to discourage anybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>from doing this further.</v>

2168
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:42.640
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they want to say it's as oldest </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight at any fight game is and it's also</v>

2169
01:31:42.641 --> 01:31:43.474
<v Speaker 4>a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the John Jones one in particular </v>

2170
01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:47.003
<v Speaker 4>was fucking real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When daniel put his hand on john's neck </v>

2171
01:31:49.981 --> 01:31:51.720
<v Speaker 4>and pushed him back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>john was like,</v>

2172
01:31:51.721 --> 01:31:52.440
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>

2173
01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.000
<v Speaker 4>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just not happening.</v>

2174
01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:58.540
<v Speaker 4>He didn't give a shit if there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>million people around 50,000.</v>

2175
01:31:58.630 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So john was fine.</v>

2176
01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:00.814
<v Speaker 4>$50,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>and was ordered to complete 40 hours of </v>

2177
01:32:02.981 --> 01:32:05.610
<v Speaker 4>community service and cormier was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>$9,000</v>

2178
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:08.290
<v Speaker 4>in order to complete 20 hours of </v>
<v Speaker 4>community service.</v>

2179
01:32:08.291 --> 01:32:12.710
<v Speaker 4>So they made a distinction that core me </v>
<v Speaker 4>a was less guilty than john,</v>

2180
01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:18.300
<v Speaker 4>but cormier touched him first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he?</v>

2181
01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.233
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He grabbed his neck and pushed him back </v>

2182
01:32:20.051 --> 01:32:20.884
<v Speaker 4>because john got face to face with them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and touch bases with the fines </v>

2183
01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.493
<v Speaker 4>constituted 10th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 percent of each fighters respect </v>

2184
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:30.130
<v Speaker 4>purse for the January 3rd fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2185
01:32:30.131 --> 01:32:32.110
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't even make sense.</v>

2186
01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:33.910
<v Speaker 4>Little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how little they made because that</v>

2187
01:32:33.911 --> 01:32:34.744
<v Speaker 4>really makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Night 90 grand really for the title </v>

2188
01:32:38.411 --> 01:32:39.760
<v Speaker 4>fight it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2189
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:40.623
<v Speaker 4>That sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what their deal is because </v>

2190
01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:43.624
<v Speaker 4>they get paid and then they have like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have like a reported pay and then </v>

2191
01:32:47.291 --> 01:32:50.610
<v Speaker 4>they have a different pay like </v>
<v Speaker 4>percentage of paper views and a bunch of</v>

2192
01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:51.453
<v Speaker 4>different stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they always show it in the papers </v>

2193
01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:54.700
<v Speaker 4>and they don't show locker room bonuses.</v>

2194
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:57.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do show get mad at me when you show</v>

2195
01:32:57.521 --> 01:32:58.280
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if you go,</v>

2196
01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:01.240
<v Speaker 4>if you go to a I fall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have to go to yahoo news.</v>

2197
01:33:01.241 --> 01:33:04.390
<v Speaker 4>It tells you the whole purse breakdowns </v>
<v Speaker 4>for everybody and then the bonus for the</v>

2198
01:33:04.391 --> 01:33:06.510
<v Speaker 4>nightly bonus and the percentage bonus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2199
01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:09.160
<v Speaker 4>they do performance of the night bonuses</v>
<v Speaker 4>that make that public,</v>

2200
01:33:09.161 --> 01:33:09.994
<v Speaker 4>but they also do some weird locker room </v>
<v Speaker 4>bonus thing that I don't know what the </v>

2201
01:33:13.511 --> 01:33:14.344
<v Speaker 4>fuck that's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what did they do to private </v>

2202
01:33:17.531 --> 01:33:18.580
<v Speaker 4>companies?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The point,</v>

2203
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:20.790
<v Speaker 4>and it may just find roy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2204
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:22.560
<v Speaker 4>they going to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did he say?</v>

2205
01:33:22.570 --> 01:33:23.403
<v Speaker 4>What'd you just put up</v>

2206
01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:24.913
<v Speaker 9>is jones' attorney was arguing that they</v>
<v Speaker 9>shouldn't be paying off a percentage of </v>

2207
01:33:27.630 --> 01:33:28.463
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>of their purses and courtney a is </v>

2208
01:33:31.221 --> 01:33:35.240
<v Speaker 9>scheduled to make a base pay of 90 for </v>
<v Speaker 9>the fight and also possible $90,000</v>

2209
01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:36.330
<v Speaker 9>bonus.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So</v>

2210
01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:40.280
<v Speaker 4>seems like a really low amounT.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2211
01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:41.870
<v Speaker 4>It feels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels like that's not right.</v>

2212
01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.713
<v Speaker 4>It's 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what it's so low to be fighting </v>

2213
01:33:44.911 --> 01:33:49.440
<v Speaker 4>for the world title seems wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it seems incorrect.</v>

2214
01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:51.800
<v Speaker 4>Seems wrong to write it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seeing it all,</v>

2215
01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:55.140
<v Speaker 4>it's always seemed wrong to me at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highest levels.</v>

2216
01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:58.980
<v Speaker 4>Those guys are making some serious cash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what's interesting is how many,</v>

2217
01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.710
<v Speaker 4>how many people are going to reach that </v>
<v Speaker 4>level and what you're seeing is a lot of</v>

2218
01:34:01.711 --> 01:34:02.544
<v Speaker 4>people that are trying to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>generate public interest the same way </v>

2219
01:34:06.091 --> 01:34:06.924
<v Speaker 4>conor stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's like guys who really never </v>

2220
01:34:08.431 --> 01:34:09.740
<v Speaker 4>really trashed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talked before.</v>

2221
01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:12.120
<v Speaker 4>We're really in a trash talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not good at it.</v>

2222
01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:12.850
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

2223
01:34:12.850 --> 01:34:17.400
<v Speaker 4>It's awkward and it's uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's the thing is if you were,</v>

2224
01:34:17.401 --> 01:34:18.234
<v Speaker 4>if your economy mcgregor and it comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural and that's what you do and </v>

2225
01:34:20.970 --> 01:34:24.720
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're like you've got a strategy</v>

2226
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:25.583
<v Speaker 4>and your strategy is to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial guy and you're going to </v>

2227
01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:29.440
<v Speaker 4>get everybody to pay attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2228
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:30.510
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot of work,</v>

2229
01:34:30.511 --> 01:34:31.410
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2230
01:34:31.411 --> 01:34:33.550
<v Speaker 4>nate is what nate is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2231
01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:34.553
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in on one hand it's also not what </v>

2232
01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.200
<v Speaker 4>martial arts are at their best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like at the very best,</v>

2233
01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:44.573
<v Speaker 4>they're two guys who want to compete and</v>
<v Speaker 4>test themselves against each other at </v>

2234
01:34:49.831 --> 01:34:51.750
<v Speaker 4>the very highest level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>RIght?</v>

2235
01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:52.613
<v Speaker 4>And when we think of a martial artist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't think of some dude who's </v>

2236
01:34:56.010 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 4>insulting and spitting</v>

2237
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.813
<v Speaker 1>on them and throwing water bombing they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to take the thug aspect </v>

2238
01:35:01.701 --> 01:35:02.630
<v Speaker 1>out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fair.</v>

2239
01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:05.210
<v Speaker 1>When you think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think back to what it was,</v>

2240
01:35:05.211 --> 01:35:06.044
<v Speaker 1>I was Bruce Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody respecting and bowing and you </v>

2241
01:35:08.631 --> 01:35:09.770
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2242
01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:10.780
<v Speaker 1>now it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2243
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:12.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of meatheads who know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2244
01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely that too.</v>

2245
01:35:14.691 --> 01:35:18.680
<v Speaker 1>But to achieve the level of like a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>class level,</v>

2246
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you have to have so much control over </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are.</v>

2247
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:22.783
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to figure out where </v>
<v Speaker 1>all your personality pitfalls are and </v>

2248
01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:30.260
<v Speaker 1>sooth out all the bullshit in your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and concentrate on the work.</v>

2249
01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.650
<v Speaker 1>It's such a weird sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2250
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:38.000
<v Speaker 1>There's no sport that carries the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of Loss.</v>

2251
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Like mma does a boxIng as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boxing is pretty close.</v>

2252
01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.153
<v Speaker 1>But mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think in mma you can have a loss </v>

2253
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:54.020
<v Speaker 1>and still come back and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>affect you that much.</v>

2254
01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:59.210
<v Speaker 1>You think it doesn't box and boxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so fucking shady.</v>

2255
01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Inboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2256
01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:01.341
<v Speaker 1>he lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2257
01:36:01.341 --> 01:36:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need somebody else,</v>

2258
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:03.710
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2259
01:36:03.710 --> 01:36:05.960
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an undefeated record,</v>

2260
01:36:05.961 --> 01:36:09.110
<v Speaker 1>and boxing means a lot more than it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mma.</v>

2261
01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only been a few,</v>

2262
01:36:10.641 --> 01:36:11.300
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2263
01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:15.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody strives for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They strive for that gennady golovkin.</v>

2264
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:17.683
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>undefeated record as they go Into the </v>

2265
01:36:19.881 --> 01:36:21.250
<v Speaker 1>big fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2266
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:23.383
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't harm canelo I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>canelo stock rose in the floyd </v>

2267
01:36:26.631 --> 01:36:27.690
<v Speaker 1>mayweather fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2268
01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:32.450
<v Speaker 1>because he was so young and I honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at that fight as a matter of fact,</v>

2269
01:36:32.451 --> 01:36:33.284
<v Speaker 1>and I think that floyd could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped canelo in that fight if he </v>

2270
01:36:35.811 --> 01:36:37.190
<v Speaker 1>really wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

2271
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just hitting them at will and you</v>

2272
01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:40.724
<v Speaker 1>could see canelo going back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all he had to do was just put a </v>

2273
01:36:42.561 --> 01:36:43.640
<v Speaker 1>little bit more pressure on them.</v>

2274
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:48.020
<v Speaker 1>But I think floyd being somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate was like,</v>

2275
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:49.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I stopped this kid a little,</v>

2276
01:36:49.271 --> 01:36:50.480
<v Speaker 1>it might ruin his career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2277
01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really think that?</v>

2278
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

2279
01:36:52.941 --> 01:36:54.260
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2280
01:36:54.261 --> 01:36:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he's not taking any chances.</v>

2281
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:59.263
<v Speaker 1>He's boxing smart and canelo can still </v>
<v Speaker 1>pop and he carries that populate into </v>

2282
01:37:03.501 --> 01:37:04.334
<v Speaker 1>the fight and he's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if floyd opened up to try to really </v>

2283
01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.473
<v Speaker 1>hurt him and stop him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ran the risk of being countered a </v>

2284
01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:12.770
<v Speaker 1>master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>

2285
01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.520
<v Speaker 1>he's canelo is not as fast as floyd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his timing's really good.</v>

2286
01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.373
<v Speaker 1>He said it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at that time he was still very </v>

2287
01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:21.290
<v Speaker 1>green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd really was in the,</v>

2288
01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:22.880
<v Speaker 1>in the zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that fight.</v>

2289
01:37:22.881 --> 01:37:24.320
<v Speaker 1>He was just hItting them pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

2290
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:25.243
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

2291
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:27.410
<v Speaker 1>and then he would hit crank or right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand on them.</v>

2292
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:29.660
<v Speaker 1>You see canelo go back a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2293
01:37:29.661 --> 01:37:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I think canelo's chin's a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>overrated a really.</v>

2294
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:34.230
<v Speaker 1>we saw that when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2295
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:37.910
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knocked them down and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first or second round one fight.</v>

2296
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:39.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody knocked him down fairly </v>

2297
01:37:40.491 --> 01:37:41.324
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now maybe about around four or </v>

2310
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:10.403

<v Speaker 1>his skillset before he gets back in </v>

2366
01:40:26.861 --> 01:40:30.410
<v Speaker 1>defensive movement in boxing.</v>

2376
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:57.820
<v Speaker 4>a really interesting fighter as well </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's so hard to hit,</v>

2377
01:40:57.830 --> 01:41:02.350
<v Speaker 4>but he's also so aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's wEird like that's not hands down,</v>

2378
01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:06.700

2384
01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:31.900
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what hE's fighting next.</v>

2385
01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:34.870
<v Speaker 4>And nicholas volunteers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2386
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:38.470
<v Speaker 4>he's definitely putting some attention </v>
<v Speaker 4>on these.</v>

2387
01:41:38.471 --> 01:41:40.660
<v Speaker 4>A lighter split decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2388
01:41:40.810 --> 01:41:42.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever it's a split decision,</v>

2389
01:41:42.631 --> 01:41:43.870
<v Speaker 4>it could be like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could have gone either way.</v>

2390
01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:45.573
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was apparently a crazy war and he </v>

2391
01:41:46.271 --> 01:41:47.104
<v Speaker 4>wants to fight him again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think hendo bisbing should have </v>

2392
01:41:49.211 --> 01:41:53.110
<v Speaker 4>been a draw or a split decision?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the scoring system sucks.</v>

2393
01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:54.093
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people said that that first round </v>

2394
01:41:55.331 --> 01:41:56.530
<v Speaker 4>wasn't a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight round.</v>

2395
01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.240
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was more than attending.</v>

2396
01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.040
<v Speaker 4>That might've been a fucking 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven around.</v>

2397
01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:02.200
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely a 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eight for sure,</v>

2398
01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:04.870
<v Speaker 4>because he knocked him down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had him,</v>

2399
01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:05.713
<v Speaker 4>brock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's standing on top of it and bisping </v>

2400
01:42:08.621 --> 01:42:11.560
<v Speaker 4>survived for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean bisbing showed true grit.</v>

2401
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:13.510
<v Speaker 4>He got through that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He pressed on,</v>

2402
01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:16.950
<v Speaker 4>but he was in a world of shit and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think he would admit it.</v>

2403
01:42:16.951 --> 01:42:19.000
<v Speaker 4>It's face shows it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's all beat up.</v>

2404
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:21.610
<v Speaker 4>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a significant round.</v>

2405
01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.690
<v Speaker 4>And then there was another round where </v>
<v Speaker 4>handle knocked him down again,</v>

2406
01:42:25.691 --> 01:42:26.524
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>yep.</v>

2407
01:42:26.650 --> 01:42:30.340
<v Speaker 4>So that was the second or third.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to tell man,</v>

2408
01:42:30.341 --> 01:42:34.870
<v Speaker 4>but the other thing that balance that </v>
<v Speaker 4>out was that bisping was way more active</v>

2409
01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:36.483
<v Speaker 4>and you got to take that into account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like bisping was landing all </v>

2410
01:42:39.611 --> 01:42:42.320
<v Speaker 4>those shots and attacking because </v>
<v Speaker 4>handled.</v>

2411
01:42:42.321 --> 01:42:45.700
<v Speaker 4>Let them know because he was imposing </v>
<v Speaker 4>his game on henderson.</v>

2412
01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:50.350
<v Speaker 4>Then the question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is henderson's game more impactful?</v>

2413
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's less impacts.</v>

2414
01:42:52.871 --> 01:42:53.704
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then what about damage or damage </v>

2415
01:42:55.151 --> 01:42:59.530
<v Speaker 4>wise was wiscat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gave bisping a first round.</v>

2416
01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:02.500
<v Speaker 4>Who did the first judge white?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2417
01:43:02.501 --> 01:43:04.440
<v Speaker 4>fuck why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2418
01:43:04.441 --> 01:43:05.230
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all.</v>

2419
01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:07.960
<v Speaker 4>The first one is the top row is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>second round right here.</v>

2420
01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:09.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2421
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.150
<v Speaker 4>Second round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were.</v>

2422
01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.720
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eVen that guy gave him the first part.</v>

2423
01:43:12.721 --> 01:43:14.890
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you gave it to him around.</v>

2424
01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:15.610
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>
<v Speaker 4>gave a.</v>

2425
01:43:15.610 --> 01:43:19.150
<v Speaker 4>henderson was the second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then he made the first.</v>

2426
01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:22.180
<v Speaker 4>The first two rounds he made the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>night at 10.</v>

2427
01:43:22.181 --> 01:43:23.170
<v Speaker 4>Nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ten,</v>

2428
01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.020
<v Speaker 4>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Y'all made it a 10.</v>

2429
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:27.250
<v Speaker 4>Nine c.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'S not smart.</v>

2430
01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.230
<v Speaker 4>That's not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not right.</v>

2431
01:43:29.231 --> 01:43:30.700
<v Speaker 4>The minute there's a knockdown like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2432
01:43:30.701 --> 01:43:31.840
<v Speaker 4>it's got to be a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight round.</v>

2433
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:35.680
<v Speaker 4>It's not just a knock down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like a knockdown in boxing.</v>

2434
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:37.950
<v Speaker 4>Makes a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 round 10.</v>

2435
01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:39.250
<v Speaker 4>Nine route or a 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eight round.</v>

2436
01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:41.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I give them their evened up.</v>

2437
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:42.940
<v Speaker 4>It'll make it a nine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine round,</v>

2438
01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:44.620
<v Speaker 4>but for the most part it's a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight round.</v>

2439
01:43:44.621 --> 01:43:46.060
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A guy knocks the guy down,</v>

2440
01:43:46.130 --> 01:43:47.530
<v Speaker 4>knocked down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got the first one,</v>

2441
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:48.590
<v Speaker 4>the round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you've got the out,</v>

2442
01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:52.190
<v Speaker 4>but it's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no facts in mma when it comes to</v>

2443
01:43:52.191 --> 01:43:53.024
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no like one thing that happens </v>

2444
01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:58.280
<v Speaker 4>where you definitely take a point off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know that with boxing,</v>

2445
01:43:58.281 --> 01:43:59.780
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2446
01:43:59.781 --> 01:44:04.730
<v Speaker 4>with mma that wasn't just a knock down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a knock down and then followed</v>

2447
01:44:04.731 --> 01:44:08.420
<v Speaker 4>by some fucking for roche's hair raising</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground impound.</v>

2448
01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:10.640
<v Speaker 4>He got elbowed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got punched,</v>

2449
01:44:10.641 --> 01:44:12.690
<v Speaker 4>he got beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got out of their faces,</v>

2450
01:44:12.710 --> 01:44:14.210
<v Speaker 4>bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His eyes closed.</v>

2451
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:17.420
<v Speaker 4>You can't say that wasn't close to being</v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped.</v>

2452
01:44:17.630 --> 01:44:20.330
<v Speaker 4>You've to you to be on the brink of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being stopped.</v>

2453
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:25.570
<v Speaker 4>So that round I disagree with across the</v>
<v Speaker 4>board and then it's trying to figure out</v>

2454
01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:28.610
<v Speaker 4>who won the other rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was the other one.</v>

2455
01:44:28.611 --> 01:44:33.230
<v Speaker 4>We're hindou heard him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What brand was that was the second round</v>

2456
01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:34.340
<v Speaker 4>that he heard him again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2457
01:44:34.341 --> 01:44:37.010
<v Speaker 4>most things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2458
01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:37.993
<v Speaker 4>the second round he heard them again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then do you have to argue about the </v>

2459
01:44:41.121 --> 01:44:43.910
<v Speaker 4>fourth and the fifth rounds?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure out who knows?</v>

2460
01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:47.210
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a close fight,</v>

2461
01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.073
<v Speaker 4>but I could see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I coulD see the way many people thought </v>

2462
01:44:50.901 --> 01:44:54.590
<v Speaker 4>that bisping lanDed more and even though</v>
<v Speaker 4>they weren't as impactful,</v>

2463
01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:55.573
<v Speaker 4>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to add that up against the </v>

2464
01:44:58.821 --> 01:45:01.790
<v Speaker 4>lower volume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but more power by henderson.</v>

2465
01:45:02.210 --> 01:45:03.530
<v Speaker 4>It's about effectiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2466
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:05.173
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well see henderson at the end of the </v>

2467
01:45:06.321 --> 01:45:10.940
<v Speaker 4>fight looked like he just got done </v>
<v Speaker 4>sparring and bisbing looked like he just</v>

2468
01:45:10.941 --> 01:45:12.200
<v Speaker 4>got done with a fight with henderson.</v>

2469
01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:15.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we really would have looked lIke he went</v>

2470
01:45:15.981 --> 01:45:18.530
<v Speaker 4>through five rounds with one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>toughest fucking guys ever.</v>

2471
01:45:19.130 --> 01:45:23.090
<v Speaker 4>The question is who want it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the system is flawed.</v>

2472
01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:27.590
<v Speaker 4>I could see under the system that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have today that bisping won that fight.</v>

2473
01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.930
<v Speaker 4>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have volume.</v>

2474
01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:30.853
<v Speaker 4>Could see it as a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see it as a fair draw and I </v>

2475
01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:36.980
<v Speaker 4>could see that too and that would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been a very fair outcome.</v>

2476
01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:37.963
<v Speaker 4>I can see that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely don't think there's been </v>

2477
01:45:39.411 --> 01:45:43.610
<v Speaker 4>good enough to beat dan and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think dan did enough to beat bisping.</v>

2478
01:45:43.730 --> 01:45:46.430
<v Speaker 4>That's a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a real good argument and I think if</v>

2479
01:45:46.431 --> 01:45:49.730
<v Speaker 4>there's ever a fight where you could say</v>
<v Speaker 4>a draw might be justified,</v>

2480
01:45:49.731 --> 01:45:51.200
<v Speaker 4>that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look online,</v>

2481
01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:54.410
<v Speaker 4>like people think bisbing one versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>people think henderson one,</v>

2482
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:57.860
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty much split down the middle </v>
<v Speaker 4>except english people of course.</v>

2483
01:45:58.580 --> 01:45:59.413
<v Speaker 4>AnD even american people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of american people that </v>

2484
01:46:01.371 --> 01:46:03.230
<v Speaker 4>think bisbing one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2485
01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:04.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2486
01:46:04.650 --> 01:46:06.710
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a flawed system.</v>

2487
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:08.890
<v Speaker 4>The system's going judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2488
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:11.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's it called?</v>

2489
01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.150
<v Speaker 4>Medical suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2490
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:16.070
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That ain't good for you online.</v>

2491
01:46:16.410 --> 01:46:17.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they looked at fighting.</v>

2492
01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:21.050
<v Speaker 4>Let's settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody relax for a little while.</v>

2493
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:23.540
<v Speaker 4>Was you just went to war with a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>meat machine,</v>

2494
01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:25.333
<v Speaker 4>like a cleaver who was telling me that a</v>
<v Speaker 4>henderson and we're hanging out and </v>

2495
01:46:29.451 --> 01:46:33.950
<v Speaker 4>having just punched him like as a joke </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he hits a whole fucking hard.</v>

2496
01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:35.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

2497
01:46:35.001 --> 01:46:35.751
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2498
01:46:35.751 --> 01:46:38.840
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it makes sense.</v>

2499
01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:43.160
<v Speaker 4>He's just got one of those weird frames.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some people that just have power</v>

2500
01:46:43.161 --> 01:46:45.330
<v Speaker 4>that just doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.870
<v Speaker 4>Just like regular power and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2502
01:46:48.230 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 4>there's that henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that rumble thing.</v>

2503
01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:51.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to step in and crank the right </v>

2504
01:46:52.651 --> 01:46:55.080
<v Speaker 1>way in order to get power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that.</v>

2505
01:46:55.081 --> 01:46:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Just I'm going to hit you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to feel power.</v>

2506
01:46:57.430 --> 01:47:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It's dino's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's scary that john linacre kid,</v>

2507
01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:02.940
<v Speaker 1>that little guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to fight at 1:25</v>

2508
01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:03.931
<v Speaker 1>and now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2509
01:47:03.931 --> 01:47:05.670
<v Speaker 1>he's fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought at 1:35</v>

2510
01:47:05.671 --> 01:47:06.504
<v Speaker 1>in his last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ms dot weight and beat John Dodson </v>

2511
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:11.910
<v Speaker 1>and literally close decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's a,</v>

2512
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.620
<v Speaker 1>he's got that weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spooky power for a little guy for 1:35.</v>

2513
01:47:16.621 --> 01:47:17.454
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of read through the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that have that have some heavy </v>

2514
01:47:18.811 --> 01:47:19.644
<v Speaker 1>hands and he's got the heaviest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heaviest I've ever seen in this </v>

2515
01:47:22.051 --> 01:47:22.884
<v Speaker 1>division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a clobber who just gets guys up </v>

2516
01:47:25.441 --> 01:47:27.170
<v Speaker 1>against the cage and just clobbered </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2517
01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of those things where when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel the power of the first time he</v>

2518
01:47:30.541 --> 01:47:34.290
<v Speaker 1>could see in their eyes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy wouldn't golovkin hits somebody see</v>

2519
01:47:34.291 --> 01:47:35.310
<v Speaker 1>it in their face immediately.</v>

2520
01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.560
<v Speaker 1>And I've never seen people wince until </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got hit by him.</v>

2521
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's something special for sure.</v>

2522
01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:41.003
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time they get hit and you look at </v>

2523
01:47:41.530 --> 01:47:42.361

2525
01:47:44.721 --> 01:47:46.850
<v Speaker 1>per view buys though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not,</v>

2526
01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy to me though.</v>

2527
01:47:49.090 --> 01:47:50.490
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so exciting.</v>

2528
01:47:50.610 --> 01:47:52.110
<v Speaker 1>He's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there,</v>

2529
01:47:52.590 --> 01:47:53.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's with tom loffler and who's tom </v>

2530
01:47:55.561 --> 01:47:56.394
<v Speaker 1>loffler?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his promoter and it was just </v>

2531
01:47:57.570 --> 01:47:59.100
<v Speaker 1>promoter fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2532
01:47:59.101 --> 01:48:01.410
<v Speaker 1>it just that tom Walker does not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the connections.</v>

2533
01:48:01.411 --> 01:48:06.411
<v Speaker 1>I think that bob arum or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a fucking floyd made with heR.</v>

2534
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2535
01:48:07.710 --> 01:48:09.540
<v Speaker 1>What's his name there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al haymon has.</v>

2536
01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:10.890

<v Speaker 1>hoya.</v>

2538
01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:15.253
<v Speaker 1>And then there's ain't no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but alan hayman's the guy really who's </v>

2539
01:48:17.971 --> 01:48:21.330
<v Speaker 1>got all the connects and I like how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>take in fighters there too.</v>

2540
01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Like bernard hopkins is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners over there and it's a.</v>

2541
01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:26.543
<v Speaker 1>They seem to do a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a crazy thing to go from being a </v>

2542
01:48:30.031 --> 01:48:31.890
<v Speaker 1>fighter to being a promoter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2543
01:48:31.891 --> 01:48:34.140
<v Speaker 1>And then realizing you're making way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more money as a promoter.</v>

2544
01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:35.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2545
01:48:35.071 --> 01:48:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Not in the line of fire at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2546
01:48:36.901 --> 01:48:37.734
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think hopkins is going to take one </v>

2547
01:48:39.001 --> 01:48:40.290
<v Speaker 1>more fight though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2548
01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.213
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to get it out of the garden at </v>

2549
01:48:42.601 --> 01:48:43.560
<v Speaker 1>least 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

2551
01:48:48.130 --> 01:48:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Never been out of shape though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he needs a super,</v>

2552
01:48:51.751 --> 01:48:52.584
<v Speaker 1>super disciplined guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just amazing that he's willing </v>

2553
01:48:54.391 --> 01:48:56.690
<v Speaker 1>to do one more fight at this age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2554
01:48:56.730 --> 01:49:00.840
<v Speaker 1>and then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a successful promoter now you know</v>

2555
01:49:00.841 --> 01:49:03.060

2582
01:50:09.311 --> 01:50:11.140
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I remember that time was a trend</v>

2583
01:50:11.141 --> 01:50:14.090
<v Speaker 3>that is going to knock him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stopped trinidad.</v>

2584
01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.960
<v Speaker 3>He beat the shit out of trend dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't just beat the shit out of him.</v>

2585
01:50:16.961 --> 01:50:19.290
<v Speaker 3>He boxes face off before he beat the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit out of him.</v>

2586
01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:20.373

<v Speaker 3>I think it was hopkins that I'm almost </v>

2587
01:50:25.091 --> 01:50:26.470
<v Speaker 3>sure it was hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a fight.</v>

2588
01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:28.593
<v Speaker 3>This was in probably the late nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy somehow got under him and body </v>

2589
01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:38.350
<v Speaker 3>slammed him and he dislocated his </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder and they were like,</v>

2590
01:50:38.351 --> 01:50:40.680
<v Speaker 3>we could stop the fight and you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>win by ignore decision because.</v>

2591
01:50:40.690 --> 01:50:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

2592
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:44.590
<v Speaker 3>He dislocated his right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His right shoulder.</v>

2593
01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:46.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2594
01:50:46.130 --> 01:50:46.790

2596
01:50:48.021 --> 01:50:51.320
<v Speaker 4>I remember one time he wasn't gonna get </v>
<v Speaker 4>thrown out.</v>

2597
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:54.110
<v Speaker 4>He dislocated his shoulder and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped the fight.</v>

2598
01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:55.993
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they stopped the fIght because of him </v>

2599
01:50:57.291 --> 01:50:58.124
<v Speaker 4>getting thrown out of the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you got thrown othering more than </v>

2600
01:50:59.391 --> 01:50:59.920
<v Speaker 4>once.</v>

2601
01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:01.720

<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

2603
01:51:04.150 --> 01:51:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Why knew he got thrown out of the ring </v>
<v Speaker 3>against one guy?</v>

2604
01:51:06.651 --> 01:51:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I remember he showed shoulder dislocated</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he still went next round and he</v>

2605
01:51:11.081 --> 01:51:12.640
<v Speaker 3>stopped him with his left hand.</v>

2607
01:51:13.391 --> 01:51:16.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not have been hopkins,</v>

2608
01:51:16.181 --> 01:51:17.940
<v Speaker 3>but I remember this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it?</v>

<v Speaker 4>but it was.</v>

2623
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:50.743
<v Speaker 4>He'd also had this happen before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Before this fight because Chad dawson </v>

2624
01:51:55.210 --> 01:51:58.100
<v Speaker 4>was fairly recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like in the later.</v>

2625
01:51:58.130 --> 01:51:59.660
<v Speaker 4>The late nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2626
01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:02.480
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When hopkins was not a</v>

2627
01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:06.960

<v Speaker 4>it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you just google hopkins record.</v>

2629
01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:11.093
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2633
01:52:25.890 --> 01:52:27.750
<v Speaker 3>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he fight antwan echols?</v>

2636
01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:34.290
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that was the second fight</v>

2637
01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:38.330
<v Speaker 4>because whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever threw him down.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He fought him twice.</v>

<v Speaker 8>The good fight.</v>

2663
01:53:37.290 --> 01:53:38.570
<v Speaker 8>Very good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think,</v>

2664
01:53:38.571 --> 01:53:39.404
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think andrea has the power to </v>

2665
01:53:40.221 --> 01:53:43.820
<v Speaker 8>hurt kovalev do you think it's because </v>
<v Speaker 8>he's going up to 75?</v>

2666
01:53:44.250 --> 01:53:46.610
<v Speaker 8>One 75 and to me it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look that impressive.</v>

2667
01:53:46.611 --> 01:53:51.100
<v Speaker 8>And once every five we only had one </v>
<v Speaker 8>fight at one 75 to two at two.</v>

2668
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:53.240
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I thought he just had one and uh,</v>

2669
01:53:53.630 --> 01:53:55.250
<v Speaker 8>he doesn't hit very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Who do you find it?</v>

2670
01:53:55.251 --> 01:53:56.084
<v Speaker 8>One 75.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Before that I found a dominican guy waS </v>

2671
01:53:59.301 --> 01:54:02.930
<v Speaker 8>at that fight and that was in on </v>
<v Speaker 8>ontario,</v>

2672
01:54:02.931 --> 01:54:05.120
<v Speaker 8>California.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>

2673
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:07.910
<v Speaker 8>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe that was at one 68,</v>

2674
01:54:07.911 --> 01:54:08.744
<v Speaker 8>but whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he,</v>

2675
01:54:09.010 --> 01:54:10.040
<v Speaker 8>he's fought twice now.</v>

2676
01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:11.323
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's hard when a guy has to figure out </v>

2677
01:54:12.741 --> 01:54:16.610
<v Speaker 8>what to do to order to make the big </v>
<v Speaker 8>bucks and you've got to take a chance.</v>

2678
01:54:16.611 --> 01:54:18.920
<v Speaker 8>And andrea is dominating.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's 68.</v>

2679
01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:21.200
<v Speaker 8>He's just such a good boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

2680
01:54:21.250 --> 01:54:23.120
<v Speaker 8>They're smart dude.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2681
01:54:23.121 --> 01:54:26.060
<v Speaker 8>he fought a bIg portion of his career </v>
<v Speaker 8>with a fucked up shoulder.</v>

2682
01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:27.710
<v Speaker 8>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2683
01:54:27.711 --> 01:54:29.990
<v Speaker 8>he had to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I or something.</v>

2684
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:32.690
<v Speaker 8>I don't know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he had to have been.</v>

2685
01:54:32.691 --> 01:54:34.580
<v Speaker 8>The shoulder is getting mixed up with xy</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe.</v>

2686
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:38.510
<v Speaker 8>But he finally had shoulder surgery like</v>
<v Speaker 8>two years ago.</v>

2687
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:41.270
<v Speaker 8>He had to take a full,</v>
<v Speaker 8>almost like a full year off.</v>

2688
01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:42.493
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He took a lot of time off shoulder </v>

2689
01:54:44.121 --> 01:54:45.600
<v Speaker 8>surgeries like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He,</v>

2690
01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:49.790
<v Speaker 8>he's had a lot of years off.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He keeps getting too much time off.</v>

2691
01:54:49.791 --> 01:54:53.450
<v Speaker 8>As far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean inferior like a mean boss.</v>

2692
01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:54.283
<v Speaker 8>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you're at the concern as far as I'm </v>

2693
01:54:55.851 --> 01:54:57.410
<v Speaker 8>concerned that if you have the primary I</v>
<v Speaker 8>Korea,</v>

2694
01:54:57.411 --> 01:55:00.760
<v Speaker 8>you need to be in the primary career.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2695
01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:03.440
<v Speaker 8>but if you got a jack shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not goddamn thing you can do about it.</v>

2696
01:55:03.441 --> 01:55:05.390
<v Speaker 8>True little rotator cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Never hurt.</v>

2697
01:55:05.391 --> 01:55:08.570
<v Speaker 8>Nobody heard.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A lot of people they boxers.</v>

2698
01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:10.880
<v Speaker 8>It's really common.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They get shoulder injuries,</v>

2699
01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:15.390
<v Speaker 8>but I'm from overextending from modern </v>
<v Speaker 8>things,</v>

2700
01:55:15.690 --> 01:55:16.523
<v Speaker 8>just sparring and I know guys that have </v>
<v Speaker 8>had their biceps torn off because there </v>

2701
01:55:20.741 --> 01:55:24.080
<v Speaker 8>were sparring and they threw a punch and</v>
<v Speaker 8>someone blocked the punch,</v>

2702
01:55:24.110 --> 01:55:24.943
<v Speaker 8>like an got in the way and just the full</v>
<v Speaker 8>extension being caught like halfway and </v>

2703
01:55:28.551 --> 01:55:29.384
<v Speaker 8>then pop.</v>
<v Speaker 8>TheY got a torn bicep tendon and that's </v>

2704
01:55:32.211 --> 01:55:34.190
<v Speaker 8>why I don't know guys.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2705
01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:37.490
<v Speaker 8>if you do a lot of curls,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you really should be careful because you</v>

2706
01:55:37.491 --> 01:55:38.324
<v Speaker 8>can break that thing and when it breaks </v>
<v Speaker 8>it pulls up and not like you never seen </v>

2707
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:43.950
<v Speaker 8>matt serra's harm.</v>

2708
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:45.300
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's hers.</v>

2709
01:55:45.301 --> 01:55:48.600
<v Speaker 8>Got one bicep that broke and then curled</v>
<v Speaker 8>up.</v>

2710
01:55:48.810 --> 01:55:50.070
<v Speaker 8>They can't fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2711
01:55:50.071 --> 01:55:50.904
<v Speaker 8>they could have right after it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like if you go to the hospital right </v>

2712
01:55:54.061 --> 01:55:54.894
<v Speaker 8>after it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they reattach it and then you could fix </v>

2713
01:55:56.761 --> 01:55:59.700
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like an achilles tear almost.</v>

2714
01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:01.883
<v Speaker 8>When your achilles snaps here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>doesn't your ankle just go loose like </v>

2715
01:56:03.721 --> 01:56:06.510
<v Speaker 8>that up like a rubber band?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2716
01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:10.440
<v Speaker 8>it's like that in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but apparently it just looks bad.</v>

2717
01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:12.900
<v Speaker 8>Like iT pulls up and it hangs up there </v>
<v Speaker 8>and it looks bad,</v>

2718
01:56:12.901 --> 01:56:15.130
<v Speaker 8>but it doesn't really affect the </v>
<v Speaker 8>movement of your arm.</v>

2719
01:56:15.131 --> 01:56:15.964
<v Speaker 8>so a lot of guys don't do anything about</v>
<v Speaker 8>it and they just didn't even get it </v>

2720
01:56:18.331 --> 01:56:19.164
<v Speaker 8>fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They just leave it with that weird </v>

2721
01:56:20.221 --> 01:56:21.210
<v Speaker 8>lumping.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't,</v>

2722
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:24.070
<v Speaker 8>it's got to hurt on some level.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

2723
01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:25.020
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I guess it doesn't,</v>

2724
01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:27.390
<v Speaker 8>not according to matt serra,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know.</v>

2725
01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:29.880
<v Speaker 8>Well he's the terror.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He is the terror.</v>

2726
01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:32.940
<v Speaker 8>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2727
01:56:32.941 --> 01:56:34.770
<v Speaker 8>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's not a goddamn thing in the world</v>

2728
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:37.620
<v Speaker 8>that beats your body up more than mma </v>
<v Speaker 8>and maybe football.</v>

2729
01:56:38.250 --> 01:56:41.260
<v Speaker 8>She knows two thinGs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would much rather watch mma.</v>

2730
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:43.440
<v Speaker 8>FooTball,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't understand football on any day.</v>

2731
01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:45.420
<v Speaker 8>It's because you canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're luckier here.</v>

2732
01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.990
<v Speaker 8>Luckily we let you in.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know,</v>

2733
01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:47.720
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2734
01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:48.630
<v Speaker 8>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Where's that?</v>

2735
01:56:48.631 --> 01:56:50.120
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>where's sarah?</v>

2736
01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:51.990
<v Speaker 8>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2737
01:56:51.991 --> 01:56:54.060
<v Speaker 8>you can see he's missing a chunk of his </v>
<v Speaker 8>arm,</v>

2738
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:56.400
<v Speaker 8>his bicep,</v>
<v Speaker 8>his right bicep.</v>

2739
01:56:56.401 --> 01:57:00.560
<v Speaker 8>It's like the front part of it from the </v>
<v Speaker 8>elbow towards the shoulder.</v>

2740
01:57:00.770 --> 01:57:02.400
<v Speaker 8>My bicep.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2741
01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:06.210
<v Speaker 8>I just got a chunk torn out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it doesn't affect his movement,</v>

2742
01:57:06.690 --> 01:57:07.800
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's weird.</v>

2743
01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:11.840
<v Speaker 8>It just looks odd,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but that's a.</v>

2744
01:57:11.841 --> 01:57:16.841
<v Speaker 8>That's one that breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The human body is very fucking soft when</v>

2745
01:57:18.031 --> 01:57:23.031
<v Speaker 8>it comes to the of the durability of </v>
<v Speaker 8>animals and they see how fucking goddamn</v>

2746
01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:24.540
<v Speaker 8>flimsy.</v>

2747
01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:25.590
<v Speaker 8>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Russell peTers,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Animals.</v>

2749
01:57:28.441 --> 01:57:32.530

<v Speaker 8>They figured out how the.</v>

2750
01:57:32.630 --> 01:57:34.470
<v Speaker 8>They know exactly how to stay in their </v>
<v Speaker 8>lane.</v>

2751
01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:36.450
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>they definitely do that.</v>

2752
01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:38.850
<v Speaker 8>Humans that are always like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:39.833
<v Speaker 8>there's no renaissance animals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There should be who didn't know </v>

2754
01:57:43.711 --> 01:57:45.240
<v Speaker 8>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2755
01:57:45.241 --> 01:57:46.490
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they can fly.</v>

2756
01:57:46.890 --> 01:57:49.570
<v Speaker 8>They know how to swim like a water.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The renaissance and yeah,</v>

2757
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:52.650
<v Speaker 8>give a hoot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was a fucking creeps man.</v>

2758
01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:55.380
<v Speaker 8>I remember when I first moved to </v>
<v Speaker 8>California and island,</v>

2759
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:56.850
<v Speaker 8>they're super violent.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2760
01:57:56.851 --> 01:57:57.980
<v Speaker 8>they're predators.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2761
01:57:58.260 --> 01:57:59.093
<v Speaker 8>When I first moved to California,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I saw an owl that was flying off with a </v>

2762
01:58:02.101 --> 01:58:06.390
<v Speaker 8>rabbit and dropped the rabbit and a </v>
<v Speaker 8>because I was,</v>

2763
01:58:06.650 --> 01:58:08.100
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he had killed his rabbit,</v>

2764
01:58:08.101 --> 01:58:12.930
<v Speaker 8>I guess real close to the road and as I </v>
<v Speaker 8>was driving he tried to fly off with the</v>

2765
01:58:12.931 --> 01:58:14.820
<v Speaker 8>rabbit and then decided,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fuck this,</v>

2766
01:58:14.821 --> 01:58:17.940
<v Speaker 8>I'm not getting away fast enough and </v>
<v Speaker 8>just drop the rabbit and then flew.</v>

2767
01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:19.073
<v Speaker 8>SO I see him fly off with the rabbit and</v>
<v Speaker 8>his talents and then go fuck this and </v>

2768
01:58:24.541 --> 01:58:27.030
<v Speaker 8>just release it and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the rabbIt hits the ground.</v>

2769
01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:28.073
<v Speaker 8>So I get out of my car and look at the </v>
<v Speaker 8>rabbit and the rabbit is just </v>

2770
01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:34.370
<v Speaker 8>eviscerated.</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's just torn its guts out and I'm,</v>

2771
01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:38.370
<v Speaker 8>I'm sitting there going like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is not what I think of when I think</v>

2772
01:58:38.371 --> 01:58:39.560
<v Speaker 8>of an owl.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2773
01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:41.883
<v Speaker 8>I think</v>

2774
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:45.730
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even stunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I knew they ate rats and rodents</v>

2775
01:58:45.731 --> 01:58:46.564
<v Speaker 4>and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't think they literally will </v>

2776
01:58:48.341 --> 01:58:50.290
<v Speaker 4>take out something that's their size.</v>

2777
01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't play.</v>

2778
01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:54.110
<v Speaker 1>They got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got big old talents on them.</v>

2779
01:58:54.111 --> 01:58:55.010
<v Speaker 1>That's Why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2780
01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Be in a bad attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2781
01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.353
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking cunts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sea hawks circling my backyard a lot </v>

2782
01:59:00.981 --> 01:59:04.040
<v Speaker 1>lately because I have a puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no.</v>

2783
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:05.530
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2784
01:59:05.730 --> 01:59:08.510
<v Speaker 1>so what we do is when we see these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually it starts with one,</v>

2785
01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:10.550
<v Speaker 1>then you see two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you see three and four.</v>

2786
01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:11.443
<v Speaker 1>jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get my assistant to take out his </v>

2787
01:59:12.771 --> 01:59:15.080
<v Speaker 1>drone and he flies it up and scare some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's a good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2789
01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:19.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good move.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you exactly how he did it.</v>

2914
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:44.940
<v Speaker 3>I remember the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clearly he would,</v>

2915
02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:46.013
<v Speaker 3>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went to where there was two trees </v>

2916
02:04:47.550 --> 02:04:51.150
<v Speaker 3>side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he built up a little fort in this one</v>

2917
02:04:51.151 --> 02:04:51.984
<v Speaker 3>tree and then he tied a bull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a blu walks around the other tree and </v>

2918
02:04:56.731 --> 02:05:00.240
<v Speaker 3>then he went and sat up in the tree at </v>
<v Speaker 3>around fiVe,</v>

2919
02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:01.253
<v Speaker 3>6:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the evening and he sat there and I'm </v>

2920
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:05.280
<v Speaker 3>reading magazines and stuff.</v>

2921
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:06.663
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he knew when the night falls </v>

2922
02:05:08.910 --> 02:05:09.743
<v Speaker 3>that tiger would come out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then as soon as the bull started </v>

2923
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:15.000
<v Speaker 3>going crazy and running around the tree </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot because he knew he was scared.</v>

2924
02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:17.450
<v Speaker 3>My dad was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had the shotgun with them,</v>

2925
02:05:17.451 --> 02:05:18.610
<v Speaker 3>a three or a three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait,</v>

2926
02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:20.280
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2927
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:25.530
<v Speaker 3>and he had his flashlight and the minute</v>
<v Speaker 3>his flashlight touched the barrel of the</v>

2928
02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:28.590
<v Speaker 3>gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made a metal noise.</v>

2929
02:05:28.650 --> 02:05:29.483
<v Speaker 3>And then as soon as he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tiger looked up at him and instead </v>

2930
02:05:32.461 --> 02:05:35.490
<v Speaker 3>of going for the ox leap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight up my dad and the tree.</v>

2931
02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:38.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad just fumbled and shot and hit him</v>

2932
02:05:38.371 --> 02:05:41.250
<v Speaker 3>right here in the throat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

2933
02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Flipped Back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he,</v>

2934
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:46.910
<v Speaker 3>he flashed the flashlight on his eyes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if they were so glossy.</v>

2935
02:05:47.330 --> 02:05:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Let me put another shot and just for </v>
<v Speaker 3>safety and we have that skin to the holy</v>

2936
02:05:54.511 --> 02:05:56.940
<v Speaker 3>shit you're done with gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>

2937
02:05:56.960 --> 02:05:58.850
<v Speaker 3>it's at my house in kits and not in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

2938
02:05:59.510 --> 02:06:04.510
<v Speaker 3>We have it in Canada and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I want to bring it here,</v>

2939
02:06:05.070 --> 02:06:06.830
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if we'll be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2940
02:06:06.831 --> 02:06:07.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2941
02:06:07.690 --> 02:06:10.200
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to get some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>historical exemption.</v>

2942
02:06:10.201 --> 02:06:11.034
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2943
02:06:11.150 --> 02:06:13.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what paperwork I need for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2944
02:06:13.081 --> 02:06:14.820
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's hard to prove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2945
02:06:14.821 --> 02:06:15.090
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2946
02:06:15.090 --> 02:06:17.130
<v Speaker 4>that seems like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

2947
02:06:17.340 --> 02:06:18.173
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what happens when they find </v>

2948
02:06:19.651 --> 02:06:23.460
<v Speaker 4>those things and they were illegal is </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to donate them to museums.</v>

2949
02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:24.441
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2950
02:06:24.441 --> 02:06:26.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to lose that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's family heirloom because um,</v>

2951
02:06:26.850 --> 02:06:29.460
<v Speaker 4>I remember reading about someone getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>arrested.</v>

2952
02:06:30.150 --> 02:06:30.983
<v Speaker 4>It was a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say it was like the seventies </v>

2953
02:06:33.091 --> 02:06:37.080
<v Speaker 4>or the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone got arrested with tiger skins.</v>

2954
02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:41.180
<v Speaker 4>They had some tiger skins that were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2955
02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:44.490
<v Speaker 4>obtainEd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them was obtained illegally.</v>

2956
02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:46.290
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2957
02:06:46.410 --> 02:06:49.800
<v Speaker 4>but it was illegally in like 1937 when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they shot it in.</v>

2958
02:06:49.801 --> 02:06:51.910
<v Speaker 4>This person had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a couple of them,</v>

2959
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:54.810
<v Speaker 4>they were in trouBle because when that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens,</v>

2960
02:06:54.811 --> 02:06:59.811
<v Speaker 4>if someone sells you one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's apparently your responsibility.</v>

2961
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.930
<v Speaker 4>Since it's abandoned item.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2962
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:02.783
<v Speaker 4>to bRing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to bring it to like somewhere </v>

2963
02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:06.450
<v Speaker 4>and then they have to post it or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2964
02:07:06.451 --> 02:07:08.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're not alloWed to possess </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2965
02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:10.150
<v Speaker 4>So if you do possess it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can</v>

2966
02:07:10.290 --> 02:07:12.450
<v Speaker 3>big trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2967
02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:17.430
<v Speaker 3>this was all properly gotten and </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly imported into Canada.</v>

2968
02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:20.940
<v Speaker 3>But what part of India did this take </v>
<v Speaker 3>place?</v>

2969
02:07:21.210 --> 02:07:24.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a part is a small railway village</v>

2970
02:07:24.031 --> 02:07:24.864
<v Speaker 3>called boron poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of in the middle of the </v>

2971
02:07:26.641 --> 02:07:29.370
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that anywhere near the sunderbans?</v>

2972
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot confirm nor deny that</v>

2973
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:33.403
<v Speaker 4>that was the subject of this documentary</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw where they were talking about of </v>

2974
02:07:37.321 --> 02:07:38.154
<v Speaker 4>thE cinder benz is a very unusual </v>
<v Speaker 4>section of the river system in India </v>

2975
02:07:43.961 --> 02:07:47.440
<v Speaker 4>because it's very brackish from like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>long Period of tiMe.</v>

2976
02:07:47.650 --> 02:07:48.483
<v Speaker 4>AnD these animals apparently drink the </v>
<v Speaker 4>water and the water has a high salt </v>

2977
02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:57.031
<v Speaker 4>content and it was super irritable to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tigers and he thinks they make.</v>

2978
02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:57.993
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the theories theY make the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tiger's more aggressive because they're </v>

2979
02:08:00.521 --> 02:08:01.354
<v Speaker 4>just in pain all the time from drinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>salty water and they've killed some </v>

2980
02:08:06.130 --> 02:08:09.010
<v Speaker 4>insane amount of people over the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple hundred years.</v>

2981
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:13.510
<v Speaker 4>I think it's somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood of 200 plus thousand people</v>

2982
02:08:13.810 --> 02:08:17.830
<v Speaker 4>have been killed by tigers in the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple hundred years in this area.</v>

2983
02:08:18.050 --> 02:08:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I remember going there when I was 11 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>12 around that age anD my dad took us.</v>

2984
02:08:24.170 --> 02:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>We went to my grandmother's who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>still lived out there and uh,</v>

2985
02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:29.480
<v Speaker 1>he took us for a walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all had to carry guns.</v>

2986
02:08:29.540 --> 02:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I was 11 walking around with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

2987
02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:34.540
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody had to carry a gun because you</v>

2988
02:08:34.541 --> 02:08:36.240
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took us to like a,</v>

2989
02:08:36.370 --> 02:08:41.000
<v Speaker 1>like a river and you could see fresh </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiger prints in the mud and he was like,</v>

2992
02:08:43.911 --> 02:08:44.744
<v Speaker 1>My dad was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go that way because that's where </v>

2993
02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:47.300
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of the car.</v>

3011
02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:37.130
<v Speaker 1>She apparently got mad at somebody in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>

3012
02:09:37.131 --> 02:09:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who,</v>

02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:38.613
<v Speaker 4>but she got out and she survived her mom</v>
<v Speaker 4>who got out to chase the tiger away </v>

3014
02:09:42.821 --> 02:09:44.020
<v Speaker 4>after the tiger pulled her off.</v>

3015
02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:45.850
<v Speaker 1>The mom got killed.</v>

3020
02:09:56.370 --> 02:09:57.203
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hadn't been fully a forerunner of </v>

3021
02:09:59.511 --> 02:10:02.030
<v Speaker 1>the dangers and left the vehicle because</v>

02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>She was car sick bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was carjacked.</v>

3026
02:10:14.210 --> 02:10:16.580

<v Speaker 4>She gets out,</v>

3027
02:10:16.610 --> 02:10:20.180
<v Speaker 4>she storms over to the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other person gets out.</v>

3028
02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:20.580
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:22.020
<v Speaker 1>and she's arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

02:10:22.021 --> 02:10:23.550
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you right now,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The time we just ran out and grabbed her</v>

3033
02:10:29.821 --> 02:10:30.654
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then someone else goes out after </v>

3034
02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:34.213
<v Speaker 1>tiger</v>

3035
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:36.260
<v Speaker 8>and then a park ranger.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3036
02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:40.060
<v Speaker 8>park ranger runs in there anD that's all</v>
<v Speaker 8>we see it looked.</v>

3037
02:10:40.190 --> 02:10:42.890
<v Speaker 8>It looked like a tiger and was the </v>
<v Speaker 8>easiest lunch I've ever had.</v>

3038
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:44.323
<v Speaker 8>Tiger probably couldn't help himself.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Finally saw something they could jack </v>

3039
02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:49.220
<v Speaker 8>and best yet she wasn't paying </v>
<v Speaker 8>attention.</v>

3040
02:10:49.221 --> 02:10:51.110
<v Speaker 8>So her back was turned.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>

3041
02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:52.153
<v Speaker 8>You ever see those videos of the tigers?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like creeping up on people when they're </v>

3042
02:10:54.531 --> 02:10:56.240
<v Speaker 8>sitting with their back to the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Crazy.</v>

3043
02:10:56.300 --> 02:10:58.930
<v Speaker 8>They just dive on the back of them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That can't help themselves.</v>

3044
02:10:58.931 --> 02:11:00.680
<v Speaker 8>It's wHat they do.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're being tigers.</v>

3045
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:01.723
<v Speaker 8>They are being tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Tigers too busy being tigers when you </v>

3046
02:11:04.131 --> 02:11:05.160
<v Speaker 8>don't check and tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

3047
02:11:05.170 --> 02:11:06.800
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying to find this picture of my </v>
<v Speaker 8>dad.</v>

3048
02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:07.940
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the tiger rug,</v>

3049
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:13.200
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>says you have to sign a piece of like a,</v>

3050
02:11:13.530 --> 02:11:16.400
<v Speaker 8>a waiver that says you will knock it out</v>
<v Speaker 8>of your car once you enter the park.</v>

3051
02:11:16.410 --> 02:11:19.760
<v Speaker 8>And she thought it was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wasn't that no one explained it to her.</v>

3052
02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:21.090
<v Speaker 8>What does she think she's doing?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3053
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:25.700
<v Speaker 8>she might've not been paying attention </v>
<v Speaker 8>and not knowing that stuff.</v>

3054
02:11:25.701 --> 02:11:28.700
<v Speaker 8>But if somebody explains it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how the fuck did they just let you drive</v>

3055
02:11:28.701 --> 02:11:30.500
<v Speaker 8>around your own car where they have </v>
<v Speaker 8>tigers?</v>

3056
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:31.990
<v Speaker 8>China doesn't give a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>

3057
02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:34.760
<v Speaker 8>It's just such a ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 8>ballsy.</v>

3058
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:38.480
<v Speaker 8>They would never have that in America </v>
<v Speaker 8>with the liability insurance that people</v>

3059
02:11:38.481 --> 02:11:41.460
<v Speaker 8>have to carry over here in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They have a place called african lion so</v>

3060
02:11:41.461 --> 02:11:42.294
<v Speaker 8>far.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When I was a kid we used to go and you </v>

3061
02:11:43.441 --> 02:11:46.550
<v Speaker 8>drive through with your own car and </v>
<v Speaker 8>there was.</v>

3062
02:11:46.551 --> 02:11:47.530
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there was lions,</v>

3063
02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:49.233
<v Speaker 8>there was giraffes and monkeys would </v>
<v Speaker 8>jump on your car and fuck up your </v>

3064
02:11:52.941 --> 02:11:53.774
<v Speaker 8>antenna.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And there was a place like that in New </v>

3065
02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:59.370
<v Speaker 8>Jersey that I went to where the monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 8>would jump on your car need?</v>

3066
02:11:59.470 --> 02:12:00.303
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They'd pull people's windshield wipers </v>

3067
02:12:01.371 --> 02:12:02.204
<v Speaker 8>off and they were really Destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But there's a big difference between </v>

3068
02:12:05.331 --> 02:12:08.240
<v Speaker 8>that elian.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You guys had lions.</v>

3069
02:12:08.630 --> 02:12:11.090
<v Speaker 8>It was called african lions for.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't believe I saw lion.</v>

3070
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:13.603
<v Speaker 8>Do you remember the monkeys fucking up </v>
<v Speaker 8>the car and then my mom telling me that </v>

3071
02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:21.440
<v Speaker 8>recently when I was home that we should </v>
<v Speaker 8>take my daughter to go see african lines</v>

3072
02:12:21.441 --> 02:12:23.810
<v Speaker 8>of argument going in my fucking card.</v>
<v Speaker 8>African lions.</v>

3073
02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:28.920
<v Speaker 8>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I saw a bobcat and a bunch of moms are a</v>

3074
02:12:28.941 --> 02:12:31.610
<v Speaker 8>bunch of babies.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 8>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3076
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:34.260
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

3077
02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:35.093
<v Speaker 8>I was in tone ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're driving on this road and this </v>

3078
02:12:37.641 --> 02:12:40.640
<v Speaker 8>bobcat and I think I want to say two or </v>
<v Speaker 8>three babies,</v>

3079
02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.430
<v Speaker 8>but I saw it so briefly and I knew that </v>
<v Speaker 8>it was a cat.</v>

3080
02:12:43.431 --> 02:12:44.264
<v Speaker 8>I saw it so briefly and the guys I was </v>
<v Speaker 8>with thought it was a cat that in my </v>

3081
02:12:47.001 --> 02:12:49.430
<v Speaker 8>mind I had saw I'd seen a cougar.</v>

3082
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:54.910
<v Speaker 8>I'd seen a small cougar and some cougar </v>
<v Speaker 8>puppies when they explained to me that,</v>

3083
02:12:55.170 --> 02:12:55.711
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

3084
02:12:55.711 --> 02:12:56.151
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

3085
02:12:56.151 --> 02:12:56.984
<v Speaker 8>It was a bobcat.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then I had to look into my memory and I </v>

3086
02:12:59.091 --> 02:13:01.550
<v Speaker 8>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how much of my memory is concocted?</v>

3087
02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:06.910
<v Speaker 8>How much of my memory in this situation </v>
<v Speaker 8>is Just like a total falsification?</v>

3088
02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:07.880
<v Speaker 8>I wanted it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3089
02:13:07.881 --> 02:13:10.880
<v Speaker 8>I've just filled in the blanks,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like I knew it was a living thing.</v>

3090
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:12.103
<v Speaker 8>I knew some kind of a cat and I knew it </v>
<v Speaker 8>ran awaY really quick and there was a </v>

3091
02:13:14.361 --> 02:13:17.390
<v Speaker 8>couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So when we said it was a cat,</v>

3092
02:13:17.391 --> 02:13:18.224
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh well that must have been a mountain </v>

3093
02:13:18.951 --> 02:13:20.030
<v Speaker 8>lion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Very small mountain lion.</v>

3094
02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:23.630
<v Speaker 8>And I was trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bobcats are just,</v>

3095
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:25.970
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they have really big pause.</v>

3096
02:13:25.971 --> 02:13:26.804
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that what it is,</v>

3097
02:13:26.810 --> 02:13:28.130
<v Speaker 8>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know those are links.</v>

3098
02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:30.560
<v Speaker 8>Links have really big pumps because they</v>
<v Speaker 8>walked through the snow.</v>

3099
02:13:30.650 --> 02:13:31.950
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those are weird to see.</v>

3100
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:35.730
<v Speaker 8>Men don't want to see one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I saw one of those when I was in Canada.</v>

3101
02:13:35.970 --> 02:13:36.570
<v Speaker 8>Did You?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3102
02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:38.990
<v Speaker 8>walk on the side of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'd Say nature of it.</v>

3103
02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:41.790
<v Speaker 8>I never saw whenever.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Never saw a moose.</v>

3104
02:13:41.791 --> 02:13:43.710
<v Speaker 8>Elan what's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I know,</v>

3105
02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:45.870
<v Speaker 8>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Who are you?</v>

3106
02:13:46.750 --> 02:13:47.583
<v Speaker 8>I don't know who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just not like the canadian animal or is </v>

3107
02:13:50.150 --> 02:13:53.670
<v Speaker 8>it like a duck or something?</v>
<v Speaker 8>The goose is ours.</v>

3108
02:13:53.730 --> 02:13:55.620
<v Speaker 8>Is it for real?</v>
<v Speaker 8>The Canada goose?</v>

3109
02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:57.720
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's your animal.</v>

3110
02:13:58.010 --> 02:13:58.843
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that's the only one that we </v>

3111
02:13:59.521 --> 02:14:02.580
<v Speaker 8>identify as canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but moose is definitely part of our,</v>

3112
02:14:02.581 --> 02:14:03.640
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>our,</v>

3113
02:14:03.641 --> 02:14:04.474
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>heritage in a way that's kind of </v>

3114
02:14:06.211 --> 02:14:07.044
<v Speaker 8>appropriate that you guys are the goose </v>
<v Speaker 8>and where the eagle county shitty mean </v>

3115
02:14:12.421 --> 02:14:13.920
<v Speaker 8>bird doesn't give a fuck.</v>

3116
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:18.950
<v Speaker 8>Kills everything but can be tamed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A eagle gimme.</v>

3117
02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:20.240
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>sure.</v>

3118
02:14:20.241 --> 02:14:21.074
<v Speaker 8>You can get them to sit on your arm.</v>
<v Speaker 8>was trying to one of them your eyes off </v>

3119
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:26.880
<v Speaker 8>the leather.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think you have a raise them,</v>

3120
02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:29.410
<v Speaker 8>but people definitely raise eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>

3121
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:31.440
<v Speaker 8>it's not like you can get a regular </v>
<v Speaker 8>eagle and tame them,</v>

3122
02:14:32.250 --> 02:14:33.083
<v Speaker 8>but if you raise him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sure he can get them to the point </v>

3123
02:14:34.831 --> 02:14:35.664
<v Speaker 8>where they don't try to kill you all.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't like dave's house of eagles or </v>

3124
02:14:37.531 --> 02:14:39.870
<v Speaker 8>something.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's such an awesome animal though.</v>

3125
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:44.040
<v Speaker 8>It's just amazing that there's such a </v>
<v Speaker 8>varietY of different things.</v>

3126
02:14:44.070 --> 02:14:44.903
<v Speaker 8>That's my dad killed things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's your dad's sitting on a god </v>

3127
02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:54.320
<v Speaker 8>damned man eating tiger that he killed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What a scary thing that is.</v>

3128
02:14:56.230 --> 02:14:57.330
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>another thing about it,</v>

3129
02:14:57.331 --> 02:14:59.580
<v Speaker 8>they're so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>

3130
02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:00.473
<v Speaker 8>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like you're going to be killed by </v>

3131
02:15:01.261 --> 02:15:03.180
<v Speaker 8>something that's so amazing to look at.</v>

3132
02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:05.093
<v Speaker 8>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They always say that if tigers were in </v>

3133
02:15:06.181 --> 02:15:07.530
<v Speaker 8>africa,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they would be the king of the jungle.</v>

3134
02:15:08.190 --> 02:15:09.080
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3135
02:15:09.170 --> 02:15:11.280
<v Speaker 8>Other way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Especially the big ones.</v>

3136
02:15:11.310 --> 02:15:12.143
<v Speaker 8>Bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 8>meaner.</v>

3137
02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:13.390
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're,</v>

3138
02:15:13.410 --> 02:15:15.060
<v Speaker 8>they're faster.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're like,</v>

3139
02:15:15.061 --> 02:15:15.894
<v Speaker 8>they're out in the next level to align.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was a video that I watched the </v>

3140
02:15:18.271 --> 02:15:19.560
<v Speaker 8>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Ligers real.</v>

3141
02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:21.140
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Lions are real,</v>

3142
02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:23.910
<v Speaker 8>but laggers tend to be like docile for </v>
<v Speaker 8>some strange reason.</v>

3143
02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:26.670
<v Speaker 8>You don't think anybody's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 8>attacked by a lagger.</v>

3144
02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:27.833
<v Speaker 8>They also have some weird growth thing </v>
<v Speaker 8>going on where the whatever regulates </v>

3145
02:15:30.121 --> 02:15:31.740
<v Speaker 8>growth,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

3146
02:15:31.850 --> 02:15:32.790
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

3147
02:15:32.850 --> 02:15:34.140
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't work on them.</v>

3148
02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:35.460
<v Speaker 8>That's a lagger.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3149
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:36.343
<v Speaker 8>There are so huge.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're like way bigger than regular </v>

3150
02:15:37.681 --> 02:15:39.450
<v Speaker 8>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look at the belly on that guy though.</v>

3151
02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:41.160
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're fucking giant.</v>

3152
02:15:41.161 --> 02:15:43.830
<v Speaker 8>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's an enormous,</v>

3153
02:15:43.831 --> 02:15:45.750
<v Speaker 8>enormous animal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

3154
02:15:45.751 --> 02:15:46.584
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whether it's the male tiger fucks the </v>

3155
02:15:48.301 --> 02:15:50.700
<v Speaker 8>female lion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that's how it goes.</v>

3156
02:15:51.150 --> 02:15:54.420
<v Speaker 8>So when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 8>apparently the,</v>

3157
02:15:54.421 --> 02:15:55.920
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>look at that.</v>

3158
02:15:55.950 --> 02:15:56.800
<v Speaker 8>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look.</v>

3159
02:15:56.940 --> 02:16:00.870
<v Speaker 8>And apparently when,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when it does happen,</v>

3160
02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:02.250
<v Speaker 8>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>cat,</v>

3161
02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:06.270
<v Speaker 8>whichever side is the lie,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't lie to the tiger,</v>

3162
02:16:06.271 --> 02:16:09.640
<v Speaker 8>one of the sides is supposed to get,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a,</v>

3163
02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:13.080
<v Speaker 8>the gene for regulating growth from the </v>
<v Speaker 8>woman,</v>

3164
02:16:13.530 --> 02:16:14.363
<v Speaker 8>but it doesn't get it from the woman or </v>
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't get it from the man because </v>

3165
02:16:16.201 --> 02:16:18.420
<v Speaker 8>the man's a tiger or the man's elian,</v>
<v Speaker 8>however,</v>

3166
02:16:18.421 --> 02:16:21.330
<v Speaker 8>the combination works.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But because it's a male and a female,</v>

3167
02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:22.433
<v Speaker 8>theY are a lion and a tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They make this new thing that doesn't </v>

3168
02:16:26.071 --> 02:16:28.610
<v Speaker 8>know when to stop growing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So It just keeps drawing.</v>

3169
02:16:28.730 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it just gives you bigger.</v>

3170
02:16:30.050 --> 02:16:31.850
<v Speaker 4>These are fabricated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are like,</v>

3171
02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:33.113
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think they can appear in the wild </v>

3172
02:16:34.421 --> 02:16:36.250
<v Speaker 4>but they don't live in the wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

3173
02:16:36.740 --> 02:16:38.160
<v Speaker 4>Two animals that are from different </v>
<v Speaker 4>parts,</v>

3174
02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:39.580
<v Speaker 4>different continents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3175
02:16:39.581 --> 02:16:41.600
<v Speaker 4>So somebody had to have put them </v>
<v Speaker 4>together at some.</v>

3176
02:16:41.690 --> 02:16:43.180
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not viable.</v>

3177
02:16:43.210 --> 02:16:45.760
<v Speaker 4>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're hybrids and it's a hybrid.</v>

3178
02:16:45.761 --> 02:16:47.170
<v Speaker 4>It's not viable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they can't.</v>

3179
02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:50.140
<v Speaker 4>It's not like a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a wolf can fuck your dog.</v>

3180
02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:53.920
<v Speaker 4>And those puppies are part wolf and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>could fuck a regular dog.</v>

3181
02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:56.800
<v Speaker 4>And there'd be no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would just keep making puppies.</v>

3182
02:16:56.801 --> 02:16:59.350
<v Speaker 4>It probably good for the gene pool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with these things,</v>

3183
02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:04.380
<v Speaker 4>even though a lion and a tiger probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>look more similar than a german shepherd</v>

3184
02:17:05.471 --> 02:17:07.120
<v Speaker 4>and a poodle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do,</v>

3185
02:17:07.121 --> 02:17:08.350
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It probably looked more simply,</v>

3186
02:17:08.351 --> 02:17:11.110
<v Speaker 4>completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not the same thing so that,</v>

3187
02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:12.400
<v Speaker 4>that baby's a hybrid.</v>

3188
02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:16.510
<v Speaker 4>So it was hybrid babies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't reproduce so they can produce</v>

3189
02:17:16.511 --> 02:17:17.950
<v Speaker 4>more ligers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3190
02:17:18.130 --> 02:17:20.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's there one litter animals.</v>

3191
02:17:20.850 --> 02:17:21.683
<v Speaker 4>But like wolf dogs will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dogs could fuck regular dogs and they </v>

3192
02:17:24.981 --> 02:17:25.814
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can get fucked by regular dogs and </v>

3193
02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:31.590
<v Speaker 4>coyotes like crazy in my backyard and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking or screaming.</v>

3194
02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:33.490
<v Speaker 4>They were screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ever killing something.</v>

3195
02:17:33.491 --> 02:17:36.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting thing.</v>

3196
02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:37.780
<v Speaker 4>Those are wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3197
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:39.970
<v Speaker 4>It's their actual wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Skinny wolves.</v>

3198
02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:41.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little tiny wolves.</v>

3199
02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:43.230
<v Speaker 4>They can mate with wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made with dough.</v>

3200
02:17:43.330 --> 02:17:44.460
<v Speaker 4>We ran into a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3201
02:17:44.461 --> 02:17:46.630
<v Speaker 4>a litter once when I was doing fear </v>
<v Speaker 4>factor.</v>

3202
02:17:46.990 --> 02:17:47.823
<v Speaker 4>We're in this really rural area where </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing the stunt and we ran into a </v>

3203
02:17:51.071 --> 02:17:55.930
<v Speaker 4>litter of coyotes and a labrador </v>
<v Speaker 4>retriever.</v>

3204
02:17:55.970 --> 02:17:58.090
<v Speaker 4>Coyote had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this guy's labrador retriever.</v>

3205
02:17:59.020 --> 02:17:59.853
<v Speaker 4>And the labrador retriever gave birth </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the puppies were all outside </v>

3206
02:18:02.261 --> 02:18:03.970
<v Speaker 4>and we were trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my name mangy looking,</v>

3207
02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:05.080
<v Speaker 4>they will remain.</v>

3208
02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:07.040
<v Speaker 4>She looked and it was real sad because </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3209
02:18:07.090 --> 02:18:07.923
<v Speaker 4>there were essentially feral and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>were kind of trying to rescue them and </v>

3210
02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:12.633
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to give them to people on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the crew and people in the crew were </v>

3211
02:18:14.231 --> 02:18:17.450
<v Speaker 4>like trying to get the cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>service so they can call friends,</v>

3212
02:18:17.451 --> 02:18:19.750
<v Speaker 4>see if anybody want to take them because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize like,</v>

3213
02:18:19.751 --> 02:18:20.980
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these poor little things.</v>

3214
02:18:20.981 --> 02:18:22.660
<v Speaker 4>Like they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to die out here.</v>

3215
02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:24.790
<v Speaker 4>But there was also the thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

3216
02:18:24.791 --> 02:18:27.500
<v Speaker 4>who wants a half coyote?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants that.</v>

3217
02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:29.260
<v Speaker 4>Ain't going to Listen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3218
02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:30.500
<v Speaker 4>Wiley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>

3219
02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:32.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a wild animal.</v>

3220
02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:35.440
<v Speaker 4>A tricky little wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That fucking thing is not listening.</v>

3221
02:18:36.730 --> 02:18:37.563
<v Speaker 4>But if you had like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people were with the lab is </v>

3222
02:18:39.521 --> 02:18:42.700
<v Speaker 4>like such a calm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>peaceful dog to like bounce it out.</v>

3223
02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:43.471
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3224
02:18:43.471 --> 02:18:44.304
<v Speaker 4>It might be too.</v>

3225
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:47.680
<v Speaker 4>I might just make a really cunty lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3226
02:18:49.150 --> 02:18:49.983
<v Speaker 4>I'm having this guy on soon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a wildlife biologist who's been </v>

3227
02:18:53.411 --> 02:18:57.340
<v Speaker 4>studying all the coyotes that live in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>urban los angeles.</v>

3228
02:18:57.910 --> 02:19:01.000
<v Speaker 4>I was a big article about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about this ongoing research,</v>

3229
02:19:01.090 --> 02:19:03.670
<v Speaker 4>but just how many coyotes live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a ton of them,</v>

3230
02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:06.110
<v Speaker 4>is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've infiltrated in there.</v>

3231
02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:06.993
<v Speaker 4>They're a part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We think we'd like to think of our eco </v>

3232
02:19:08.831 --> 02:19:09.664
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3233
02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:14.820
<v Speaker 4>our cities rather as environments that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are free of anything alive other than us</v>

3234
02:19:15.281 --> 02:19:18.670
<v Speaker 4>that's dangerous or anything other than </v>
<v Speaker 4>us that's a predator.</v>

3235
02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:19.533
<v Speaker 4>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't want to think that there's </v>

3236
02:19:20.081 --> 02:19:20.914
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some thing acting as a predator in our </v>

3237
02:19:23.291 --> 02:19:25.670
<v Speaker 4>midst like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the most part.</v>

3238
02:19:25.780 --> 02:19:26.410
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3239
02:19:26.410 --> 02:19:29.000
<v Speaker 4>we like to think of cities as being </v>
<v Speaker 4>barren of wildlife,</v>

3240
02:19:29.001 --> 02:19:30.590
<v Speaker 4>but it's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3241
02:19:30.591 --> 02:19:31.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>

3242
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:33.410
<v Speaker 4>They were here before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were not even,</v>

3243
02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:34.940
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

3244
02:19:34.941 --> 02:19:35.774
<v Speaker 4>but their ranges expanded there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm reading a book right now called </v>

3245
02:19:38.691 --> 02:19:43.130
<v Speaker 4>coyote America by this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dan flores.</v>

3246
02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:47.090
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a wildlife historian,</v>

3247
02:19:47.210 --> 02:19:48.043
<v Speaker 4>turned author.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you find out about the history of </v>

3248
02:19:51.141 --> 02:19:51.974
<v Speaker 4>the coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently all dogs came from north </v>

3249
02:19:54.141 --> 02:19:56.180
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All dogs,</v>

3250
02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:58.820
<v Speaker 4>all candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including jackals,</v>

3251
02:19:58.821 --> 02:20:00.710
<v Speaker 4>including a bunch of shit that's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>africa right now.</v>

3252
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:03.050
<v Speaker 4>All came from north America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All horses,</v>

3253
02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:06.080
<v Speaker 4>zebras.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then all it all came from north America.</v>

3254
02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:07.333
<v Speaker 4>They went extinct in north America and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then we'll reintroduced later and the </v>

3255
02:20:10.581 --> 02:20:12.680
<v Speaker 4>coyotes are a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get around.</v>

3256
02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:14.840
<v Speaker 4>How don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess pangea.</v>

3257
02:20:14.841 --> 02:20:17.420
<v Speaker 4>I think it was when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the continents were all connected,</v>

3258
02:20:18.030 --> 02:20:18.863
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when there was a different </v>

3259
02:20:19.011 --> 02:20:21.230
<v Speaker 4>configuration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this fucking books,</v>

3260
02:20:21.231 --> 02:20:22.064
<v Speaker 4>amazing man talking about the history of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the coyote and how sneaky those fuckers </v>

3261
02:20:24.891 --> 02:20:25.400
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

3262
02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:29.450
<v Speaker 4>The reason why there's so many coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all across every city in America</v>

3263
02:20:29.451 --> 02:20:31.910
<v Speaker 4>today and that wasn't the case 100 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>

3264
02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:34.640
<v Speaker 4>They've expanded their range due to </v>
<v Speaker 4>persecution.</v>

3265
02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:35.713
<v Speaker 4>So when anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he shoots them when wolves come in and </v>

3266
02:20:37.881 --> 02:20:40.310
<v Speaker 4>start killing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when anything happens to them,</v>

3267
02:20:40.311 --> 02:20:43.670
<v Speaker 4>they make more babies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do that roll call that screaming in</v>

3268
02:20:43.671 --> 02:20:45.200
<v Speaker 4>the night and day when one of them's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

3269
02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:49.100
<v Speaker 4>One of them's not calling back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The females start producing more eggs.</v>

3270
02:20:49.390 --> 02:20:53.950
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy shit that go from having like</v>
<v Speaker 4>for offspring to like,</v>

3271
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

3272
02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:56.510
<v Speaker 4>for pups in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have like 15.</v>

3273
02:20:57.580 --> 02:20:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty crazy.</v>

3274
02:20:58.880 --> 02:20:59.713
<v Speaker 1>You knoW?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard when a siren goes </v>

3275
02:21:01.781 --> 02:21:02.800
<v Speaker 1>by?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sets them off?</v>

3276
02:21:02.860 --> 02:21:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear a siren and then fucking all of a</v>

3277
02:21:05.141 --> 02:21:06.760
<v Speaker 1>sudden you hear a shitload of coyotes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

3278
02:21:06.761 --> 02:21:07.594
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

3279
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:10.080
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard Turkey do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3280
02:21:10.170 --> 02:21:12.240
<v Speaker 4>When you slammed your car door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3281
02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:14.430
<v Speaker 4>If you're out in the woods and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>slammed your car door,</v>

3282
02:21:14.490 --> 02:21:17.160
<v Speaker 4>you'll hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3283
02:21:17.161 --> 02:21:20.280
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have this instinctive reaction,</v>

3284
02:21:20.281 --> 02:21:23.220
<v Speaker 4>like turkeys will gobble if you make a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Turkey call,</v>

3285
02:21:23.250 --> 02:21:24.083
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know they have the,</v>

3286
02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:27.240
<v Speaker 4>they make a call like a Turkey and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Turkey calls back,</v>

3287
02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:29.370
<v Speaker 4>but they'll also do it if you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>slammed a car door.</v>

3288
02:21:30.210 --> 02:21:33.480
<v Speaker 4>The very sensitive to sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just freak out.</v>

3289
02:21:33.690 --> 02:21:35.310
<v Speaker 4>And when they freak out they can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>handle themselves.</v>

3290
02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:39.450
<v Speaker 1>What does that meet you are cooking the </v>

<v Speaker 8>The second place that I've found that's </v>
<v Speaker 8>like a super authentic,</v>

3667
02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:47.413
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's another one in canoga park </v>

3668
02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:49.620
<v Speaker 8>that's real similar.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like a,</v>

3669
02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:51.350
<v Speaker 8>like a super market</v>

3670
02:37:51.390 --> 02:37:53.490
<v Speaker 3>rather than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they also serve food there,</v>

3671
02:37:53.491 --> 02:37:57.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's all vegetarian is more common </v>
<v Speaker 3>than not in India really,</v>

3672
02:37:57.350 --> 02:37:58.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to specify they'll,</v>

3673
02:37:58.821 --> 02:38:01.330
<v Speaker 3>they'll put on the outside vege and non </v>
<v Speaker 3>vege.</v>

3674
02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:05.850
<v Speaker 3>So why don't airplanes when they order </v>
<v Speaker 3>their food and then they screw it up.</v>

3675
02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:06.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

3676
02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:09.010
<v Speaker 3>I am a vegetable and my wife is also a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetable.</v>

3677
02:38:09.100 --> 02:38:09.920
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they say.</v>

3678
02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's true.</v>

3679
02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:14.220
<v Speaker 3>But it's good to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that that indian so predominantly</v>

3680
02:38:14.221 --> 02:38:17.670
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just alwayS has been historically.</v>

3681
02:38:17.671 --> 02:38:18.151
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3682
02:38:18.151 --> 02:38:18.984
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they revere animals quite a bit </v>

3683
02:38:20.821 --> 02:38:24.330
<v Speaker 3>and they also don't have the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't really facilitate.</v>

3684
02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm storing meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knoW?</v>

3685
02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:29.300
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We don't have refrigerators and stuff.</v>

3686
02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:30.930
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That makes sense.</v>

3687
02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:36.240
<v Speaker 8>It's easier to hang onto the vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but there are some dishes like a,</v>

3688
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:39.000
<v Speaker 8>like there's one that has rogan in it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>lamb,</v>

3689
02:38:39.001 --> 02:38:40.050
<v Speaker 8>rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 8>joe rogan,</v>

3690
02:38:40.051 --> 02:38:40.830
<v Speaker 8>josh.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>

3691
02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:42.690
<v Speaker 8>That shit is good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is good.</v>

3692
02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:44.100
<v Speaker 8>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That place in woodland hills.</v>

3693
02:38:44.101 --> 02:38:45.770
<v Speaker 8>I've had it there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Extra spicy.</v>

3694
02:38:46.050 --> 02:38:48.030
<v Speaker 8>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Joe says damn good.</v>

3695
02:38:48.060 --> 02:38:50.220
<v Speaker 8>You say josh does josh.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Josh,</v>

3696
02:38:50.390 --> 02:38:52.480
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3697
02:38:52.890 --> 02:38:53.723
<v Speaker 8>but that's a meat dish.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is that is just a small amount of thoSe </v>

3698
02:38:56.251 --> 02:38:56.980
<v Speaker 8>meat dishes?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3699
02:38:56.980 --> 02:38:57.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3700
02:38:57.350 --> 02:38:59.060
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of meat dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3701
02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:01.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more often than not you'll find,</v>

3702
02:39:01.220 --> 02:39:02.053
<v Speaker 3>you'll find it's probably easier to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>a vegetarian indian restaurant than it </v>

3703
02:39:04.431 --> 02:39:06.800
<v Speaker 3>would be to find a meat one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if,</v>

3704
02:39:06.801 --> 02:39:07.634
<v Speaker 3>unless you go from like north India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>north indians tend to eat a lot more </v>

3705
02:39:09.651 --> 02:39:10.484
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>

3706
02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:12.220
<v Speaker 8>One,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if there's a direct connection.</v>

3707
02:39:12.460 --> 02:39:14.890
<v Speaker 8>I mean India has always had like an </v>
<v Speaker 8>issue with Pakistan.</v>

3708
02:39:14.891 --> 02:39:16.720
<v Speaker 8>They'd been involved in conflicts </v>
<v Speaker 8>before.</v>

3709
02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:19.750
<v Speaker 8>But overAll when people think about </v>
<v Speaker 8>indian people,</v>

3710
02:39:19.751 --> 02:39:20.584
<v Speaker 8>people from India,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they think of them as not being like </v>

3711
02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:23.160
<v Speaker 8>war,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like to think of being.</v>

3712
02:39:23.390 --> 02:39:24.223
<v Speaker 8>It's being pretty peaceful people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I wonder if there's a correlation </v>

3713
02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:30.820
<v Speaker 8>between that and the massive amount of </v>
<v Speaker 8>people you plants only.</v>

3714
02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:34.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm a wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3715
02:39:35.310 --> 02:39:37.030
<v Speaker 3>it's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

3716
02:39:37.031 --> 02:39:37.411
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

3717
02:39:37.411 --> 02:39:38.244
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3718
02:39:38.530 --> 02:39:43.380
<v Speaker 3>there have alwayS been big on meditating</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yoga obviously is ours and yeah.</v>

3719
02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:48.600
<v Speaker 3>And centering yourself and eating hash </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating hash</v>

3720
02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:49.760
<v Speaker 8>when you go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 8>deep,</v>

3721
02:39:49.761 --> 02:39:50.241
<v Speaker 8>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 8>deep,</v>

3722
02:39:50.241 --> 02:39:51.074
<v Speaker 8>deep into the records.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They had some really crazy ancient </v>

<v Speaker 4>fishermen in it and killed one at a </v>

3746
02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:50.153

<v Speaker 4>and these guys thought about they </v>

3747
02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:54.060
<v Speaker 4>couldn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to row.</v>

3748
02:40:54.090 --> 02:40:55.850
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't roll fast in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>swim.</v>

3749
02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:56.993
<v Speaker 4>They swam faster than five guys can row </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then then for grad can row and then </v>

3750
02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:02.690
<v Speaker 4>three gaskets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rail.</v>

3752
02:41:06.601 --> 02:41:07.434
<v Speaker 4>five were killed by the same fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>tiger who's kept swimming out to the </v>

3753
02:41:11.191 --> 02:41:14.280
<v Speaker 4>boat and jacking them and then swimming </v>
<v Speaker 4>to shore with them,</v>

3754
02:41:14.780 --> 02:41:15.613
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to him it was like being at a party and </v>

3755
02:41:16.890 --> 02:41:20.480
<v Speaker 4>the order of trade was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get another one of those police.</v>

3756
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:23.790
<v Speaker 4>He chased it down with a 10 or third </v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was like,</v>

3757
02:41:23.791 --> 02:41:24.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3759
02:41:28.201 --> 02:41:32.210
<v Speaker 4>tiger running at the guy because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>turns off at the last minute.</v>

3760
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:36.780
<v Speaker 4>I think they fire a gun and scare it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's running at him at an impossible</v>

3761
02:41:36.781 --> 02:41:38.670
<v Speaker 4>rate of speed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you see it running.</v>

3762
02:41:38.671 --> 02:41:39.504
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it forces your brain to reprocess how </v>

3763
02:41:42.601 --> 02:41:43.860
<v Speaker 4>fast you can get out of the way.</v>

3764
02:41:44.270 --> 02:41:45.850
<v Speaker 4>Like I think we like to think like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3768
02:41:51.841 --> 02:41:52.674

<v Speaker 4>something or even if a coyote came at </v>

3769
02:41:55.351 --> 02:41:56.940

<v Speaker 4>It's not just going to sit there and let</v>
<v Speaker 4>you punch it in the face.</v>

3773
02:42:04.051 --> 02:42:05.550
<v Speaker 4>reality kicks back in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3774
02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:07.730
<v Speaker 4>well that's what people think they could</v>
<v Speaker 4>do to each other too.</v>

3775
02:42:08.090 --> 02:42:09.240
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys are always thinking,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking goes looking at you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

02:42:19.231 --> 02:42:22.140
<v Speaker 4>one of these and that's going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end of that and then when it's not,</v>

3781
02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:26.060
<v Speaker 4>when the guy moves his head and hits you</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a jab and kicks you in the balls,</v>

3782
02:42:26.061 --> 02:42:27.810
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no.</v>

3783
02:42:27.810 --> 02:42:29.820
<v Speaker 4>What have I done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Always.</v>

3784
02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:31.033
<v Speaker 4>Then you get beat up by his friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have in your head you have this </v>

3785
02:42:34.831 --> 02:42:37.680
<v Speaker 4>thing that tiger's going to run at me </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to get the fuck out of the</v>

3786
02:42:37.681 --> 02:42:38.514
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the guys that tried to fight nick </v>

3787
02:42:39.931 --> 02:42:42.390
<v Speaker 4>diaz and the guy in the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3788
02:42:42.391 --> 02:42:44.670
<v Speaker 4>What a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking smart plan.</v>

3789
02:42:44.671 --> 02:42:45.504
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the next time you're going to mouth </v>

3790
02:42:46.651 --> 02:42:48.210
<v Speaker 4>off to someone to look at their ears </v>
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

3791
02:42:48.780 --> 02:42:50.370
<v Speaker 4>Let's just look in his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3792
02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:52.950
<v Speaker 4>Just get scar tissue all over his </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyebrows.</v>

3793
02:42:52.951 --> 02:42:55.810
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't you just assume that that guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>has been into wild?</v>

3794
02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:58.380
<v Speaker 4>They're just drunk dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got a lot of those in this world.</v>

3795
02:42:58.560 --> 02:42:59.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make sense.</v>

3796
02:43:00.410 --> 02:43:01.243
<v Speaker 4>Even when I'm drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that stupid and that's why </v>

3797
02:43:02.581 --> 02:43:04.230
<v Speaker 4>you're Russell Peters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you not one of those dummies.</v>

3798
02:43:06.810 --> 02:43:07.643
<v Speaker 4>We need those guys to russell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true that we need to balance out </v>

3799
02:43:09.781 --> 02:43:10.614
<v Speaker 4>the ecosystem for now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've just got to raise the level of </v>

3800
02:43:13.841 --> 02:43:14.800
<v Speaker 4>dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3801
02:43:14.801 --> 02:43:17.650
<v Speaker 4>because the level of dummy today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you take the average jami,</v>

3802
02:43:17.651 --> 02:43:20.830
<v Speaker 4>like even those guys that got in a fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>with nick diaz,</v>

3803
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:23.560
<v Speaker 4>we take those guys and drop them off in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the caveman days.</v>

3804
02:43:23.561 --> 02:43:26.170
<v Speaker 4>They'd be running shit to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>smartest guy in the room.</v>

3805
02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:27.690
<v Speaker 4>They'd be able to take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

3806
02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:28.930
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys don't know shit.</v>

3807
02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:30.190
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

3808
02:43:30.191 --> 02:43:32.560
<v Speaker 4>we got to make some shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't rely on this cave.</v>

3809
02:43:32.561 --> 02:43:34.420
<v Speaker 4>The bears know where the cave is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3810
02:43:34.421 --> 02:43:35.350
<v Speaker 4>come on guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come with me.</v>

3811
02:43:35.810 --> 02:43:38.530
<v Speaker 4>They'd figure out tools like you guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't even figured out tools yet.</v>

3812
02:43:38.531 --> 02:43:40.350
<v Speaker 4>We gotta make foreman's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd be the performance.</v>

3813
02:43:40.780 --> 02:43:43.990
<v Speaker 4>You could get one of those dummies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>bring them back to the point before.</v>

3814
02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:47.530
<v Speaker 4>Monkey peopLe invented tools and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could start making tools.</v>

3815
02:43:47.740 --> 02:43:49.030
<v Speaker 4>He'd be the king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3816
02:43:49.690 --> 02:43:50.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

3817
02:43:50.030 --> 02:43:51.250
<v Speaker 4>That's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>

3818
02:43:51.430 --> 02:43:55.840
<v Speaker 4>That was only a million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So evolution is not like all of a sudden</v>

3819
02:43:55.841 --> 02:43:57.460
<v Speaker 4>now we're at point 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3820
02:43:57.550 --> 02:44:00.130
<v Speaker 4>there's still people at point six that </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys at point six,</v>

3821
02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:02.860
<v Speaker 4>that's whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People really think.</v>

3822
02:44:02.861 --> 02:44:06.370
<v Speaker 4>Evolution is a even playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's like,</v>

3823
02:44:06.371 --> 02:44:08.530
<v Speaker 4>well then how come I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're an idiot.</v>

3824
02:44:08.531 --> 02:44:12.290
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's an even playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While people don't want to admit that,</v>

3825
02:44:12.530 --> 02:44:15.010
<v Speaker 4>that life isn't fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you think it's fair to fair physically </v>

<v Speaker 4>think that you are.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Do you have a spot in your house where </v>

3872
02:46:06.401 --> 02:46:08.950
<v Speaker 4>I'll do it because then I'll have a man </v>
<v Speaker 4>cave that I can.</v>

3873

3874
02:46:11.110 --> 02:46:11.943
<v Speaker 4>You want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ideally the best move would be if you </v>

3875
02:46:14.721 --> 02:46:17.240
<v Speaker 4>had a bathroom that you could sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had a house.</v>

3876
02:46:17.340 --> 02:46:18.173
<v Speaker 4>I know you're a baller so you're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get a nice house if you have a house </v>

3877
02:46:22.371 --> 02:46:24.380
<v Speaker 4>and you could sacrifice one of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>bathrooms.</v>

3878
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:28.310
<v Speaker 4>Set it up in there so that you have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shower that's right there.</v>

3879
02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:29.233
<v Speaker 4>It's already set up for plumbing and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that jazz and I have like the guys from </v>

3880
02:46:32.451 --> 02:46:35.720
<v Speaker 4>float lab set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will value it so much.</v>

3881
02:46:36.020 --> 02:46:38.900
<v Speaker 4>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a nice place to just chill and</v>

3882
02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:41.990
<v Speaker 4>think about shit and reflect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long do you do it?</v>

3883
02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:43.993
<v Speaker 4>The least I do is an hour usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I will jump in if I only have 40 </v>

3884
02:46:47.391 --> 02:46:49.160
<v Speaker 4>minutes and I said I just want to get in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there right now.</v>

3885
02:46:49.220 --> 02:46:49.550
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

3886
02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:52.280
<v Speaker 4>we'll jump in and do like 40 minutes if </v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I have to go somewhere.</v>

3887
02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:56.210
<v Speaker 4>But honestly that is contrary to what </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good for.</v>

3888
02:46:56.211 --> 02:46:58.220
<v Speaker 4>What it's good for is like the end of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the day for me.</v>

3889
02:46:58.460 --> 02:47:01.070
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody's asleep and I can get in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing.</v>

3890
02:47:01.550 --> 02:47:02.383
<v Speaker 4>I can just</v>

3891
02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:07.270
<v Speaker 1>just totally removed myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you fell asleep in there?</v>

3892
02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:08.133
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Russell peters,</v>

3924
02:48:16.980 --> 02:48:19.780
<v Speaker 1>a lady loves to cook for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she'll cook whatever we tell it,</v>

3925
02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:21.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be hard though.</v>

3926
02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:24.790
<v Speaker 1>The real way to get your body to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight is you got to get off the fucking</v>

3927
02:48:24.791 --> 02:48:25.900
<v Speaker 1>carbs and the sugar.</v>

3928
02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:27.073
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the most addictive things in </v>

3929
02:48:28.570 --> 02:48:29.560
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3930
02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:31.173
<v Speaker 1>The key is don't torture yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>relentlessly like every now and then </v>

3931
02:48:34.691 --> 02:48:37.900
<v Speaker 1>you've got to give yourself a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give yourself a little reward.</v>

3932
02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:42.550
<v Speaker 1>When I was training with a raise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get a one day treat cheat day.</v>

3933
02:48:42.690 --> 02:48:43.523

3958
02:49:47.581 --> 02:49:48.414
<v Speaker 4>with such lust,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a guy who had been depriving </v>

3959
02:49:50.281 --> 02:49:51.650

<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

3961
02:49:53.540 --> 02:49:58.040
<v Speaker 1>It was very therapeutic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the most disgusted you ever</v>

3962
02:49:58.041 --> 02:50:00.550

3969
02:50:18.741 --> 02:50:20.250
<v Speaker 1>really wanted five guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

3970
02:50:20.660 --> 02:50:21.493
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had chicken fried steak in Montana </v>

3975
02:50:33.580 --> 02:50:37.660
<v Speaker 4>It was smothered in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this delicious gravy.</v>

3976
02:50:39.730 --> 02:50:42.220
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get that from healthy food.</v>

3977
02:50:42.780 --> 02:50:43.390
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3978

<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>

3980
02:50:50.380 --> 02:50:53.400
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good warmth.</v>

3981
02:50:53.460 --> 02:50:57.460
<v Speaker 4>A bowl of spaghetti with meatballs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you're sucking down that</v>

3982
02:50:58.400 --> 02:50:59.233
<v Speaker 1>fan of the fettuccine alfredo with </v>

3983
02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:03.433
<v Speaker 1>noodles because I don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>slapped in the face with fucking </v>

3984
02:51:05.961 --> 02:51:07.910
<v Speaker 1>fettuccine [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>

3985
02:51:08.310 --> 02:51:09.143
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm particularly fond of linguine with </v>

3986
02:51:11.661 --> 02:51:13.160
<v Speaker 1>clams,</v>

3999
02:51:47.610 --> 02:51:51.330

<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4001
02:51:51.930 --> 02:51:54.780
<v Speaker 4>you put some parmesan cheese on top of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

4002
02:51:54.781 --> 02:51:57.090
<v Speaker 4>JusT some grated parmesan on the top of </v>

<v Speaker 4>you never should put cheese on.</v>

4005
02:52:05.830 --> 02:52:08.710
<v Speaker 4>Like if you get linguine with clams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tell you not to put the cheese on.</v>

4006
02:52:08.711 --> 02:52:12.010

<v Speaker 4>I'm going to ask for the cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4038
02:53:31.370 --> 02:53:32.203
<v Speaker 4>I'll ask for the cheat if you asked for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the jeans because they don't want to </v>

4039
02:53:33.801 --> 02:53:34.550
<v Speaker 4>give it to you.</v>

4040
02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:35.383
<v Speaker 4>They want to give you the linguine with </v>
<v Speaker 4>clams and if you have a dish training </v>

4041
02:53:38.180 --> 02:53:38.991

<v Speaker 4>kevin,</v>

4042
02:53:38.991 --> 02:53:40.160
<v Speaker 4>james.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4043
02:53:40.161 --> 02:53:41.000
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not right now.</v>

4044
02:53:41.300 --> 02:53:43.310
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know he was training for a bit.</v>

4045
02:53:43.340 --> 02:53:45.800
<v Speaker 4>Then he's done a lot of training with </v>
<v Speaker 4>bas rutan.</v>

4046
02:53:45.860 --> 02:53:46.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right with boss.</v>

4047
02:53:46.821 --> 02:53:47.654
<v Speaker 4>And he did some stuff with ray longo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin's actually really accomplished </v>

4048
02:53:50.901 --> 02:53:52.280
<v Speaker 4>martial artists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's actually,</v>

4049
02:53:52.370 --> 02:53:54.710
<v Speaker 4>he's got really good hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very good kicks.</v>

4050
02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Like he's a real martial artists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4051
02:53:56.660 --> 02:53:59.450
<v Speaker 4>he's a big guy but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can fucking hit hard.</v>

4052
02:53:59.720 --> 02:54:00.553
<v Speaker 4>Like it's kind of surprising if you ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>see him hit the bag or a hit the pads </v>

4053
02:54:03.621 --> 02:54:05.930
<v Speaker 4>with mark [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty impressive.</v>

4054
02:54:06.400 --> 02:54:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4055
02:54:07.090 --> 02:54:08.540
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't look like a professional </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter,</v>

4056
02:54:08.541 --> 02:54:09.374
<v Speaker 4>but he's a very confident and competent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rather a martial artist but didn't want </v>

4057
02:54:14.271 --> 02:54:17.240
<v Speaker 4>to ask for that cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Needed a got to keep that she's coming.</v>

<v Speaker 4>was in red sauce and meatballs,</v>

4059
02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:21.793
<v Speaker 4>they would offer you the cheese cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you would make somebody ordered that </v>

4062
02:54:28.101 --> 02:54:30.110

<v Speaker 4>the noodles,</v>

4069
02:54:44.570 --> 02:54:49.010

<v Speaker 4>Cheese is way better when it's raw.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You remember raw cheese?</v>

4085
02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:28.220
<v Speaker 4>get cheese from place that uses raw </v>
<v Speaker 4>milk.</v>

4086
02:55:29.630 --> 02:55:32.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been getting into that and drinking</v>

4087
02:55:32.181 --> 02:55:34.250
<v Speaker 4>raw milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Been drinking a lot of raw milk lately.</v>

4088
02:55:34.310 --> 02:55:36.080
<v Speaker 4>You'd only goat's milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not have,</v>

4089
02:55:36.081 --> 02:55:38.090
<v Speaker 4>I have drinken raw goat's milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

4090
02:55:38.091 --> 02:55:41.510
<v Speaker 4>you just raw cow's milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get it from some,</v>

4091
02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:46.720
<v Speaker 4>some sustainable farms and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some like erewhon gary's cold though,</v>

4092
02:55:47.001 --> 02:55:47.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4093
02:55:47.330 --> 02:55:48.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tastes delicious.</v>

4094
02:55:48.501 --> 02:55:49.910
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so much better.</v>

4095
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:53.870
<v Speaker 4>It goes down easier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like regular milk feels weird and one of</v>

4096
02:55:53.871 --> 02:55:55.470
<v Speaker 4>the reasons why regular milk feels </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

4097
02:55:55.471 --> 02:55:56.304
<v Speaker 4>It's because it's homogenized and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pasteurized and apparently there's </v>

4098
02:55:58.101 --> 02:56:03.101
<v Speaker 4>enzymes in milk that when you're boiling</v>
<v Speaker 4>the milk to treat it and make it sort of</v>

4099
02:56:03.381 --> 02:56:06.950
<v Speaker 4>lasts longer and so it doesn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 4>ds and you're killing all the good stuff</v>

4100
02:56:06.951 --> 02:56:07.784
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your body is drinking this weird </v>

4101
02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:10.273
<v Speaker 4>liquidy protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exactly know what to do with </v>

4102
02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:14.570
<v Speaker 4>like during chemotherapy on milk because</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

4103
02:56:14.690 --> 02:56:15.770
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4104
02:56:15.860 --> 02:56:17.120
<v Speaker 4>In a lot of ways it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4105
02:56:17.570 --> 02:56:21.050
<v Speaker 4>it's just boiling the fuck out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you don't have it that way,</v>

4106
02:56:21.051 --> 02:56:22.820
<v Speaker 4>when you just have cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>raw milk,</v>

4107
02:56:22.850 --> 02:56:25.220
<v Speaker 4>it's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It tastes better.</v>

4108
02:56:25.370 --> 02:56:28.340
<v Speaker 4>It feels smooth when it goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one thing that people,</v>

4109
02:56:28.341 --> 02:56:29.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4110
02:56:30.350 --> 02:56:31.610
<v Speaker 4>comment on when they drink it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

4111
02:56:31.611 --> 02:56:32.660
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really smooth.</v>

4112
02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:33.993
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's got all the stuff that </v>

4113
02:56:35.170 --> 02:56:39.390
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to drink and people tell</v>
<v Speaker 4>you you're not supposed to drink milk.</v>

4114
02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:41.540
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They taste a little different.</v>

4115
02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:44.330
<v Speaker 4>His better to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

4116
02:56:44.331 --> 02:56:45.620
<v Speaker 4>I think it tastes better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean some people,</v>

4117
02:56:45.621 --> 02:56:48.740
<v Speaker 4>like some people like low fat milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that shit's disgusting.</v>

4118
02:56:49.100 --> 02:56:53.210
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather just drink water or low fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>milk tastes weird and coffee.</v>

4119
02:56:53.211 --> 02:56:55.490
<v Speaker 4>I like to put half and half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like that too.</v>

4120
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:58.220
<v Speaker 4>This is getting to a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do I like show?</v>

4121
02:56:58.650 --> 02:56:59.483
<v Speaker 4>I do like mason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Welcome to the joe rogan experience </v>

4122
02:57:01.431 --> 02:57:03.110
<v Speaker 4>where we're talking about coffee and </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

4123
02:57:03.111 --> 02:57:06.280
<v Speaker 4>We liken it back when there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>milkman delivered milk everyday,</v>

4124
02:57:06.290 --> 02:57:08.800
<v Speaker 4>whether it had been fucking your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I was doing.</v>

4125
02:57:08.801 --> 02:57:09.510
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4126
02:57:09.510 --> 02:57:10.343
<v Speaker 4>that's the big milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they had to do it all the time </v>

4127
02:57:12.340 --> 02:57:14.180
<v Speaker 4>because it was 100 percent raw mouth </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>

4128
02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:16.790
<v Speaker 4>I wonder when they came up with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>homogenization process,</v>

4129
02:57:17.660 --> 02:57:18.493
<v Speaker 4>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once they did come up with the </v>

4130
02:57:20.271 --> 02:57:22.400
<v Speaker 4>pasteurization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's louie pastor.</v>

4131
02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:24.230
<v Speaker 4>You got to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

4132
02:57:24.231 --> 02:57:27.920
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much of that was raw and </v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of it was pasteurized when they</v>

4133
02:57:27.921 --> 02:57:30.510
<v Speaker 4>started doing that on a big scale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

4134
02:57:30.530 --> 02:57:32.630
<v Speaker 4>It's imperative if you want to like keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>it on the shelf,</v>

4135
02:57:32.900 --> 02:57:33.733
<v Speaker 4>like you're not going to be able to keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>raw milk on the shelf for very long </v>

4136
02:57:36.470 --> 02:57:37.303
<v Speaker 4>because I've had it in my house for just</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of days and it noticeably goes </v>

4137
02:57:39.561 --> 02:57:42.620
<v Speaker 4>bad in the refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not bad where you can't drInk it,</v>

4138
02:57:42.621 --> 02:57:44.000
<v Speaker 4>but to wear it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

4139
02:57:44.001 --> 02:57:44.834
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is on the door of getting funky </v>

4140
02:57:48.390 --> 02:57:51.590
<v Speaker 4>text after text my ex wife because I got</v>
<v Speaker 4>to pick up my daughter.</v>

4141
02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:54.573
<v Speaker 4>What do you got there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie found that weird milk milestones </v>

4142
02:57:57.021 --> 02:58:01.280
<v Speaker 4>of milk history of us in 1950 there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>milk vending machines.</v>

4143
02:58:01.620 --> 02:58:02.453
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

4144
02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:03.950
<v Speaker 1>When did they start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4145
02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:04.833
<v Speaker 9>find out.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's a lot of first compulsory </v>

4146
02:58:06.341 --> 02:58:09.280
<v Speaker 9>pasteurization law in chicago applying </v>
<v Speaker 9>the milk,</v>

4147
02:58:09.281 --> 02:58:14.281
<v Speaker 9>except that except that from to burke.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Kulin tested cows 19.</v>

4148
02:58:15.101 --> 02:58:15.934
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>eight</v>

4149
02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:21.060
<v Speaker 4>tuberculin hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What Is that?</v>

4150
02:58:22.110 --> 02:58:23.490
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that tuberculosis?</v>

4151
02:58:24.330 --> 02:58:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Brucellosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that brucellosis is.</v>

4152
02:58:28.531 --> 02:58:30.990
<v Speaker 4>Brucellosis is something that cows get </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I know.</v>

4153
02:58:30.991 --> 02:58:33.150
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

4154
02:58:33.151 --> 02:58:33.984
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the main concerns about a </v>

4155
02:58:36.570 --> 02:58:40.950
<v Speaker 4>different wildlife populations mingling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially buffalo,</v>

4156
02:58:40.980 --> 02:58:44.730
<v Speaker 4>like some buffalo have brucellosis and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can get it to cows.</v>

4157
02:58:44.990 --> 02:58:45.823
<v Speaker 9>So 19,</v>
<v Speaker 9>19 and milk was sold successfully for </v>

4158
02:58:48.091 --> 02:58:48.924
<v Speaker 9>the first time in Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And then a couple more years passed by </v>

4159
02:58:52.981 --> 02:58:54.300
<v Speaker 9>before.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

4160
02:58:54.720 --> 02:58:56.520
<v Speaker 9>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 9>First farm belt,</v>

4161
02:58:56.790 --> 02:59:01.230
<v Speaker 9>first farm bulk tanks for milk began </v>
<v Speaker 9>replacing milk cans in 1938.</v>

4162
02:59:01.231 --> 02:59:02.064
<v Speaker 9>And then every other day milk delivery </v>
<v Speaker 9>started in 42 and then it was added to </v>

4163
02:59:05.341 --> 02:59:06.690
<v Speaker 9>school lunches and 46.</v>

4164
02:59:06.800 --> 02:59:07.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when It was in 42 is that </v>

4165
02:59:09.201 --> 02:59:12.980
<v Speaker 1>homogenized and pasteurized milk when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they started initially as a conservation</v>

4166
02:59:12.981 --> 02:59:15.890
<v Speaker 1>measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they do it every day and you</v>

4167
02:59:15.891 --> 02:59:18.170
<v Speaker 1>have an ice box in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't have to.</v>

4168
02:59:19.140 --> 02:59:19.973
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They relied on a guy to come by with a </v>

4169
02:59:21.471 --> 02:59:22.304
<v Speaker 1>milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's how everybody got their </v>

4170
02:59:22.881 --> 02:59:24.140
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

4171
02:59:24.141 --> 02:59:24.974
<v Speaker 1>people's lifespans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life expectancies were a lot shorter </v>

4172
02:59:26.601 --> 02:59:27.680
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

4173
02:59:27.710 --> 02:59:29.780
<v Speaker 1>So is this a good thing or bad thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we did?</v>

4174
02:59:30.800 --> 02:59:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were shorter than.</v>

4175
02:59:32.780 --> 02:59:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4176
02:59:34.200 --> 02:59:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4177
02:59:35.600 --> 02:59:36.433
<v Speaker 1>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people dIdn't understand </v>

4178
02:59:36.800 --> 02:59:39.230
<v Speaker 1>medicine or vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True target.</v>

4179
02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:40.073
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just knocked you over the head </v>

4180
02:59:41.631 --> 02:59:42.464
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to do surgery when he was a </v>

4181
02:59:45.281 --> 02:59:47.090
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No way for real.</v>

4182
02:59:47.320 --> 02:59:48.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4183
02:59:48.081 --> 02:59:49.760
<v Speaker 1>not scurvy or ricketts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had rickets,</v>

4184
02:59:50.540 --> 02:59:53.090
<v Speaker 1>rickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that come from?</v>

4185
02:59:53.180 --> 02:59:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nutrition or something.</v>

4186
02:59:54.950 --> 02:59:57.530
<v Speaker 1>He's had it when he was a baby and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>a stunted his growth.</v>

4187
02:59:57.531 --> 03:00:00.320
<v Speaker 1>So you only became like five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was tallest.</v>

4188
03:00:00.321 --> 03:00:01.041
<v Speaker 1>Maybe five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

4189
03:00:01.041 --> 03:00:01.874
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

4190
03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I think when we get older in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetimes,</v>

4191
03:00:04.941 --> 03:00:06.690
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna come a point in time where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4192
03:00:06.750 --> 03:00:11.750
<v Speaker 1>they laugh at people being sick or </v>
<v Speaker 1>people being injured.</v>

4193
03:00:12.081 --> 03:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I think they're gonna be able to repair </v>
<v Speaker 1>our bodies perfectly.</v>

4194
03:00:14.780 --> 03:00:15.613
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna be able to regenerate </v>
<v Speaker 1>limbs within the next 50 a hundred </v>

4195
03:00:18.470 --> 03:00:19.303
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably going to be so many crazy </v>

4196
03:00:20.301 --> 03:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>advancements to medical science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look back on injuries and</v>

4197
03:00:24.781 --> 03:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>the treatment of injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we do it today,</v>

4198
03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:27.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4199
03:00:27.841 --> 03:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4200
03:00:28.580 --> 03:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>once they get the stem cells shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4201
03:00:31.880 --> 03:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Have you had any of that yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4202
03:00:33.441 --> 03:00:33.891
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4203
03:00:33.891 --> 03:00:37.130
<v Speaker 1>when I was in India last year on tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy gave me some,</v>

4204
03:00:37.530 --> 03:00:38.363
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a face stuff that gives you a </v>

4205
03:00:41.751 --> 03:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>facial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4206
03:00:42.741 --> 03:00:43.574
<v Speaker 1>He was really friendly and I just stood </v>
<v Speaker 1>there always some sort of oil to rub on </v>

4207
03:00:48.561 --> 03:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>my face that had stem cells in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably bullshit.</v>

4208
03:00:51.290 --> 03:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

4209
03:00:52.311 --> 03:00:52.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>

4210
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>See it's gonna have an immediate effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they call me bro,</v>

4211
03:00:55.431 --> 03:00:56.264
<v Speaker 1>I love to do business with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I did it for like two months </v>

4212
03:00:58.251 --> 03:00:59.020
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

4213
03:00:59.020 --> 03:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All it did was give</v>

4214
03:01:00.070 --> 03:01:01.480
<v Speaker 4>me a couple of pimples.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's with it.</v>

4215
03:01:02.020 --> 03:01:03.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably bullshit,</v>

4216
03:01:03.130 --> 03:01:04.600
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real stem cell shit,</v>

4217
03:01:04.601 --> 03:01:06.880
<v Speaker 4>they're going to inject in you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to keep it cold.</v>

4218
03:01:07.110 --> 03:01:08.770
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4219
03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:09.521
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>

4220
03:01:09.521 --> 03:01:12.160
<v Speaker 4>didn't do anything for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to be,</v>

4221
03:01:12.161 --> 03:01:17.161
<v Speaker 4>I think the first group of people to see</v>
<v Speaker 4>people live like deep into the hundreds.</v>

4222
03:01:18.310 --> 03:01:19.143
<v Speaker 4>I think it's going to be real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is a 200 year old healthy </v>

4223
03:01:22.301 --> 03:01:25.120
<v Speaker 4>person going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how strange is it going to be if they're</v>

4224
03:01:25.121 --> 03:01:25.954
<v Speaker 4>really figure out a way to regenerate </v>
<v Speaker 4>tissue and keep someone in a relatively </v>

4225
03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:34.540
<v Speaker 4>healthy state and you get to see like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the wisdom of someone that's two,</v>

4226
03:01:34.541 --> 03:01:35.910
<v Speaker 4>300 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

4227
03:01:36.190 --> 03:01:37.510
<v Speaker 4>you're 40.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd you say?</v>

4228
03:01:37.511 --> 03:01:39.070
<v Speaker 4>Over 46.</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 six.</v>

4229
03:01:39.340 --> 03:01:41.650
<v Speaker 4>How much smarter you than when you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>26.</v>

4230
03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:43.540
<v Speaker 4>Whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lot,</v>

4231
03:01:43.570 --> 03:01:44.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold that.</v>

4232
03:01:44.770 --> 03:01:48.130
<v Speaker 4>If you live to be 146,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much smarter would you be?</v>

4233
03:01:48.310 --> 03:01:49.143
<v Speaker 4>pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

4234
03:01:49.750 --> 03:01:52.300
<v Speaker 4>as long as you're coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if you looked exactly the same?</v>

4235
03:01:52.540 --> 03:01:54.370
<v Speaker 4>That'd be pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be strange.</v>

4236
03:01:54.460 --> 03:01:55.350
<v Speaker 4>It'd be strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also,</v>

4237
03:01:55.660 --> 03:01:57.820
<v Speaker 4>did you feel guilty if you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>pussy at 1:46?</v>

4238
03:01:57.850 --> 03:01:58.683
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

4239
03:02:00.470 --> 03:02:02.470
<v Speaker 4>I was getting busy when I was fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>at 1:47</v>

4240
03:02:03.610 --> 03:02:05.970
<v Speaker 4>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>

4241
03:02:06.320 --> 03:02:09.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if they can,</v>

4242
03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:12.640
<v Speaker 4>they can get the hgh thing right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make it cancer free.</v>

4243
03:02:12.730 --> 03:02:13.563
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no correlation between hgh and </v>

4244
03:02:16.681 --> 03:02:17.514
<v Speaker 4>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The correlations between abuse of hgh </v>

4245
03:02:21.101 --> 03:02:26.101
<v Speaker 4>and some issues and also cancer with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of different factors.</v>

4246
03:02:26.890 --> 03:02:31.630
<v Speaker 4>Environmental factors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>factors like diet factors like heredity.</v>

4247
03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:32.793
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of different shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a concern that if you are </v>

4248
03:02:36.220 --> 03:02:41.020
<v Speaker 4>supplementing with human growth hormone </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a cancer grows in your body,</v>

4249
03:02:41.021 --> 03:02:44.140
<v Speaker 4>that it could grow more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is a concern,</v>

4250
03:02:44.410 --> 03:02:45.243
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think there's any real </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence to support that concern that </v>

4251
03:02:47.651 --> 03:02:50.980
<v Speaker 4>I've ever read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what's interesting about cancer that</v>

4252
03:02:50.981 --> 03:02:54.430
<v Speaker 4>I've been reading a lot about is when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get your body to,</v>

4253
03:02:54.860 --> 03:02:55.693
<v Speaker 4>if you get your body to a place where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's used to a bunch of different </v>

4254
03:03:01.301 --> 03:03:04.150
<v Speaker 4>chemicals that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are in the environment,</v>

4255
03:03:04.180 --> 03:03:07.180
<v Speaker 4>whether it's pollutants or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4256
03:03:07.181 --> 03:03:07.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

4257
03:03:07.930 --> 03:03:09.910
<v Speaker 4>something that you work with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4258
03:03:10.330 --> 03:03:10.780
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4259
03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:14.140
<v Speaker 4>people that work around like really </v>
<v Speaker 4>strong chemicals.</v>

4260
03:03:14.140 --> 03:03:14.973
<v Speaker 4>People that work like with automotive </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff like all the bondos and epoxies </v>

4261
03:03:20.981 --> 03:03:22.750
<v Speaker 4>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like those people,</v>

4262
03:03:22.751 --> 03:03:23.584
<v Speaker 4>their cancer numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you work with a lot of </v>

4263
03:03:25.391 --> 03:03:28.030
<v Speaker 4>chemicals and cancer numbers get crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>high,</v>

4264
03:03:28.570 --> 03:03:31.060
<v Speaker 4>like that seems to be where the big risk</v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

4265
03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:34.540
<v Speaker 4>His diet and people that work around </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemicals.</v>

4266
03:03:34.990 --> 03:03:35.823
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that are out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there that they just took a job because </v>

4267
03:03:38.471 --> 03:03:39.304
<v Speaker 4>it's a good job and it pays well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're in like a slow death </v>

4268
03:03:42.281 --> 03:03:44.590
<v Speaker 4>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

4269
03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:47.200
<v Speaker 4>That fucking sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4270
03:03:47.430 --> 03:03:49.140
<v Speaker 4>That's got to be the weirdest way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a living,</v>

4271
03:03:49.150 --> 03:03:53.210
<v Speaker 4>to be trapped in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a gig where you're very job itself,</v>

4272
03:03:53.211 --> 03:03:54.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slowly chew in a way.</v>

4273
03:03:54.401 --> 03:03:57.160
<v Speaker 4>Your body while you were doing comedy in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nineties as well.</v>

4274
03:03:57.230 --> 03:03:58.160
<v Speaker 4>And remember going</v>

4275
03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:01.310
<v Speaker 8>to clubs on the for the whole weekend </v>
<v Speaker 8>and be full of fucking smoke.</v>

4276
03:04:01.460 --> 03:04:02.420
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I remember.</v>

4277
03:04:02.421 --> 03:04:04.370
<v Speaker 8>I remember just leaving gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just,</v>

4278
03:04:05.270 --> 03:04:06.103
<v Speaker 8>it fucking rick.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You couldn't wear the same clothes </v>

4279
03:04:07.401 --> 03:04:10.340
<v Speaker 8>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He couldn't had the shower as soon as he</v>

4280
03:04:10.341 --> 03:04:11.174
<v Speaker 8>got back home.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And oftentimes he didn't realize it </v>

4281
03:04:12.771 --> 03:04:14.150
<v Speaker 8>until you open up your bag,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

4282
03:04:14.460 --> 03:04:15.740
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You clothes,</v>

4283
03:04:15.770 --> 03:04:17.150
<v Speaker 8>take your clothes out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you got home you're like,</v>

4284
03:04:17.151 --> 03:04:20.660
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 8>He just stunk like cigarettes.</v>

4285
03:04:21.560 --> 03:04:23.780
<v Speaker 8>But cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you're a waitress,</v>

4286
03:04:23.810 --> 03:04:25.340
<v Speaker 8>it's the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like a lot,</v>

4287
03:04:25.341 --> 03:04:26.900
<v Speaker 8>directly in the line of fire with them </v>
<v Speaker 8>then.</v>

4288
03:04:26.960 --> 03:04:27.793
<v Speaker 8>And you're there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like in the days when they used to be </v>

4289
03:04:29.121 --> 03:04:29.954
<v Speaker 8>able to smoke in bars.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I bet a lot of chicks got a lot of </v>

4290
03:04:32.481 --> 03:04:35.390
<v Speaker 8>waitresses got a cancer from secondhand </v>
<v Speaker 8>smoke.</v>

4291
03:04:36.260 --> 03:04:37.220
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just remembered.</v>

4292
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:40.670
<v Speaker 8>And the worst the gig,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the more the smoke for some reason.</v>

4293
03:04:40.940 --> 03:04:42.590
<v Speaker 8>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That wasn't that long ago.</v>

4294
03:04:43.110 --> 03:04:43.943
<v Speaker 8>Really wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wasn't I remember when they banned </v>

4295
03:04:46.311 --> 03:04:47.630
<v Speaker 8>smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Must've been around 2000,</v>

4296
03:04:47.631 --> 03:04:51.860
<v Speaker 8>maybe 99 maybe at the latest.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4297
03:04:51.861 --> 03:04:52.694
<v Speaker 8>The weird improvements that that </v>
<v Speaker 8>happened that are pretty goddamn </v>

4298
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:57.970
<v Speaker 8>significant at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People are protesting.</v>

4299
03:04:58.360 --> 03:05:01.590
<v Speaker 8>We willing to smoke in bars.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We knew there was a,</v>

4300
03:05:01.591 --> 03:05:03.980
<v Speaker 8>I remember people complaining saying </v>
<v Speaker 8>that pool halls,</v>

4301
03:05:03.981 --> 03:05:04.814
<v Speaker 8>we're going to go out of business </v>
<v Speaker 8>because they wouldn't allow people to </v>

4302
03:05:05.931 --> 03:05:08.680
<v Speaker 8>smoke in them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People had to stand outside to smoke.</v>

4303
03:05:08.681 --> 03:05:11.970
<v Speaker 8>And then the old days everybody smoked </v>
<v Speaker 8>indoors too.</v>

4304
03:05:12.440 --> 03:05:15.050
<v Speaker 8>Fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Gross habit planes,</v>

<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

4306
03:05:17.660 --> 03:05:20.970

<v Speaker 8>Fitzsimmons parents were um,</v>

4307
03:05:21.040 --> 03:05:24.080
<v Speaker 8>chainsmokers when he was a kid and they </v>
<v Speaker 8>lived in boston.</v>

4308
03:05:24.081 --> 03:05:27.140
<v Speaker 8>So it's the winter and the windows are </v>
<v Speaker 8>closed,</v>

4309
03:05:27.260 --> 03:05:30.640
<v Speaker 8>locked down,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and they are smoking in the house chain,</v>

4310
03:05:30.641 --> 03:05:32.930
<v Speaker 8>smoking with the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Greg gets asthma.</v>

4311
03:05:32.960 --> 03:05:33.980
<v Speaker 8>He's got asthma from this.</v>

4312
03:05:34.610 --> 03:05:36.350
<v Speaker 8>They'd be in the car going on a road </v>
<v Speaker 8>trip,</v>

4313
03:05:36.410 --> 03:05:40.000
<v Speaker 8>smoking in their car windows.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Wintertime wouldn't roll down the </v>

4315
03:05:42.411 --> 03:05:43.010
<v Speaker 8>window.</v>

4317
03:05:47.780 --> 03:05:51.110

<v Speaker 8>forced the consequences of your habit on</v>

4318
03:05:51.111 --> 03:05:53.270
<v Speaker 8>other people?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maybe alcoholism.</v>

4319
03:05:54.020 --> 03:05:57.380
<v Speaker 8>Imagine if you dated someone and they </v>
<v Speaker 8>farted on you so much.</v>

<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

4325
03:06:09.351 --> 03:06:10.820

<v Speaker 8>doing with</v>

4346
