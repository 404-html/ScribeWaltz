17
00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:29.870
<v Speaker 2>years you've been given advice.</v>

18
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

19
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.053
<v Speaker 1>how did this</v>

20
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 2>catch me outside?</v>

21
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Girl,</v>

22
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.993
<v Speaker 2>how did this happen?</v>

23
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 2>All the know all the different shows.</v>

24
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:43.250
<v Speaker 2>If you made a monster,</v>

25
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

26
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's my moment of infamy.</v>

27
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.471
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

28
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:48.951
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

29
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 2>This girl comes home with her mother and her mother actually brings her own of</v>

30
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:53.421
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

31
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:58.421
<v Speaker 2>and if she's a train wreck and we work with her and we send her to this ranch</v>

32
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:01.160
<v Speaker 2>for like four months,</v>

33
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:01.994
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

34
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.040
<v Speaker 2>She goes for a long time and makes a complete turnaround,</v>

35
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.840
<v Speaker 2>does a really a great job.</v>

36
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.690
<v Speaker 2>They say she's become a leader.</v>

37
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:16.691
<v Speaker 2>She's working with all these girls doing a great job and then she graduates and</v>

38
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.750
<v Speaker 2>I remember this last shot and we do this,</v>

39
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.240
<v Speaker 2>this piece at the ranch.</v>

40
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 2>She jumps up on this fence and is smiling and everything and waving at all.</v>

41
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.300
<v Speaker 2>One night home with her mother one night and her mother's finding people that</v>

42
00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 2>are trashing her,</v>

43
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 2>the mother on,</v>

44
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.911
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

45
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:38.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

46
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.750
<v Speaker 2>the social media platforms or mother tracks him down,</v>

47
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 2>backs into who they are,</v>

48
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 2>gets their phone numbers,</v>

49
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 2>calls him up,</v>

50
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 2>yelling into the phone,</v>

51
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:48.800
<v Speaker 2>calling them names and stuff,</v>

52
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 2>gets the daughter involved one night crashes.</v>

53
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 2>So they come back for a followup like,</v>

54
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.181
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

55
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Speaker 2>month or two later.</v>

56
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.750
<v Speaker 2>And when they come I say,</v>

57
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

58
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.393
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have him back.</v>

59
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.930
<v Speaker 2>They walk out,</v>

60
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 2>I have the audience completely empty.</v>

61
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.820
<v Speaker 2>I have nobody there to play too.</v>

62
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

63
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 2>250 chairs,</v>

64
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>empty,</v>

65
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 2>nobody in the house but me,</v>

66
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:12.860
<v Speaker 2>the mother and the daughter,</v>

67
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.753
<v Speaker 2>that's a good move.</v>

68
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.960
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>

69
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.310
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

70
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 2>where is everybody's?</v>

71
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

72
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 2>you don't need anybody,</v>

73
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 2>we're just here to talk and you know,</v>

74
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:22.250
<v Speaker 2>keep things rolling.</v>

75
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:23.084
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

76
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 2>And they were dumbstruck,</v>

77
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

78
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 2>there was nobody there to showboat for or play too.</v>

79
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.050
<v Speaker 2>And there was like a 15 minute interview.</v>

80
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 2>They had nothing to say.</v>

81
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 2>And off they go.</v>

82
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:38.111
<v Speaker 2>And then this phrase that got turned into a,</v>

83
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

84
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.861
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

85
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:41.150
<v Speaker 2>a meme or whatever they call it,</v>

86
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.793
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

87
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 2>it just went crazy.</v>

88
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:49.841
<v Speaker 2>And what she was nominated for a grammy or Siri.</v>

89
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

90
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

91
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I take no credit or blame.</v>

92
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.181
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

93
00:02:58.181 --> 00:02:58.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:02:58.701 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

95
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 2>what I could and haven't seen her since.</v>

96
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I wish everybody,</v>

97
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:02.021
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

98
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 2>maybe she'll turn,</v>

99
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>so maybe it'll grow her up.</v>

100
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.600
<v Speaker 2>She'll turn some posse valve.</v>

101
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 2>But I hope so.</v>

102
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.401
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

103
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:06.860
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

104
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.690
<v Speaker 3>good attitude and very healthy attitude for you.</v>

105
00:03:08.691 --> 00:03:09.524
<v Speaker 3>But it is,</v>

106
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.780
<v Speaker 3>when something goes viral like that,</v>

107
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.440
<v Speaker 3>something's strange that for whatever reason it catches and takes off.</v>

108
00:03:15.441 --> 00:03:16.274
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

109
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.720
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

110
00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:18.830
<v Speaker 3>It's a very weird thing.</v>

111
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.910
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense.</v>

112
00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:21.530
<v Speaker 3>She's on a billboard on sunset,</v>

113
00:03:21.531 --> 00:03:22.730
<v Speaker 3>a giant billboard.</v>

114
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

115
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.523
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>

116
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Enormous billboard.</v>

117
00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:28.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of those side of the building billboards where they,</v>

118
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.271
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

119
00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:32.150
<v Speaker 3>they put the graphic up and covers the entire building.</v>

120
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.650
<v Speaker 2>It makes no sense.</v>

121
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

122
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

123
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.020
<v Speaker 2>There's people curing cancer and you can't find them with both hands.</v>

124
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

125
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has any idea who won the last Nobel Prize for science,</v>

126
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.933
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

127
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.460
<v Speaker 2>more power to her.</v>

128
00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I if if she can turn into something positive,</v>

129
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.751
<v Speaker 2>she have talent.</v>

130
00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard any of her music now?</v>

131
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.140
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

132
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I've either seen her on your show.</v>

133
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.460
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate you bringing that up.</v>

134
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.683
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

135
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.110
<v Speaker 3>But it's just so strange that one train wreck could for whatever reason,</v>

136
00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:09.920
<v Speaker 3>catch on and then all of a sudden it's gigantic.</v>

137
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

138
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 2>They say that somebody signed her and paid her millions of dollars.</v>

139
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.343
<v Speaker 2>Seriously</v>

140
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.730
<v Speaker 3>close to a million dollars from a makeup company.</v>

141
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

142
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

143
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.191
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

144
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:20.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

145
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

146
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.833
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

147
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

148
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.520
<v Speaker 3>if that's happening,</v>

149
00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:23.821
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

150
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:25.800
<v Speaker 3>like what would your advice be then?</v>

151
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Would your advice be,</v>

152
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

153
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.600
<v Speaker 3>get your shit together and stop being crazy?</v>

154
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

155
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.730
<v Speaker 3>she's making a lot of money off of being crazy and her opportunities before that</v>

156
00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:37.230
<v Speaker 3>were probably severely limited.</v>

157
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.671
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

158
00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 2>they had to be.</v>

159
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.210
<v Speaker 2>And what I hope now that this,</v>

160
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.540
<v Speaker 2>even though this certainly is a quirk,</v>

161
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 2>what I hope now is that she's surrounded by mature people with business heads on</v>

162
00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:56.411
<v Speaker 2>their shoulders and development people that will actually guide this in a way</v>

163
00:04:56.571 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 2>that it's not 15 minutes.</v>

164
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

165
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

166
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.680
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

167
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 2>That's what I hope.</v>

168
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Well everybody thought the Kardashians are going to be 15 minutes and it's been</v>

169
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 3>15 years.</v>

170
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.250
<v Speaker 2>But there's been,</v>

172
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 2>people make fun of them and there's some good things there to make fun of.</v>

174
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.260
<v Speaker 2>They do things to be made fun of.</v>

175
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.850
<v Speaker 2>But there's also from very smart business and branding that's gone into that as</v>

176
00:05:19.851 --> 00:05:20.220
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

177
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.371
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

178
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:20.881
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>

179
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:21.421
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

180
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:24.540
<v Speaker 3>and I was actually very impressed with her that she actually went to the White</v>

181
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.100
<v Speaker 3>House to talk about prison reform.</v>

182
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

183
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.840
<v Speaker 3>For people that are unjustly accused and are being been in jail for too long for</v>

184
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.000
<v Speaker 3>things that they didn't do.</v>

185
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.070
<v Speaker 3>And that's something she's actually passionate about.</v>

186
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

187
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.960
<v Speaker 2>And I know Kim and she's actually a very nice girl,</v>

188
00:05:38.961 --> 00:05:40.550
<v Speaker 2>very smart and all.</v>

189
00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:41.141
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

190
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:41.390
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

191
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.931
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>

192
00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:45.380
<v Speaker 2>they've done some very brilliant branding and it's certainly paid off.</v>

193
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 3>It's just so fascinating when something catches like that girl,</v>

194
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.570
<v Speaker 3>what is her name?</v>

195
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.403
<v Speaker 3>The catch me outside,</v>

196
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

197
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Danielle goalie or something.</v>

198
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

199
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

200
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Cause I didn't know her as the catch me outside girl.</v>

201
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 2>But if she didn't say that one phrase.</v>

202
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

203
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 2>And she just said that I think to her grandmother or somebody in the audience,</v>

204
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I know it didn't even register with us at the time.</v>

205
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.293
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

206
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

207
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a standout phrase in the interview or anything.</v>

208
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 2>It just pass by.</v>

209
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Somebody just grabbed it and,</v>

210
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 2>and then it became a meme.</v>

211
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

212
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 2>What a weird world we live in.</v>

213
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

214
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:23.684
<v Speaker 2>no kidding.</v>

215
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean it has to be a lot of responsibility to try to give people advice and try</v>

216
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:33.430
<v Speaker 2>to straighten her life out and show them the,</v>

217
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 2>the flaws and the errors that they're making.</v>

218
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

219
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:37.754
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

220
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.001
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

221
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 2>people ask me sometimes they say,</v>

222
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:40.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 2>doc field or problems,</v>

224
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 2>you think problems are as simple as you make them out to be.</v>

225
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 2>And the truth is,</v>

226
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't think problems are simple at all.</v>

227
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.781
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

228
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I think problems are really,</v>

229
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>most of the time,</v>

230
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 2>pretty complex.</v>

231
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.783
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty layered.</v>

232
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 2>They have a lot of different origins and they're oftentimes Comorbid.</v>

233
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 2>A lot of things exist together.</v>

234
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think problems are simple at all,</v>

235
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 2>but to solutions are often simple.</v>

236
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.081
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think?</v>

237
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's Kinda like the old joke.</v>

238
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 2>You go the doctor and you say this hurts.</v>

239
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:14.961
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

240
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 2>well then don't do that anymore.</v>

241
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of times it's very simple in it.</v>

242
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Somebody will have a complex thing that comes from childhood or maybe it's a</v>

243
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 2>drug background or they've had trauma in their life.</v>

244
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 2>But the solution is change your behavior.</v>

245
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.631
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

246
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 2>stop rewarding bad behavior.</v>

247
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

248
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 2>choose a different path in life.</v>

249
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Just behave your way to success.</v>

250
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the solutions are very simple,</v>

251
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 2>even though the problems are very complex because at some point you have to stop</v>

252
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 2>focus econ.</v>

253
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

254
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 2>And start focusing on what instead of why it happened,</v>

255
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do to change it?</v>

256
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes the solutions are pretty simple,</v>

257
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.700
<v Speaker 2>but implementing those solutions are often very,</v>

258
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 2>it's often very difficult for people to change their lives,</v>

259
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 2>change their patterns.</v>

260
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

261
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.693
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

262
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 2>and patterns is the key.</v>

263
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.813
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

264
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

265
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 2>nobody does anything in pattern if they don't get a pay off.</v>

266
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 2>And if you can identify,</v>

267
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 2>that's why.</v>

268
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 2>That's why insights so important.</v>

269
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.100
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think it's the number one outcome to whether somebody is going to</v>

270
00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 2>respond to a talking therapy.</v>

271
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.034
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

272
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.820
<v Speaker 2>if somebody can identify what their payoff is,</v>

273
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 2>where they really can figure out,</v>

274
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this repeatedly and my payoff is I don't have to work,</v>

275
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 2>or I don't get held accountable for this,</v>

276
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 2>or I'm escaping accountability over here,</v>

277
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 2>or I get attention or sympathy,</v>

278
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 2>or if they can figure out what their payoff is</v>

279
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.870
<v Speaker 2>and they can then control that,</v>

280
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 2>whether it's for themselves or their kids or whatever.</v>

281
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 2>If you control the currency,</v>

282
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 2>then you can control the behavior.</v>

283
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

284
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

285
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 2>it just seems that people</v>

286
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>

287
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 3>they have this comfort in their patterns and even if their patents are self</v>

288
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:02.851
<v Speaker 3>destructive,</v>

289
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 3>he had been his drug abuse or alcoholism or did those,</v>

290
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

291
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 3>the comfort in those patterns falling into those patterns.</v>

292
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 3>It seems very compelling to a lot of people and payoffs don't necessarily mean</v>

293
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 3>that it's a positive payoff.</v>

294
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

295
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

296
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.120
<v Speaker 2>it pay off for taking heroin as you get high.</v>

297
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.430
<v Speaker 2>And so you're high for a while.</v>

298
00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:22.780
<v Speaker 2>That's not a positive pay off,</v>

299
00:09:22.781 --> 00:09:23.710
<v Speaker 2>but it's a payoff.</v>

300
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

301
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.690
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>

302
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.760
<v Speaker 2>if you get high and so you don't get a job and you don't take care of your kids,</v>

303
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.890
<v Speaker 2>that's a payoff.</v>

304
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.040
<v Speaker 2>That you're not doing things that you need to do,</v>

305
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.630
<v Speaker 2>that you should be accountable for.</v>

306
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a pathological payoff,</v>

307
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.451
<v Speaker 2>but it's a pay off.</v>

308
00:09:40.451 --> 00:09:41.290
<v Speaker 2>None the less.</v>

309
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.810
<v Speaker 2>And so that does reward you,</v>

310
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 2>even though it's a pathological payoff.</v>

311
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a pathological thing.</v>

312
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

313
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.730
<v Speaker 2>you call it a reward and if you,</v>

314
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.530
<v Speaker 2>but if you can identify that where they say,</v>

315
00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:53.800
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

316
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

317
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:54.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

318
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing what I need to do and I need to stop rewarding myself in that way</v>

319
00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:00.070
<v Speaker 2>and hold myself,</v>

320
00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:01.360
<v Speaker 2>kind of need to be there for my kid.</v>

321
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I tell my kid I'm going to be there every day and I don't show up because I'm</v>

322
00:10:05.861 --> 00:10:06.730
<v Speaker 2>high on drugs,</v>

323
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.593
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

324
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 2>I need to stop doing.</v>

325
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to not let myself get away with that and instead require myself to</v>

326
00:10:14.771 --> 00:10:16.000
<v Speaker 2>show up for the kid.</v>

327
00:10:16.001 --> 00:10:18.310
<v Speaker 2>When I say I do say I will,</v>

328
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.730
<v Speaker 2>and then you see what's in the kid's eyes.</v>

329
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.680
<v Speaker 2>You share the experience with them.</v>

330
00:10:23.681 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Now that becomes your payoff,</v>

331
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.500
<v Speaker 2>so then you'll start showing it for your kids.</v>

332
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

333
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.801
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

334
00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:29.420
<v Speaker 3>how many people take your advice?</v>

335
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.570
<v Speaker 3>How many people just listened and try for a little bit and then bail?</v>

336
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.453
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

337
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.420
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say because I think our,</v>

338
00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:43.421
<v Speaker 2>sometimes our most productive guest are the ones that don't get it because the</v>

339
00:10:45.861 --> 00:10:46.970
<v Speaker 2>mail we get,</v>

340
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.253
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>

341
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.183
<v Speaker 2>oh wow,</v>

342
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.600
<v Speaker 2>that guy didn't get her to,</v>

343
00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:51.680
<v Speaker 2>that woman didn't get it,</v>

344
00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:56.681
<v Speaker 2>but I saw myself in them and I'll never say that again.</v>

345
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.620
<v Speaker 2>I saw them being such a right fighter or I saw them being so hard headed or so</v>

346
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:09.221
<v Speaker 2>oppositional and I s I heard them say things I've said and they laughed and</v>

347
00:11:11.331 --> 00:11:12.164
<v Speaker 2>didn't get it.</v>

348
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.730
<v Speaker 2>I got it on.</v>

349
00:11:13.731 --> 00:11:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Never do that again.</v>

350
00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:19.961
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes those that don't get it at all while they're there are the ones</v>

351
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:23.000
<v Speaker 2>that are the best teaching tools for the millions of people that are home</v>

352
00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:23.600
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>

353
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:23.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

354
00:11:23.931 --> 00:11:24.651
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting,</v>

355
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:25.041
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

356
00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:26.600
<v Speaker 3>When you watch people fail and you go,</v>

357
00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:27.141
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

358
00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:27.650
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

359
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.030
<v Speaker 3>I see that in myself.</v>

360
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

361
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.130
<v Speaker 3>I just got to not do with that guys do it.</v>

362
00:11:31.131 --> 00:11:34.640
<v Speaker 3>And then also do you see the stubborn pigheadedness that some people have what?</v>

363
00:11:34.641 --> 00:11:39.560
<v Speaker 3>They won't listen to advice and you could clearly see how they're ruining their</v>

364
00:11:39.561 --> 00:11:41.660
<v Speaker 3>lives by not being honest.</v>

365
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes the story that we might have is maybe extreme where you say,</v>

366
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't do all six things they're doing,</v>

367
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 2>but I do two of them and they are in sharp relief to me.</v>

368
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:54.730
<v Speaker 2>So I get that.</v>

369
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I ain't gonna do that anymore.</v>

370
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

371
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 2>that's where I think you get a pay off and you know,</v>

372
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 2>people go and find these things on the Internet.</v>

373
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

374
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.590
<v Speaker 2>last year,</v>

375
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

376
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 2>we have a channel where we put up,</v>

377
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:07.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

378
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 2>different clips from a divorce shows or parenting shows or whatever.</v>

379
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:15.100
<v Speaker 2>And we had over 2 billion views.</v>

380
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:15.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

381
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 2>last year or people just going and finding that information and looking at it.</v>

382
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 2>So I know people are seeking the information out and looking at it beyond the</v>

383
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:24.460
<v Speaker 2>show itself.</v>

384
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.220
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

385
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:25.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:29.770
<v Speaker 2>they must be seeking information and we just don't have a good distribution</v>

387
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:30.604
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

388
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

389
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 2>for mental health in America.</v>

390
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 2>So I think they look,</v>

391
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 2>I think they're hungry for it.</v>

392
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:35.720
<v Speaker 2>And I looked for it.</v>

393
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Well there's so many people out there that are trying to do better at trying to</v>

394
00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:41.360
<v Speaker 3>get their lives in order and you know,</v>

395
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.680
<v Speaker 3>shows like yours and,</v>

396
00:12:42.681 --> 00:12:43.251
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

397
00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:46.220
<v Speaker 3>just advice shows people that are giving out inspiration and knowledge.</v>

398
00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.481
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

399
00:12:47.481 --> 00:12:49.730
<v Speaker 3>it's such an important thing for people to,</v>

400
00:12:49.731 --> 00:12:53.810
<v Speaker 3>especially for people that didn't grow up with wise parents or they'd be a good</v>

401
00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:54.980
<v Speaker 3>support system around them.</v>

402
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.033
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

403
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.883
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

404
00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:58.880
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

405
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 2>And I grew up with an alcoholic father and it was a pretty violent home and,</v>

406
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.270
<v Speaker 2>and he was a really bad alcoholic.</v>

407
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.070
<v Speaker 2>And I know having grown up in that,</v>

408
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 2>you wind up with what I call a damaged personal truth and you feel second class.</v>

409
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.240
<v Speaker 2>And the problem that kids make.</v>

410
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.230
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

411
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.100
<v Speaker 2>cause I know I did it and I see others do it,</v>

412
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.160
<v Speaker 2>is you compare your personal truth,</v>

413
00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:39.161
<v Speaker 2>what you know about yourself and how you really live and what's really going on.</v>

414
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 2>You compare your personal truth to everybody else's social mask because you go</v>

415
00:13:45.981 --> 00:13:47.180
<v Speaker 2>to school and you know,</v>

416
00:13:47.181 --> 00:13:51.740
<v Speaker 2>well I know that last night the windows got kicked out of my house.</v>

417
00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I know that the utilities got turned off.</v>

418
00:13:55.011 --> 00:13:59.510
<v Speaker 2>And I know there was a big fight in my kitchen last night and the kid sitting</v>

419
00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:00.291
<v Speaker 2>next to me,</v>

420
00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:05.270
<v Speaker 2>he's got on a shirt that's all ironed and his face is all bright and clean and</v>

421
00:14:05.271 --> 00:14:05.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:10.130
<v Speaker 2>he looks like he's just got it all together and you compare yourself to that</v>

423
00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:10.550
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

424
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.383
<v Speaker 2>that kid,</v>

425
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.910
<v Speaker 2>and you feel like you're second class.</v>

426
00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:19.070
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with that is we generate the results in life we think we</v>

427
00:14:19.071 --> 00:14:19.904
<v Speaker 2>deserve.</v>

428
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.520
<v Speaker 2>So if you think your damn is,</v>

429
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.160
<v Speaker 2>do you think your second class you will generate</v>

430
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.720
<v Speaker 2>results that you think a second class person deserves.</v>

431
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.410
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't fix your personal truth,</v>

432
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.810
<v Speaker 2>then you'll spend the rest of your life saying,</v>

433
00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:36.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

434
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:36.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

435
00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:37.850
<v Speaker 2>those really good results,</v>

436
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.650
<v Speaker 2>those belong for somebody else.</v>

437
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.880
<v Speaker 2>It's not for me.</v>

438
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.470
<v Speaker 2>That's for somebody else.</v>

439
00:14:42.471 --> 00:14:47.450
<v Speaker 2>And you'll settle for second best and you won't get what you might otherwise</v>

440
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:49.880
<v Speaker 2>generate for yourself if you don't fix your personal truth.</v>

441
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 2>And so I think a lot of people are struggling looking for a way to kind of get</v>

442
00:14:55.821 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 2>out of feeling not good about themselves and damage self esteem,</v>

443
00:14:59.601 --> 00:14:59.971
<v Speaker 2>damage,</v>

444
00:14:59.971 --> 00:15:00.501
<v Speaker 2>self worth.</v>

445
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 2>And they really don't know where to go.</v>

446
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

447
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:03.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

448
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.480
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I do the show.</v>

449
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.201
<v Speaker 2>I don't look,</v>

450
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not under the misapprehension that we're doing eight minute cures up there.</v>

451
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:09.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

452
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:10.970
<v Speaker 2>come on you,</v>

453
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.983
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing that.</v>

454
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you can point people in the right direction,</v>

455
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 2>if you can raise their awareness,</v>

456
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:19.340
<v Speaker 2>you can get them thinking about it.</v>

457
00:15:19.341 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 2>You can create a narrative where they at least say,</v>

458
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:22.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 2>how do I feel about myself?</v>

460
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:24.794
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

461
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 2>is there stuff I need to resolve?</v>

462
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

463
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.210
<v Speaker 2>what am I saying to myself?</v>

464
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:30.500
<v Speaker 2>If you can get them thinking about that,</v>

465
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:31.101
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

466
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:32.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe you've done something.</v>

467
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:32.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

468
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:33.081
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

469
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Tony Robbins once said once said,</v>

470
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.000
<v Speaker 3>it's incremental changes over the long haul and the way you have to look at it</v>

471
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:41.390
<v Speaker 3>as if these two boats are going in a parallel direction and one of them just</v>

472
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 3>shifts five degrees over the course of time,</v>

473
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.420
<v Speaker 3>this boat is going to be in a far different place than the other boat that's</v>

474
00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:48.141
<v Speaker 3>going in the same way.</v>

475
00:15:48.141 --> 00:15:48.974
<v Speaker 3>It was always going.</v>

476
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:50.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

477
00:15:50.071 --> 00:15:55.071
<v Speaker 2>And the important thing to realize as well is the next year is going to go by</v>

478
00:15:55.171 --> 00:15:57.450
<v Speaker 2>whether you're doing something about your life or not.</v>

479
00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

480
00:15:58.261 --> 00:15:58.501
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

481
00:15:58.501 --> 00:16:03.501
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting here right now at the end of February and the next 10 months are</v>

482
00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:10.650
<v Speaker 2>going to go by whether somebody is working to make change or whether they're</v>

483
00:16:10.651 --> 00:16:11.484
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

484
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.221
<v Speaker 2>And they may think,</v>

485
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:12.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

486
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

487
00:16:13.201 --> 00:16:17.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm so far away and I'll never get it under control or I'm so behind in my bills</v>

488
00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:18.684
<v Speaker 2>or I'm so,</v>

489
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.083
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

490
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:20.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

491
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.940
<v Speaker 2>just depressed or,</v>

492
00:16:21.941 --> 00:16:22.774
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

493
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.990
<v Speaker 2>everything is so out of control.</v>

494
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:25.651
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

495
00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:26.340
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

496
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 2>you make those incremental changes and then you know pretty soon in December you</v>

497
00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:31.890
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

498
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.723
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

499
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm way better off than I was at the end of February,</v>

500
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.893
<v Speaker 2>so shit,</v>

501
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.830
<v Speaker 2>you made little changes and they all ended up and if you don't,</v>

502
00:16:40.831 --> 00:16:41.551
<v Speaker 2>by the end of the year,</v>

503
00:16:41.551 --> 00:16:42.450
<v Speaker 2>you're just in deeper.</v>

504
00:16:42.451 --> 00:16:43.650
<v Speaker 2>So every little bit matters.</v>

505
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

506
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:44.551
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

507
00:16:44.551 --> 00:16:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I tell people to write things down.</v>

508
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 3>I said one of the best ways to get things done is to write things down.</v>

509
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Write down what you're trying to get done.</v>

510
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Write down what you need to get done on a longterm basis in which you need to</v>

511
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:56.780
<v Speaker 3>get done in a short term basis and write off a checklist.</v>

512
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:57.651
<v Speaker 3>Force yourself.</v>

513
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:58.484
<v Speaker 3>Be Accountable.</v>

514
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

515
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 3>The difference between a dream and a goal is a timeline and accountability.</v>

516
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Accountability is gigantic.</v>

517
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.550
<v Speaker 2>You got to have somebody,</v>

518
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.840
<v Speaker 2>whether it's yourself or a friend or somebody that's going to say,</v>

519
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.853
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

520
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.560
<v Speaker 2>did you do what you said you were going to do by this time?</v>

521
00:17:14.561 --> 00:17:16.240
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't hold your feet to the fire,</v>

522
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.920
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>

523
00:17:17.921 --> 00:17:19.810
<v Speaker 2>just sitting around dreaming some day,</v>

524
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.600
<v Speaker 2>some day I'm going to get a different job.</v>

525
00:17:22.601 --> 00:17:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Some day I'm going to change.</v>

526
00:17:24.161 --> 00:17:26.050
<v Speaker 2>This will someday ain't a day of the week.</v>

527
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:27.461
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

528
00:17:27.461 --> 00:17:29.530
<v Speaker 2>there's Monday,</v>

529
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday,</v>

530
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday,</v>

531
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Thursday,</v>

532
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Friday,</v>

533
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>

534
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:29.531
<v Speaker 2>Sunday.</v>

535
00:17:29.531 --> 00:17:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Look on your counter some days not on there.</v>

536
00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:33.280
<v Speaker 2>So you got to say,</v>

537
00:17:33.281 --> 00:17:34.000
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

538
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.070
<v Speaker 2>I want to take this small step by here,</v>

539
00:17:36.071 --> 00:17:37.030
<v Speaker 2>this small step by their,</v>

540
00:17:37.031 --> 00:17:37.930
<v Speaker 2>this most step by there.</v>

541
00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:38.860
<v Speaker 2>And then pretty soon,</v>

542
00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:39.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

543
00:17:39.581 --> 00:17:42.010
<v Speaker 2>we don't leaps tall buildings in a single bound.</v>

544
00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:43.210
<v Speaker 2>We take it a floor at a time.</v>

545
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.850
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

546
00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.200
<v Speaker 3>all the years you've been doing your show,</v>

547
00:17:46.201 --> 00:17:47.850
<v Speaker 3>you've developed a real community,</v>

548
00:17:47.851 --> 00:17:48.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

549
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:48.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

550
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:48.620
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

551
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:48.950
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

552
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.240
<v Speaker 3>you really have made an impact.</v>

553
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 3>If you stop and think about all the people that your show is touched and all the</v>

554
00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 3>people that have listened to your advice and all the people that have taken that</v>

555
00:17:56.971 --> 00:17:57.804
<v Speaker 3>advice and,</v>

556
00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 3>and made those little incremental changes in their lives and set those goals and</v>

557
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 3>held themselves accountable,</v>

558
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty significant thing.</v>

559
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

560
00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:06.883
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

561
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

562
00:18:07.241 --> 00:18:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

563
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.503
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

564
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I know that there's a stigma attached to mental illness and that really bothers</v>

565
00:18:16.251 --> 00:18:16.401
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

566
00:18:16.401 --> 00:18:17.420
<v Speaker 2>There should not be,</v>

567
00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:17.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

568
00:18:17.991 --> 00:18:21.200
<v Speaker 2>having depression or anxiety or whatever.</v>

569
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.093
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

570
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:27.280
<v Speaker 2>it should have no more stigma than having a knee injury or kidney infection or</v>

571
00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:29.960
<v Speaker 2>diabetes.</v>

572
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.960
<v Speaker 2>But there is a stigma attached to it and I've tried to talk about this in a way</v>

573
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.730
<v Speaker 2>where it's okay to talk about it and not be ashamed of it.</v>

574
00:18:40.731 --> 00:18:40.851
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

575
00:18:40.851 --> 00:18:42.980
<v Speaker 2>it's okay if you've got anxiety,</v>

576
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.930
<v Speaker 2>you've got PTSD,</v>

577
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.800
<v Speaker 2>w whatever,</v>

578
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.671
<v Speaker 2>it's okay,</v>

579
00:18:46.671 --> 00:18:47.481
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about it.</v>

580
00:18:47.481 --> 00:18:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Let's get hell for it.</v>

581
00:18:48.321 --> 00:18:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Get it behind you and move on.</v>

582
00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:50.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

583
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.930
<v Speaker 2>just not,</v>

584
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.730
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that you should be ashamed of.</v>

585
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.090
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean</v>

586
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.400
<v Speaker 3>when you talking to someone that maybe has depression,</v>

587
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.470
<v Speaker 3>do you try to get them to exercise first?</v>

588
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:03.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you try to get them to visit a psychiatrist immediately and get on</v>

589
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:04.001
<v Speaker 3>medication?</v>

590
00:19:04.001 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Like do you take it on a case by case basis?</v>

591
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.261
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

592
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:07.591
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

593
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 2>but you have to approach it.</v>

594
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.130
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has a philosophy about it.</v>

595
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.910
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying that mine's any better than anybody else's,</v>

596
00:19:14.911 --> 00:19:19.911
<v Speaker 2>but I do have a philosophy about it and I'm very slow to medication.</v>

597
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.311
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

598
00:19:21.311 --> 00:19:22.144
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

599
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I think you used medication for biochemical replacement.</v>

600
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

601
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:32.190
<v Speaker 2>if for some reason your body is not making enough of something it needs,</v>

602
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 2>then maybe you support it short term biochemically.</v>

603
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.033
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

604
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.180
<v Speaker 2>I look at depression.</v>

605
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.120
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of ways you can break it up,</v>

606
00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Speaker 2>but I look at it like,</v>

607
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.160
<v Speaker 2>is it exogenous depression or endogenous depression?</v>

608
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:50.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

609
00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:54.450
<v Speaker 2>is it coming from the inside out or the outside in?</v>

610
00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Is it because you're reacting to something?</v>

611
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.170
<v Speaker 2>I see a lot of depressed people that</v>

612
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.010
<v Speaker 2>in a sense it makes sense,</v>

613
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

614
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:02.851
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

615
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:04.050
<v Speaker 2>you look at their life and you say,</v>

616
00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:04.884
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

617
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 2>if you're not down about this,</v>

618
00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:07.800
<v Speaker 2>you should be,</v>

619
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:08.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

620
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Speaker 2>you've lost your job.</v>

621
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.070
<v Speaker 2>You've gotten a divorce,</v>

622
00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 2>your health is in the shitter.</v>

623
00:20:12.721 --> 00:20:13.554
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

624
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

625
00:20:14.101 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 2>you should be down about this.</v>

626
00:20:15.811 --> 00:20:17.430
<v Speaker 2>It's external things.</v>

627
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 2>So you don't need a pill.</v>

628
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

629
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.140
<v Speaker 2>put somebody in a chemical straight jacket because their life's fallen apart.</v>

630
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.440
<v Speaker 2>What the hell's that gonna do then?</v>

631
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.210
<v Speaker 2>That's just putting goggles on him where they can't see it.</v>

632
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I would much rather get them to behave their way to success and say,</v>

633
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 2>what are you reacting to that you're depressed about?</v>

634
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Let's put that on a to do list and start,</v>

635
00:20:42.181 --> 00:20:42.841
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

636
00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:45.930
<v Speaker 2>write it down and start crossing those things off.</v>

637
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Let's figure what's an action plan to change this action plan to change the next</v>

638
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:50.434
<v Speaker 2>thing I clean.</v>

639
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.870
<v Speaker 2>And then when you start doing that,</v>

640
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.810
<v Speaker 2>then you generally see their mood lift.</v>

641
00:20:55.811 --> 00:21:00.811
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that are depressed or just realistically reacting to a crummy</v>

642
00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:02.350
<v Speaker 2>circumstance in their life.</v>

643
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily a a mental illness,</v>

644
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 2>it's just a re realistic reaction to a bad spot in their life.</v>

645
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:10.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

646
00:21:10.891 --> 00:21:14.340
<v Speaker 3>that's such a way good way of putting it to that you weren't in a bad state</v>

647
00:21:14.341 --> 00:21:16.850
<v Speaker 3>looking at this might be something wrong with,</v>

648
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

649
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.990
<v Speaker 2>you're in denial.</v>

650
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:18.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

651
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>

652
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.970
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

653
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:20.900
<v Speaker 2>if you've gotten a divorce,</v>

654
00:21:20.901 --> 00:21:21.800
<v Speaker 2>lost your job,</v>

655
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:23.600
<v Speaker 2>your health's in bad shape,</v>

656
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.380
<v Speaker 2>your kids are alienated from you and you're saying,</v>

657
00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine,</v>

658
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.460
<v Speaker 2>then you're not in touch with reality,</v>

659
00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.530
<v Speaker 2>you should be bothered by that.</v>

660
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.833
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

661
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.880
<v Speaker 2>and I think to give somebody a pill to mask your feelings about that just keeps</v>

662
00:21:41.661 --> 00:21:42.680
<v Speaker 2>you off task.</v>

663
00:21:42.681 --> 00:21:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

664
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.570
<v Speaker 2>your pain's a good motivator.</v>

665
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

666
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

667
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.850
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in like Texas and Oklahoma and I don't know you've ever done this,</v>

668
00:21:52.341 --> 00:21:53.510
<v Speaker 2>but we were,</v>

669
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I used to spend my summers in the thriving metropolis of Monday,</v>

670
00:21:58.671 --> 00:21:59.181
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

671
00:21:59.181 --> 00:22:00.020
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of Monday,</v>

672
00:22:00.021 --> 00:22:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Texas?</v>

673
00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.130
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

674
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.731
<v Speaker 2>It's him.</v>

675
00:22:01.731 --> 00:22:02.630
<v Speaker 2>You in?</v>

676
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:03.851
<v Speaker 2>It's a U.</v>

677
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:04.101
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

678
00:22:04.101 --> 00:22:06.470
<v Speaker 2>N.</v>

679
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.470
<v Speaker 2>O.</v>

680
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.470
<v Speaker 2>M.</v>

681
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.470
<v Speaker 2>U.</v>

682
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.470
<v Speaker 2>N.</v>

683
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.470
<v Speaker 2>D.</v>

684
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.470
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

685
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Y.</v>

686
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.870
<v Speaker 2>It's got like 2000 people in it,</v>

687
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.700
<v Speaker 2>but in the summers it would get hot in Monday,</v>

688
00:22:13.701 --> 00:22:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

689
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.130
<v Speaker 2>And when I say hot,</v>

690
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean you look out in the backyard and your dog burst into flame.</v>

691
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.240
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm talking about.</v>

692
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.020
<v Speaker 2>So we would be going to the swimming pool or something,</v>

693
00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:24.883
<v Speaker 2>barefooted.</v>

694
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:30.430
<v Speaker 2>And you get halfway across an asphalt road and you look down and you're like,</v>

695
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.601
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

696
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:32.751
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

697
00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:34.070
<v Speaker 2>your feet are just on fire.</v>

698
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.080
<v Speaker 2>So what are you going to do?</v>

699
00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.011
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

700
00:22:37.011 --> 00:22:38.150
<v Speaker 2>that is painful.</v>

701
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.890
<v Speaker 2>You're going to do one of two things.</v>

702
00:22:39.891 --> 00:22:43.370
<v Speaker 2>You're either going to make a u turn and get your ass back over to the side of</v>

703
00:22:43.371 --> 00:22:47.030
<v Speaker 2>the road and getting the grass or you're going to run to the other side and get</v>

704
00:22:47.031 --> 00:22:48.200
<v Speaker 2>off the road and getting the grass.</v>

705
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.670
<v Speaker 2>But you are not going to stand there in the middle of the road and melt yourself</v>

706
00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:53.690
<v Speaker 2>down to the knees.</v>

707
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Pain is a motivator.</v>

708
00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Paint is not necessarily always bad.</v>

709
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.680
<v Speaker 2>If you're in pain,</v>

710
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.250
<v Speaker 2>it's going to motivate you to move to change something.</v>

711
00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.720
<v Speaker 2>And the mash that with drugs to dull that pain with drugs is not necessarily a</v>

712
00:23:08.721 --> 00:23:09.500
<v Speaker 2>good thing.</v>

713
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.820
<v Speaker 3>That is wise,</v>

714
00:23:10.821 --> 00:23:12.770
<v Speaker 3>wise advice and um,</v>

715
00:23:12.771 --> 00:23:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I wish more people thought that way.</v>

716
00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Particularly more doctors.</v>

717
00:23:15.291 --> 00:23:15.531
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

718
00:23:15.531 --> 00:23:18.750
<v Speaker 3>I have so many friends that have gone to a doctor cause I'm not feeling so good</v>

719
00:23:18.751 --> 00:23:23.300
<v Speaker 3>and that they're almost immediately wanting to throw him on something that's not</v>

720
00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:23.800
<v Speaker 3>smart.</v>

721
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.160
<v Speaker 3>And all the years you've been doing this,</v>

722
00:23:25.161 --> 00:23:29.560
<v Speaker 3>have you noticed like was depression as prevalent like the,</v>

723
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.430
<v Speaker 3>the term depression or was it,</v>

724
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:31.971
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>

725
00:23:31.971 --> 00:23:36.971
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't really remember it being a thing when I was a kid that was</v>

726
00:23:37.071 --> 00:23:38.900
<v Speaker 3>discussed the way it's discussed now.</v>

727
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.250
<v Speaker 3>Now it's discussed the way people discuss all sorts of other ailments.</v>

728
00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Is it just an awareness thing?</v>

729
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Is it just people</v>

730
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 2>were thinking about it now in different terms?</v>

731
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:48.651
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

732
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 2>I think as part of the narrative now,</v>

733
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 2>and I think with social media,</v>

734
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.660
<v Speaker 2>with the Internet,</v>

735
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:54.560
<v Speaker 2>not just social media,</v>

736
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:55.394
<v Speaker 2>with the Internet,</v>

737
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just a lot more,</v>

738
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot more in the nomenclature.</v>

739
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

740
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.740
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot more awareness about it.</v>

741
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.233
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

742
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.650
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was just as prevalent in the fifties and sixties as it was now.</v>

743
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:14.651
<v Speaker 2>But in the fifties and sixties there wasn't a psychologist on every corner and</v>

744
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:19.751
<v Speaker 2>there is now and there wasn't sub doctoral licensing then.</v>

745
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:20.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

746
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:20.600
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

747
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.200
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

748
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

749
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:27.010
<v Speaker 2>back then that you had to have a phd or an MD as a psychiatrist to see patients.</v>

750
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.751
<v Speaker 2>Now they have marriage.</v>

751
00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:30.720
<v Speaker 2>And family therapist,</v>

752
00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:31.970
<v Speaker 2>they've licensed social workers,</v>

753
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:33.410
<v Speaker 2>they have different levels,</v>

754
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.341
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

755
00:24:34.341 --> 00:24:35.990
<v Speaker 2>where you can do independent practice.</v>

756
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:40.991
<v Speaker 2>So that's broadened the number of people that can provide services.</v>

757
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.400
<v Speaker 2>And some people think that's a good thing.</v>

758
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Some people think it's not.</v>

759
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:45.963
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

760
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I generally think it's a,</v>

761
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing because I think [inaudible] 58% of our rural markets today</v>

762
00:24:55.250 --> 00:25:00.250
<v Speaker 2>have no psychiatrist available and something like 50 or roughly have no mental</v>

763
00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:06.890
<v Speaker 2>health professional available at all.</v>

764
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.143
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

765
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:13.240
<v Speaker 2>So there's just nobody available to help people in the outlying areas.</v>

766
00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 2>So I think the more people you can get into the profession,</v>

767
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

768
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.440
<v Speaker 2>so long as there's a degree of competency is better.</v>

769
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.950
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

770
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:22.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it's always been prevalent.</v>

772
00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I just think people didn't talk about it very much.</v>

773
00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just something that I swallowed or they took the church or,</v>

774
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:28.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

775
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

776
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Speaker 2>When you see,</v>

777
00:25:31.521 --> 00:25:31.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

778
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

779
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

780
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 2>all these folks that are on medication today,</v>

781
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:36.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

782
00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:39.680
<v Speaker 2>how many of these people do you think legitimately should be on medication?</v>

783
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.543
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

784
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

785
00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:42.950
<v Speaker 2>is it something that you can assess?</v>

786
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:44.391
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

787
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

788
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't answer that in terms.</v>

789
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm sure there's research of people,</v>

790
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.480
<v Speaker 2>how many people are on medication.</v>

791
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.510
<v Speaker 2>But in my personal experience,</v>

792
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.880
<v Speaker 2>most of the people that I see on medications,</v>

793
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.470
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

794
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:07.160
<v Speaker 2>don't need most of the medications they're on now.</v>

795
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 2>That's just anecdotal.</v>

796
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:09.531
<v Speaker 2>It's my opinion.</v>

797
00:26:09.531 --> 00:26:13.370
<v Speaker 2>He asked me to hand you a research survey or study to support that.</v>

798
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.550
<v Speaker 2>I can't hand it to you or I can't point you to one.</v>

799
00:26:16.551 --> 00:26:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll just tell you after 45 years in this experience,</v>

800
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.640
<v Speaker 2>I see people that are on medication,</v>

801
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.230
<v Speaker 2>they've usually seen,</v>

802
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.173
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

803
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:30.460
<v Speaker 2>someone for six or eight minutes and said,</v>

804
00:26:30.711 --> 00:26:30.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

805
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:32.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm really feeling kind of down a blue.</v>

806
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

807
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:34.970
<v Speaker 2>here's some Prozac,</v>

808
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:35.541
<v Speaker 2>here's this,</v>

809
00:26:35.541 --> 00:26:36.170
<v Speaker 2>here's that.</v>

810
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.003
<v Speaker 2>They give it to them.</v>

811
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:42.220
<v Speaker 2>They don't even really ask why and they just give it to him because medicine has</v>

812
00:26:45.091 --> 00:26:46.680
<v Speaker 2>become a high volume business.</v>

813
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's not necessarily the doctor's fault.</v>

814
00:26:50.881 --> 00:26:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean the way that it's now funded and Medicare and Medicaid,</v>

815
00:26:54.601 --> 00:26:56.150
<v Speaker 2>you got to turn them and burn them and yeah,</v>

816
00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 2>or you can't stay in business.</v>

817
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.480
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a high volume business.</v>

818
00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 2>And so they throw pills at them because they don't have an hour to sit down or</v>

819
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:06.690
<v Speaker 2>don't take an hour to sit down and talk about and say,</v>

820
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

821
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.460
<v Speaker 2>was fine at what's going on.</v>

822
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Is there a reason?</v>

823
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

824
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:15.060
<v Speaker 2>if this guy's got five parts of his life that have gone down or a woman has got</v>

825
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.480
<v Speaker 2>three or four areas of her life that have really gone down in,</v>

826
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.410
<v Speaker 2>in quality,</v>

827
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 2>then they should be having poor mood.</v>

828
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.470
<v Speaker 2>So why mask that?</v>

829
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.560
<v Speaker 2>Let's come up with an action plan and change it.</v>

830
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.440
<v Speaker 2>So most of the people I see on medication,</v>

831
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.303
<v Speaker 2>not all,</v>

832
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.880
<v Speaker 2>but most of the people I see are on too many medications in too high a dose or</v>

833
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:43.260
<v Speaker 2>either don't need it at all and I'm really bothered by polypharmacy.</v>

834
00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:45.690
<v Speaker 2>That's where I really get frustrated.</v>

835
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:46.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

836
00:27:46.511 --> 00:27:49.540
<v Speaker 3>This is what you're saying is a very common sense approach,</v>

837
00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:52.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the norm today.</v>

838
00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:52.750
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

839
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:55.060
<v Speaker 3>It seems like more people are treating this,</v>

840
00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

841
00:27:55.481 --> 00:27:56.051
<v Speaker 3>air quotes,</v>

842
00:27:56.051 --> 00:27:58.540
<v Speaker 3>depression issue as if it's a medical disorder,</v>

843
00:27:58.541 --> 00:27:59.230
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

844
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.020
<v Speaker 3>like diabetes or something where you need medication.</v>

845
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

846
00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:06.070
<v Speaker 2>And look for a lot of people that works.</v>

847
00:28:06.071 --> 00:28:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean you give people a mood elevator and they say,</v>

848
00:28:09.671 --> 00:28:09.881
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

849
00:28:09.881 --> 00:28:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I feel better.</v>

850
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.720
<v Speaker 3>And then maybe they change their life.</v>

851
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.970
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they move their life into a more positive direction.</v>

852
00:28:14.971 --> 00:28:16.200
<v Speaker 3>They can wean themselves off of it.</v>

853
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things about depression for example,</v>

854
00:28:18.581 --> 00:28:19.690
<v Speaker 2>you're using that as an example,</v>

855
00:28:19.691 --> 00:28:24.250
<v Speaker 2>is you get what's referred to as psychomotor retardation.</v>

856
00:28:24.251 --> 00:28:24.730
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

857
00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a lessening in activity level.</v>

858
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.123
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

859
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.340
<v Speaker 2>and I think old sayings get to be old sayings because they're profound.</v>

860
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not going to get hit if you're not swinging well.</v>

861
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

862
00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:43.290
<v Speaker 2>if you're depressed and so you think slower,</v>

863
00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:45.520
<v Speaker 2>less actively,</v>

864
00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.400
<v Speaker 2>you behave less actively,</v>

865
00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.430
<v Speaker 2>your chance of getting rewarded goes down,</v>

866
00:28:51.431 --> 00:28:51.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

867
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't get out there and you don't mix it up socially as much.</v>

868
00:28:55.451 --> 00:28:57.610
<v Speaker 2>You don't apply for jobs as much.</v>

869
00:28:57.611 --> 00:28:59.980
<v Speaker 2>You're not as productive on your job as much,</v>

870
00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.760
<v Speaker 2>so you're less likely to get strokes.</v>

871
00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.120
<v Speaker 2>You're less likely to get rewarded.</v>

872
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

873
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:09.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe you go take a pill and it lifts your mood up so you get more active.</v>

874
00:29:09.371 --> 00:29:11.290
<v Speaker 2>And so now you can start getting pats on the back.</v>

875
00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:13.450
<v Speaker 2>You start getting people to engage with you more,</v>

876
00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.600
<v Speaker 2>so that lifts your mood and is that takes care of it.</v>

877
00:29:16.601 --> 00:29:19.030
<v Speaker 2>So you took the medication short term,</v>

878
00:29:19.031 --> 00:29:21.040
<v Speaker 2>you're lifted back up and you're okay.</v>

879
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Short term it can be an alternative.</v>

880
00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:30.420
<v Speaker 2>But I've seen people on everything from opioids to mood elevators for years and</v>

881
00:29:33.221 --> 00:29:34.930
<v Speaker 2>that's where you lose me.</v>

882
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I just don't get it.</v>

883
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

884
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

885
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I know people that had been on things since they were five years old.</v>

886
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

887
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Speaker 3>And they're in their forties.</v>

888
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:42.423
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

889
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.640
<v Speaker 2>And then you have wastebasket diagnosis like add and ADHD where you know what</v>

890
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:53.410
<v Speaker 2>used to be a spoiled brat is now add or Adhd.</v>

891
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.550
<v Speaker 2>So they start prescribing um,</v>

892
00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.400
<v Speaker 2>these Ritalin neo cortical stimulants like Ritalin.</v>

893
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 2>And if you give a kid that does not need a neocortical stimulant,</v>

894
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.543
<v Speaker 2>a stimulant,</v>

895
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.480
<v Speaker 2>you're really going to throw him off the charts now cause you're,</v>

896
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:15.540
<v Speaker 2>you've got an normally active brain that you're now making hyperactive.</v>

897
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 2>So you're creating a problem that didn't exist before you gave him the</v>

898
00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:23.170
<v Speaker 2>medication because you didn't do the proper diagnosis.</v>

899
00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:23.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

900
00:30:23.781 --> 00:30:26.450
<v Speaker 3>I had my old neighbor had a situation like that.</v>

901
00:30:26.451 --> 00:30:29.690
<v Speaker 3>They had a kid and the kid was just had a lot of energy and they weren't paying</v>

902
00:30:29.691 --> 00:30:32.420
<v Speaker 3>attention to them and so they started medicating them.</v>

903
00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.580
<v Speaker 3>It's insanely common.</v>

904
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

905
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:39.800
<v Speaker 3>And you cannot chemically babysit your children and who knows where these kids</v>

906
00:30:39.801 --> 00:30:40.491
<v Speaker 3>are going to be 20,</v>

907
00:30:40.491 --> 00:30:41.330
<v Speaker 3>30 years from now.</v>

908
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:41.541
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

909
00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:46.541
<v Speaker 3>we're just looking at this rash of people being treated for these ailments,</v>

910
00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:51.170
<v Speaker 3>air quotes and then when we're not seeing how this all turns out in the long run</v>

911
00:30:51.171 --> 00:30:52.790
<v Speaker 3>and how much damage we're doing to these people.</v>

912
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:53.873
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

913
00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.381
<v Speaker 2>In fairness,</v>

914
00:30:55.381 --> 00:30:56.820
<v Speaker 2>on the other end of the continuum,</v>

915
00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I have seen some people that are clearly psychotic.</v>

916
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

917
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.653
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia,</v>

918
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:04.920
<v Speaker 2>delusional,</v>

919
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.520
<v Speaker 2>that without medication are absolutely impossible to manage.</v>

920
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:17.270
<v Speaker 2>But if you put them on anti psychotics and so you can lower their delusional</v>

921
00:31:18.421 --> 00:31:19.560
<v Speaker 2>behavior there,</v>

922
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.940
<v Speaker 2>hallucinatory behavior,</v>

923
00:31:20.941 --> 00:31:25.941
<v Speaker 2>so you can now have a meaningful conversation with them so they can respond to</v>

924
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.730
<v Speaker 2>talking therapies.</v>

925
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.830
<v Speaker 2>It makes all the difference in the world.</v>

926
00:31:31.831 --> 00:31:33.810
<v Speaker 2>And without those anti-psychotics,</v>

927
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.300
<v Speaker 2>you would be lost without them.</v>

928
00:31:36.301 --> 00:31:41.301
<v Speaker 2>So there are some medications for some disorders that are absolute miracles that</v>

929
00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:44.670
<v Speaker 2>without them you wouldn't be able to do the work you need to do to get the</v>

930
00:31:44.671 --> 00:31:45.990
<v Speaker 2>person back where they need to be.</v>

931
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

932
00:31:46.301 --> 00:31:46.991
<v Speaker 3>unquestionably.</v>

933
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:49.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's definitely a lot of great pharmaceutical drugs that helped a lot</v>

934
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:50.560
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>

935
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Do you get pushback from a lot of these positions from the established medical</v>

936
00:31:55.421 --> 00:31:56.254
<v Speaker 3>community?</v>

937
00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:56.951
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

938
00:31:56.951 --> 00:31:57.620
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

939
00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.453
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

940
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.830
<v Speaker 2>mostly when you talk to people about it thoughtfully.</v>

941
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.443
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

942
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.690
<v Speaker 2>they agree with,</v>

943
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.760
<v Speaker 2>with what I'm saying.</v>

944
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean most people will agree that you need to be thoughtful about prescribing</v>

945
00:32:14.831 --> 00:32:19.831
<v Speaker 2>medications and that medications are too readily administered.</v>

946
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:24.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's certainly what we've seen in the opioid epidemic right now.</v>

947
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

948
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:29.650
<v Speaker 2>opioids are so readily prescribed right now that there are Neff opioid</v>

949
00:32:29.651 --> 00:32:31.810
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions for every man,</v>

950
00:32:31.811 --> 00:32:34.060
<v Speaker 2>woman and child in America to have their own bottle.</v>

951
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 2>And if you renew that prescription one time,</v>

952
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.021
<v Speaker 2>one time,</v>

953
00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 2>if you are taking those opioids at the seven day mark,</v>

954
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.420
<v Speaker 2>your chance of being addicted at one year is one in 12.</v>

955
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 2>And if you renew it at,</v>

956
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.650
<v Speaker 2>if you're still taking them at 30 days,</v>

957
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.790
<v Speaker 2>your likelihood of being addicted is one in three.</v>

958
00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.953
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

959
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:05.620
<v Speaker 2>And these things are getting written with way too high appeal count.</v>

960
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

961
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.940
<v Speaker 2>and so the addictions,</v>

962
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

963
00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:11.590
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

964
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:16.590
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing a whole different kind of addiction now coming out of the suburbs</v>

965
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.620
<v Speaker 2>and they take them for a while and they're very expensive and actually take him</v>

966
00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:22.131
<v Speaker 2>for a while.</v>

967
00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Heroin's cheaper.</v>

968
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.540
<v Speaker 2>So they dumped the opioids and start taking heroin.</v>

969
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:27.890
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying soccer mom,</v>

970
00:33:27.891 --> 00:33:32.891
<v Speaker 2>heroin addicts that you weren't saying 10 years ago because they get started on</v>

971
00:33:33.201 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 2>prescription opioids and in the can't afford them.</v>

972
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Or finally the doctor cuts them off,</v>

973
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:41.210
<v Speaker 2>but they're addicted and so they start taking heroin because it's cheaper.</v>

974
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Now this is obviously a very disturbing pattern,</v>

975
00:33:43.551 --> 00:33:44.720
<v Speaker 3>but where do you see us going?</v>

976
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.790
<v Speaker 3>Like when you look at the future and mean?</v>

977
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.470
<v Speaker 3>It looks bleak in that regard.</v>

978
00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:48.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

979
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:51.500
<v Speaker 3>I've known several people that have had real problems with pills.</v>

980
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

981
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.290
<v Speaker 2>The problem that,</v>

982
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.530
<v Speaker 2>that I think people have is they think,</v>

983
00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.730
<v Speaker 2>because a doctor gave me this because it's on a prescription pad that this is</v>

984
00:34:00.731 --> 00:34:01.210
<v Speaker 2>safe,</v>

985
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:05.320
<v Speaker 2>that your body doesn't know whether you got that in a back alley or you got it</v>

986
00:34:05.321 --> 00:34:06.154
<v Speaker 2>from a doctor.</v>

987
00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.700
<v Speaker 2>It still has the same addictive quality.</v>

988
00:34:09.701 --> 00:34:11.770
<v Speaker 2>And I think it is at an epidemic level.</v>

989
00:34:11.771 --> 00:34:16.771
<v Speaker 2>And I've testified before Congress about this and I think there were several</v>

990
00:34:18.131 --> 00:34:22.360
<v Speaker 2>levels of accountability at the manufacturing level and at the prescription</v>

991
00:34:22.361 --> 00:34:24.670
<v Speaker 2>level and at the educational level.</v>

992
00:34:24.671 --> 00:34:25.990
<v Speaker 2>So people understand,</v>

993
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

994
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody has to take part of it and I'm doing everything I can to raise</v>

995
00:34:30.911 --> 00:34:32.380
<v Speaker 2>the awareness about it as well.</v>

996
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.930
<v Speaker 3>When you testified before Congress,</v>

997
00:34:33.931 --> 00:34:34.920
<v Speaker 3>what was the reaction?</v>

998
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

999
00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:41.210
<v Speaker 2>they're very much aware that this has become a serious,</v>

1000
00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:46.550
<v Speaker 2>serious problem because the cost as,</v>

1001
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.640
<v Speaker 2>as you see the last labor in the workforce is in the billions of dollars.</v>

1002
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.390
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1003
00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:54.360
<v Speaker 2>you see the,</v>

1004
00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:55.450
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1005
00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:55.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1006
00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.980
<v Speaker 2>demands on the healthcare system that this is creating a young mothers with,</v>

1007
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:06.600
<v Speaker 2>with children and babies born addicted to these opioids.</v>

1008
00:35:06.601 --> 00:35:08.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean the numbers are just going through the roof.</v>

1009
00:35:08.671 --> 00:35:09.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1010
00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:14.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's putting a strain financially on healthcare system that it just can't</v>

1011
00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:14.521
<v Speaker 2>stand.</v>

1012
00:35:14.521 --> 00:35:19.521
<v Speaker 2>So you start costing money and it starts getting politicians' attention.</v>

1013
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.151
<v Speaker 2>So they start saying,</v>

1014
00:35:21.151 --> 00:35:21.361
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1015
00:35:21.361 --> 00:35:22.740
<v Speaker 2>now we gotta start doing something.</v>

1016
00:35:22.741 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

1017
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.031
<v Speaker 2>they get it.</v>

1018
00:35:24.031 --> 00:35:25.200
<v Speaker 2>They get that there's a problem.</v>

1019
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.580
<v Speaker 3>What could they do though once it seems like once that genie's out of the</v>

1020
00:35:28.581 --> 00:35:29.414
<v Speaker 3>bottle?</v>

1021
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Well clearly you've got to start educating people and</v>

1022
00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:41.860
<v Speaker 2>the manufacturers have to be required to start labeling this much more clearly.</v>

1023
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Physicians have to be much more um,</v>

1024
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.860
<v Speaker 2>conservative in prescribing.</v>

1025
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.173
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1026
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:51.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1027
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I just had to shoulder surgery and um,</v>

1028
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I took like one,</v>

1029
00:35:58.590 --> 00:35:59.670
<v Speaker 2>one opioid,</v>

1030
00:35:59.671 --> 00:36:04.671
<v Speaker 2>one pill they gave me in the hospital and after that you can manage it with like</v>

1031
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Tylenol or something.</v>

1032
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Cause the surgeons now are so good with the arthroscopic surgeries and stuff,</v>

1033
00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:16.230
<v Speaker 2>it's so much less of an insult to the body.</v>

1034
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1035
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 2>that was ice and Tylenol and stuff.</v>

1036
00:36:20.101 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 2>You can manage it if you just kind of focus on it a little bit.</v>

1037
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.190
<v Speaker 2>And then I might say,</v>

1038
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:26.640
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>

1039
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 2>if you've had surgery and you're having organic pain,</v>

1040
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:31.350
<v Speaker 2>for God's sakes,</v>

1041
00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:33.000
<v Speaker 2>get ahead of the pain and stay ahead.</v>

1042
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.800
<v Speaker 2>But when you,</v>

1043
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.540
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you can get off of it,</v>

1044
00:36:36.541 --> 00:36:38.730
<v Speaker 2>get off of it and understand what's happening.</v>

1045
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.820
<v Speaker 2>There's no sense of being like macho.</v>

1047
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.740
<v Speaker 2>We don't need a leather strap between your cheese and go have some surgery.</v>

1048
00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:44.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1049
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.611
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

1050
00:36:44.611 --> 00:36:45.091
<v Speaker 2>if it hurts,</v>

1051
00:36:45.091 --> 00:36:46.500
<v Speaker 2>take the pill and get past it,</v>

1052
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 2>but realize the minute you can get away from that,</v>

1053
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:50.880
<v Speaker 2>you need to get away from it.</v>

1054
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:51.871
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1055
00:36:51.871 --> 00:36:54.570
<v Speaker 2>they don't need to give you a 30 day supply.</v>

1056
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1057
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.470
<v Speaker 2>They need to give you three or four days and then you've got to go see your</v>

1058
00:36:58.471 --> 00:36:59.251
<v Speaker 2>doctor again.</v>

1059
00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:00.510
<v Speaker 2>If it's still a problem,</v>

1060
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.793
<v Speaker 2>discuss it.</v>

1061
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:02.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1062
00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:03.564
<v Speaker 2>that's what the,</v>

1063
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.690
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think needs to happen to just be a lot more conservative about</v>

1064
00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:07.524
<v Speaker 2>what you're giving</v>

1065
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:08.500
<v Speaker 3>is a promise.</v>

1066
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.670
<v Speaker 3>These pharmaceutical companies make so much money,</v>

1067
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:11.870
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to,</v>

1068
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:15.140
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to back off that they got private jets and yachts to pay for.</v>

1069
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:15.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1070
00:37:15.881 --> 00:37:17.020
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to shut down.</v>

1071
00:37:17.021 --> 00:37:17.854
<v Speaker 2>Some of these,</v>

1072
00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:22.890
<v Speaker 2>they had some of these pill clinics in pain clinics in Florida where you could</v>

1073
00:37:23.921 --> 00:37:27.790
<v Speaker 2>go in without an x ray without an MRI and just say you had back pain and there</v>

1074
00:37:27.791 --> 00:37:31.690
<v Speaker 2>was a doctor there that would give you a 90 count prescription on the spot.</v>

1075
00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:36.100
<v Speaker 2>No questions asked 90 [inaudible] and you're out the door and you go down the</v>

1076
00:37:36.101 --> 00:37:36.934
<v Speaker 2>street to the next one.</v>

1077
00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:37.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1078
00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Cause there was no database,</v>

1079
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:39.700
<v Speaker 2>no database.</v>

1080
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:44.380
<v Speaker 2>And that doctor might be a foreign doctor that flew in from off shore road.</v>

1081
00:37:44.381 --> 00:37:48.070
<v Speaker 2>All the prescriptions during the day flew off again at night and now they're</v>

1082
00:37:48.071 --> 00:37:51.160
<v Speaker 2>shutting that stuff down so that the hammer's coming down.</v>

1083
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.430
<v Speaker 3>Well one can only hope.</v>

1084
00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:54.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1085
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.100
<v Speaker 3>when you've been doing your show,</v>

1086
00:37:56.101 --> 00:37:59.300
<v Speaker 3>as long as you've been doing it and I'm sure you,</v>

1087
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 3>you've made a ton of loot,</v>

1088
00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:01.970
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1089
00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.450
<v Speaker 3>what makes you want to do a podcast?</v>

1090
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.703
<v Speaker 3>Why doing that?</v>

1091
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Well my interest has been,</v>

1092
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:14.040
<v Speaker 2>you were saying there were a lot of people getting their information on the</v>

1093
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:14.874
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

1094
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.340
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>

1095
00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.190
<v Speaker 2>By getting clips of the show and that sort of thing.</v>

1096
00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:25.540
<v Speaker 2>And it's clear to me that is the population is changing.</v>

1097
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:26.451
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1098
00:38:26.451 --> 00:38:27.284
<v Speaker 2>I'm an old guy,</v>

1099
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:32.150
<v Speaker 2>but younger people are getting their information in different ways,</v>

1100
00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:32.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1101
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.090
<v Speaker 2>are going to the Internet and the</v>

1102
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:41.730
<v Speaker 2>menu has got to be readily available and you can reach a lot of people that way</v>

1103
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 2>that you wouldn't reach the other way.</v>

1104
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole population that's not going to watch broadcast television during</v>

1105
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:50.254
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>

1106
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.320
<v Speaker 2>And there's a whole population that's watching broadcast television and today</v>

1107
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.270
<v Speaker 2>that maybe isn't on in,</v>

1108
00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.720
<v Speaker 2>in the digital space.</v>

1109
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:03.810
<v Speaker 2>And if I can get a crossover between the two and you can get a bigger audience</v>

1110
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:05.140
<v Speaker 2>to spread your message,</v>

1111
00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:06.370
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

1112
00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:07.540
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're doing up.</v>

1113
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:12.541
<v Speaker 2>My goal is to spread the message and get what I think's important to say out</v>

1114
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:13.120
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1115
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.200
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1116
00:39:14.201 --> 00:39:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll shout it from the rooftops if that's what I can,</v>

1117
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.640
<v Speaker 2>if I think that's effective,</v>

1118
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to do anything that's scalable to get the message out there.</v>

1119
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:24.484
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1120
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:25.900
<v Speaker 2>and to me,</v>

1121
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:26.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1122
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:27.483
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing,</v>

1123
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing some different things in the podcast and I'm doing on the show,</v>

1124
00:39:31.121 --> 00:39:31.954
<v Speaker 2>on the show.</v>

1125
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I've got a fact pattern in front of me.</v>

1126
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I've got a story,</v>

1127
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:36.640
<v Speaker 2>I got a family,</v>

1128
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:40.360
<v Speaker 2>got an individual that's got a specific fact pair and I'm dealing with that fact</v>

1129
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:42.850
<v Speaker 2>pattern in the podcast.</v>

1130
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm not solving a problem.</v>

1131
00:39:44.141 --> 00:39:49.141
<v Speaker 2>I don't have somebody there that has a problem for me to solve.</v>

1132
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking to people that I find interesting and I'm able to talk to them</v>

1133
00:39:55.241 --> 00:39:58.150
<v Speaker 2>about whatever I want to talk to him about and discuss things like you and I are</v>

1134
00:39:58.151 --> 00:39:58.931
<v Speaker 2>talking about right now.</v>

1135
00:39:58.931 --> 00:39:59.764
<v Speaker 2>I think this is,</v>

1136
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:04.770
<v Speaker 2>I think what we've been talking about is an important discussion and I welcome</v>

1137
00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:10.420
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity to have that discussion and I don't have time to do that when</v>

1138
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:12.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about somebody who's sitting there saying,</v>

1139
00:40:12.371 --> 00:40:13.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1140
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I think my kid is on the precipice of overdosing or is really in trouble and</v>

1141
00:40:19.731 --> 00:40:21.310
<v Speaker 2>then I got to focus on that.</v>

1142
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't have time to pontificate about such things as the opioid epidemic or the</v>

1143
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:31.540
<v Speaker 2>philosophy of pills versus therapy and things of that nature.</v>

1144
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Cause I have to give all my attention to the story in front of me in a podcast</v>

1145
00:40:36.671 --> 00:40:38.110
<v Speaker 2>environment like we're doing now.</v>

1146
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk about things that I think people need to hear.</v>

1147
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:42.921
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1148
00:40:42.921 --> 00:40:43.481
<v Speaker 2>if they don't,</v>

1149
00:40:43.481 --> 00:40:44.320
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to listen.</v>

1150
00:40:44.321 --> 00:40:45.154
<v Speaker 2>But if they,</v>

1151
00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.210
<v Speaker 2>if they're interested,</v>

1152
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:46.841
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>

1153
00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:51.490
<v Speaker 2>So I like it being more free form and me being able to talk about things.</v>

1154
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:52.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1155
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about what makes people a champion.</v>

1156
00:40:55.661 --> 00:41:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Like I talked to Tony Romo right after the Superbowl about,</v>

1157
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:00.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1158
00:41:00.431 --> 00:41:02.350
<v Speaker 2>he came from eastern Illinois University.</v>

1159
00:41:02.351 --> 00:41:03.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like got what,</v>

1160
00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:08.200
<v Speaker 2>nine students or something and he's a little bit of university and he turns out</v>

1161
00:41:08.201 --> 00:41:12.460
<v Speaker 2>to be quarterback of America's team for 14 years,</v>

1162
00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:17.020
<v Speaker 2>set all kinds of records and then goes to the booth and becomes a number one</v>

1163
00:41:17.021 --> 00:41:19.960
<v Speaker 2>color analyst and television mean champion,</v>

1164
00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 2>champion champion.</v>

1165
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Why you,</v>

1166
00:41:22.331 --> 00:41:23.164
<v Speaker 2>what is it that,</v>

1167
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 2>what do you attribute that to?</v>

1168
00:41:24.641 --> 00:41:27.220
<v Speaker 2>I like asking those questions and hearing people talk.</v>

1169
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.800
<v Speaker 2>What do you say to young people about that?</v>

1170
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:30.990
<v Speaker 2>What made you a champion?</v>

1171
00:41:30.991 --> 00:41:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to let your kids play football with all the CTE and stuff?</v>

1172
00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:35.541
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1173
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 2>what do you say I'm at?</v>

1174
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.450
<v Speaker 2>I like having those kind of conversation.</v>

1175
00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Did the same thing with Shaq and Charles Barkley and different people.</v>

1176
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.610
<v Speaker 2>What did he say about what makes you a champion,</v>

1177
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1178
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.100
<v Speaker 2>for him?</v>

1179
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:47.223
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1180
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 2>he said that he has this,</v>

1181
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:52.244
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1182
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.040
<v Speaker 2>he says he didn't,</v>

1183
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.650
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't the kind of swagger sort of person that,</v>

1184
00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1185
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 2>came in cocky like he was going to own the field and own the game.</v>

1186
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:08.410
<v Speaker 2>But inside he said he had this absolute drive that if he didn't win,</v>

1187
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.940
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't live with it is like if somebody thought like he played the game,</v>

1188
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:21.800
<v Speaker 2>somebody beat them,</v>

1189
00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:22.640
<v Speaker 2>beat him.</v>

1190
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 2>That just the idea that that person went home thinking that they were better</v>

1191
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 2>than him,</v>

1192
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.020
<v Speaker 2>that they could beat him,</v>

1193
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:34.010
<v Speaker 2>that he just couldn't eat sleep.</v>

1194
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Think until he got back and owned it again and got back to it.</v>

1195
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:41.060
<v Speaker 2>He said he just is this drive to win.</v>

1196
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.600
<v Speaker 2>And so he would mean,</v>

1197
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.780
<v Speaker 2>he said he would be out at one o'clock in the morning and the dome throwing a</v>

1198
00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:48.500
<v Speaker 2>pass,</v>

1199
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.500
<v Speaker 2>that that route got intercepted.</v>

1200
00:42:51.501 --> 00:42:56.501
<v Speaker 2>He got jumped on that route and he be trying to figure out why on Thursday in</v>

1201
00:42:58.161 --> 00:42:58.940
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>

1202
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.740
<v Speaker 2>he saw what he needed to see,</v>

1203
00:43:00.741 --> 00:43:02.300
<v Speaker 2>why didn't he see it on Sunday?</v>

1204
00:43:02.301 --> 00:43:05.390
<v Speaker 2>And he would analyze and analyze and analyze until he could get there,</v>

1205
00:43:05.391 --> 00:43:06.141
<v Speaker 2>until he could do it,</v>

1206
00:43:06.141 --> 00:43:06.960
<v Speaker 2>until he could win it.</v>

1207
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.510
<v Speaker 2>He just had this drive to win</v>

1208
00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.560
<v Speaker 3>that super unhealthy obsession.</v>

1209
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.080
<v Speaker 3>They all share that Michael Jordan had that.</v>

1210
00:43:14.081 --> 00:43:14.321
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1211
00:43:14.321 --> 00:43:16.340
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about that several times on the podcast.</v>

1212
00:43:16.341 --> 00:43:19.300
<v Speaker 3>So many people that are extreme winners,</v>

1213
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.330
<v Speaker 3>they're psychotic and their obsession with winning.</v>

1214
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:23.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:24.460
<v Speaker 3>That's all they wanna do.</v>

1216
00:43:24.461 --> 00:43:26.320
<v Speaker 3>And if they lose the date day,</v>

1217
00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:27.570
<v Speaker 3>it's almost in software,</v>

1218
00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:28.840
<v Speaker 3>but they almost can't deal with it.</v>

1219
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:30.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1220
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.050
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1221
00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:33.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing,</v>

1222
00:43:33.661 --> 00:43:37.980
<v Speaker 2>but the difference between winners and losers as winners do things,</v>

1223
00:43:37.981 --> 00:43:39.660
<v Speaker 2>losers do not want to do.</v>

1224
00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:41.010
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1225
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.900
<v Speaker 2>they will get up in the middle of the night,</v>

1226
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.980
<v Speaker 2>they will do this,</v>

1227
00:43:43.981 --> 00:43:44.850
<v Speaker 2>they will do that.</v>

1228
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.260
<v Speaker 2>They feel it more.</v>

1229
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.780
<v Speaker 2>They just do things losers don't want to do.</v>

1230
00:43:48.781 --> 00:43:49.920
<v Speaker 2>They pay a price.</v>

1231
00:43:49.921 --> 00:43:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Losers just don't want to pay.</v>

1232
00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:53.460
<v Speaker 2>And Luther say it's just not worth it.</v>

1233
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:55.860
<v Speaker 2>And every winter has been loser.</v>

1234
00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh well that's what made him a winner.</v>

1235
00:43:59.100 --> 00:43:59.933
<v Speaker 2>If all you ever,</v>

1236
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:00.461
<v Speaker 2>if it's a,</v>

1237
00:44:00.461 --> 00:44:03.450
<v Speaker 2>if you go through life as in a success only journey,</v>

1238
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:04.921
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1239
00:44:04.921 --> 00:44:06.750
<v Speaker 2>how boring would that be me?</v>

1240
00:44:06.751 --> 00:44:07.860
<v Speaker 2>You think it would be great,</v>

1241
00:44:07.861 --> 00:44:11.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's like eating ice cream every meal about the fourth meal you're going to</v>

1242
00:44:11.581 --> 00:44:12.240
<v Speaker 2>be thinking,</v>

1243
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:12.810
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1244
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.130
<v Speaker 2>let's kill something and eat it.</v>

1245
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.850
<v Speaker 3>Well it's like who are you talking about about depression,</v>

1246
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.200
<v Speaker 3>about that bad feelings will motivate you to change if you're in a bad feeling,</v>

1247
00:44:21.201 --> 00:44:21.591
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1248
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:23.150
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a bad state in your life,</v>

1249
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.880
<v Speaker 3>that pain is an amazing motivator.</v>

1250
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.580
<v Speaker 3>And even though it feels terrible at the time,</v>

1251
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 3>it can propel you to a new and better life because you don't ever want to</v>

1252
00:44:32.341 --> 00:44:35.250
<v Speaker 3>experience that again and make you grow and be a better person.</v>

1253
00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1254
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:39.470
<v Speaker 2>And you got to decide what's your currency.</v>

1255
00:44:39.471 --> 00:44:40.304
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1256
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.200
<v Speaker 2>cause you say,</v>

1257
00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:42.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1258
00:44:42.581 --> 00:44:46.040
<v Speaker 2>you've done your show a long time and probably don't need the money,</v>

1259
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:48.770
<v Speaker 2>but there are different kinds of currency,</v>

1260
00:44:48.771 --> 00:44:49.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1261
00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean you don't always work for one kind of currency.</v>

1262
00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:58.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean every year when we wrap our season,</v>

1263
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I kind of take a month and let everybody go and rat,</v>

1264
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1265
00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.490
<v Speaker 2>just kind of unwind and relax and kick back and do whatever they want to do.</v>

1266
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.240
<v Speaker 2>And then we start meeting and focusing on,</v>

1267
00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:12.074
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1268
00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.230
<v Speaker 2>how can we reinvent ourselves for next season?</v>

1269
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:17.480
<v Speaker 2>How can we tell our stories better?</v>

1270
00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:20.930
<v Speaker 2>How can we broaden our horizons,</v>

1271
00:45:20.931 --> 00:45:25.931
<v Speaker 2>do things different so that we raise our game because we're kind of competing</v>

1272
00:45:26.541 --> 00:45:27.440
<v Speaker 2>with ourselves.</v>

1273
00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.000
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1274
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:29.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1275
00:45:29.301 --> 00:45:32.430
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of in a category by ourselves within the,</v>

1276
00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.070
<v Speaker 2>when it does what we do.</v>

1277
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:39.660
<v Speaker 2>And we've been number one for a long time because I got a really hardworking</v>

1278
00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.041
<v Speaker 2>team,</v>

1279
00:45:40.041 --> 00:45:43.340
<v Speaker 2>but we're in a s nobody else tries to do what we do.</v>

1280
00:45:43.341 --> 00:45:46.160
<v Speaker 2>So we're kind of competing with ourselves.</v>

1281
00:45:46.161 --> 00:45:47.380
<v Speaker 2>And so we're,</v>

1282
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:51.410
<v Speaker 2>we work real hard to figure out how can we have a bigger impact?</v>

1283
00:45:51.411 --> 00:45:54.080
<v Speaker 2>How can we tell this more effectively?</v>

1284
00:45:54.081 --> 00:45:59.081
<v Speaker 2>What techniques can we come up with that make this even more powerful,</v>

1285
00:46:00.261 --> 00:46:01.790
<v Speaker 2>more impactful than what it is?</v>

1286
00:46:01.791 --> 00:46:02.624
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>

1287
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1288
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.120
<v Speaker 2>that's what really gets me moving.</v>

1289
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.541
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1290
00:46:05.541 --> 00:46:06.380
<v Speaker 3>it's very telling.</v>

1291
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.621
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1292
00:46:06.621 --> 00:46:06.891
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1293
00:46:06.891 --> 00:46:10.790
<v Speaker 3>that's why I would imagine you move towards doing a podcast where it's less</v>

1294
00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:13.770
<v Speaker 3>restrictive and more open ended and you can kind of do whatever you want.</v>

1295
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:14.300
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1296
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.133
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1297
00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.860
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty cool that at all these years of doing that and giving out advice,</v>

1298
00:46:18.861 --> 00:46:20.930
<v Speaker 3>he's still find this,</v>

1299
00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.190
<v Speaker 3>this passion to,</v>

1300
00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:24.590
<v Speaker 3>to make it better and to do it from a different angle.</v>

1301
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1302
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.020
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1303
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm as excited about,</v>

1304
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:29.850
<v Speaker 2>we're just about to wrap,</v>

1305
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:30.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1306
00:46:30.401 --> 00:46:31.420
<v Speaker 2>our 17th season</v>

1307
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:33.833
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1308
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:34.883
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot.</v>

1309
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.940
<v Speaker 2>How many episodes you've done coming up on 3000.</v>

1310
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1311
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:43.380
<v Speaker 2>and I did Oprah for five years before.</v>

1312
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

1313
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.993
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1314
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

1315
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.960
<v Speaker 2>that's 22 years and then,</v>

1316
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.380
<v Speaker 2>and then I just renewed for five years,</v>

1317
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:54.030
<v Speaker 2>moved out to 20,</v>

1318
00:46:54.031 --> 00:46:56.280
<v Speaker 2>23 before you sign that,</v>

1319
00:46:56.281 --> 00:46:56.491
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1320
00:46:56.491 --> 00:46:57.324
<v Speaker 2>what am I,</v>

1321
00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:57.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1322
00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:58.620
<v Speaker 2>let's go fishing.</v>

1323
00:46:58.650 --> 00:46:58.861
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1324
00:46:58.861 --> 00:47:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Robin and I thought about it,</v>

1325
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:00.661
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1326
00:47:00.661 --> 00:47:00.841
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1327
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:01.890
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do?</v>

1328
00:47:01.891 --> 00:47:02.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1329
00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:03.003
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1330
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see you enjoy it.</v>

1331
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I do.</v>

1332
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:06.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1333
00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:06.750
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>

1334
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:11.750
<v Speaker 2>He could tell and I've always told my team the thing that we don't want,</v>

1335
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get bored.</v>

1336
00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:17.160
<v Speaker 2>And if it gets formulaic for me,</v>

1337
00:47:17.161 --> 00:47:18.810
<v Speaker 2>it'll be formulaic for the viewer.</v>

1338
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want that to happen.</v>

1339
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:21.361
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1340
00:47:21.361 --> 00:47:26.361
<v Speaker 2>we do a lot of news stories and stuff and that keeps it fresh because you don't</v>

1341
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 2>know what's going to break in the news tomorrow.</v>

1342
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:34.040
<v Speaker 2>And so we do most of the really big news stories and we don't break the news</v>

1343
00:47:35.371 --> 00:47:35.891
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>

1344
00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:37.240
<v Speaker 2>We go behind the headline,</v>

1345
00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:39.130
<v Speaker 2>talk about here's what really happened.</v>

1346
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:40.990
<v Speaker 2>As Paul Harvey said,</v>

1347
00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:44.290
<v Speaker 2>here's the rest of the story is what you read in the headline.</v>

1348
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:44.671
<v Speaker 2>Now here's,</v>

1349
00:47:44.671 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 2>here's the rest of the story.</v>

1350
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.280
<v Speaker 2>And I really liked doing that.</v>

1351
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I really like getting into that.</v>

1352
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.173
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1353
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 3>and when you're doing this on your podcast,</v>

1354
00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:55.271
<v Speaker 3>well I'm,</v>

1355
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:57.580
<v Speaker 3>one of the beautiful things about that is that,</v>

1356
00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:58.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1357
00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:01.180
<v Speaker 3>you can explore these ideas without commercial breaks.</v>

1358
00:48:01.181 --> 00:48:04.180
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have anybody telling you what to do.</v>

1359
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:05.014
<v Speaker 3>You could just,</v>

1360
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever's interesting to you.</v>

1361
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Is that how you pick the subjects and the people that you're talking to?</v>

1362
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1363
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Like this week I,</v>

1364
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I had on Pam Meyers who wrote lie spotting,</v>

1365
00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:17.530
<v Speaker 3>I spend a lot of motherfuckers,</v>

1366
00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:20.240
<v Speaker 3>is that a book on liars by spotting?</v>

1367
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1368
00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:25.750
<v Speaker 2>And I spent a lot of my career on deception detection because I spent a lot of</v>

1369
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:27.370
<v Speaker 2>time in the litigation arena,</v>

1370
00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1371
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:29.460
<v Speaker 2>on interrogation technique.</v>

1372
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's how you met over,</v>

1373
00:48:30.401 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1374
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1375
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:32.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1376
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:33.310
<v Speaker 3>That was when she was doing that.</v>

1377
00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:33.441
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1378
00:48:33.441 --> 00:48:33.640
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1379
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.350
<v Speaker 3>the beef industry was sooner.</v>

1380
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:35.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1381
00:48:35.561 --> 00:48:37.180
<v Speaker 3>The mad cow case in Amarillo,</v>

1382
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1383
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:38.613
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1384
00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:41.690
<v Speaker 2>She got sued for a couple of billion dollars and um,</v>

1385
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:42.591
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1386
00:48:42.591 --> 00:48:44.150
<v Speaker 2>represented her in that case.</v>

1387
00:48:44.151 --> 00:48:44.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1388
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:45.343
<v Speaker 2>that's how we met.</v>

1389
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.100
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1390
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:47.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1391
00:48:47.361 --> 00:48:52.361
<v Speaker 2>I had Pam on and we've both worked a lot in deception detection and</v>

1392
00:48:52.641 --> 00:48:54.380
<v Speaker 2>interrogation techniques and stuff.</v>

1393
00:48:54.381 --> 00:48:55.880
<v Speaker 2>And so just,</v>

1394
00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.460
<v Speaker 2>and it came right at a time when,</v>

1395
00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:02.800
<v Speaker 2>you know Jesse Smollett is in the news about it.</v>

1396
00:49:02.801 --> 00:49:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Is he telling the truth?</v>

1397
00:49:03.801 --> 00:49:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Was he not telling the truth?</v>

1398
00:49:04.851 --> 00:49:06.380
<v Speaker 2>And in here we have this conversation.</v>

1399
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.850
<v Speaker 3>What did you think immediately when you heard that story?</v>

1400
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1401
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I was very suspicious when I heard this story.</v>

1402
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:12.091
<v Speaker 3>Jamie and I,</v>

1403
00:49:12.091 --> 00:49:13.770
<v Speaker 3>we shut that once the cameras are off,</v>

1404
00:49:13.771 --> 00:49:14.850
<v Speaker 3>we're leg these off.</v>

1405
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that guy.</v>

1406
00:49:16.131 --> 00:49:17.090
<v Speaker 3>That he's real,</v>

1407
00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.730
<v Speaker 3>that nobody does this.</v>

1408
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.300
<v Speaker 3>It was just too much like a movie.</v>

1409
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1410
00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:24.120
<v Speaker 3>It was a bad movie.</v>

1411
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1412
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:31.430
<v Speaker 2>It's nine below zero and two people are lying and white just in hopes that he</v>

1413
00:49:31.501 --> 00:49:32.730
<v Speaker 2>might come by</v>

1414
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:33.460
<v Speaker 3>who I am.</v>

1415
00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1416
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:34.503
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1417
00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:35.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1418
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.950
<v Speaker 3>so strange.</v>

1419
00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1420
00:49:37.261 --> 00:49:37.590
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1421
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.830
<v Speaker 3>it was suspicious and you know,</v>

1422
00:49:39.831 --> 00:49:43.040
<v Speaker 3>he's entitled to due process and he's going to get it.</v>

1423
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:43.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1424
00:49:43.881 --> 00:49:44.720
<v Speaker 3>He's going to get it.</v>

1425
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:45.561
<v Speaker 3>And now he's saying,</v>

1426
00:49:45.561 --> 00:49:45.831
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1427
00:49:45.831 --> 00:49:47.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm a untreated drug problem.</v>

1428
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:52.990
<v Speaker 3>So he's trying to carve out some path to explain his bizarre behavior.</v>

1429
00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:54.150
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1430
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:55.170
<v Speaker 2>there are very,</v>

1431
00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:00.390
<v Speaker 2>there are very specific lie behaviors that people</v>

1432
00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:03.540
<v Speaker 2>can't really control.</v>

1433
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of stuff?</v>

1434
00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:05.903
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1435
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.440
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1436
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:09.120
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1437
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:14.120
<v Speaker 2>when people are really desperately trying to convince you they're telling the</v>

1438
00:50:14.491 --> 00:50:15.324
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

1439
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.830
<v Speaker 2>they'll do a lot of times what are called convincing statements.</v>

1440
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.553
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1441
00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.990
<v Speaker 2>rather than just telling you what they did or didn't do,</v>

1442
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.280
<v Speaker 2>they'll do convincing statements.</v>

1443
00:50:26.281 --> 00:50:27.114
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1444
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 2>you know me,</v>

1445
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:29.440
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1446
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.271
<v Speaker 2>like somebody saying,</v>

1447
00:50:30.271 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 2>who's who?</v>

1448
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Somebody stole the petty cash in the office.</v>

1449
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:34.251
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1450
00:50:34.251 --> 00:50:34.700
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1451
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I give more money.</v>

1452
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I donate more money than was stolen yearly.</v>

1453
00:50:38.571 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 2>You guys know me.</v>

1454
00:50:39.711 --> 00:50:40.544
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1455
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I was employee of the week,</v>

1456
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1457
00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.260
<v Speaker 2>there this convincing you that is a nice guy.</v>

1458
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:49.960
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll say,</v>

1459
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:50.661
<v Speaker 2>when someone does,</v>

1460
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 2>if they're wrongly accused and know when someone gives with the wrongly accused</v>

1461
00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.670
<v Speaker 2>you of the wrongly accused,</v>

1462
00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:00.470
<v Speaker 2>they'll look you straight up in the eye and tell you I didn't do it.</v>

1463
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.580
<v Speaker 2>And if you ask them,</v>

1464
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:04.520
<v Speaker 2>what do you think should happen to somebody that did,</v>

1465
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.190
<v Speaker 2>an innocent person will say,</v>

1466
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I think they should be found.</v>

1467
00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:12.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it should be held fully accountable to the extent of the law.</v>

1468
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Somebody that's guilty will say,</v>

1469
00:51:14.031 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1470
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1471
00:51:15.021 --> 00:51:15.801
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1472
00:51:15.801 --> 00:51:16.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1473
00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:17.320
<v Speaker 2>people make mistakes.</v>

1474
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1475
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.553
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1476
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:20.240
<v Speaker 2>you got to give a guy a second chance.</v>

1477
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you worry that in coaching that you're essentially coaching liars by telling</v>

1478
00:51:26.271 --> 00:51:28.640
<v Speaker 2>people this kind of stuff and someone who does steal the money,</v>

1479
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1480
00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.220
<v Speaker 2>would be able to kind of like,</v>

1481
00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:31.671
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1482
00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:32.504
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1483
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.130
<v Speaker 2>it's not for amateurs.</v>

1484
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:34.560
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1485
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1486
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.863
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1487
00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:37.453
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1488
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:42.520
<v Speaker 2>there were some things that you can tell people to watch for,</v>

1489
00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:47.590
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things you do if there's somebody that you suspect is you</v>

1490
00:51:48.081 --> 00:51:52.640
<v Speaker 2>increase their cognitive load during the interrogation and there's no way you</v>

1491
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:53.720
<v Speaker 2>can prepare for that.</v>

1492
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1493
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:54.863
<v Speaker 2>how'd you do that?</v>

1494
00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.233
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1495
00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:57.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1496
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.200
<v Speaker 2>you plan a mind virus,</v>

1497
00:52:00.201 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1498
00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:02.120
<v Speaker 2>a mind virus.</v>

1499
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1500
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:05.570
<v Speaker 2>This is a Perry Mason type shit.</v>

1501
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1502
00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.113
<v Speaker 2>Like when he did,</v>

1503
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.113
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1504
00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:11.720
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1505
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.160
<v Speaker 2>let's pretend some money's missing,</v>

1506
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:14.600
<v Speaker 2>if I said to you,</v>

1507
00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:15.993
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1508
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:21.370
<v Speaker 2>is there any reason somebody would have told me that they saw you near a cashbox</v>

1509
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.200
<v Speaker 2>about the time it went missing?</v>

1510
00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Dumped,</v>

1511
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:26.103
<v Speaker 2>dumped down.</v>

1512
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:27.711
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1513
00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Now people talk at 125 words a minute.</v>

1514
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.400
<v Speaker 2>They think at 12 to 1400 words a minute.</v>

1515
00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:36.141
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1516
00:52:36.141 --> 00:52:37.160
<v Speaker 2>if it takes you five,</v>

1517
00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:39.380
<v Speaker 2>five seconds to tell me no,</v>

1518
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.140
<v Speaker 2>you took the money.</v>

1519
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Because if you weren't from his right now,</v>

1520
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 2>if you didn't take it,</v>

1521
00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.720
<v Speaker 2>you know you didn't take it.</v>

1522
00:52:50.721 --> 00:52:54.140
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to run scenarios through your head to think who could have seen</v>

1523
00:52:54.141 --> 00:52:55.440
<v Speaker 2>me been.</v>

1524
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was it.</v>

1525
00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.570
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see anybody.</v>

1526
00:52:59.571 --> 00:53:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could have seen me what did it.</v>

1527
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:03.140
<v Speaker 2>But if you didn't do it,</v>

1528
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:08.120
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take you one millisecond to say absolutely not.</v>

1529
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been wrong before?</v>

1530
00:53:09.861 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 2>And when you see someone on television and go,</v>

1531
00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I think that guy's guilty and they're innocent or vice verse.</v>

1532
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

1533
00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Because if,</v>

1534
00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:22.020
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to know for sure if somebody is guilty or innocent,</v>

1535
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.590
<v Speaker 2>you need to invest a lot of time.</v>

1536
00:53:24.591 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 2>You need to get a baseline of what they normally look like,</v>

1537
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:29.161
<v Speaker 2>talk like,</v>

1538
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:29.994
<v Speaker 2>feel like,</v>

1539
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:31.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1540
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:31.800
<v Speaker 2>and NBA.</v>

1541
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.690
<v Speaker 2>And then knowing that baseline,</v>

1542
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:36.720
<v Speaker 2>you then need to compare how they're behaving on TV.</v>

1543
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.080
<v Speaker 2>So just walking by the screen and seeing it,</v>

1544
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:41.003
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1545
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 2>you might see things that would ordinarily be lie behaviors that could just be</v>

1546
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:46.770
<v Speaker 2>part of their personality.</v>

1547
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:49.770
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to really make a judgment,</v>

1548
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:50.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1549
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.931
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1550
00:53:50.931 --> 00:53:53.970
<v Speaker 2>you got to put a lot of time in and figure it out.</v>

1551
00:53:53.971 --> 00:53:58.971
<v Speaker 2>And what you should do before you decide you're going to be a human lie detector</v>

1552
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:03.510
<v Speaker 2>is do your homework and y'all tried to figure it out objectively before you</v>

1553
00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 2>figure it out behaviorally.</v>

1554
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:05.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1555
00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 2>you ought of do your investigation,</v>

1556
00:54:07.201 --> 00:54:11.060
<v Speaker 2>find out if somebody took the money and you know,</v>

1557
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.710
<v Speaker 2>find out where they were and you know,</v>

1558
00:54:13.711 --> 00:54:16.200
<v Speaker 2>look for fingerprints and do this and do that.</v>

1559
00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:16.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1560
00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:21.381
<v Speaker 2>you ought to really objectively figure it out before you rely on these things.</v>

1561
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.320
<v Speaker 2>And so unless you get a baseline and get one on one with them and spend a lot of</v>

1562
00:54:29.311 --> 00:54:30.144
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1563
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.220
<v Speaker 2>then you can't be,</v>

1564
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:36.060
<v Speaker 2>you can't be really certain that you know,</v>

1565
00:54:36.061 --> 00:54:38.150
<v Speaker 2>whether they're telling the truth or whether or not it's,</v>

1566
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:43.210
<v Speaker 2>it would be fun if it was that easy and that some people are pretty obvious.</v>

1567
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1568
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:48.730
<v Speaker 2>I heard a cop once say that when people are guilty they tend to plead and cry</v>

1569
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:54.120
<v Speaker 2>and then when they're not guilty they tend to get angry when they're accused.</v>

1570
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.150
<v Speaker 2>People that are wrongly accused are generally,</v>

1571
00:54:57.151 --> 00:54:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I write from the beginning till the end.</v>

1572
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

1573
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:02.640
<v Speaker 2>every case is different,</v>

1574
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:08.250
<v Speaker 2>but if you're wrongly accused that person is going to be pissed off from the</v>

1575
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:11.400
<v Speaker 2>minute you accused him till the end because it's like,</v>

1576
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:12.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1577
00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:13.270
<v Speaker 2>their self.</v>

1578
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.921
<v Speaker 2>Raj is like,</v>

1579
00:55:13.921 --> 00:55:14.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1580
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:17.860
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do this and you're saying I did and screw you.</v>

1581
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.060
<v Speaker 2>And they don't take a step back.</v>

1582
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:23.190
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>

1583
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:25.410
<v Speaker 2>you see people,</v>

1584
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.730
<v Speaker 2>they knew these convincing statements and they're pleading for you to believe</v>

1585
00:55:29.731 --> 00:55:29.971
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1586
00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:34.971
<v Speaker 2>And then an anytime somebody says now in all honesty,</v>

1587
00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.600
<v Speaker 2>usually the next thing out of their mass ally,</v>

1588
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.960
<v Speaker 2>like I said to you now,</v>

1589
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.580
<v Speaker 2>now Joe,</v>

1590
00:55:46.581 --> 00:55:47.414
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

1591
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:49.490
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to everything else you've been telling me,</v>

1592
00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:53.020
<v Speaker 2>why are we we bracketing this one out is honest.</v>

1593
00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Or if they invoke the Deity,</v>

1594
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.003
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1595
00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>

1596
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.690
<v Speaker 2>God as my witness.</v>

1597
00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.150
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1598
00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:10.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether I have not done what I said you need to do with Jesse</v>

1599
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:12.103
<v Speaker 2>Smollett.</v>

1600
00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.380
<v Speaker 2>But I do know when he went to the set at Fox,</v>

1601
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:17.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1602
00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.080
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1603
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:20.600
<v Speaker 2>you all know me.</v>

1604
00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:23.283
<v Speaker 2>I swear,</v>

1605
00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:24.183
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1606
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do this.</v>

1607
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:28.570
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

1608
00:56:28.571 --> 00:56:31.720
<v Speaker 3>there were like three or four of those kinds of statements in like two or three</v>

1609
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 3>sentences there.</v>

1610
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.901
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1611
00:56:32.901 --> 00:56:33.800
<v Speaker 3>my favorite ones,</v>

1612
00:56:33.801 --> 00:56:34.521
<v Speaker 3>he's on stage.</v>

1613
00:56:34.521 --> 00:56:36.020
<v Speaker 3>He called himself the gay Tupac.</v>

1614
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:37.580
<v Speaker 3>That's enough for me.</v>

1615
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:39.530
<v Speaker 3>That's a little narcissistic.</v>

1616
00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.660
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange thing though.</v>

1617
00:56:44.661 --> 00:56:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Like there was another one today,</v>

1618
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:50.990
<v Speaker 3>a guy a lit his house on fire and think a in Chicago and uh,</v>

1619
00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:51.930
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1620
00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:52.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1621
00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:53.360
<v Speaker 3>he's a gay fella,</v>

1622
00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:56.330
<v Speaker 3>said it was a hate crime and they caught him.</v>

1623
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:58.550
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of that going on,</v>

1624
00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.533
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1625
00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:00.920
<v Speaker 3>a lot of fake crime.</v>

1626
00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Very strange.</v>

1627
00:57:02.481 --> 00:57:02.641
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1628
00:57:02.641 --> 00:57:03.270
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1629
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:07.580
<v Speaker 3>and then sometimes people accuse people of something and someone will say,</v>

1630
00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:08.330
<v Speaker 3>why would,</v>

1631
00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 3>why would someone make something out?</v>

1632
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Why would someone turned themselves into a victim?</v>

1633
00:57:11.521 --> 00:57:13.700
<v Speaker 3>What there think there's a lot of clout and being a victim,</v>

1634
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.230
<v Speaker 3>especially today,</v>

1635
00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.220
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of,</v>

1636
00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:17.330
<v Speaker 3>you get a lot of attention,</v>

1637
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:18.200
<v Speaker 3>a lot of love.</v>

1638
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:23.290
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of false accusations and false attacks and it's a lot of</v>

1639
00:57:23.691 --> 00:57:24.524
<v Speaker 3>real ones.</v>

1640
00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:25.191
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

1641
00:57:25.191 --> 00:57:26.380
<v Speaker 3>when the false ones calm,</v>

1642
00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:28.760
<v Speaker 3>but it just does a giant disservice to everybody.</v>

1643
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:28.951
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1644
00:57:28.951 --> 00:57:33.951
<v Speaker 2>there's a fair amount of research as to why people do these hoaxes and</v>

1645
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:39.090
<v Speaker 2>particularly hate crime hoaxes and one of the primary motivation,</v>

1646
00:57:39.091 --> 00:57:39.421
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1647
00:57:39.421 --> 00:57:41.310
<v Speaker 2>it's sympathy and attention and all that,</v>

1648
00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:47.240
<v Speaker 2>but one of the interesting reasons that I've read in research is that they</v>

1649
00:57:48.001 --> 00:57:52.740
<v Speaker 2>really feel like it's emblematic of how the system treats them overall.</v>

1650
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:58.340
<v Speaker 2>This is just a dramatic example of it and they feel like I'm treated this way</v>

1651
00:57:58.531 --> 00:57:59.340
<v Speaker 2>anyhow.</v>

1652
00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1653
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.983
<v Speaker 2>so they'd just,</v>

1654
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:02.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm discriminated against,</v>

1655
00:58:02.851 --> 00:58:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I suffer by us,</v>

1656
00:58:04.141 --> 00:58:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm put down.</v>

1657
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.120
<v Speaker 2>This is just a focused example of that.</v>

1658
00:58:09.121 --> 00:58:11.130
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really not lying.</v>

1659
00:58:11.131 --> 00:58:14.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm just role playing how I'm overall treated.</v>

1660
00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1661
00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:20.160
<v Speaker 2>So they justified in their mind of their disc going to bring all this treatment</v>

1662
00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:23.220
<v Speaker 2>into one example to bring it into focus.</v>

1663
00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:26.970
<v Speaker 2>And so while it's a phony deal,</v>

1664
00:58:26.971 --> 00:58:31.780
<v Speaker 2>it really is truthful representation of what their life is really likely</v>

1665
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.120
<v Speaker 2>justified in that way.</v>

1666
00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:33.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1667
00:58:33.541 --> 00:58:34.374
<v Speaker 2>how weird.</v>

1668
00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:35.640
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1669
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:35.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1670
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:38.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a deep psychological shit.</v>

1671
00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1672
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:39.290
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1673
00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:39.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1674
00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:40.550
<v Speaker 2>that's stretching.</v>

1675
00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:42.480
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird one.</v>

1676
00:58:42.481 --> 00:58:43.314
<v Speaker 2>We liked</v>

1677
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:45.210
<v Speaker 3>you ride it out like that.</v>

1678
00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Put it in your mind that way.</v>

1679
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:47.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1680
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.353
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1681
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:49.680
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1682
00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.600
<v Speaker 3>it's strange too because it gives people this,</v>

1683
00:58:51.601 --> 00:58:52.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1684
00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:52.700
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1685
00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:52.921
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1686
00:58:52.921 --> 00:58:53.131
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1687
00:58:53.131 --> 00:58:55.770
<v Speaker 3>this giant public show to watch now.</v>

1688
00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1689
00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1690
00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I hate that family.</v>

1691
00:58:58.070 --> 00:58:59.960
<v Speaker 2>What a talented young man.</v>

1692
00:58:59.961 --> 00:59:00.470

1694
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:01.390
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1695
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:03.530
<v Speaker 2>I've the Times that I've seen,</v>

1696
00:59:03.531 --> 00:59:04.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to show a lot,</v>

1697
00:59:04.521 --> 00:59:09.521
<v Speaker 2>but the times I've seen him on there singing and assuming it is his voice and</v>

1698
00:59:09.951 --> 00:59:10.784
<v Speaker 2>he's singing,</v>

1706
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 2>were in drama and all that stuff.</v>

00:59:32.821 --> 00:59:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Obviously not all deceptive,</v>

1714
00:59:34.171 --> 00:59:35.010
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1715
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:38.400
<v Speaker 3>some of the most brilliant actors are just completely out of their mind.</v>

1716
00:59:38.401 --> 00:59:41.100
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons why they're so good at acting because they can</v>

1717
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:42.251
<v Speaker 3>look a,</v>

1718
00:59:42.251 --> 00:59:45.890
<v Speaker 3>my frame wet and my friend Wayne Fetterman had a a bit they did about it on</v>

1719
00:59:45.891 --> 00:59:47.130
<v Speaker 3>stage and he's like,</v>

1720
00:59:47.131 --> 00:59:47.730
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

1721
00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:50.820
<v Speaker 3>It's not fucking normal to be able to just cry.</v>

1722
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.811
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1723
00:59:51.811 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 3>you could just cry and pretend something's wrong and cries.</v>

1724
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:55.050
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1725
00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:56.010
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

1726
00:59:56.011 --> 00:59:57.270
<v Speaker 3>These are crazy people.</v>

1727
00:59:57.550 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1728
00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:01.460
<v Speaker 2>And you really can't go to a certain place.</v>

1729
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.840
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>

1730
01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.800
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a little of that in you.</v>

1731
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:08.130
<v Speaker 2>My Dad used to always say when he's working with patients,</v>

1732
01:00:08.131 --> 01:00:10.120
<v Speaker 2>you'd would say something about that.</v>

1733
01:00:10.121 --> 01:00:10.481
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy,</v>

1734
01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:11.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't stand about me.</v>

1735
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Cause you say you can't see it in them if you don't have a little evidence in</v>

1736
01:00:16.331 --> 01:00:17.164
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1737
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:18.690
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some truth,</v>

1738
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:20.320
<v Speaker 3>there's 100% truth and that,</v>

1739
01:00:20.321 --> 01:00:22.960
<v Speaker 3>that is a thing that tries me the craziest about weak people.</v>

1740
01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm so terrified of seeing weakness and,</v>

1741
01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:25.781
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1742
01:00:25.781 --> 01:00:26.614
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>

1743
01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:28.083
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1744
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.810
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1745
01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:30.100
<v Speaker 3>just being pathetic.</v>

1746
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm so terrified to seeing that in myself.</v>

1747
01:00:31.991 --> 01:00:33.280
<v Speaker 3>I see it in other people and it just,</v>

1748
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.301
<v Speaker 3>it smells,</v>

1749
01:00:34.301 --> 01:00:36.280
<v Speaker 3>I smelled like a drug sniffing dog.</v>

1750
01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:36.941
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1751
01:00:36.941 --> 01:00:37.774
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

1752
01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1753
01:00:38.111 --> 01:00:39.520
<v Speaker 3>You smell desperation.</v>

1754
01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1755
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:41.980
<v Speaker 3>What makes you do this?</v>

1756
01:00:41.981 --> 01:00:43.150
<v Speaker 3>Why are you doing a podcast?</v>

1757
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:45.280
<v Speaker 3>I have always been a blabber mouth.</v>

1758
01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.750
<v Speaker 3>I can never shut the fuck up.</v>

1759
01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.740
<v Speaker 3>I love talk and,</v>

1760
01:00:47.741 --> 01:00:48.340
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1761
01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:52.810
<v Speaker 3>I've always been fascinated by human beings and their lives and just talking to</v>

1762
01:00:52.811 --> 01:00:57.400
<v Speaker 3>people and finding out like the guy before was this guy yo on Grillo,</v>

1763
01:00:57.401 --> 01:00:57.890
<v Speaker 3>who's a,</v>

1764
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:59.500
<v Speaker 3>a a narcotics,</v>

1765
01:00:59.501 --> 01:01:00.370
<v Speaker 3>a journalist.</v>

1766
01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:03.100
<v Speaker 3>He's a narco journalists in Mexico.</v>

1767
01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.151
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1768
01:01:04.151 --> 01:01:05.410
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't wait to talk to that guy.</v>

1769
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:06.181
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1770
01:01:06.181 --> 01:01:07.690
<v Speaker 3>just what a life.</v>

1771
01:01:07.691 --> 01:01:09.550
<v Speaker 3>And He's been living in Mexico for 18 years.</v>

1772
01:01:09.551 --> 01:01:10.384
<v Speaker 3>He's from England.</v>

1773
01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.040
<v Speaker 3>I still alive.</v>

1774
01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.930
<v Speaker 3>So that's something right there.</v>

1775
01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:14.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:01:14.321 --> 01:01:14.711
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

1777
01:01:14.711 --> 01:01:14.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1778
01:01:14.891 --> 01:01:17.500
<v Speaker 3>he's telling me about friends that have been killed and you know,</v>

1779
01:01:17.501 --> 01:01:19.990
<v Speaker 3>he's been in some sticky situations a few times and,</v>

1780
01:01:19.991 --> 01:01:20.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1781
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1782
01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm just fascinated by pit by people and what they liked to do.</v>

1783
01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:26.651
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1784
01:01:26.651 --> 01:01:29.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by athletes and fascinated by physicists.</v>

1785
01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:30.821
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1786
01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:31.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1787
01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:32.410
<v Speaker 3>I've just always been very,</v>

1788
01:01:32.411 --> 01:01:34.180
<v Speaker 3>very curious and um,</v>

1789
01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:37.250
<v Speaker 3>I've always recognized that everyone thinks about things differently.</v>

1790
01:01:37.251 --> 01:01:39.340
<v Speaker 3>And then I could take a little bit of something from everybody,</v>

1791
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:43.060
<v Speaker 3>whether it's from a book or it's from having a conversation with someone,</v>

1792
01:01:43.061 --> 01:01:44.360
<v Speaker 3>I can gain a little bit of,</v>

1793
01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:46.270
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of experience,</v>

1794
01:01:46.271 --> 01:01:47.200
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of knowledge,</v>

1795
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.670
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of insight.</v>

1796
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:49.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1797
01:01:49.691 --> 01:01:54.691
<v Speaker 2>You're naturally very curious because I listened to you interviews and you're</v>

1798
01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:56.170
<v Speaker 2>naturally very curious.</v>

1799
01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:59.980
<v Speaker 2>You don't struggle for the next question because you really want to know</v>

1800
01:01:59.981 --> 01:02:01.780
<v Speaker 2>something that makes it much easier.</v>

1801
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.570
<v Speaker 3>Does very lucky that I found this very,</v>

1802
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.350
<v Speaker 3>just stumbled into doing this kind of Shannon,</v>

1803
01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:08.360
<v Speaker 3>why wasn't this way in the beginning and the big beginning,</v>

1804
01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:10.520
<v Speaker 3>it was just horse shitting with friends and,</v>

1805
01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.530
<v Speaker 3>and slowly but surely as the pot,</v>

1806
01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.150
<v Speaker 3>the podcast became popular.</v>

1807
01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:14.451
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1808
01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:17.660
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that guy would talk to me and then I would get people on and then it</v>

1809
01:02:17.661 --> 01:02:22.661
<v Speaker 3>became more these long form interesting conversations.</v>

1810
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:24.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1811
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1812
01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:27.900
<v Speaker 2>If you're curious about human functioning at all,</v>

1813
01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:29.100
<v Speaker 2>human nature at all,</v>

1814
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:32.080
<v Speaker 2>there's an endless menu of things you can talk about.</v>

1815
01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:33.270
<v Speaker 2>And I don't care who it is.</v>

1816
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:33.780
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

1817
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.410
<v Speaker 2>you could pull somebody out of a car on the street and if you're curious,</v>

1818
01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:40.260
<v Speaker 2>you can talk to him because everybody has a different take in life.</v>

1819
01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:41.610
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has a different walk.</v>

1820
01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1821
01:02:42.111 --> 01:02:42.741
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1822
01:02:42.741 --> 01:02:43.790
<v Speaker 3>And what you're talking about,</v>

1823
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:45.740
<v Speaker 3>you're interviewing all these athletes,</v>

1824
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:46.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1825
01:02:46.511 --> 01:02:46.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1826
01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.560
<v Speaker 3>I think people tend to write off athletic pursuits as being entirely physical</v>

1827
01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:52.880
<v Speaker 3>and they are not,</v>

1828
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think this is an easy way for people to look at it that don't engage or</v>

1829
01:02:57.831 --> 01:03:02.831
<v Speaker 3>they've never really thought about playing anything at a very high level that it</v>

1830
01:03:03.021 --> 01:03:05.300
<v Speaker 3>requires some intense thinking.</v>

1831
01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:09.620
<v Speaker 3>It might not require mathematics or a large vocabulary,</v>

1832
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.380
<v Speaker 3>but understanding what's required,</v>

1833
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:14.540
<v Speaker 3>understanding when and how to execute,</v>

1834
01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:17.060
<v Speaker 3>understanding how to keep your shit together under pressure.</v>

1835
01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Those are all intensely intellectual aspects of any really high end athletic</v>

1836
01:03:23.031 --> 01:03:23.864
<v Speaker 3>pursuit.</v>

1837
01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.360
<v Speaker 3>And there's a different breed of cat that</v>

1838
01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 2>he wants the ball with the buzzer and it,</v>

1839
01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:30.720
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a show boat.</v>

1840
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:32.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a different breed of cat</v>

1841
01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.000
<v Speaker 3>once that ball at that point,</v>

1842
01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:38.230
<v Speaker 3>and it's not always who you think,</v>

1843
01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:42.970
<v Speaker 3>but it takes a special kind of person that wants that pressure,</v>

1844
01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:45.880
<v Speaker 3>that knows they can handle it better than anybody else.</v>

1845
01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1846
01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:46.691
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1847
01:03:46.691 --> 01:03:49.960
<v Speaker 3>and it's a lot of times it's people that are entirely confident that they've</v>

1848
01:03:49.961 --> 01:03:50.794
<v Speaker 3>done the work.</v>

1849
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.240
<v Speaker 3>You know there's a haunting thing that happens with athletes where you're not</v>

1850
01:03:55.241 --> 01:03:56.440
<v Speaker 3>sure if you did enough.</v>

1851
01:03:56.441 --> 01:04:01.441
<v Speaker 3>And in fighters it's a very dangerous inclination because it leads you to</v>

1852
01:04:01.511 --> 01:04:06.430
<v Speaker 3>overtrain and you have to be very careful about that because with a fighter you</v>

1853
01:04:06.431 --> 01:04:08.920
<v Speaker 3>only can learn so much during your training camp.</v>

1854
01:04:08.921 --> 01:04:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Like say once you get into training camp,</v>

1855
01:04:10.751 --> 01:04:12.700
<v Speaker 3>you got eight weeks depending on who you are.</v>

1856
01:04:12.701 --> 01:04:14.080
<v Speaker 3>Some guys like to do a little longer,</v>

1857
01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:17.530
<v Speaker 3>but the average is maybe eight 12 weeks is a long camp.</v>

1858
01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:21.490
<v Speaker 3>You already have to know how to fight by the time you get to camp.</v>

1859
01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.560
<v Speaker 3>So what you're really doing is just kind of working on specific movements where</v>

1860
01:04:26.561 --> 01:04:30.670
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with one kind of fighter and then getting your body in shape,</v>

1861
01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:33.250
<v Speaker 3>getting your body condition to getting your mind ready,</v>

1862
01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:34.390
<v Speaker 3>preparing everything,</v>

1863
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.950
<v Speaker 3>cutting your body weight down,</v>

1864
01:04:35.951 --> 01:04:40.090
<v Speaker 3>getting so you can weigh in and have a a good amount of,</v>

1865
01:04:40.091 --> 01:04:40.924
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1866
01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:41.290
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1867
01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:41.870
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1868
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:43.390
<v Speaker 3>you gotta have enough vitality,</v>

1869
01:04:43.391 --> 01:04:44.500
<v Speaker 3>can't drain yourself.</v>

1870
01:04:44.501 --> 01:04:49.501
<v Speaker 3>So this is this complicated dance that goes on and that haunting thing of did I</v>

1871
01:04:49.811 --> 01:04:50.600
<v Speaker 3>do enough?</v>

1872
01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:54.300
<v Speaker 3>It can cause fighters to screw themselves over by overtraining.</v>

1873
01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1874
01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:59.760
<v Speaker 3>So you have to have enough confidence to know that you've done enough as well as</v>

1875
01:05:00.491 --> 01:05:01.324
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

1876
01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:03.220
<v Speaker 3>You have to know you've done enough.</v>

1877
01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:03.641
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

1878
01:05:03.641 --> 01:05:04.990
<v Speaker 3>you haven't done too much.</v>

1879
01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.030
<v Speaker 3>This is really strange dance,</v>

1880
01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:07.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1881
01:05:07.631 --> 01:05:07.931
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>

1882
01:05:07.931 --> 01:05:08.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1883
01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:08.770
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1884
01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:13.270
<v Speaker 3>this weekend is a giant UFC big UFC two big title fights between,</v>

1885
01:05:13.271 --> 01:05:14.890
<v Speaker 3>for the very best fighters in the world.</v>

1886
01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:16.060
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1887
01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:20.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is one of the interesting aspects of the fight game to me is one,</v>

1888
01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:24.760
<v Speaker 3>watching these guys stare each other down at the way in where they get a look at</v>

1889
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:25.031
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1890
01:05:25.031 --> 01:05:28.960
<v Speaker 3>And they know 24 hours from now they're going to war and just see like is there</v>

1891
01:05:28.961 --> 01:05:31.300
<v Speaker 3>a just us mellowed out?</v>

1892
01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything,</v>

1893
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.120
<v Speaker 3>is there anything in there?</v>

1894
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:34.991
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1895
01:05:34.991 --> 01:05:39.580
<v Speaker 3>and just knowing that this is probably one of the most difficult things in all</v>

1896
01:05:39.581 --> 01:05:41.920
<v Speaker 3>of athletics and that these guys are going to,</v>

1897
01:05:41.921 --> 01:05:42.754
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1898
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1899
01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:47.620
<v Speaker 3>they're going to apply their trade and one of the most complicated things,</v>

1900
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:49.480
<v Speaker 3>it's a battle of physical,</v>

1901
01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:50.560
<v Speaker 3>mental,</v>

1902
01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:51.011
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1903
01:05:51.011 --> 01:05:52.270
<v Speaker 3>of mindset,</v>

1904
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.230
<v Speaker 3>of we'll,</v>

1905
01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.480
<v Speaker 3>of conditioning and discipline.</v>

1906
01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.040
<v Speaker 3>And then it's also,</v>

1907
01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.170
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of random shit that happens.</v>

1908
01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Do you think if I can change at William when people are looking at it?</v>

1909
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.073
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1910
01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:05.993
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1911
01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.240
<v Speaker 3>It can change.</v>

1912
01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:08.320
<v Speaker 3>It can shift right then.</v>

1913
01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:09.820
<v Speaker 3>It can't change forever by like,</v>

1914
01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.310
<v Speaker 3>you could look at John Jones sideways,</v>

1915
01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:13.330
<v Speaker 3>upside down.</v>

1916
01:06:13.331 --> 01:06:14.440
<v Speaker 3>You could stick your toe in.</v>

1917
01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Ain't gonna Affect Shit.</v>

1918
01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:19.890
<v Speaker 3>There's some guys that are just locked down and bulletproof Jon Jones to pull it</v>

1919
01:06:19.891 --> 01:06:20.200
<v Speaker 3>proof.</v>

1920
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.790
<v Speaker 3>There's certain guys that had just bulletproof.</v>

1921
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:23.290
<v Speaker 3>They just look at you and like,</v>

1922
01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:24.124
<v Speaker 3>they know what to do.</v>

1923
01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:25.690
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why he's undefeated,</v>

1924
01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:26.020
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1925
01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:26.680
<v Speaker 3>He's just,</v>

1926
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 3>he knows how to do it,</v>

1927
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.310
<v Speaker 3>but then there's other guys that like that may be like fucking,</v>

1928
01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.760
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's 80 20 maybe,</v>

1929
01:06:33.761 --> 01:06:34.540
<v Speaker 3>and then the,</v>

1930
01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.180
<v Speaker 3>the stare down your look at the guy and you're looking at him like,</v>

1931
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:39.020
<v Speaker 3>God damn and I'm fighting Yoel Romero.</v>

1932
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.360
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck did this happen?</v>

1933
01:06:40.361 --> 01:06:45.361
<v Speaker 3>And then you see him drop down to 75 maybe 73% confidence,</v>

1934
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 3>72 70 shit.</v>

1935
01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:49.600
<v Speaker 3>They look at his traps.</v>

1936
01:06:49.601 --> 01:06:51.940
<v Speaker 3>He's got a neck that starts at the top of his head and you're like,</v>

1937
01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:52.870
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

1938
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:53.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1939
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.610
<v Speaker 3>there's certain guys,</v>

1940
01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:55.300
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

1941
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:57.340
<v Speaker 3>they're intimidating at weigh ins too.</v>

1942
01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1943
01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:58.331
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1944
01:06:58.331 --> 01:06:59.380
<v Speaker 3>It can change a little bit,</v>

1945
01:06:59.381 --> 01:07:00.430
<v Speaker 3>but not for everybody.</v>

1946
01:07:00.431 --> 01:07:01.750
<v Speaker 3>There's certain guys that just,</v>

1947
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:03.131
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

1948
01:07:03.131 --> 01:07:04.090
<v Speaker 3>You can't get in there.</v>

1949
01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 3>There's certain champions like real champions,</v>

1950
01:07:06.521 --> 01:07:07.211
<v Speaker 3>like mighty mouse,</v>

1951
01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:07.721
<v Speaker 3>Johnson.</v>

1952
01:07:07.721 --> 01:07:11.260
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of guys like that that are just champions.</v>

1953
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:11.950
<v Speaker 3>You look at them,</v>

1954
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:12.880
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

1955
01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:13.410
<v Speaker 3>They've,</v>

1956
01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:14.410
<v Speaker 3>they know what they're doing.</v>

1957
01:07:14.411 --> 01:07:16.240
<v Speaker 3>They've done the work that the best in the business.</v>

1958
01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Like you can mean mug them and get aggressive.</v>

1959
01:07:18.911 --> 01:07:19.960
<v Speaker 3>They might smile at you.</v>

1960
01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:20.560
<v Speaker 3>They might,</v>

1961
01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.220
<v Speaker 3>this is cute.</v>

1962
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.090
<v Speaker 3>Tried to make me nervous.</v>

1963
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.983
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

1964
01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:24.003
<v Speaker 3>See You tomorrow.</v>

1965
01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.840
<v Speaker 3>So is that because they know who they are and it doesn't matter who this is or</v>

1967
01:07:33.431 --> 01:07:35.290
<v Speaker 3>is it that they just don't,</v>

1968
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:37.060
<v Speaker 3>they don't believe in this guy.</v>

1969
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.931
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1970
01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:39.160
<v Speaker 3>they know who they are,</v>

1971
01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.053
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1972
01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:44.080
<v Speaker 3>And they have reached a level of confidence when you get to a certain level of</v>

1973
01:07:44.081 --> 01:07:44.650
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

1974
01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

1975
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.060
<v Speaker 3>John Jones has one loss on his record and it's by disqualification to fight that</v>

1976
01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:51.580
<v Speaker 3>he was destroying the guy and he was hitting the guy with,</v>

1977
01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:52.660
<v Speaker 3>it's a really dumb rule,</v>

1978
01:07:52.661 --> 01:07:54.250
<v Speaker 3>but when you throw elbows,</v>

1979
01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:56.860
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to throw a 12 to six elbow,</v>

1980
01:07:56.861 --> 01:07:58.070
<v Speaker 3>meaning coming straight down.</v>

1981
01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:02.530
<v Speaker 3>The only reason that exists is because when mixed martial arts was first being,</v>

1982
01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.633
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1983
01:08:03.790 --> 01:08:06.070
<v Speaker 3>was first being sanctioned by athletic commissions,</v>

1984
01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:06.360
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1985
01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:11.360
<v Speaker 3>the people that were in the athletic commission had some nervous fears of a,</v>

1986
01:08:11.471 --> 01:08:13.540
<v Speaker 3>they had seen like those late night TV shows,</v>

1987
01:08:13.541 --> 01:08:15.100
<v Speaker 3>her karate guys are breaking bricks,</v>

1988
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.450
<v Speaker 3>the elbow driving straight down.</v>

1989
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 3>They thought they could kill somebody if they did that.</v>

1990
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:20.084
<v Speaker 3>So let's not have,</v>

1991
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.691
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

1992
01:08:20.691 --> 01:08:21.950
<v Speaker 3>we'll eliminate that strike.</v>

1993
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:22.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a dumb move.</v>

1994
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:27.410
<v Speaker 3>And Jon Jones hit this guy with a couple 12 to six elbows and he was</v>

1995
01:08:27.411 --> 01:08:28.490
<v Speaker 3>disqualified in a fight.</v>

1996
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:30.530
<v Speaker 3>He was just just destroying the guy.</v>

1997
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:35.720
<v Speaker 3>So for a guy like that who has this staggering resume of achievement,</v>

1998
01:08:35.721 --> 01:08:39.020
<v Speaker 3>he's widely considered to be the greatest light heavyweight champion of all</v>

1999
01:08:39.021 --> 01:08:39.261
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2000
01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:40.040
<v Speaker 3>If not,</v>

2001
01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.070
<v Speaker 3>he's definitely in the running of the greatest fighter ever of all time.</v>

2002
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.540
<v Speaker 3>For a guy like that,</v>

2003
01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:45.200
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>

2004
01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:45.830
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2005
01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.320
<v Speaker 3>he's confident to the point of,</v>

2006
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:48.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2007
01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:49.723
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2008
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.540
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2009
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.970
<v Speaker 3>he's not trying to just beat this guy,</v>

2010
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 3>although he's going to beat this guy.</v>

2011
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.590
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to go down in history as one of the greatest of all time or the</v>

2012
01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:58.550
<v Speaker 3>greatest of all time.</v>

2013
01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:00.050
<v Speaker 3>So for a guy like that,</v>

2014
01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:01.880
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter what you do,</v>

2015
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:02.480
<v Speaker 3>he's out.</v>

2016
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.220
<v Speaker 3>He's a Michael Jordan type character.</v>

2017
01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:04.461
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2018
01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:05.810
<v Speaker 3>there's a few of those guys out there.</v>

2019
01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:08.120
<v Speaker 3>There's these Lebron James is these,</v>

2020
01:09:08.121 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2021
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Larry Bird's,</v>

2022
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:10.021
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

2023
01:09:10.021 --> 01:09:11.300
<v Speaker 3>They exist in all sports.</v>

2024
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:13.130
<v Speaker 3>They have this mindset,</v>

2025
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 3>a champion mindset.</v>

2026
01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Does he find angry or does he fight business?</v>

2027
01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 3>Like business?</v>

2028
01:09:18.771 --> 01:09:20.390
<v Speaker 3>Like he's very business like,</v>

2029
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:21.080
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2030
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.950
<v Speaker 3>he's very business.</v>

2031
01:09:21.951 --> 01:09:23.180
<v Speaker 3>Like he just knows what he's doing.</v>

2032
01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.740
<v Speaker 3>The best guys fight business.</v>

2033
01:09:24.741 --> 01:09:27.890
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some guys that fight with emotion and they're still really good but</v>

2034
01:09:27.891 --> 01:09:30.890
<v Speaker 3>like fade or Amelia Akos is famous Russian guy.</v>

2035
01:09:30.891 --> 01:09:31.220
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>

2036
01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:34.760
<v Speaker 3>he would have a look on his face that he was cashing a check and he was smashing</v>

2037
01:09:34.761 --> 01:09:36.260
<v Speaker 3>a guy's eye orbit in,</v>

2038
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:37.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2039
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.791
<v Speaker 3>he was just,</v>

2040
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:38.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2041
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2042
01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.060
<v Speaker 3>he was the highest level of that,</v>

2043
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.060
<v Speaker 3>like that robotic businesslike approach to fighting.</v>

2044
01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.730
<v Speaker 3>And then after he knocked you unconscious to help you get back up.</v>

2045
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:47.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2046
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.141
<v Speaker 3>it was over.</v>

2047
01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:48.891
<v Speaker 3>Once he shut her off,</v>

2048
01:09:48.891 --> 01:09:49.221
<v Speaker 3>it was over.</v>

2049
01:09:49.221 --> 01:09:49.730
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>

2050
01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:50.270
<v Speaker 3>no signs.</v>

2051
01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:51.530
<v Speaker 3>He thought emotions were weak.</v>

2052
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:53.390
<v Speaker 3>Like showing emotions in a fight,</v>

2053
01:09:53.391 --> 01:09:54.230
<v Speaker 3>showing anger,</v>

2054
01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.273
<v Speaker 3>all that was weak.</v>

2055
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:56.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2056
01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:00.610
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a huge psychological component to it.</v>

2057
01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:00.911
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2058
01:10:00.911 --> 01:10:01.160
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2059
01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I agree completely.</v>

2060
01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.093
<v Speaker 3>Giant,</v>

2061
01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:04.323
<v Speaker 3>gigantic.</v>

2062
01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:05.283
<v Speaker 3>I think you've,</v>

2063
01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:06.060
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2064
01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I think if you go in with doubt,</v>

2065
01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.273
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2066
01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I just think that's terrible.</v>

2067
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:12.883
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>

2068
01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.140
<v Speaker 3>I think he's here because now you're fighting yourself and them to,</v>

2069
01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:19.340
<v Speaker 3>you remember the Mike Tyson fights when he was in his prime?</v>

2070
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2071
01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:21.010
<v Speaker 3>I remember the look in those guys face.</v>

2072
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2073
01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.200
<v Speaker 3>And they're staring across the ring and I'm like,</v>

2074
01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:23.921
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus,</v>

2075
01:10:23.921 --> 01:10:24.900
<v Speaker 3>what did I sign up for?</v>

2076
01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:25.983
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to lose.</v>

2077
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:27.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the money was here,</v>

2078
01:10:27.851 --> 01:10:28.571
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't worth,</v>

2079
01:10:28.571 --> 01:10:33.571
<v Speaker 3>it just seemed like a good idea at the time as life changing life defining</v>

2080
01:10:33.791 --> 01:10:34.624
<v Speaker 3>moment when you,</v>

2081
01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:39.310
<v Speaker 3>when you were staring across the ring at Iron Mike and it was like 1989 he was</v>

2082
01:10:39.311 --> 01:10:40.330
<v Speaker 3>at top of the world.</v>

2083
01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2084
01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:41.680
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2085
01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.191
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

2086
01:10:42.191 --> 01:10:43.950
<v Speaker 3>and you knew he was going to come over there and,</v>

2087
01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:47.800
<v Speaker 3>and it's you mail ever been here before?</v>

2088
01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Guns blazing.</v>

2089
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:50.023
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2090
01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2091
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:51.580
<v Speaker 3>And he did.</v>

2092
01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile you meet him now he's like the nicest guy on the planet earth.</v>

2094
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't be sweeter guy.</v>

2095
01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2096
01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.060
<v Speaker 3>I taught committed.</v>

2097
01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.330
<v Speaker 3>He's got a daughter that's apparently a pretty good tennis player and he's</v>

2098
01:11:01.331 --> 01:11:03.430
<v Speaker 3>really behind her now and focused on that.</v>

2099
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:07.420
<v Speaker 3>That was him back then because when he came out of jail and he's fighting Peter</v>

2100
01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:07.950
<v Speaker 3>McNeely,</v>

2101
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:10.060
<v Speaker 3>he's just letting them know it's common baby.</v>

2102
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Terrifying man.</v>

2103
01:11:12.431 --> 01:11:12.761
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2104
01:11:12.761 --> 01:11:13.594
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

2105
01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:17.980
<v Speaker 3>he was never as formidable after jail as he was before he went in now.</v>

2106
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:18.931
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2107
01:11:18.931 --> 01:11:20.880
<v Speaker 3>there's a ton of factors.</v>

2108
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.260
<v Speaker 3>His training was never the same.</v>

2109
01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2110
01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:23.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2111
01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.750
<v Speaker 3>he didn't,</v>

2112
01:11:24.751 --> 01:11:27.240
<v Speaker 3>he lost that connection with custom motto.</v>

2113
01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:27.421
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2114
01:11:27.421 --> 01:11:30.120
<v Speaker 3>he had custom motto with training them when he was at his very best.</v>

2115
01:11:30.121 --> 01:11:34.500
<v Speaker 3>And then Kevin Rooney who worked with customer and Mike trained him after that,</v>

2116
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.020
<v Speaker 3>and then they eventually parted ways.</v>

2117
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:37.651
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2118
01:11:37.651 --> 01:11:37.771
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2119
01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:39.510
<v Speaker 3>that was before the buster Douglas fight.</v>

2120
01:11:39.511 --> 01:11:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I remember he had guys in his corner.</v>

2121
01:11:40.981 --> 01:11:42.330
<v Speaker 3>It didn't even have an end swell.</v>

2122
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:42.631
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2123
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:45.450
<v Speaker 3>his eye was swelling up and they didn't even have ice to put on it.</v>

2124
01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2125
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.411
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2126
01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:47.760
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of factors.</v>

2127
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:49.013
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2128
01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:49.883
<v Speaker 3>but also,</v>

2129
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2130
01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:51.480
<v Speaker 3>when I talked to Mike,</v>

2131
01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:51.991
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2132
01:11:51.991 --> 01:11:53.130
<v Speaker 3>on the podcast,</v>

2133
01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 3>one of the things was,</v>

2134
01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:59.810
<v Speaker 3>and this was just him sort of coming to grips with the fact that he never really</v>

2135
01:12:01.261 --> 01:12:02.040
<v Speaker 3>had a childhood.</v>

2136
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.440
<v Speaker 3>His childhood was that from the time he was 12 years old,</v>

2137
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:05.730
<v Speaker 3>customer Donald took him in,</v>

2138
01:12:05.731 --> 01:12:07.800
<v Speaker 3>was hypnotizing him and teaching him how to fight,</v>

2139
01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.010
<v Speaker 3>teaching amount of fighting in hypnotizing him to be a machine is going.</v>

2140
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:13.650
<v Speaker 3>He was literally saying to him,</v>

2141
01:12:13.651 --> 01:12:14.700
<v Speaker 3>you don't exist.</v>

2142
01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.110
<v Speaker 3>The task exists,</v>

2143
01:12:16.111 --> 01:12:20.280
<v Speaker 3>the job at hand exists and you're going to go out there and you're going to get</v>

2144
01:12:20.281 --> 01:12:21.114
<v Speaker 3>the job done.</v>

2145
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:24.360
<v Speaker 3>And he was telling this to a 13 year old that never experienced love.</v>

2146
01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:27.690
<v Speaker 3>He just was abandoned and homeless.</v>

2147
01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:28.060
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2148
01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:31.980
<v Speaker 3>and this is the only way he ever got any sort of positive reinforcement.</v>

2149
01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:33.750
<v Speaker 3>And his life is by destroying people.</v>

2150
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:35.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2151
01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:36.720
<v Speaker 3>that's sad.</v>

2152
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:37.980
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2153
01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.740
<v Speaker 3>now he seems to really be connected to his daughter.</v>

2154
01:12:40.741 --> 01:12:41.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2155
01:12:41.131 --> 01:12:41.341
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2156
01:12:41.341 --> 01:12:41.960
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>

2157
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.070
<v Speaker 3>you see in here a softness in his voice.</v>

2158
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:45.560
<v Speaker 3>He really is connected to that.</v>

2159
01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:46.853
<v Speaker 3>He learned.</v>

2160
01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:47.180
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2161
01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:47.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2162
01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:51.090
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to try to look at someone like who they were,</v>

2163
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2164
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago.</v>

2165
01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:53.341
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2166
01:12:53.341 --> 01:12:54.420
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to do that.</v>

2167
01:12:54.421 --> 01:12:55.050
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to just say,</v>

2168
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:55.261
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2169
01:12:55.261 --> 01:12:56.094
<v Speaker 3>he's that guy.</v>

2170
01:12:56.490 --> 01:12:59.880
<v Speaker 3>But people evolve and they grow and he's a great example of that.</v>

2171
01:12:59.881 --> 01:13:01.290
<v Speaker 3>He's a very different person.</v>

2172
01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:01.681
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2173
01:13:01.681 --> 01:13:04.830
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't even work out because he's worried about his ego.</v>

2174
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:05.841
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

2175
01:13:05.841 --> 01:13:08.310
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't hit the bag or do anything like that.</v>

2176
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:10.920
<v Speaker 3>I said occasionally we'd get on the treadmill and work out a little bit on a</v>

2177
01:13:10.921 --> 01:13:12.840
<v Speaker 3>treadmill just to get a little exercise in.</v>

2178
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:17.250
<v Speaker 3>But he's worried about feeding his ego was worried about like looking at himself</v>

2179
01:13:17.251 --> 01:13:19.830
<v Speaker 3>in the mirror and bringing that old monster back again.</v>

2180
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2181
01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2182
01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:21.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2183
01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:21.953
<v Speaker 3>That's what he said.</v>

2184
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:23.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2185
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be afraid of not being able to get back to the level he was.</v>

2186
01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:28.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's afraid of that.</v>

2187
01:13:28.921 --> 01:13:30.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he wants to be that guy.</v>

2188
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.140
<v Speaker 3>He says he doesn't like that guy blue,</v>

2189
01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:37.830
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy because that guys who made him rich and famous and everybody</v>

2190
01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:39.720
<v Speaker 3>loves him because he was that guy.</v>

2191
01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:43.590
<v Speaker 3>But who he is now is a completely different person.</v>

2192
01:13:43.591 --> 01:13:44.490
<v Speaker 3>Just a sweetheart.</v>

2193
01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:45.660
<v Speaker 3>A real sweetheart.</v>

2194
01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:46.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2195
01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.333
<v Speaker 3>He seems like it.</v>

2196
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:47.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2197
01:13:47.731 --> 01:13:51.270
<v Speaker 3>you'd never think to talk to him if you didn't know his history.</v>

2198
01:13:51.271 --> 01:13:52.740
<v Speaker 3>You'd never guess that was that guy.</v>

2199
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.520
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2200
01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.353
<v Speaker 3>You'd never would.</v>

2201
01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2202
01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:55.591
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2203
01:13:55.591 --> 01:13:56.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2204
01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:59.850
<v Speaker 3>the psychological aspect of fighting is one of the more intriguing parts of it</v>

2205
01:13:59.851 --> 01:14:00.450
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

2206
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:01.283
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2207
01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:06.630
<v Speaker 3>for me it's like probably one of the reasons why I got interested in psyche in</v>

2208
01:14:06.631 --> 01:14:10.080
<v Speaker 3>the first place and the way people think about things and,</v>

2209
01:14:10.081 --> 01:14:11.100
<v Speaker 3>and weakness,</v>

2210
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 3>like real weakness,</v>

2211
01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:13.563
<v Speaker 3>weakness,</v>

2212
01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:16.180
<v Speaker 3>weakness can get exposed in a variety of different ways.</v>

2213
01:14:16.181 --> 01:14:17.770
<v Speaker 3>But in competition,</v>

2214
01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:18.940
<v Speaker 3>just when you really see it.</v>

2215
01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:20.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2216
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:21.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the,</v>

2217
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:21.970
<v Speaker 3>I have this theory,</v>

2218
01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:23.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2219
01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:28.720
<v Speaker 2>and we see it in sports and I saw it when I talked to him and he's been a friend</v>

2220
01:14:29.201 --> 01:14:34.180
<v Speaker 2>of mine for a long time and I was talking to him about his psychology is he goes</v>

2221
01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:38.590
<v Speaker 2>into a football game and he says he plays a movie in his mind of the entire game</v>

2222
01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 2>before he plays it.</v>

2223
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

2224
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:42.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2225
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:46.200
<v Speaker 2>in a football game you're going to have 11 or 12 possessions during the game and</v>

2226
01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:47.681
<v Speaker 2>the football game,</v>

2227
01:14:47.681 --> 01:14:49.420
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna get that ball 11 or 12 times.</v>

2228
01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:50.510
<v Speaker 2>And he would say,</v>

2229
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to carry that ball three or four times per possession,</v>

2230
01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:56.380
<v Speaker 2>and he knows which plays he's going to run.</v>

2231
01:14:56.381 --> 01:14:57.640
<v Speaker 2>He would run him through his head,</v>

2232
01:14:57.641 --> 01:14:58.331
<v Speaker 2>he would see it,</v>

2233
01:14:58.331 --> 01:15:00.430
<v Speaker 2>he would know who was going to be there to tackle him.</v>

2234
01:15:00.431 --> 01:15:02.770
<v Speaker 2>He would run everything through his head.</v>

2235
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.280
<v Speaker 2>And he's one of those guys that wants the ball when the clock's running out.</v>

2236
01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:13.020
<v Speaker 2>But I have this theory that situations do not make heroes situations expose</v>

2237
01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.073
<v Speaker 2>heroes.</v>

2238
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:20.740
<v Speaker 2>And I saw that in Katrina,</v>

2239
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:26.770
<v Speaker 2>the hurricane that so devastated that that one neighborhood,</v>

2240
01:15:27.371 --> 01:15:28.270
<v Speaker 2>what ward was it?</v>

2241
01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Is it the ninth ward?</v>

2242
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:30.580
<v Speaker 2>I forget which ward it was.</v>

2243
01:15:30.581 --> 01:15:32.080
<v Speaker 2>That got so wiped out,</v>

2244
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2245
01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:38.610
<v Speaker 2>when Katrina hit New Orleans and there was a guy down there that had been really</v>

2246
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:39.920
<v Speaker 2>quiet.</v>

2247
01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had ever heard anything out of him.</v>

2248
01:15:42.341 --> 01:15:43.180
<v Speaker 2>He was an older guy,</v>

2249
01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:44.020
<v Speaker 2>lived in a house,</v>

2250
01:15:44.021 --> 01:15:45.130
<v Speaker 2>stayed to himself.</v>

2251
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:49.420
<v Speaker 2>And that night when the water was at rooftop level,</v>

2252
01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:54.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean he swam rooftop to rooftop and save six,</v>

2253
01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:55.000
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

2254
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.110
<v Speaker 2>eight people got him out of there and he didn't make it out,</v>

2255
01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:03.370
<v Speaker 2>but he got seven or eight people out of there and you go back and you check his</v>

2256
01:16:03.371 --> 01:16:07.210
<v Speaker 2>history and he was a military hero.</v>

2257
01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:12.570
<v Speaker 2>He just sat quietly in his home and when the situation came about,</v>

2258
01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.730
<v Speaker 2>it revealed who he was.</v>

2259
01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.740
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what happens.</v>

2260
01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:19.930
<v Speaker 2>I think if you've got a hero,</v>

2261
01:16:19.931 --> 01:16:20.830
<v Speaker 2>they just sit there,</v>

2262
01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:24.670
<v Speaker 2>sit there and sit there until a situation reveals who they are.</v>

2263
01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it makes him a hero.</v>

2264
01:16:26.231 --> 01:16:31.231
<v Speaker 2>I think it reveals that they're heroes and I think that's what happens to</v>

2265
01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:32.531
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2266
01:16:32.531 --> 01:16:33.070
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2267
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:35.470
<v Speaker 2>they are who they are until they get in,</v>

2268
01:16:35.471 --> 01:16:38.200
<v Speaker 2>in the opportunity that comes along and they're going to show you who that is</v>

2269
01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.190
<v Speaker 2>and they may show you they're a coward where they may show you that they've got</v>

2270
01:16:42.191 --> 01:16:45.910
<v Speaker 2>the focus to hang or they may show you that they're a hero,</v>

2271
01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:49.780
<v Speaker 2>but life circumstances are going to come along and you're going to show you who</v>

2272
01:16:49.781 --> 01:16:50.614
<v Speaker 2>somebody is.</v>

2273
01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2274
01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree.</v>

2275
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:58.040
<v Speaker 3>And I think what's also interesting is when someone does get revealed to be a</v>

2276
01:16:58.561 --> 01:16:59.394
<v Speaker 3>coward,</v>

2277
01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:00.990
<v Speaker 3>they can become a hero.</v>

2278
01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:02.610
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard.</v>

2279
01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:06.510
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to get past the memory of you being a coward.</v>

2280
01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2281
01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.950
<v Speaker 3>and I'll tell you why I think that's true.</v>

2282
01:17:09.951 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 3>If</v>

2283
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 2>you want to know please.</v>

2284
01:17:11.151 --> 01:17:11.984
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe</v>

2285
01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.180
<v Speaker 2>going away,</v>

2286
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.170
<v Speaker 2>going off on a tangent,</v>

2287
01:17:15.171 --> 01:17:16.004
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

2288
01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:16.761
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2289
01:17:16.761 --> 01:17:17.594
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2290
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I think we learn about ourselves and yo everybody talks about self esteem and</v>

2291
01:17:22.941 --> 01:17:23.774
<v Speaker 2>self worth,</v>

2292
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:29.270
<v Speaker 2>but nobody ever talks about what it really is or how we get it.</v>

2293
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:34.870
<v Speaker 2>And I think I think about it in terms of self attribution because you know how</v>

2294
01:17:37.011 --> 01:17:38.840
<v Speaker 2>you form opinions of other people.</v>

2295
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2296
01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:41.350
<v Speaker 2>if you look at this guy and you,</v>

2297
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:45.920
<v Speaker 2>you maybe you work with this guy and so you watch him across a couple of years</v>

2298
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:50.240
<v Speaker 2>and maybe this guy shows up to work every day and he's there 15 minutes early</v>

2299
01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.950
<v Speaker 2>and he unlocks the place,</v>

2300
01:17:51.951 --> 01:17:52.940
<v Speaker 2>gets everything ready,</v>

2301
01:17:52.941 --> 01:17:53.930
<v Speaker 2>puts a coffee on,</v>

2302
01:17:53.931 --> 01:17:54.920
<v Speaker 2>has his desk ready,</v>

2303
01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:56.000
<v Speaker 2>he's all buttoned up.</v>

2304
01:17:56.001 --> 01:17:56.371
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>

2305
01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:57.141
<v Speaker 2>when the bell rings,</v>

2306
01:17:57.141 --> 01:17:58.100
<v Speaker 2>he's ready to go.</v>

2307
01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:01.730
<v Speaker 2>And you just learned that this guy's buttoned up,</v>

2308
01:18:01.731 --> 01:18:02.360
<v Speaker 2>ready to go.</v>

2309
01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Dependable never misses.</v>

2310
01:18:03.921 --> 01:18:04.754
<v Speaker 2>He's always there.</v>

2311
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.560
<v Speaker 2>So you attribute certain traits and characteristics to him based on your</v>

2312
01:18:09.561 --> 01:18:14.150
<v Speaker 2>observations of him and your experience of him based on that you assign certain</v>

2313
01:18:14.151 --> 01:18:15.560
<v Speaker 2>traits and characteristics to him.</v>

2314
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:21.550
<v Speaker 2>But I say that's exactly the same way we form our own self image and our own</v>

2315
01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.040
<v Speaker 2>level of self worth.</v>

2316
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:30.070
<v Speaker 2>We watch ourselves go through life and we watch how we handle certain</v>

2317
01:18:31.161 --> 01:18:32.900
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and situations.</v>

2318
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:37.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I say overindulgence is one of the most insidious forms of child</v>

2319
01:18:37.701 --> 01:18:39.650
<v Speaker 2>abuse known to parenting.</v>

2320
01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2321
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:41.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not the worst.</v>

2322
01:18:41.961 --> 01:18:46.961
<v Speaker 2>It's just insidious because if you overindulge your children and do everything</v>

2323
01:18:47.271 --> 01:18:47.811
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>

2324
01:18:47.811 --> 01:18:50.570
<v Speaker 2>you never let them observe themselves,</v>

2325
01:18:50.571 --> 01:18:52.100
<v Speaker 2>master their environment.</v>

2326
01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:55.190
<v Speaker 2>You never let them step back and say,</v>

2327
01:18:55.191 --> 01:18:55.820
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2328
01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>

2329
01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.550
<v Speaker 2>I built this,</v>

2330
01:18:58.551 --> 01:18:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I overcame that,</v>

2331
01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 2>I handled this,</v>

2332
01:19:01.311 --> 01:19:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>

2333
01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 2>And so we,</v>

2334
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:08.360
<v Speaker 2>that's the same way we make our own self image and level of self worth.</v>

2335
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.960
<v Speaker 2>We watch ourselves overcome the third grade.</v>

2336
01:19:11.961 --> 01:19:14.570
<v Speaker 2>We watch ourselves stand up to a bully,</v>

2337
01:19:14.571 --> 01:19:19.571
<v Speaker 2>we watch ourselves handle a test with the information that intimidated us or we</v>

2338
01:19:21.081 --> 01:19:26.081
<v Speaker 2>watch ourselves make it on to the Little League baseball team and actually get a</v>

2339
01:19:27.711 --> 01:19:29.030
<v Speaker 2>hit when we needed to.</v>

2340
01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:34.031
<v Speaker 2>Where we watch ourselves get on to the debate team and actually argue something</v>

2341
01:19:34.821 --> 01:19:35.541
<v Speaker 2>successfully,</v>

2342
01:19:35.541 --> 01:19:38.390
<v Speaker 2>whether it's academic or athletic or musical.</v>

2343
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:41.660
<v Speaker 2>We watch ourselves do it and so we go back and say,</v>

2344
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2345
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>

2346
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:45.200
<v Speaker 2>I attribute to myself the ability,</v>

2347
01:19:45.201 --> 01:19:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I can hang,</v>

2348
01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:47.630
<v Speaker 2>I can do this.</v>

2349
01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I can rise to the occasion.</v>

2350
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Or we watch ourselves fold like a pup tent and a windstorm and say,</v>

2351
01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:55.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2352
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 2>I can hang.</v>

2353
01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:56.993
<v Speaker 2>I don't have it.</v>

2354
01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:00.410
<v Speaker 2>And we make those attributions to ourselves.</v>

2355
01:20:00.411 --> 01:20:03.800
<v Speaker 2>And so we strength from the challenge for the rest of our lives until like you</v>

2356
01:20:03.801 --> 01:20:04.011
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2357
01:20:04.011 --> 01:20:09.011
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to overcome that and something pushes you up until you finally observe</v>

2358
01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:11.460
<v Speaker 2>yourself overcome something.</v>

2359
01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:17.210
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's how we form our level of self esteem and our identity about</v>

2360
01:20:18.301 --> 01:20:19.134
<v Speaker 2>who we are.</v>

2361
01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.900
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think most people think about that.</v>

2362
01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:22.711
<v Speaker 2>Look back and say,</v>

2363
01:20:22.711 --> 01:20:22.951
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2364
01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:23.784
<v Speaker 2>how did I,</v>

2365
01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:25.650
<v Speaker 2>how did I get to be Joe Rogan?</v>

2366
01:20:25.651 --> 01:20:26.490
<v Speaker 2>As I sit in a chair,</v>

2367
01:20:26.491 --> 01:20:27.570
<v Speaker 2>you have a self image,</v>

2368
01:20:27.571 --> 01:20:28.850
<v Speaker 2>you have a level of confidence,</v>

2369
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:29.641
<v Speaker 2>ego,</v>

2370
01:20:29.641 --> 01:20:30.474
<v Speaker 2>strength,</v>

2371
01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:31.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2372
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:37.430
<v Speaker 2>a level of self worth that's attributable to things you've watched yourself do</v>

2373
01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.090
<v Speaker 2>or not do,</v>

2374
01:20:39.091 --> 01:20:39.631
<v Speaker 2>achieve,</v>

2375
01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:40.321
<v Speaker 2>not achieve,</v>

2376
01:20:40.321 --> 01:20:43.440
<v Speaker 2>overcome or whatever throughout your life.</v>

2377
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.753
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2378
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.320
<v Speaker 2>and I think to know yourself,</v>

2379
01:20:46.321 --> 01:20:47.640
<v Speaker 2>you have to know what those things are.</v>

2380
01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.590
<v Speaker 3>I think you're 100% right.</v>

2381
01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:53.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think for children participating in things that are going to test you so</v>

2382
01:20:53.911 --> 01:20:54.744
<v Speaker 3>critical,</v>

2383
01:20:54.810 --> 01:20:57.150
<v Speaker 3>giving them this opportunity to realize that the,</v>

2384
01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:57.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2385
01:20:57.670 --> 01:21:01.470
<v Speaker 3>there's a line between success and failure and that you could push through that</v>

2386
01:21:01.471 --> 01:21:02.140
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>

2387
01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:02.461
<v Speaker 3>You could,</v>

2388
01:21:02.461 --> 01:21:06.700
<v Speaker 3>you could become successful at something and learn watching kids.</v>

2389
01:21:06.701 --> 01:21:06.801
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2390
01:21:06.801 --> 01:21:08.880
<v Speaker 3>that's why I think sports are so important for children.</v>

2391
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the more insidious things about having these participation</v>

2392
01:21:13.831 --> 01:21:16.590
<v Speaker 3>trophies for kids where that nobody wins the game.</v>

2393
01:21:16.591 --> 01:21:17.221
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

2394
01:21:17.221 --> 01:21:17.941
<v Speaker 3>Everybody plays.</v>

2395
01:21:17.941 --> 01:21:18.631
<v Speaker 3>But nobody wins.</v>

2396
01:21:18.631 --> 01:21:19.560
<v Speaker 3>We don't keep score.</v>

2397
01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.150
<v Speaker 3>Why the fuck you plan?</v>

2398
01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2399
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean that just goes down as an environmental non event.</v>

2400
01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2401
01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:30.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean that contributes nothing to your definition is just something to do.</v>

2402
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.830
<v Speaker 3>It's also psychologically,</v>

2403
01:21:32.010 --> 01:21:33.270
<v Speaker 3>it's coddling.</v>

2404
01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:33.901
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

2405
01:21:33.901 --> 01:21:38.880
<v Speaker 3>it's very damaging for your potential education that you would get from that</v>

2406
01:21:38.881 --> 01:21:39.600
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

2407
01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.160
<v Speaker 3>The bad feeling that you get when someone scores on you is motivation for you to</v>

2408
01:21:44.161 --> 01:21:45.360
<v Speaker 3>be better at defense.</v>

2409
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:46.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2410
01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:47.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2411
01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:49.760
<v Speaker 2>I think we cheat kids when we do that,</v>

2412
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:51.630
<v Speaker 2>and of course you gotta play everybody.</v>

2413
01:21:51.730 --> 01:21:55.340
<v Speaker 2>I get that not everybody is meant to be an athlete,</v>

2414
01:21:55.341 --> 01:21:55.700
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2415
01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:56.241
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2416
01:21:56.241 --> 01:21:57.074
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2417
01:21:57.170 --> 01:21:58.280
<v Speaker 2>go do something else.</v>

2418
01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Be Good at what you're good at.</v>

2419
01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:02.960
<v Speaker 3>And if you really want to do it well,</v>

2420
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:04.220
<v Speaker 3>you've got a long road.</v>

2421
01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a greased hill.</v>

2422
01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:07.213
<v Speaker 3>Start running.</v>

2423
01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2424
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Everything's not for everybody.</v>

2425
01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:14.880
<v Speaker 2>So find what you're good at and watch yourself achieve in that lane.</v>

2426
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:16.231
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2427
01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:16.790
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

2428
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:17.623
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2429
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:20.070
<v Speaker 2>I can't carry a tune in a bucket.</v>

2430
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:21.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2431
01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.353
<v Speaker 2>I can't even,</v>

2432
01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:23.790
<v Speaker 2>I can play no instrument.</v>

2433
01:22:23.791 --> 01:22:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I can't sing.</v>

2434
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I can play a radio of,</v>

2435
01:22:26.581 --> 01:22:27.990
<v Speaker 2>it's got a big on off knob.</v>

2436
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:28.853
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2437
01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:30.281
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

2438
01:22:30.281 --> 01:22:31.114
<v Speaker 2>I don't try,</v>

2439
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:31.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2440
01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:31.650
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2441
01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not good at that.</v>

2442
01:22:32.611 --> 01:22:36.930
<v Speaker 2>So I go into lanes that I can do stuff and observe myself in that.</v>

2443
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.170
<v Speaker 2>But I think you cheat kids if you don't let them observe themselves face</v>

2444
01:22:41.171 --> 01:22:42.330
<v Speaker 2>adversity and overcome it.</v>

2445
01:22:42.650 --> 01:22:43.341
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2446
01:22:43.341 --> 01:22:46.880
<v Speaker 3>And it's also an interesting lesson to learn that life isn't fair.</v>

2447
01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:47.631
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2448
01:22:47.631 --> 01:22:52.631
<v Speaker 3>if you're a kid and you're playing basketball with a 15 year old Lebron James</v>

2449
01:22:53.210 --> 01:22:54.650
<v Speaker 3>and you're my height,</v>

2450
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:55.311
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

2451
01:22:55.311 --> 01:22:56.144
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>

2452
01:22:56.710 --> 01:22:57.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2453
01:22:57.410 --> 01:22:58.940
<v Speaker 3>this ain't gonna work out at all.</v>

2454
01:22:59.130 --> 01:22:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2455
01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:01.160
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at a towel boy here.</v>

2456
01:23:01.730 --> 01:23:03.410
<v Speaker 3>This is not fucking happening.</v>

2457
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 3>And you have to be able to that and appreciate that.</v>

2458
01:23:06.371 --> 01:23:07.570
<v Speaker 3>And then conversely,</v>

2459
01:23:07.571 --> 01:23:10.360
<v Speaker 3>if you're very physically frail,</v>

2460
01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:10.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2461
01:23:10.931 --> 01:23:12.610
<v Speaker 3>maybe wrestling's not for you either.</v>

2462
01:23:12.611 --> 01:23:12.851
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2463
01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:13.300
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

2464
01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:13.991
<v Speaker 3>maybe you,</v>

2465
01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:14.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2466
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:18.160
<v Speaker 3>we need to do something about your body before you engage in any sort of a</v>

2467
01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:19.180
<v Speaker 3>combat sport.</v>

2468
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.931
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2469
01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:21.390
<v Speaker 3>they did an experiment back in,</v>

2470
01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the 60s they did something called teaching machines.</v>

2471
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:25.040
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that?</v>

2472
01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:25.873
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2473
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:28.051
<v Speaker 2>Short period of time.</v>

2474
01:23:28.051 --> 01:23:28.884
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>

2475
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:32.340
<v Speaker 2>they took students in the class where they put the steps of learning the</v>

2476
01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:37.140
<v Speaker 2>information so close together that there was never a failure experience.</v>

2477
01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:42.740
<v Speaker 2>It would say like the war of 1812 happened in 1812 then the next thing would say</v>

2478
01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.150
<v Speaker 2>the war of 1812 happened in blank.</v>

2479
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:49.650
<v Speaker 2>You fill in 1812.</v>

2480
01:23:49.651 --> 01:23:50.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean come on,</v>

2481
01:23:50.821 --> 01:23:51.990
<v Speaker 2>potted plant could get that.</v>

2482
01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.180
<v Speaker 2>So they've put it together and they would teach the information and they would</v>

2483
01:23:57.181 --> 01:24:00.600
<v Speaker 2>teach it to criteria where you mastered the information.</v>

2484
01:24:00.601 --> 01:24:04.080
<v Speaker 2>You had it 100% and I said,</v>

2485
01:24:04.081 --> 01:24:04.530
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2486
01:24:04.530 --> 01:24:05.363
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>

2487
01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Everybody learned it.</v>

2488
01:24:06.511 --> 01:24:08.280
<v Speaker 2>So everybody made a hundred,</v>

2489
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.840
<v Speaker 2>everybody got the information,</v>

2490
01:24:09.841 --> 01:24:11.010
<v Speaker 2>they truly did learn it.</v>

2491
01:24:11.011 --> 01:24:12.120
<v Speaker 2>There was no question about it.</v>

2492
01:24:12.121 --> 01:24:15.210
<v Speaker 2>They learned the information and so they did great.</v>

2493
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:17.730
<v Speaker 2>And then they took them out of that program.</v>

2494
01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And put them back in the regular classroom.</v>

2495
01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:22.980
<v Speaker 2>And the first time they came to questions,</v>

2496
01:24:22.981 --> 01:24:24.210
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know the answer to.</v>

2497
01:24:24.211 --> 01:24:29.190
<v Speaker 2>The first time they didn't get a hundred they came apart like a cheap suit.</v>

2498
01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:30.330
<v Speaker 2>They panicked,</v>

2499
01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:32.610
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know how to handle adversity,</v>

2500
01:24:32.611 --> 01:24:36.690
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know how to handle it when they didn't have the right answers,</v>

2501
01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.170
<v Speaker 2>they didn't learn how to not be perfect.</v>

2502
01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:45.570
<v Speaker 2>And so they scrapped the whole program because he said you can't do this because</v>

2503
01:24:45.571 --> 01:24:47.010
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way life is.</v>

2504
01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:48.660
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>

2505
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2506
01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:52.470
<v Speaker 2>you're not teaching them how the real world works,</v>

2507
01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.800
<v Speaker 2>you might as well teach them to go on red and stop on green and then give them</v>

2508
01:24:58.131 --> 01:24:59.460
<v Speaker 2>the keys and put them out in life.</v>

2509
01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's not the way it works.</v>

2510
01:25:00.661 --> 01:25:05.160
<v Speaker 2>And those kids were absolutely screwed up when they got into a truly competitive</v>

2511
01:25:05.161 --> 01:25:05.994
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

2512
01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:07.950
<v Speaker 2>It can't be success only.</v>

2513
01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:08.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2514
01:25:08.491 --> 01:25:09.720
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

2515
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.980
<v Speaker 3>It's not healthy.</v>

2516
01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:12.120
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for you.</v>

2517
01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:13.290
<v Speaker 3>You don't learn from it.</v>

2518
01:25:13.291 --> 01:25:17.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole idea about school is you're supposed to be setting kids up for</v>

2519
01:25:17.191 --> 01:25:17.731
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>

2520
01:25:17.731 --> 01:25:18.840
<v Speaker 3>He's supposed to be teaching them,</v>

2521
01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.580
<v Speaker 3>not just information,</v>

2522
01:25:20.581 --> 01:25:21.900
<v Speaker 3>but teaching them how to learn.</v>

2523
01:25:21.901 --> 01:25:22.734
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2524
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:24.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2525
01:25:24.081 --> 01:25:24.920
<v Speaker 2>and that worries me.</v>

2526
01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:25.491
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2527
01:25:25.491 --> 01:25:27.950
<v Speaker 2>I've read that story not long ago when new students,</v>

2528
01:25:27.951 --> 01:25:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it was at Ucla in law school,</v>

2529
01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:36.400
<v Speaker 2>complained and got a professor either disciplined or fired because he required</v>

2530
01:25:40.131 --> 01:25:45.131
<v Speaker 2>them to take a counter argument over something controversial like Ferguson.</v>

2531
01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:48.411
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2532
01:25:48.411 --> 01:25:49.244
<v Speaker 2>I want you to,</v>

2533
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2534
01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I know you that you're all on this point of view.</v>

2535
01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Now I want you to prepare an argument for the other side.</v>

2536
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:58.610
<v Speaker 2>And they all said,</v>

2537
01:25:58.610 --> 01:25:58.850
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2538
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:59.360
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2539
01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.440
<v Speaker 2>that's upsetting to us.</v>

2540
01:26:00.441 --> 01:26:01.580
<v Speaker 2>We just can't do it.</v>

2541
01:26:01.581 --> 01:26:02.960
<v Speaker 2>And they went to the administration and,</v>

2542
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:04.151
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2543
01:26:04.151 --> 01:26:04.751
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2544
01:26:04.751 --> 01:26:06.580
<v Speaker 3>Because you may have to do,</v>

2545
01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:07.421
<v Speaker 3>as a lawyer,</v>

2546
01:26:07.421 --> 01:26:11.200
<v Speaker 3>you may have to represent someone who's done something you don't agree with.</v>

2547
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:12.940
<v Speaker 3>If that's what you want to do for a living.</v>

2548
01:26:12.941 --> 01:26:13.200
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2549
01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:14.033
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2550
01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.330
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding me?</v>

2551
01:26:15.710 --> 01:26:18.060
<v Speaker 2>They were like needed therapy.</v>

2552
01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:20.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2553
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:23.250
<v Speaker 3>what the hell has happened here?</v>

2554
01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2555
01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:26.440
<v Speaker 3>that is so crazy.</v>

2556
01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:27.493
<v Speaker 3>That's nuts.</v>

2557
01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:28.950
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2558
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:30.211
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2559
01:26:30.211 --> 01:26:31.044
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2560
01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.113
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2561
01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2562
01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:35.281
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2563
01:26:35.281 --> 01:26:37.560
<v Speaker 3>there's a movement going on in this country right now,</v>

2564
01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:40.950
<v Speaker 3>the social justice movement and a,</v>

2565
01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:46.280
<v Speaker 3>it leans in that direction that people don't want to look at things for how they</v>

2566
01:26:46.651 --> 01:26:46.891
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

2567
01:26:46.891 --> 01:26:48.520
<v Speaker 3>They want to look at things for how they want them</v>

2568
01:26:48.630 --> 01:26:49.463
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

2569
01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2570
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:51.120
<v Speaker 2>That just,</v>

2571
01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand.</v>

2572
01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.880
<v Speaker 2>You cannot</v>

2573
01:26:55.460 --> 01:27:00.460
<v Speaker 2>legislate that everything is going to be equal for everybody because everybody's</v>

2574
01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:03.884
<v Speaker 2>not equal.</v>

2575
01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2576
01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:06.050
<v Speaker 2>They're not equal.</v>

2577
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:09.680
<v Speaker 2>They may be equal in terms of their value as a human being,</v>

2578
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:12.530
<v Speaker 2>but they're not equal in mass skills.</v>

2579
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:14.780
<v Speaker 2>They're not equal in how fast they run.</v>

2580
01:27:14.781 --> 01:27:16.670
<v Speaker 2>They're not equal in creativity.</v>

2581
01:27:16.671 --> 01:27:17.390
<v Speaker 2>They're not equal.</v>

2582
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has their own value,</v>

2583
01:27:18.981 --> 01:27:21.380
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean they're marketable.</v>

2584
01:27:21.381 --> 01:27:26.381
<v Speaker 2>Skills in an open society and an open market are going to be the same</v>

2585
01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:26.811
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2586
01:27:26.811 --> 01:27:27.644
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

2587
01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:28.280
<v Speaker 3>I used to have,</v>

2588
01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.120
<v Speaker 3>I had a joke on one of my special saw two specials ago about,</v>

2589
01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:32.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2590
01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:34.790
<v Speaker 3>there was a story about a woman who was guarding the White House.</v>

2591
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.810
<v Speaker 3>She was the lone guard at one of the doors of the White House and some crazy man</v>

2592
01:27:38.811 --> 01:27:40.490
<v Speaker 3>broke in and uh,</v>

2593
01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:43.430
<v Speaker 3>knocked her to the ground and just ran through the White House and he was</v>

2594
01:27:43.431 --> 01:27:46.880
<v Speaker 3>running around inside the White House for like three minutes before they finally</v>

2595
01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:48.260
<v Speaker 3>some off duty.</v>

2596
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.750
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2597
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:51.440
<v Speaker 3>see a secret service agent tackled this guy.</v>

2598
01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:52.521
<v Speaker 3>I saw like,</v>

2599
01:27:52.521 --> 01:27:53.390
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

2600
01:27:53.391 --> 01:27:54.530
<v Speaker 3>This guy's running through the White House,</v>

2601
01:27:54.531 --> 01:27:55.364
<v Speaker 3>tackle this guy,</v>

2602
01:27:55.490 --> 01:28:00.490
<v Speaker 3>and that the joke was that people think that a woman can do everything a man can</v>

2603
01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:01.611
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2604
01:28:01.611 --> 01:28:01.851
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2605
01:28:01.851 --> 01:28:03.290
<v Speaker 3>a woman can do everything a man could do.</v>

2606
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:04.333
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>

2607
01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.130
<v Speaker 3>And some woman in the crowd of the comedy store is like,</v>

2608
01:28:07.131 --> 01:28:07.964
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2609
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.301
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2610
01:28:08.301 --> 01:28:08.960
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2611
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:10.490
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make any fucking sense.</v>

2612
01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Here's why it doesn't make any sense because a man can't do everything a man can</v>

2613
01:28:14.471 --> 01:28:15.304
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2614
01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:15.681
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2615
01:28:15.681 --> 01:28:16.130
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2616
01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I've met Shaquille O'Neal and his Dick is where my face is.</v>

2617
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:23.240
<v Speaker 3>And if the White House has experienced seeing a Shaq attack,</v>

2618
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:27.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm the wrong person to save the world because he's just going to run right over</v>

2619
01:28:27.471 --> 01:28:28.070
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2620
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.550
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2621
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:31.580
<v Speaker 3>but if my wife and kid where garden,</v>

2622
01:28:31.581 --> 01:28:32.414
<v Speaker 3>the White House,</v>

2623
01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:33.860
<v Speaker 3>guess what I'm getting in?</v>

2624
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.761
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2625
01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:35.720
<v Speaker 3>I love my family,</v>

2626
01:28:35.721 --> 01:28:37.810
<v Speaker 3>but if it's between me and get it,</v>

2627
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:39.260
<v Speaker 3>there's no way they're going to be able to stop me.</v>

2628
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:40.550
<v Speaker 3>I loved them to death,</v>

2629
01:28:40.551 --> 01:28:44.780
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a man and they're women and if there's a woman guard in the White House,</v>

2630
01:28:44.781 --> 01:28:45.561
<v Speaker 3>I don't care who she is,</v>

2631
01:28:45.561 --> 01:28:46.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll fuck her up.</v>

2632
01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:47.750
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to happen.</v>

2633
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.920
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

2634
01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:49.850
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>

2635
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:54.850
<v Speaker 3>someone had this idea that they would put a woman in charge of a very physical</v>

2636
01:28:57.171 --> 01:28:57.830
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

2637
01:28:57.830 --> 01:29:02.580
<v Speaker 3>You should have a giant man with a violent temper and he should be armed.</v>

2638
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.091
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2639
01:29:03.091 --> 01:29:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Cause this is the guy that's keeping bad people from the fucking president.</v>

2640
01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:08.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2641
01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2642
01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2643
01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:10.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

2644
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:13.280
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like you got to find your own lane.</v>

2645
01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2646
01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.121
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2647
01:29:14.121 --> 01:29:15.770
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to put me in the NBA.</v>

2648
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:16.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2649
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:18.270
<v Speaker 3>Physical things in particular.</v>

2650
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.460
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also mental things.</v>

2651
01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:21.120
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2652
01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.170
<v Speaker 3>I suck at math.</v>

2653
01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:22.861
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2654
01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:23.010
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

2655
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:23.250
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2656
01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:26.100
<v Speaker 3>if everyone has a chance to work at cern,</v>

2657
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:26.671
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2658
01:29:26.671 --> 01:29:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has a chance to work at the large Hadron collider,</v>

2659
01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:30.990
<v Speaker 3>including people that have no idea about physics.</v>

2660
01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.690
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have a real time making these equations work.</v>

2661
01:29:33.730 --> 01:29:34.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2662
01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:37.420
<v Speaker 2>that's what I mean about finding your own lane.</v>

2663
01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2664
01:29:37.690 --> 01:29:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Cue.</v>

2665
01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.150
<v Speaker 2>I can't add two and two and get five every time.</v>

2666
01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not good at math,</v>

2667
01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:43.510
<v Speaker 2>but I'm good with words.</v>

2668
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:44.411
<v Speaker 2>I can talk.</v>

2669
01:29:44.411 --> 01:29:46.510
<v Speaker 2>I can read faster than I can comprehend well,</v>

2670
01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:48.700
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not good with math,</v>

2671
01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:52.600
<v Speaker 2>so I got myself into a lane where I talked for a living.</v>

2672
01:29:52.601 --> 01:29:53.201
<v Speaker 2>I read,</v>

2673
01:29:53.201 --> 01:29:53.771
<v Speaker 2>I talk,</v>

2674
01:29:53.771 --> 01:29:54.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2675
01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:55.030
<v Speaker 2>it's qualitative,</v>

2676
01:29:55.031 --> 01:29:55.990
<v Speaker 2>not quantitative.</v>

2677
01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:59.950
<v Speaker 2>I can accept that I'm not suited for that.</v>

2678
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.903
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2679
01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel bad about myself because of that.</v>

2680
01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Once you do something and you're good at it,</v>

2681
01:30:05.061 --> 01:30:07.010
<v Speaker 3>you can accept not being good at other things.</v>

2682
01:30:07.011 --> 01:30:09.500
<v Speaker 3>It's much easier if you find the thing that you're good at,</v>

2683
01:30:09.501 --> 01:30:12.740
<v Speaker 3>whether it's gymnastics or singing or painting,</v>

2684
01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:13.790
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2685
01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.830
<v Speaker 3>If you could find a thing that you're good at,</v>

2686
01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:17.000
<v Speaker 3>it will make you,</v>

2687
01:30:17.170 --> 01:30:21.350
<v Speaker 3>it'll give you a feeling of self worth and you won't need to be good at</v>

2688
01:30:21.351 --> 01:30:25.250
<v Speaker 3>everything you can accept and you can enjoy other people being good at things as</v>

2689
01:30:25.251 --> 01:30:26.084
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2690
01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2691
01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.240
<v Speaker 2>You know what I said earlier,</v>

2692
01:30:28.330 --> 01:30:31.690
<v Speaker 2>my dad was an alcoholic and I would compare myself to that kid across,</v>

2693
01:30:31.691 --> 01:30:33.430
<v Speaker 2>cause I had a damaged personal truth,</v>

2694
01:30:34.210 --> 01:30:39.070
<v Speaker 2>but I found a currency because at that time in my life I was a pretty decent</v>

2695
01:30:39.071 --> 01:30:41.740
<v Speaker 2>athlete for this small school I was going to.</v>

2696
01:30:41.741 --> 01:30:43.030
<v Speaker 2>So that was my currency.</v>

2697
01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2698
01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:48.580
<v Speaker 2>So now it didn't matter what was happening at home because I got strokes for</v>

2699
01:30:48.581 --> 01:30:50.890
<v Speaker 2>being able to jump high and run fast at school.</v>

2700
01:30:50.891 --> 01:30:52.360
<v Speaker 2>So that became my currency.</v>

2701
01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:55.810
<v Speaker 2>So now when I compared myself to him,</v>

2702
01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.441
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2703
01:30:56.441 --> 01:30:58.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe my home life wasn't as good as his,</v>

2704
01:30:58.451 --> 01:30:59.920
<v Speaker 2>but I could run faster and jump higher.</v>

2705
01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:01.960
<v Speaker 2>So that became my currency.</v>

2706
01:31:01.961 --> 01:31:02.820
<v Speaker 2>So now I,</v>

2707
01:31:03.130 --> 01:31:03.461
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2708
01:31:03.461 --> 01:31:05.470
<v Speaker 2>That leveled the playing field for me.</v>

2709
01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:06.910
<v Speaker 2>And you all would,</v>

2710
01:31:06.911 --> 01:31:07.421
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

2711
01:31:07.421 --> 01:31:11.050
<v Speaker 2>find what you're good at at a given time and do what you're good at.</v>

2712
01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:11.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2713
01:31:11.431 --> 01:31:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Find something you love,</v>

2714
01:31:12.631 --> 01:31:15.360
<v Speaker 3>find something you're passionate about and that you could also excel at.</v>

2715
01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:19.110
<v Speaker 2>And if you can work it out where it's your vocation and your avocation,</v>

2716
01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:21.210
<v Speaker 2>you love doing it and you get paid for it,</v>

2717
01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:24.480
<v Speaker 2>then you're just double blessed and then you got it right because you enjoy</v>

2718
01:31:24.481 --> 01:31:26.460
<v Speaker 2>doing this and it works out and that's good.</v>

2719
01:31:26.490 --> 01:31:26.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2720
01:31:26.701 --> 01:31:29.200
<v Speaker 2>You catch lucky breaks if you the image,</v>

2721
01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:30.253
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

2722
01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:30.571
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

2723
01:31:30.571 --> 01:31:31.404
<v Speaker 2>that's lucky.</v>

2724
01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2725
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:34.583
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2726
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:38.340
<v Speaker 2>And if I just think if you're in your life and theirs,</v>

2727
01:31:38.370 --> 01:31:40.920
<v Speaker 2>you don't have something that you're passionate about.</v>

2728
01:31:41.490 --> 01:31:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2729
01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:45.660
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean that in a cliche way.</v>

2730
01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:50.760
<v Speaker 2>If there's not something where you wake up every day and there's nothing in your</v>

2731
01:31:50.761 --> 01:31:52.860
<v Speaker 2>life that you're excited to do,</v>

2732
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:54.630
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2733
01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:56.910
<v Speaker 2>you need to go back to the drawing board.</v>

2734
01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:57.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2735
01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Because if all you're doing is just grinding it out,</v>

2736
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:02.890
<v Speaker 2>you get up everyday,</v>

2737
01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:04.720
<v Speaker 2>go to a job you don't like,</v>

2738
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:09.750
<v Speaker 2>do task you don't care to do and come home to a home you don't want to come home</v>

2739
01:32:10.481 --> 01:32:12.880
<v Speaker 2>to and wait to get them to do it again the next day</v>

2740
01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:15.640
<v Speaker 2>you're burning daylight.</v>

2741
01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.980
<v Speaker 2>What the Hell existences that.</v>

2742
01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.210
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2743
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:20.103
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2744
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that,</v>

2745
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:23.260
<v Speaker 2>that find something.</v>

2746
01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if it's gardening or music or art or athletics or something.</v>

2747
01:32:28.661 --> 01:32:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Find something you're excited to do.</v>

2748
01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Expose yourself to different things with that very purpose of finding something</v>

2749
01:32:35.231 --> 01:32:37.390
<v Speaker 2>that you love because the assumption out there,</v>

2750
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:38.350
<v Speaker 2>there's something out there.</v>

2751
01:32:38.351 --> 01:32:39.550
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you something.</v>

2752
01:32:39.650 --> 01:32:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2753
01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:41.170
<v Speaker 2>There's something healthy.</v>

2754
01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not illegal.</v>

2755
01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be high risk.</v>

2756
01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:49.120
<v Speaker 2>There's something you can do that's not going to kill you or put you in jail</v>

2757
01:32:49.121 --> 01:32:50.200
<v Speaker 2>that you can be excited about.</v>

2758
01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:51.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2759
01:32:51.101 --> 01:32:51.890
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's,</v>

2760
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:52.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2761
01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:56.890
<v Speaker 2>one of the most important things to do when you're a parent is to try to expose</v>

2762
01:32:56.891 --> 01:33:00.520
<v Speaker 2>your kids to as many different things as possible to find those things for them.</v>

2763
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2764
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:02.080
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2765
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I got two boys as you know,</v>

2766
01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:04.841
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2767
01:33:04.841 --> 01:33:05.830
<v Speaker 2>one of them really well,</v>

2768
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:10.920
<v Speaker 2>and I did that growing up because my dad never took me hunting a single day in</v>

2769
01:33:11.141 --> 01:33:11.620
<v Speaker 2>his life.</v>

2770
01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:14.080
<v Speaker 2>He never took me fishing a single day in his life.</v>

2771
01:33:14.081 --> 01:33:16.390
<v Speaker 2>He never took me camping a single day in his life.</v>

2772
01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:18.610
<v Speaker 2>He never took me to the lake.</v>

2773
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:19.750
<v Speaker 2>He never took me skiing,</v>

2774
01:33:19.751 --> 01:33:20.081
<v Speaker 2>boating,</v>

2775
01:33:20.081 --> 01:33:20.471
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2776
01:33:20.471 --> 01:33:21.304
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

2777
01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I took them to all of those things.</v>

2778
01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>

2779
01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I had no clue what I was doing,</v>

2780
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:28.990
<v Speaker 2>but I took him Turkey hunting,</v>

2781
01:33:28.991 --> 01:33:29.651
<v Speaker 2>duck hunting,</v>

2782
01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:30.520
<v Speaker 2>deer hunting,</v>

2783
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.320
<v Speaker 2>she's skiing,</v>

2784
01:33:32.321 --> 01:33:33.340
<v Speaker 2>snow skiing,</v>

2785
01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:34.203
<v Speaker 2>camping.</v>

2786
01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I did it all.</v>

2787
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:38.920
<v Speaker 2>And to see what they liked,</v>

2788
01:33:38.921 --> 01:33:39.820
<v Speaker 2>let them pick.</v>

2789
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:41.350
<v Speaker 2>And boy,</v>

2790
01:33:41.351 --> 01:33:44.710
<v Speaker 2>when you don't know what you're doing as a dad,</v>

2791
01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:46.180
<v Speaker 2>that's a bitch.</v>

2792
01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2793
01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:47.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2794
01:33:47.381 --> 01:33:49.130
<v Speaker 2>just little things like you,</v>

2795
01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:54.190
<v Speaker 2>you go camping and you don't realize that sit in your 10 up on the side of a</v>

2796
01:33:54.191 --> 01:33:55.024
<v Speaker 2>hill,</v>

2797
01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:59.170
<v Speaker 2>even if it's like eight or 10 degrees is a bad idea.</v>

2798
01:33:59.230 --> 01:33:59.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2799
01:33:59.421 --> 01:33:59.860
<v Speaker 2>Sleep.</v>

2800
01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:01.420
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get on flat ground.</v>

2801
01:34:01.450 --> 01:34:01.691
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2802
01:34:01.691 --> 01:34:02.710
<v Speaker 2>it looks flat to me,</v>

2803
01:34:02.711 --> 01:34:05.620
<v Speaker 2>but I spent the night try not to roll down to Damn Hill.</v>

2804
01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 2>It didn't look like it was on a slant,</v>

2805
01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:08.254
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

2806
01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:10.720
<v Speaker 2>but you figure these things out as you go along.</v>

2807
01:34:10.721 --> 01:34:15.280
<v Speaker 2>But I was glad I gave him those experiences so they could choose.</v>

2808
01:34:15.281 --> 01:34:15.911
<v Speaker 2>And they did.</v>

2809
01:34:15.911 --> 01:34:16.220
<v Speaker 2>And they will.</v>

2810
01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:17.560
<v Speaker 2>And there's some of it they liked some of it.</v>

2811
01:34:17.561 --> 01:34:18.220
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>

2812
01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.390
<v Speaker 2>well I don't know both the kids,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

2855
01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.760
<v Speaker 2>The good thing about being bald as you look the same all the time,</v>

2856
01:35:07.761 --> 01:35:07.911
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2857
01:35:07.911 --> 01:35:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2858
01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:09.053
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

2859
01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.430
<v Speaker 2>And you save money on shampoo.</v>

2860
01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:11.750
<v Speaker 2>You shaved money on shampoo.</v>

2861
01:35:11.751 --> 01:35:16.751
<v Speaker 2>And I've been bald since I was like 12 so really my hair fell out really early.</v>

2862
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.313
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2863
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I remember playing college football.</v>

2864
01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:23.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd take my helmet off and it looked like I had an animal in there.</v>

2865
01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Once a pill,</v>

2866
01:35:26.630 --> 01:35:27.560
<v Speaker 2>it's going on here.</v>

2867
01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:28.361
<v Speaker 2>My team,</v>

2868
01:35:28.361 --> 01:35:30.830
<v Speaker 2>I should say what the hill is in your helmet.</v>

2869
01:35:30.831 --> 01:35:32.030
<v Speaker 2>It's my hair shut up.</v>

2870
01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.071
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>

2871
01:35:34.071 --> 01:35:35.060
<v Speaker 2>but it just fell out.</v>

2872
01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I guess he got knocked out or the mustache works too.</v>

2873
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:38.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2874
01:35:38.001 --> 01:35:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Well some a lot of guys can't rock a mustache.</v>

2875
01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I'd look a little creepy with one.</v>

2876
01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2877
01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Well I tried to keep it where it doesn't look like total porn.</v>

2878
01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:47.503
<v Speaker 2>That's tough.</v>

2879
01:35:48.190 --> 01:35:49.011
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>

2880
01:35:49.011 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 2>You got to embrace your weaknesses.</v>

2881
01:35:50.721 --> 01:35:51.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2882
01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:51.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2883
01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.810
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I wrote my first book on Oprah,</v>

2884
01:35:53.811 --> 01:35:54.510
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

2885
01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:56.370
<v Speaker 2>you'll you won't have any trouble finding it.</v>

2886
01:35:56.371 --> 01:35:59.120
