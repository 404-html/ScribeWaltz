1
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>So it's not obvious on first consideration why discussed would be a moral</v>

2
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>most of the work that's done,</v>

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>it's outside of the disgust realm I would say is predicated on the assumption</v>

6
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that conservatives in particular,</v>

7
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps people who are more authoritarian and general draw boundaries around</v>

8
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>their territories because they're afraid of the other.</v>

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't really,</v>

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>that isn't really how it plays out as far as I can tell.</v>

11
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Because conservatives for example,</v>

12
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>are less neurotic than treat in the big five traits sense than liberals.</v>

13
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Although it's,</v>

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a minor difference.</v>

15
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>But the disgust issue seems to be particularly relevant.</v>

16
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

17
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>so can you tell us a little bit about why disgust per se?</v>

18
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

19
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 2>first conservatives are a little less neurotic,</v>

20
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 2>but they also add,</v>

21
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 2>if you do very low level perceptual experiment,</v>

22
00:00:57.461 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 2>just like a puff of white noise in the ear,</v>

23
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 2>people who react more strongly to that to any sort of very low level threat are</v>

24
00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 2>more likely to vote Republican in this country.</v>

25
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:06.511
<v Speaker 2>So they're there.</v>

26
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

27
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.700
<v Speaker 2>there are all these interesting personality differences that lead to different</v>

28
00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:10.330
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

29
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 2>But as for why discussed?</v>

30
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.573
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

31
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

32
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm uh,</v>

33
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Durkheimian I would say I love the,</v>

34
00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:17.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.431
<v Speaker 2>the sociologists,</v>

36
00:01:18.431 --> 00:01:19.264
<v Speaker 2>Emile Durkheim,</v>

37
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.530
<v Speaker 2>and I'm also,</v>

38
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm a social psychologist,</v>

39
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 2>so I'm always thinking not about people as individual utility maximizers but</v>

40
00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:28.330
<v Speaker 2>people as members of social groups,</v>

41
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 2>people who are totally focused on belonging in their social groups and people</v>

42
00:01:33.731 --> 00:01:37.420
<v Speaker 2>who have some pro social motives about keeping the group together,</v>

43
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 2>about doing things that are good for the group.</v>

44
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 2>So as I tried to argue in my book,</v>

45
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:42.250
<v Speaker 2>the righteous mind,</v>

46
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.061
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

47
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:43.691
<v Speaker 2>we're selfish.</v>

48
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt that we often will do things to advance our own self interest</v>

49
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 2>at the expense of others.</v>

50
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 2>But we're also really groupish,</v>

51
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 2>which means we'll do all sorts of things to advance Eric Group at the expense of</v>

52
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.133
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

53
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.831
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

54
00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:57.664
<v Speaker 2>we're tribal,</v>

55
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 2>we evolved as a tribal species and we're doing,</v>

56
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:03.160
<v Speaker 2>we have all this software,</v>

57
00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:03.821
<v Speaker 2>I would know all this,</v>

58
00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:05.800
<v Speaker 2>all these predispositions,</v>

59
00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 2>these mental predispositions for life in,</v>

60
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 2>in tribes that are battling other tribes.</v>

61
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it comes out so easily.</v>

62
00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the way boys organized themselves when they get up fraternity,</v>

63
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

64
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.310
<v Speaker 2>the hazing rituals,</v>

65
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.210
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the weight,</v>

66
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:20.230
<v Speaker 2>it's especially clear in boys,</v>

67
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

68
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.420
<v Speaker 2>the way street gangs organized themselves.</v>

69
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:22.661
<v Speaker 2>Girls,</v>

70
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 2>tribalism is a little different.</v>

71
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.053
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

72
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 2>but I would say this is,</v>

73
00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:26.980
<v Speaker 2>and that's why,</v>

74
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.251
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

75
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.680
<v Speaker 2>I love the [inaudible] approach of archetypes or something.</v>

76
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.290
<v Speaker 2>There's just this weird stuff that is pan human.</v>

77
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Even if it comes out slightly differently around the world,</v>

78
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 2>there really is a human nature and it comes complete with a whole bunch of like,</v>

79
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 2>predesigned ideas.</v>
