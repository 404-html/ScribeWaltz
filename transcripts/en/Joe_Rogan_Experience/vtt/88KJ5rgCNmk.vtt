00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did this start?</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>When did the trigger warnings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did the safe spaces,</v>

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>when did all this emerge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>it has its roots in the student radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam of the 19 sixties,</v>

5
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:13.434
<v Speaker 1>especially the far left radicalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really popped up in the 19 nineties </v>

6
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:17.634
<v Speaker 1>and the early nineties when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching in the US at that point and </v>

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.433
<v Speaker 1>I taught at Harvard from 93 to 98 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a fair push for political </v>

9
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>correctness especially in the early part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the nineties,</v>

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.473
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it got pushed back down and </v>

11
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>disappeared and went under ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It went underground is more accurate and</v>

12
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:36.144
<v Speaker 1>then it's just come back with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vengeance in the last five years and I </v>

13
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.224
<v Speaker 1>think it's partly because we have all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these radical left political activist </v>

14
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>departments at the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's studies being at the top of the,</v>

15
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.763
<v Speaker 1>of the list that have done nothing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 30 years to even longer than </v>

16
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's almost 40 years,</v>

17
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.670
<v Speaker 1>have done nothing but produce an never </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending stream of ideological.</v>

19
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>He reminded counter civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political activists,</v>

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's all subsidized by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by tuition and by the public purse,</v>

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.923
<v Speaker 1>and that's another thing we really got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask ourselves is why the hell are we </v>

22
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>subsidizing revolution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are we doing that?</v>

23
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy and it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous.</v>

24
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly is going on with women's</v>

25
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>studies that you believe is fostering </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution?</v>

26
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd go on their websites and read,</v>

27
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>read what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

28
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

29
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.280
<v Speaker 1>for the women's studies types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a,</v>

30
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a false anthropology.</v>

31
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:44.364
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea that way back when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a feminist paradise and that </v>

32
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:50.424
<v Speaker 1>would be like noble savage mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>living where everything was </v>

33
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:53.424
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism and a women dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a matriarchal culture that was </v>

34
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>put forward by Ucla anthropologist named</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] tests.</v>

35
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I can never pronounce her name properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I got it.</v>

36
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And then that was overthrown by </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal institutions,</v>

37
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>start essentially starting at about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

38
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

39
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

40
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>of Judaism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was all overthrown.</v>

41
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>And ever since then we've lived in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive patriarchy.</v>

42
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's what our culture is.</v>

43
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.153
<v Speaker 1>It's an oppressive patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're pointing to one unsuccessful </v>

44
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 1>society that they believe existed or did</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

45
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

46
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>it didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence for whatsoever.</v>

47
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:28.371
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

48
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the,</v>

49
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.013
<v Speaker 1>it's the telling of a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological myth as if it was history </v>

50
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.813
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

51
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>and anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

52
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>so the basic claim is that Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization is a brutish patriarchy and</v>

53
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:42.084
<v Speaker 1>that whatever positive things that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>have managed to accomplish were all </v>

54
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>accomplished as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppression and,</v>

55
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and theft.</v>

56
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>And that the appropriate thing to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to restructure it from the bottom up.</v>

57
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>And they mean that they mean that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean every single bloody concept.</v>

58
00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:58.674
<v Speaker 1>And you can marry that modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and throw in a nice stash </v>

59
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.104
<v Speaker 1>of Marxism and you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideological and motivated grounds </v>

60
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:07.714
<v Speaker 1>for social revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just go online and look at a </v>

61
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>dozen women's studies websites.</v>

62
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Just read them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see what they say.</v>

63
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:18.484
<v Speaker 1>They produce political activists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their goal is to restructure the </v>

64
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

65
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:23.494
<v Speaker 1>what's the patriarchy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the patriarchy is Western </v>

66
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>civilization and what is restructure </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

67
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means tear it down and destroy it.</v>

68
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.043
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a brutish system that's </v>

69
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:38.360
<v Speaker 1>predicated on nothing but oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing but a tyranny in the,</v>

70
00:03:38.361 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 1>in the eyes of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the radical women's studies types,</v>

71
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>heterosexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tyranny.</v>

72
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tyranny.</v>

73
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

74
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if it did,</v>

75
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>it would be a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's a tyranny.</v>

76
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And so you can ask these and and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>would they replace it with?</v>

77
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>They replace it with their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological utopia.</v>

78
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>While we've already had 100 years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

79
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>we saw what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well that doesn't matter.</v>

80
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't real Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the bloody marks is.</v>

81
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Always say that wasn't real Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

82
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.893
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many millions of people have to die </v>

83
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>before you're convinced that it's real </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxism.</v>

84
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And I know what they mean by that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They mean,</v>

85
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was the Marxist dictator,</v>

86
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 1>things would gone a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>

87
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>You should think again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sunshine.</v>

88
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.453
<v Speaker 1>If you were the Marxists dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things wouldn't have gotten a lot </v>

89
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.183
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're the sort of person that </v>

90
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 1>thinks that if you would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled,</v>

91
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:31.564
<v Speaker 1>things would've gotten a lot better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're exactly the sort of person who </v>

92
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>should never be in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

93
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>

94
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

95
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>That's an important point because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think this is something that you've said</v>

96
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 1>that I absolutely agree with that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think a lot of this thinking and the way</v>

97
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 1>people are behaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems based on revenge.</v>

98
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.090
<v Speaker 1>It seems based on revenge for awkward </v>
<v Speaker 1>upbringings,</v>

99
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>so social uncomfortable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortability.</v>

100
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.313
<v Speaker 1>That seems like there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they view the world where they </v>

101
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 1>want to get back at people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally done them no wrong.</v>

102
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>It's resentment for the burden of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's deeper,</v>

103
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.663
<v Speaker 1>it's deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean human being human existence </v>

104
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 1>is characterized by a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

105
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're limited creatures and life is very</v>

106
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:17.230
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone dies.</v>

107
00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Everyone you love is going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the things you do,</v>

108
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>all of the things you do will eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>

109
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.583
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering is a certainty and it's very </v>

110
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>easy for people to become resentful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

111
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>about being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about existence.</v>

112
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.753
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids who shoot up high schools </v>

113
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

114
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>and these mass shooters there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the perfect examples of,</v>

115
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>of people who run on nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>

116
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>They're out to kill the innocent because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best marker of a.</v>

117
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.043
<v Speaker 1>that's the best way of showing just how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much contempt they have for existence </v>

118
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why punish the guilty?</v>

119
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 1>They deserve to be punished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more malevolent and,</v>

120
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

121
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and vengeful to punish the innocent.</v>

122
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like people are motivated to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great degree by resentment of being.</v>

123
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>And a huge chunk of that is manifested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

124
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>out to the dark side of the ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession.</v>

125
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.523
<v Speaker 1>So I get to decide who my enemies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I get to go after them and I </v>

126
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:09.734
<v Speaker 1>can go after them for every single thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ever been done to me that isn't </v>

127
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:13.210
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

128
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that's just built into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of existence.</v>

129
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Then they group up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they exhibit confirmation bias.</v>

130
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.023
<v Speaker 1>They all form some sort of a group think</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they act accordingly and this </v>

131
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:26.594
<v Speaker 1>is what you've been warning against and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where I completely agree with </v>

132
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:30.100
<v Speaker 1>you in this way.</v>

133
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.933
<v Speaker 1>I think the subject is so important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the way you've outlined all the </v>

134
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:34.364
<v Speaker 1>steps and the problems with Marxism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies in general that we are </v>

135
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:39.194
<v Speaker 1>dealing with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the beginning steps of it and </v>

136
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>people who look at it now and they say </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's social change and social justice.</v>

137
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

138
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

139
00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:49.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not going to improve things.</v>

140
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Implementing these policies will make </v>
<v Speaker 1>things worse.</v>

141
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.473
<v Speaker 1>They've made things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single place they've ever been </v>

142
00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:55.054
<v Speaker 1>implemented and often they've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>things so much worse that you actually </v>

143
00:06:58.931 --> 00:07:01.870
<v Speaker 1>can't imagine it and people don't do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>

144
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I've done the reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done the reading.</v>

145
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.403
<v Speaker 1>I know how bad things can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can get so bad that no matter how </v>

146
00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:10.540
<v Speaker 1>bad you think they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even in the bloody ballpark.</v>

147
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.393
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so strange that these sort of </v>

148
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.093
<v Speaker 1>courses and these sorts of ideologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>are thriving in universities and it's </v>

149
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.380
<v Speaker 1>really disconcerting to someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

150
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your children are going to go there</v>

151
00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:28.660
<v Speaker 1>and they going to trade schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

152
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

153
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:32.110
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I used to teach at Harvard,</v>

154
00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:34.480
<v Speaker 1>just send them to trade schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universities.</v>

155
00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can make good,</v>

156
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.390
<v Speaker 1>reasonable case that the universities do</v>
<v Speaker 1>more harm than good.</v>

157
00:07:39.391 --> 00:07:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say that.</v>
