<v Speaker 5>punch line in Sacramento.</v>

34
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 5>And if you've never been to the punch line in Sacramento I've never been to a</v>

35
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:44.750
<v Speaker 5>comedy club.</v>

36
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 5>The punch line in Sacramento is like one of the perfect comedy clubs to go to</v>

37
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 5>because it's been around for ever.</v>

38
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.500
<v Speaker 5>This as well as places like I don't remember the first time I worked there.</v>

39
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 5>But it was well over a decade ago it's a bad ass old school comedy club and some</v>

40
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 5>great great great comedy has been done on that stage perfectly set out really</v>

41
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:05.180
<v Speaker 5>intimate seating.</v>

42
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.880
<v Speaker 5>So it's a bad ass place to see three very funny guy.</v>

43
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 5>So May 3rd and 4th at the punch line in Sacramento and May 5th at Cobb's and in</v>

44
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 5>San Francisco and there might be a surprise guest there might not be though too</v>

45
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.340
<v Speaker 5>there might not be may be AIDS get stronger maybe World War Z is for real but</v>

46
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 5>maybe there's gonna be a big guest maybe there's a lot a lot of times you can't</v>

47
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 5>say because the reason being I'd say if you're doing a show like this like we</v>

48
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 5>might have a friend that's in town it says hey I want to do the show but they</v>

49
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 5>don't want to advertise because they have a committed gig within X amount of</v>

50
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 5>miles with an X amount of months and sometimes not supposed to say that you're</v>

51
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:46.510
<v Speaker 5>doing a gig like that's why.</v>

52
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go to like some some guys you don't have a hard time with the Comedy</v>

53
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Store for putting your name up there because they would have like a gig they</v>

54
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:54.980
<v Speaker 2>were doing in a big place or try to sell tickets for.</v>

55
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 2>So we'd have an arrangement.</v>

56
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.200
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I can't say but it might be someone very funny.</v>

57
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.890
<v Speaker 7>It might be somebody that hardly ever leaves L.A.</v>

58
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.320
<v Speaker 7>and hardly ever leaves the Comedy Store.</v>

59
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.473
<v Speaker 7>Mm hmm.</v>

60
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.040
<v Speaker 8>Wow this is exciting.</v>

61
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.970
<v Speaker 8>I want to know who it is.</v>

62
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.390
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

63
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know who the fuck it is yet.</v>

64
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.113
<v Speaker 5>I think I do.</v>

65
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.320
<v Speaker 5>If if it is I think it is he's awesome.</v>

66
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah they're the comedy stores that means 80 percent awesome.</v>

67
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.760
<v Speaker 5>You know even the 20 percent mediocre it's probably better than what you got in</v>

68
00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:23.594
<v Speaker 5>your town anyway.</v>

69
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.743
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.700
<v Speaker 4>So you're a powerful Ryan Keeley mob said All right you guys.</v>

71
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.073
<v Speaker 4>We.</v>

72
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.760
<v Speaker 4>This podcast is brought to you by Tang.</v>

73
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm so glad that when when we we pick up a podcast sponsor you're always like oh</v>

74
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.150
<v Speaker 4>what if these kinds of douche bags you know like what if that's like a big fear</v>

75
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 4>you know when you take on a sponsor because you know I'm on network I don't have</v>

76
00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:51.140
<v Speaker 4>a channel I'm just you know I'm just doing this thing and I'm trying to like</v>

77
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.300
<v Speaker 4>navigate all this stuff by myself.</v>

78
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.643
<v Speaker 10>So</v>

79
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.080
<v Speaker 10>my attitude with the whole thing was I looked and I said the most important</v>

80
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:05.081
<v Speaker 10>thing first of all is that I don't feel duty like whatever we're selling and</v>

81
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:11.891
<v Speaker 10>everybody's like then it's too late for you know for brain do she.</v>

82
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.610
<v Speaker 4>You know I just want to make sure that what we're selling is a good product.</v>

83
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 4>So I get all these emails and tweets tweets especially sometimes about talking</v>

84
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 4>about people saying how much money they're saving on Tang and guy one guy talked</v>

85
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:29.840
<v Speaker 4>about it a couple of weeks ago.</v>

86
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.423
<v Speaker 4>He wrote to me.</v>

87
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.250
<v Speaker 4>He chopped his bill down from 90 bucks to like 18.</v>

88
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how the fuck he did I know what he's doing.</v>

89
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.960
<v Speaker 4>That sound sounded completely outrageous.</v>

90
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.410
<v Speaker 7>Well my bill has been that guy about twenty five dollars a month.</v>

91
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.800
<v Speaker 7>I mean and I have to say that this is my second phone and this is you know my</v>

92
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.090
<v Speaker 7>massage parlor phone.</v>

93
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 7>Dan would you say that you use it 50 percent as much as you earlier your other</v>

94
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.990
<v Speaker 7>phone or I'd probably say my other phone I use it 50 percent more maybe it's</v>

95
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 7>maybe a little bit a little bit higher maybe 60 maybe six.</v>

96
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.790
<v Speaker 11>So probably be the equivalent of sixty dollars someone like that would you say</v>

97
00:05:01.791 --> 00:05:02.090
<v Speaker 11>that.</v>

98
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.940
<v Speaker 12>Yeah that makes sense.</v>

99
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.410
<v Speaker 7>So if that's still him it's still cheaper than then what like.</v>

101
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.340
<v Speaker 7>Right now I have you know the iPhone through AT&amp;T as my main phone and that's</v>

102
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:12.620
<v Speaker 7>about one hundred and twenty two hundred ten dollars a month.</v>

103
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.770
<v Speaker 7>You</v>

104
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.270
<v Speaker 4>know it's fucking very pricey.</v>

105
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.080
<v Speaker 4>What thing does is they first of all they use the Sprint network then have their</v>

107
00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:22.380
<v Speaker 4>own network these one of the major networks in this country one that you know</v>

113
00:05:46.671 --> 00:05:49.740
<v Speaker 4>to have one of those early Android they were dog shit.</v>

114
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.890

<v Speaker 4>like like the droids of all.</v>

123
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 4>So anyway the waiting has it set up is they have no contracts so you buy a</v>

124
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:29.460
<v Speaker 4>device set it up and go.</v>

129
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 4>from a big company like a company that's dead I mean they're not one of the</v>

130
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 4>bigger cell phone companies.</v>

131
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.490
<v Speaker 14>I mean how many cell phone companies are there actually really stop thinking</v>

132
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.500

<v Speaker 14>it's like you generally thought of it's like this it's like a rise in powerful</v>

134
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 14>AT&amp;T powerful T-Mobile you're on a budget yeah yeah.</v>

135
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 7>Right now it is it's crazy because T-Mobile as you know they're new towers are</v>

136
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 7>pretty advanced and they don't have that fucking you know bandwidth hogs that</v>

137
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 7>you know AT&amp;T and Verizon they're their bandwidth I mean so many people are on</v>

138
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 7>their network when something goes down half the people have Verizon or AT&amp;T you</v>

139
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 7>know they're not gonna have cell phone service but then you have like T-Mobile</v>

140
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:30.660
<v Speaker 7>guys they're like No I'm fine.</v>

141
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 7>That's a very good point.</v>

142
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 7>That's a very good point.</v>

143
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

144
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.690
<v Speaker 5>And Sprint is a big one.</v>

145
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 5>Joey Diaz That's him forever.</v>

146
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 5>He loved it.</v>

147
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.100
<v Speaker 5>I've never had it other than this but I've got no problems with it.</v>

148
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah and the though the whole idea behind thing is that they're just going to</v>

149
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 2>offer you a service that's you know it's just it's reasonable.</v>

150
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to get fucked over it doesn't have to be this idea that we all</v>

151
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.480
<v Speaker 2>think that every company should try to squeeze every last dollar out of every</v>

152
00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:00.314
<v Speaker 2>last customer.</v>

153
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I think that shit's stupid.</v>

154
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.370
<v Speaker 2>I think most people rise up realizing that as well.</v>

155
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.060
<v Speaker 2>So go to Rogan distinction and you can save yourself twenty five dollars off of</v>

156
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:15.281
<v Speaker 2>either a phone or service from a very cool company were also brought to you by</v>

157
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 2>square space.</v>

158
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.190
<v Speaker 2>So you have to ask yourself do you want to make a web site.</v>

159
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.390
<v Speaker 10>Bitch that's my question to you bitch.</v>

160
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.353
<v Speaker 10>Do you want make a web site.</v>

161
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.620
<v Speaker 10>And if you do let's get a real young guy learn no HMO OK.</v>

162
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.920
<v Speaker 10>You're not going to use it.</v>

163
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.890
<v Speaker 10>It's just not gonna happen.</v>

164
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.210
<v Speaker 10>Okay let's be honest.</v>

165
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.163
<v Speaker 15>Another thing</v>

166
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 15>you don't need to begin to you to really learn how to put all that shit in and</v>

167
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 15>it's gonna be all fucked up and then you gonna try to what look at it unlike</v>

168
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.580
<v Speaker 15>Windows Internet Explorer.</v>

169
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.650
<v Speaker 15>It's going to shit.</v>

170
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.640
<v Speaker 15>But look it works on safari.</v>

171
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.940
<v Speaker 16>You don't have to do that anymore.</v>

172
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.140

<v Speaker 14>It's a cool service and I've been a fan for years.</v>

269
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:33.360
<v Speaker 14>I'm a huge fan of audio books this Hardcore History has been making my life like</v>

270
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:35.130
<v Speaker 14>so much more interesting the last couple of days.</v>

271
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.930
<v Speaker 14>Like when I get in my car I'm not like thinking oh you know you get my car and</v>

272
00:13:39.931 --> 00:13:43.260
<v Speaker 14>drove and probably stuck in traffic I'm going to go all let's hear more about</v>

273
00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:43.950
<v Speaker 14>the Mongols.</v>

274
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:44.700
<v Speaker 14>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

275
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.570
<v Speaker 24>It's just Genghis Khan was a mother fucker.</v>

276
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.700
<v Speaker 24>Yeah dude King Kong killed almost 70 million people by some counts.</v>

277
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.040
<v Speaker 24>Some accounts say more than that.</v>

278
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.950
<v Speaker 24>Some accounts say but as little as 10 million.</v>

279
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.260
<v Speaker 24>Like He definitely killed 10 million.</v>

280
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.450
<v Speaker 24>God damn it's unbelievable.</v>

281
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:03.683
<v Speaker 24>That's the best.</v>

282
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.570
<v Speaker 24>They're talking about armies that were coming towards China where the Mongols</v>

283
00:14:08.571 --> 00:14:12.560
<v Speaker 24>had been and in the distance they thought they saw snow covered mountains.</v>

284
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.490
<v Speaker 24>But when they got close they realized there were mounds of bones.</v>

285
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:17.623
<v Speaker 24>Oh my God.</v>

286
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:22.750
<v Speaker 24>The Mongols had killed 10 million people in this one town they came to this</v>

287
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:27.990
<v Speaker 24>gigantic state and just killed 10 million people.</v>

288
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.110
<v Speaker 24>It was amazing.</v>

289
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.990
<v Speaker 24>I mean horrific terrifying.</v>

290
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 24>Just the idea that that at one point in time just in the twelve hundred's</v>

291
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.400
<v Speaker 24>relatively short amount of time ago there was a guy who brought a bunch of other</v>

292
00:14:43.401 --> 00:14:48.401
<v Speaker 24>dudes with him on horseback and just fucked up the whole world banded together</v>

293
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:54.890
<v Speaker 24>took hostages took the hostages pushed them to the front lines so the hostages</v>

294
00:14:54.901 --> 00:14:59.820
<v Speaker 24>would literally lead the way and people would be defending their towns having to</v>

295
00:14:59.821 --> 00:15:04.020
<v Speaker 24>shoot arrows at their own friends who had been kidnapped their own loved ones</v>

296
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.880
<v Speaker 24>their own children the Mongols were fucking terrifying.</v>

297
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:14.990
<v Speaker 25>It's terrifying to think that just a thousand years ago not even there was a</v>

298
00:15:15.661 --> 00:15:20.661
<v Speaker 25>dude who figured out a way to get hundreds of thousands of mass murderers to</v>

299
00:15:21.481 --> 00:15:22.314
<v Speaker 25>work together.</v>

300
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.200
<v Speaker 25>Hundreds of thousands of serial killers.</v>

301
00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.840
<v Speaker 25>Hundreds of thousands of brutal rapists.</v>

302
00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.700
<v Speaker 25>Hundreds of thousands of ruthless remorseless murderers.</v>

303
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.920
<v Speaker 25>And they got together on horseback.</v>

304
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.600
<v Speaker 25>It takes one convincing leader.</v>

305
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.890
<v Speaker 25>God damn Genghis Khan must have been a mother fucker because there was nobody</v>

306
00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:45.720
<v Speaker 25>like that before and nobody liked that since his sons tried to hang on to it for</v>

307
00:15:45.721 --> 00:15:47.950
<v Speaker 25>a little while but you know what.</v>

308
00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 24>The reign of power all really came through that one bad motherfucker.</v>

309
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.940
<v Speaker 15>They had a crazy saying that an armies of donkey led by a lion could conquer an</v>

310
00:16:01.621 --> 00:16:03.950
<v Speaker 15>army of lions led by a donkey.</v>

311
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 15>They were all about tactics and they would beat much larger armies with severe</v>

312
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.580
<v Speaker 15>superior strategy and cunning and just ruthlessness.</v>

313
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.650
<v Speaker 15>Just everybody was terrified of them.</v>

314
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 15>They just they killed everybody man men women children babies they didn't give a</v>

315
00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 15>fuck.</v>

316
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.280
<v Speaker 15>They killed everybody.</v>

317
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.570
<v Speaker 15>They eight people.</v>

318
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.130
<v Speaker 15>They hate each other.</v>

319
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.240
<v Speaker 15>They got too hungry.</v>

320
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.610
<v Speaker 10>They would draw straws maybe or figure out how they would figure out you know if</v>

321
00:16:30.611 --> 00:16:34.370
<v Speaker 10>someone's gonna sacrifice themselves so that the army could go on and they would</v>

322
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.530
<v Speaker 10>slaughter them and eat them and cook them.</v>

323
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.440
<v Speaker 26>Dude it's unbelievable.</v>

324
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.270
<v Speaker 26>I was only a thousand years ago.</v>

325
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.450
<v Speaker 26>What the fuck man.</v>

326
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.060
<v Speaker 27>You think it will ever anybody else ever pull that off again.</v>

327
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 24>That kind of craziness that's terrifying to wonder.</v>

328
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:55.390
<v Speaker 10>I think if you had to worry about anything it would be worry about all this</v>

329
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.550
<v Speaker 10>beautiful city shit shutting down.</v>

330
00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 10>That's the real fear.</v>

331
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:05.050
<v Speaker 10>The real fear is we have some massive disaster like a solar flare that knocks</v>

332
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:09.710
<v Speaker 10>out our power grid and our ability to pump gas is gone.</v>

333
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 10>Our ability to drive back and forth to places is gone.</v>

334
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:16.850
<v Speaker 10>Our ability to get food people's gone and then you realize how nutty we are</v>

335
00:17:16.851 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 10>spread out and how dangerous this is and how vulnerable we are living like this.</v>

336
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:26.480
<v Speaker 10>I think you would take something like that to bring people to some place where</v>

337
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:28.910
<v Speaker 10>you could get that many psychopaths all together again.</v>

338
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.320
<v Speaker 9>Yeah I think now that we have the internet if the Internet went down I think</v>

396
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.950
<v Speaker 10>electricity and it totally feels like someone's sucking your dick a helmet that</v>

00:20:25.131 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 3>illegal because they'd never get real blow jobs over again girls.</v>

402
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.340
<v Speaker 28>But just put the fucking helmet on kind of why do you want me to do this.</v>

403
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.330
<v Speaker 9>It'd be a tough situation for women if the helmet worked that well it came.</v>

404
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.950
<v Speaker 29>You think they would lose a little bit of their value.</v>

405
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.240
<v Speaker 29>Is that what you're saying.</v>

406
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.740
<v Speaker 9>Oh yeah I think I should be walking her out these helmets on helmet.</v>

407
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.420
<v Speaker 9>What's the normal thing.</v>

408
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.600
<v Speaker 19>How much time do you think it is before something like that is invented</v>

409
00:20:47.601 --> 00:20:51.890
<v Speaker 19>something that can recreate an artificial experience like almost almost exactly.</v>

410
00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.480
<v Speaker 9>I'll bet you 15 20 years.</v>

411
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.800
<v Speaker 9>I bet it's not that far away.</v>

412
00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:59.000
<v Speaker 9>The way things are moving and shaking there's probably a bigger team of</v>

413
00:20:59.001 --> 00:21:01.910
<v Speaker 9>scientists on that right now than there is on cancer research.</v>

414
00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:02.770
<v Speaker 30>You're right.</v>

415
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.310
<v Speaker 30>Everybody is building the helmet.</v>

416
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:10.080
<v Speaker 31>Everybody wants to get their dicks sucked and then wrote on it.</v>

417
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.870
<v Speaker 11>Thought Tom Ford slashed Joe.</v>

418
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.100
<v Speaker 11>Cue the music Brian.</v>

419
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.630
<v Speaker 11>Let's get this bitch started.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's the song.</v>

426
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.140
<v Speaker 5>That's the powerful Tony Hinchcliffe song.</v>

427
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.010
<v Speaker 5>I say it like that.</v>

428
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:37.873
<v Speaker 5>I sing like a woman.</v>

429
00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:38.510

<v Speaker 18>That's right.</v>

447
00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.480
<v Speaker 10>Tony is an up and coming young standup.</v>

448
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.390
<v Speaker 10>I love one of my favorite things in life for real.</v>

449
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:22.570
<v Speaker 10>This really is absolutely true is when I don't know about someone and then I</v>

450
00:22:22.671 --> 00:22:23.870
<v Speaker 10>find out that they're funny.</v>

451
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.570
<v Speaker 10>Like when I found out about it from Brian.</v>

452
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.890
<v Speaker 10>Brian told me about you.</v>

453
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:33.790
<v Speaker 10>And as a comedian like one of things that every comedian always loves is seeing</v>

454
00:22:34.131 --> 00:22:35.760
<v Speaker 10>a new comedian like some.</v>

455
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.680
<v Speaker 10>Someone who knew who's funny like does another one say oh there's another one</v>

456
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.210
<v Speaker 10>you know and different styles and different you know different takes but when</v>

457
00:22:44.211 --> 00:22:46.880
<v Speaker 10>they're funny like it's really it gives you a lot of hope.</v>

458
00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.070
<v Speaker 10>And I was I was in L.A.</v>

459
00:22:49.071 --> 00:22:53.600
<v Speaker 10>the entire time like you started comedy and you know and then started getting a</v>

460
00:22:53.601 --> 00:22:54.740
<v Speaker 10>little a name for yourself.</v>

461
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.460
<v Speaker 10>And then eventually got to the point where you're you know regularly doing you</v>

462
00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:01.390
<v Speaker 10>know podcasts and comedy clubs and yeah.</v>

463
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.230
<v Speaker 10>So that's that's a really cool thing to say.</v>

464
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.390
<v Speaker 10>Yeah it's really so much fun.</v>

465
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:06.950
<v Speaker 10>Pretty incredible.</v>

466
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.270
<v Speaker 10>So few people pull it off.</v>

467
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:12.860
<v Speaker 10>You know I love watching somebody who comes through like some new person is</v>

468
00:23:12.861 --> 00:23:13.450
<v Speaker 10>funny.</v>

469
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.450
<v Speaker 9>It's like because we to all the class thing and like you said everybody's a</v>

470
00:23:17.451 --> 00:23:18.340
<v Speaker 9>little bit different.</v>

471
00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.930
<v Speaker 9>Everybody has their you know their take on things.</v>

472
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.530
<v Speaker 9>But when you find one there's nothing cooler it's sort of like when you love</v>

473
00:23:24.531 --> 00:23:27.680
<v Speaker 9>comedy it's like watching a baby being born like just like that.</v>

474
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.753
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>

475
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.330
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

476
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.670
<v Speaker 9>Larson's hilarious and when.</v>

477
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:36.690
<v Speaker 2>You know like you when you run into someone and you you realize that you know</v>

478
00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:41.720
<v Speaker 2>they started out sucky and you probably saw them in like those during those</v>

479
00:23:41.721 --> 00:23:42.650
<v Speaker 2>first couple of months.</v>

480
00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.270
<v Speaker 2>And then within a couple of years they become competent and then boom they</v>

481
00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:50.940
<v Speaker 2>become really good and they like like Ari is my favorite example.</v>

482
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

483
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.430
<v Speaker 2>I was there when Ari first got on stage like one of his first sets one of the</v>

484
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.283
<v Speaker 2>earliest sets.</v>

485
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:03.070
<v Speaker 2>And you know I've watched him become like a real killer like Ari Shapiro is like</v>

486
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:03.914
<v Speaker 2>a real killer.</v>

487
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.730
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

488
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Tom Seger is party of day top scorer had a benefit rather for his doggy.</v>

489
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.583
<v Speaker 2>He got a sick dog.</v>

490
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.850
<v Speaker 2>If you if you love dogs you love Tom Segura.</v>

491
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you would donate.</v>

492
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.830
<v Speaker 36>I think they have like a paper out there so don't go to your mom's house podcast</v>

493
00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.890
<v Speaker 36>on your mom's house podcast dot com.</v>

494
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.300
<v Speaker 10>Tom Sawyer is just one of the coolest guys ever.</v>

495
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.810
<v Speaker 10>And he had the show and Ari went up and fucking destroyed destroyed with a bunch</v>

496
00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:34.820
<v Speaker 10>of shit that I hadn't heard before to those couple bits that were really funny</v>

497
00:24:34.821 --> 00:24:35.510
<v Speaker 10>that were new.</v>

498
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.790
<v Speaker 10>He writes like a machine.</v>

499
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.090
<v Speaker 10>Yeah he's awesome.</v>

500
00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:38.690
<v Speaker 10>He's isn't here.</v>

501
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.460
<v Speaker 10>He's just coming up with so much content.</v>

502
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.090
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

503
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:46.090
<v Speaker 10>I think he also realizes at this time that he's like you know he's again he's</v>

504
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:47.114
<v Speaker 10>like a real comic now.</v>

505
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.740
<v Speaker 10>Now it's just a matter of doing the work.</v>

506
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.160
<v Speaker 10>And he's a smart dude you know he knows how to he knows how to put it down.</v>

507
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:57.190
<v Speaker 10>He knows what needs to be done and he can go get it done just as as a fan of</v>

508
00:24:57.531 --> 00:24:58.280
<v Speaker 10>comics.</v>

509
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.260
<v Speaker 10>It's so cool and someone pops up.</v>

510
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.920
<v Speaker 9>There's another one I got really lucky with Ari because he was the first person</v>

511
00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:08.960
<v Speaker 9>I asked me to do a gig with him and Sam Tripoli.</v>

512
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.950
<v Speaker 9>So was those two guys all of a sudden all at once I went to La Hoya with Sam</v>

513
00:25:12.951 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 9>first and then did a gig and like Irvine with Ari.</v>

514
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:16.993
<v Speaker 9>What year was this.</v>

515
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 9>This is about 2008.</v>

516
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.410
<v Speaker 9>That's so recently.</v>

517
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.560
<v Speaker 37>That's awesome.</v>

518
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:29.170
<v Speaker 9>Five years I don't think of it as being recently but you know there was like a</v>

519
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:33.960
<v Speaker 9>year or so that I was doing it before you even get a road gig like that you're</v>

520
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:34.820
<v Speaker 9>just building it.</v>

521
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.780
<v Speaker 9>I was you know just riding my bicycle from open mike to open mike.</v>

522
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.210
<v Speaker 4>How many guys that started out with you.</v>

523
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.920
<v Speaker 19>You know we all have like kind of like groups of people that we sort of start</v>

524
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:49.760
<v Speaker 19>off around a similar time and then you watch each other either fall off or give</v>

525
00:25:49.761 --> 00:25:51.950
<v Speaker 19>up or are some people get through the net.</v>

526
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:57.320
<v Speaker 19>How many people that with your class do you think got through with my true</v>

527
00:25:57.321 --> 00:25:57.770
<v Speaker 19>class.</v>

528
00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.700
<v Speaker 9>I'd probably say about good.</v>

529
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.190
<v Speaker 9>It's a tough one because we're still pulling you know and I mean you still don't</v>

530
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:07.520
<v Speaker 9>know who can make like a bit throw a right hook right at the end before they</v>

531
00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:10.820
<v Speaker 9>drop out and have a new 15 minutes the crushes and it's a breakthrough.</v>

532
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 9>But I probably guess about seven or ten right around there.</v>

533
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:15.590
<v Speaker 9>That's a good number.</v>

534
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:19.460
<v Speaker 9>Like still doing I mean you know I'm counting my original starting classes like</v>

535
00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:24.461
<v Speaker 9>a good you know 60 70 80 90 right people because I know the I mean I stayed in</v>

536
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.380
<v Speaker 9>Hollywood and built in Hollywood like Los Angeles because I feel like a lot of</v>

537
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:33.080
<v Speaker 9>people start somewhere and then come to L.A.</v>

538
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:34.110
<v Speaker 9>I'm like You know what I'm going to.</v>

539
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:40.060
<v Speaker 9>I wanted to just have a like an NBA style perspective like Chappelle once said</v>

540
00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:44.870
<v Speaker 9>and he was doing a spot on stage one night and the LR really late crushing</v>

541
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.110
<v Speaker 9>making it look like I mean it was just unbelievable.</v>

542
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.190
<v Speaker 9>And the three or four hours and he goes the back Laramie goes hey how many guys</v>

543
00:26:52.191 --> 00:26:52.521
<v Speaker 9>are L.A.</v>

544
00:26:52.521 --> 00:26:54.090
<v Speaker 9>comics and a lot of people clapping.</v>

545
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:59.210
<v Speaker 9>But how many of you are like work here at the Comedy Store and started here at</v>

546
00:26:59.211 --> 00:27:00.080
<v Speaker 9>the Comedy Store.</v>

547
00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.570
<v Speaker 9>That was just two or three of us that clap.</v>

548
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.550
<v Speaker 9>He goes You guys are insane.</v>

549
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.160
<v Speaker 9>He's performing to a lot of comedians right.</v>

550
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.870
<v Speaker 9>So the thing with him coming back a few years ago was like the audience that got</v>

551
00:27:11.871 --> 00:27:15.870
<v Speaker 9>to be there was there but the back of the room filled up to the gills.</v>

552
00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.813
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

553
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.050
<v Speaker 9>And he said that it's like learning how to dribble in the NBA starting comedy at</v>

554
00:27:21.051 --> 00:27:21.890
<v Speaker 9>the Comedy Store.</v>

555
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.420
<v Speaker 9>And it's so true.</v>

556
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.870
<v Speaker 9>But but if you think about that start learning how to dribble in the NBA and</v>

557
00:27:26.871 --> 00:27:31.010
<v Speaker 9>you're you and you're just used to the motion of a thousand miles an hour.</v>

558
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.380
<v Speaker 9>Yeah then that works out.</v>

559
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:35.750
<v Speaker 11>I think it's like anything else.</v>

560
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:40.810
<v Speaker 11>You know it's a more difficult but also more rewarding pursuit pursuit.</v>

561
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:46.280
<v Speaker 14>You know you can take an easy route through life or you can you know I mean it's</v>

562
00:27:46.281 --> 00:27:47.690
<v Speaker 14>not as hard as being a Navy SEAL.</v>

563
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.900
<v Speaker 14>Let's be honest you know even though doing comedy is hard and a lot of people</v>

564
00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:54.860
<v Speaker 14>don't ever figured out it's not nearly as hard as doing something you hate and</v>

565
00:27:54.861 --> 00:27:59.210
<v Speaker 14>being stuck working 40 hours a week at this job for the rest of your life until</v>

566
00:27:59.211 --> 00:28:01.790
<v Speaker 14>your heart stops beating because you have no passion right.</v>

567
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.540
<v Speaker 9>And I mean it was a real struggle for a few years I really threw myself to the</v>

568
00:28:05.541 --> 00:28:05.930
<v Speaker 9>wolves.</v>

569
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.780
<v Speaker 9>I didn't have sure I didn't have money saved up.</v>

570
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.800
<v Speaker 9>I was just I was just doing it and then I got the job working at the Comedy</v>

571
00:28:12.801 --> 00:28:14.510
<v Speaker 9>Store a couple of months and like as a door guy.</v>

572
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.420
<v Speaker 9>So I started getting spots a lot there which is what I wanted.</v>

573
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.600
<v Speaker 10>You know the problem the story like yours is that it worked.</v>

574
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.460
<v Speaker 10>So there's a lot of the dudes out there that will try that same thing but</v>

575
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.380
<v Speaker 10>they're not fucking funny at all.</v>

576
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.890
<v Speaker 9>You know what's tough is it is I noticed that a lot a lot of people come up to</v>

577
00:28:30.891 --> 00:28:33.230
<v Speaker 9>me and say I'm thinking about starting standup Tony.</v>

578
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:38.240
<v Speaker 9>You know what do you what do you think and sometimes they don't they just</v>

579
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.660
<v Speaker 9>sometimes I wonder out of all the times I get asked this from somebody that</v>

580
00:28:41.661 --> 00:28:46.661
<v Speaker 9>wants to start standup it's like you have to really have a crazy mind ingrained</v>

581
00:28:46.731 --> 00:28:48.920
<v Speaker 9>in you it's not something you start and learn like.</v>

582
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.480
<v Speaker 9>I was in trouble.</v>

583
00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:57.810
<v Speaker 9>Every class in school not once a day at school like every class every teacher</v>

584
00:28:58.751 --> 00:28:59.110
<v Speaker 9>hated me.</v>

585
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:03.040
<v Speaker 9>I never touched and I was never like spilled milk on somebody I never did</v>

586
00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:06.520
<v Speaker 9>anything physical but verbally I was just.</v>

587
00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:11.200
<v Speaker 9>It's the it's what I did is pretty crazy.</v>

588
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:16.120
<v Speaker 9>And I mean you know like so you just always talk to Russia totally to the</v>

589
00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:17.800
<v Speaker 9>extreme all the time.</v>

590
00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.390
<v Speaker 9>And that's that's like Kid energy you know I'm talking about the fun even now.</v>

591
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.880
<v Speaker 9>Now I'm like I'll even.</v>

592
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:27.790
<v Speaker 9>I'm still young it's like I'm not half of the quick wit that I used to be before</v>

593
00:29:27.791 --> 00:29:32.740
<v Speaker 9>I realized I wasn't now I overthinking is a defense thing you learned it from</v>

594
00:29:32.741 --> 00:29:35.270
<v Speaker 9>your parents like I learned of you Dad.</v>

595
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:39.340
<v Speaker 9>It's really an interesting situation is the way I raised I was raised with so</v>

596
00:29:39.341 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Speaker 9>weird that I know it has something to do with that because I have these four</v>

597
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:46.540
<v Speaker 9>older brothers and sisters that are much older than me.</v>

598
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 9>So it's like I mean it's 12 years between me and my closest sibling and they're</v>

599
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:51.880
<v Speaker 9>all much older.</v>

600
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.340
<v Speaker 15>Oh wow yeah.</v>

601
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:58.430
<v Speaker 15>So you probably exposed to like they probably give you a hard time and pretty</v>

602
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Speaker 15>fucked with you really they were absolutely all super cool.</v>

603
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.580
<v Speaker 9>They were actually super cool.</v>

604
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.670
<v Speaker 9>That's how I and that's sometimes I wonder how it didn't end up like that.</v>

605
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.970
<v Speaker 9>I mean there were times you know there was the old you know you were adopted.</v>

606
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.870
<v Speaker 9>Why do you think you're.</v>

607
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:11.880
<v Speaker 10>Well you know what.</v>

608
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.560
<v Speaker 10>When they're 12 years apart I don't think you're actually going to get them</v>

609
00:30:14.561 --> 00:30:17.680
<v Speaker 10>because they're gonna be sweet to you you're like happy for a little brother and</v>

610
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 10>sister.</v>

611
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 10>It's when you two years apart you know.</v>

612
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.070
<v Speaker 10>Yeah I've I've known a lot of brothers beat the fuck out of each other.</v>

613
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.990
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

614
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.570
<v Speaker 9>Obviously that album Luckily with the age gap like they were in college when I</v>

615
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:30.430
<v Speaker 9>was you know in kindergarten and stuff.</v>

616
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.820
<v Speaker 9>What was interesting about that is I definitely think it played a role because I</v>

617
00:30:33.821 --> 00:30:38.650
<v Speaker 9>was hanging out with 20 year olds when I was a little kid and they probably</v>

618
00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:40.690
<v Speaker 9>thought I was really funny when you talk shit too.</v>

619
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.670
<v Speaker 9>Totally.</v>

620
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.640
<v Speaker 9>This whole thing.</v>

621
00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.450
<v Speaker 30>That's what I would do I would talk shit and I would put on terrible magic shows</v>

622
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:50.940
<v Speaker 30>in which the whole ongoing joke was that you can clearly see you know I had not</v>

623
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.450
<v Speaker 30>seen comedian magicians right yet.</v>

624
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:58.000
<v Speaker 30>I was just trying to do magic but I was bad at it but I could just the way I</v>

625
00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:02.590
<v Speaker 30>like that and well it started I had to get good at doing it on purpose because</v>

626
00:31:02.591 --> 00:31:06.040
<v Speaker 30>it was happening accidentally and I would just try to follow through with it.</v>

627
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.120
<v Speaker 30>So you started off trying to be good.</v>

628
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:09.463
<v Speaker 38>Yeah</v>

629
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:11.950
<v Speaker 38>right.</v>

630
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.920
<v Speaker 38>But then I just got good at being that magic.</v>

631
00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:19.180
<v Speaker 11>Yeah it's a funny thing when you see someone who grew up like in a weird spot</v>

632
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:19.960
<v Speaker 11>like that.</v>

633
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.170
<v Speaker 11>I think all of us like every comic I know grew up in some sort of a weird</v>

634
00:31:23.171 --> 00:31:27.590
<v Speaker 11>situation where some basic need wasn't fulfilled.</v>

635
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.550
<v Speaker 11>So that creates like this weird personality.</v>

636
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.413
<v Speaker 11>Totally.</v>

637
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.740
<v Speaker 10>I even though I love comics when that when it doesn't create that weird</v>

638
00:31:35.741 --> 00:31:40.300
<v Speaker 10>personality it just creates fucked up people you know like if you don't put it</v>

639
00:31:40.301 --> 00:31:44.830
<v Speaker 10>to use like creating something that weird energy that comes out of a weird life.</v>

640
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 10>If you did that shit will haunt you like that can that can wreck your life if</v>

641
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:53.920
<v Speaker 10>you're one of those really creative people or more impulsive people and doesn't</v>

642
00:31:53.921 --> 00:31:56.590
<v Speaker 10>do anything about it don't doesn't focus in on something yeah.</v>

643
00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.700
<v Speaker 38>And it's just that's an interesting point because with me I didn't have any</v>

644
00:32:00.701 --> 00:32:05.701
<v Speaker 38>creative outlet until like after high school because the theater woman always</v>

645
00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:08.080
<v Speaker 38>wanted me to join theater.</v>

646
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.330
<v Speaker 38>Yeah but I never did.</v>

647
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 38>And I mean the only outlet other than doing it in front of people all the time</v>

648
00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:18.070
<v Speaker 38>and just you know being me I had nothing.</v>

649
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.100
<v Speaker 38>So then I spent a few years like what am I.</v>

650
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:22.510
<v Speaker 38>Because you don't know</v>

651
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:29.530
<v Speaker 38>if you're just a kid that loves making people laugh that you can be a standup</v>

652
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.393
<v Speaker 38>comedian right.</v>

653
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:35.480
<v Speaker 38>When you're in Ohio there's no people in L.A.</v>

654
00:32:35.481 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 38>are really lucky or in New York around those areas because there's comedy there</v>

655
00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:42.920
<v Speaker 38>at least you can stumble across a comedy club and go and wonder what's going on</v>

656
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:43.100
<v Speaker 38>there.</v>

657
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 38>I might go in there tonight just one time.</v>

658
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 38>First time I was ever at a comedy club was at the Comedy Store and I had signed</v>

659
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:52.330
<v Speaker 38>up for the open mike and gotten on.</v>

660
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 38>So it's very grandiose.</v>

661
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.450
<v Speaker 38>I mean you know it's like my heart was beating out of my chest.</v>

662
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.920
<v Speaker 38>I knew that it was something I was gonna be doing forever no matter what how you</v>

663
00:32:59.921 --> 00:33:00.540
<v Speaker 38>knew it.</v>

664
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.920
<v Speaker 20>You know it was something I definitely didn't know the first time I went on</v>

665
00:33:04.921 --> 00:33:05.754
<v Speaker 20>stage</v>

666
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.270
<v Speaker 20>I was I was scared shitless to the waist.</v>

667
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:10.560
<v Speaker 20>More scared than I thought I was going to be.</v>

668
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.350
<v Speaker 9>Oh I never I It is unbelievable.</v>

669
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.330
<v Speaker 9>It is so creepy because what ended up happening was is I've blanked out and</v>

670
00:33:18.331 --> 00:33:22.740
<v Speaker 9>forgot everything that I'd been and that was the one time that I was I had a</v>

671
00:33:22.741 --> 00:33:25.410
<v Speaker 9>couple months to prepare for three minutes.</v>

672
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.270
<v Speaker 31>Did you bring notes on stage with you.</v>

673
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.010
<v Speaker 38>No I never liked.</v>

674
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.220
<v Speaker 38>I've never liked having notes onstage with me.</v>

675
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:34.290
<v Speaker 10>That was a big thing man getting rid of your notes.</v>

676
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.940
<v Speaker 10>I was a big thing back in the day.</v>

677
00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.350
<v Speaker 10>Going on stage with notes still.</v>

678
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.130
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

679
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.920
<v Speaker 10>Because in the beginning I definitely went on stage with notes when I first</v>

680
00:33:40.921 --> 00:33:44.490
<v Speaker 10>started doing it but I saw like really good guys go on stage with notes when</v>

681
00:33:44.491 --> 00:33:45.570
<v Speaker 10>they were working on new shit.</v>

682
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.180
<v Speaker 10>Yeah it became like part of the act that they let you know they were trying</v>

683
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.840
<v Speaker 10>stuff out by looking down at the paper.</v>

684
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.020
<v Speaker 10>But you try to do the first one free ball.</v>

685
00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.860
<v Speaker 38>Yeah like really bad in a I somehow was just digging myself out by calling out</v>

686
00:34:03.721 --> 00:34:05.220
<v Speaker 38>how terrible it was.</v>

687
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.830
<v Speaker 38>I just I was basically saying Wow I just blanked out.</v>

688
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:13.050
<v Speaker 38>And I've been getting ready for this for so long and so I just ended up doing</v>

689
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:16.740
<v Speaker 38>what actually ended up sort of becoming my style which is like calling out</v>

690
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.300
<v Speaker 38>whatever's happening in the room except I was just joking about me bombing.</v>

691
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.980
<v Speaker 10>You kind of have to call out what's happened in the room right.</v>

692
00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:25.790
<v Speaker 10>Oh yeah.</v>

693
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.110
<v Speaker 10>And that's that's one.</v>

694
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:31.550
<v Speaker 10>Another good thing rather that the comedy store provides no crowd control.</v>

695
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.540
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

696
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:33.373
<v Speaker 10>None.</v>

697
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.250
<v Speaker 10>That place is madness.</v>

698
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:37.070
<v Speaker 10>There's something I could be madness.</v>

699
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.490
<v Speaker 38>That's why I like it was so modern.</v>

700
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.370
<v Speaker 38>Anything can happen at the Comedy Store.</v>

701
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.750
<v Speaker 38>So like for example like when we did that show in Indianapolis and I came out</v>

702
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.700
<v Speaker 38>and I'm looking at the masses of people but the first thing that I notice to my</v>

703
00:34:49.701 --> 00:34:54.701
<v Speaker 38>left is this lady lit up next to the stage that's doing sign language to the to</v>

704
00:34:56.091 --> 00:34:56.924
<v Speaker 38>the audience.</v>

705
00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.800
<v Speaker 38>And I just couldn't help but the start like I always say you know it started</v>

706
00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:03.450
<v Speaker 38>just with I've never performed in front of one of these people before.</v>

707
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:04.810
<v Speaker 38>I've always wondered what that would be like.</v>

708
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.430
<v Speaker 38>And I'm noticing that she has to keep up with everything that I'm saying.</v>

709
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:13.300
<v Speaker 38>So like I went off on this whole run about it that it's just so much fun for me</v>

710
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:18.460
<v Speaker 38>and I could trust my instinct and just keep going with it because I even though</v>

711
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.660
<v Speaker 38>like I wouldn't have known to do that if I was just trying to just put on like</v>

712
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:24.470
<v Speaker 38>an act.</v>

713
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.790
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

714
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:25.550
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

715
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

716
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 9>Which is also great.</v>

717
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.470
<v Speaker 9>But I got to go off on a run there and I could trust that instinct you know by</v>

718
00:35:30.471 --> 00:35:33.770
<v Speaker 9>the end I have her doing blow job motions to her face because I realized that if</v>

719
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:38.660
<v Speaker 9>I said the word blow job she has to do that jerk off that is on her face or off</v>

720
00:35:38.661 --> 00:35:41.000
<v Speaker 9>on the face is the that's the sign language for that.</v>

721
00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.050
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

722
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.720
<v Speaker 9>This is blow job or at least that's what she was doing.</v>

723
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.950
<v Speaker 10>Actually was he because they switched halfway through the whole thing but they</v>

724
00:35:48.951 --> 00:35:53.540
<v Speaker 10>switched the trick was like enough tone handling so I think so I just quit.</v>

725
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.870
<v Speaker 10>I don't I don't know what happened how did you have a backup so close that you</v>

726
00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:01.760
<v Speaker 10>they get tired I guess so signing maybe you need like really good hand cardio</v>

727
00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.160
<v Speaker 10>but not being crazy.</v>

728
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.350
<v Speaker 9>I had you know crazy a ton of tweets.</v>

729
00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.280
<v Speaker 9>Indianapolis was so much fun and everybody was like hash tagging sign language</v>

730
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.500
<v Speaker 9>because I couldn't even believe what was going on.</v>

731
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:17.890
<v Speaker 17>Yeah I did that once in San Francisco a guy brought his own remember that.</v>

732
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 17>Yeah.</v>

733
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.700
<v Speaker 17>And he sat right in the front.</v>

734
00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:20.180
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

735
00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.360
<v Speaker 10>Guy brought his own sign person.</v>

736
00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.470
<v Speaker 10>I was like wow that's pretty gangster.</v>

737
00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:25.450
<v Speaker 10>Guy was deaf.</v>

738
00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:29.830
<v Speaker 10>You want to go see some comedies like I'm tell you they're saying Yeah you look</v>

739
00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.850
<v Speaker 10>really nice guys.</v>

740
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:31.850
<v Speaker 10>That was a fun show.</v>

741
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:32.810
<v Speaker 10>He did.</v>

742
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:36.020
<v Speaker 39>I forget what he did because it was a I was obviously timing things he didn't</v>

743
00:36:36.021 --> 00:36:36.854
<v Speaker 39>talk.</v>

744
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.060
<v Speaker 39>It was really funny.</v>

745
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.410
<v Speaker 39>It was really funny like you could tell the guy like really enjoyed standup</v>

746
00:36:42.411 --> 00:36:43.130
<v Speaker 39>comedy.</v>

747
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.900
<v Speaker 39>And even though he was deaf he still understood.</v>

748
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.843
<v Speaker 39>Like what.</v>

749
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:48.440
<v Speaker 39>You know he understood jokes.</v>

750
00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.950
<v Speaker 39>It's got to be weird because he's only getting it like two dimensional.</v>

751
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:53.090
<v Speaker 39>Right.</v>

752
00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:54.420
<v Speaker 39>You don't if you don't hear it.</v>

753
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.360
<v Speaker 39>Yeah man you're missing so much.</v>

754
00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.380
<v Speaker 17>Like there's a lot of guys like Joey Díaz perfect example of you half of what's</v>

755
00:37:00.381 --> 00:37:05.381
<v Speaker 17>funny is how he sounds like you know the way sounds is the fucking intensity of</v>

756
00:37:06.411 --> 00:37:07.244
<v Speaker 17>his voice.</v>

757
00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.640
<v Speaker 10>Well it's like when he when he hits those six when he starts screaming about</v>

758
00:37:10.641 --> 00:37:15.641
<v Speaker 10>something like he was screaming about it's blue cheese with buffalo wings or go</v>

759
00:37:16.731 --> 00:37:19.550
<v Speaker 10>fuck your mother it was just fucking ranch dressing.</v>

760
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:24.560
<v Speaker 10>He went on his rant about ranch dressing and on paper it's like there's nothing</v>

761
00:37:24.561 --> 00:37:25.700
<v Speaker 10>funny about that at all.</v>

762
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.940
<v Speaker 10>But if you hear him if you hear Joe and you see him do it.</v>

763
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Speaker 10>It was one of the finest fucking things I've seen with other passion the arms</v>

764
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:37.370
<v Speaker 10>from deep but I mean maybe this guy had like a deep sense of his own timing.</v>

765
00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.510
<v Speaker 19>You know he can interpret it in the finest way because he was obviously a fan of</v>

766
00:37:41.511 --> 00:37:44.030
<v Speaker 19>stand up comedy enough to hire his own sign language person.</v>

767
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:48.710
<v Speaker 19>Yeah I've been at a college show once were they they made them have a sign</v>

768
00:37:48.711 --> 00:37:50.510
<v Speaker 19>language it was like a part of the rules.</v>

769
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.470
<v Speaker 19>Like if someone spoke they had to have someone there.</v>

770
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.050
<v Speaker 19>That's a I was wondered how complicated is that sign language.</v>

771
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:02.850
<v Speaker 9>I mean it seems like it seemed really I was watching some parts of it because at</v>

772
00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:07.030
<v Speaker 9>one point when you were on I walked around and sort of was watching from the</v>

773
00:38:07.031 --> 00:38:12.031
<v Speaker 9>side ledge area and I noticed that when you said the word at one point polite</v>

774
00:38:12.571 --> 00:38:17.571
<v Speaker 9>cock this guy had to do this thing where it was this giant like right.</v>

775
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.370
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the strap on bit.</v>

776
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.030
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

777
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.380
<v Speaker 9>Well it was it was something.</v>

778
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.790
<v Speaker 9>It was when you were taking questions at the end it was like you were talking</v>

779
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.790
<v Speaker 9>about Dennis Rodman's cock or something like that.</v>

780
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 40>He was like oh very improvised.</v>

781
00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:36.520
<v Speaker 40>Oh the Kim Jong Il thing I was noticing this guy has to do this thing like that</v>

782
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 40>black cock and sign language.</v>

783
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:39.123
<v Speaker 40>Is this.</v>

784
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:44.240
<v Speaker 40>It's like so stereotypical like it's just giant and his hands were so far apart</v>

785
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:48.020
<v Speaker 40>it is like he was describing a tree stump or something like that.</v>

786
00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.240
<v Speaker 40>Like this hand climbing.</v>

787
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.710
<v Speaker 40>I'm like that's black cock and sign language.</v>

788
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 22>Isn't that hilarious.</v>

789
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 22>That's what they would come up with.</v>

790
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:55.953
<v Speaker 22>That's the move.</v>

791
00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:58.410
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

792
00:38:58.410 --> 00:38:59.790
<v Speaker 12>So blow job is this.</v>

793
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.110
<v Speaker 12>I don't know why it's down.</v>

794
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.980
<v Speaker 12>Why does it go down.</v>

795
00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.970
<v Speaker 12>It seems that you're always on your knees.</v>

796
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.790
<v Speaker 12>But that's an awkward angle tells us to do your blog.</v>

797
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.860
<v Speaker 12>That is why it would be I see a blond giant.</v>

798
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Like a child made sign me.</v>

799
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.440

<v Speaker 36>Oh what's that Morton's Steakhouse is a wonderful place.</v>

857
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.530
<v Speaker 35>Yeah I love it and I was just in that it was the only place near me that had</v>

858
00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:44.640
<v Speaker 35>crab legs and it cause I was just since Vegas I've been thinking about those</v>

859
00:41:44.641 --> 00:41:49.641
<v Speaker 35>crab legs from Vegas and I'm 9 yeah from 9 which is most amazing place ever so I</v>

860
00:41:50.011 --> 00:41:54.570
<v Speaker 35>went there to get on and a half pound was sixty like sixty five dollars and I</v>

861
00:41:54.571 --> 00:41:55.730
<v Speaker 35>was like That's a lot.</v>

862
00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:56.603
<v Speaker 35>You get a lot.</v>

863
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:58.330
<v Speaker 35>Four legs is what it was.</v>

864
00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.160
<v Speaker 10>But did you watch that show with the dudes die.</v>

865
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:01.890
<v Speaker 10>Get on those fucking crab boats.</v>

866
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:02.700
<v Speaker 10>No I didn't.</v>

867
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.090
<v Speaker 10>That's that's why it's so much it's because it's really hard to get.</v>

868
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:07.960
<v Speaker 10>That's what world Deadliest Catch with.</v>

869
00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.370
<v Speaker 35>This is what I was getting at.</v>

870
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.160
<v Speaker 35>Then the two days later I was thinking like that didn't I want wanted more.</v>

871
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:14.480
<v Speaker 35>Know I wanted to eat right.</v>

872
00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:14.890
<v Speaker 35>Right.</v>

873
00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:15.150
<v Speaker 35>Right.</v>

874
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.810
<v Speaker 35>You know what I mean.</v>

875
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.680
<v Speaker 35>So then I went to Olive Garden and they had a weight.</v>

876
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:22.560
<v Speaker 35>So I went to the place next door and stay which is like Outback Steakhouse and</v>

877
00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:27.561
<v Speaker 35>they had them there and they they had a pound for 40 dollars and then you can</v>

878
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.450
<v Speaker 35>add another half pound for 15 bucks.</v>

879
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.210
<v Speaker 35>So I cut a pound and a half for the fries and it tasted pretty much exactly the</v>

880
00:42:35.211 --> 00:42:35.820
<v Speaker 35>same.</v>

881
00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.450
<v Speaker 35>You could tell that it came out like when you pulled it out it was like a little</v>

882
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.620
<v Speaker 35>sweet little harder.</v>

883
00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.160
<v Speaker 35>I guess.</v>

884
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.230
<v Speaker 35>Nice buttery mushy as the plate but still tastes exactly the same.</v>

885
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.720
<v Speaker 18>So you think they just overcooked it.</v>

886
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:47.430
<v Speaker 18>Maybe.</v>

887
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.570
<v Speaker 18>I think they're frozen obviously you know that you could try to tell they did</v>

888
00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:53.580
<v Speaker 18>well I think they're all frozen quite honestly because they're coming from</v>

889
00:42:53.581 --> 00:42:54.370
<v Speaker 18>Alaska.</v>

890
00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.760
<v Speaker 18>Well I was thinking that's why when the morning sucks I was like Oh that place</v>

891
00:42:56.761 --> 00:42:57.360
<v Speaker 18>probably gets it.</v>

892
00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:57.960
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>

893
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.010
<v Speaker 10>Well they just know how to fucking do everything right.</v>

894
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:03.700
<v Speaker 10>There's certain places like you know Morton's there's that other one Flemings</v>

895
00:43:03.701 --> 00:43:04.670
<v Speaker 10>you ever heard of Flemings.</v>

896
00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:05.130
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

897
00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.260
<v Speaker 10>There's a whole chain of those things they just know what the fuck they're</v>

898
00:43:07.261 --> 00:43:07.530
<v Speaker 10>doing.</v>

899
00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:10.160
<v Speaker 9>You know they sexually work at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.</v>

900
00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.123
<v Speaker 10>Wait a minute hold on a second.</v>

901
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.240
<v Speaker 10>I.</v>

902
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:17.240
<v Speaker 10>I know what you said but I thought I sexually worked at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.</v>

903
00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:18.540
<v Speaker 10>That's why I heard you say</v>

904
00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.650
<v Speaker 10>that stuff.</v>

905
00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:22.650
<v Speaker 18>I was like.</v>

906
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:24.300
<v Speaker 18>I mean what the fuck did he say.</v>

907
00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:29.690
<v Speaker 17>And that places and then I realized there was a slurring or a I used actually I</v>

908
00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:31.230
<v Speaker 17>sexually.</v>

909
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 17>So I say I used to actually sing as well you know if you ever heard someone</v>

910
00:43:37.201 --> 00:43:41.700
<v Speaker 17>speak in another language and there was a little there's they're just rattling</v>

911
00:43:41.701 --> 00:43:44.570
<v Speaker 17>off and you if you don't know what they're saying you could never discern that</v>

912
00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 17>there's more than one word going on that you don't know when one stops at</v>

913
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.570
<v Speaker 17>another one ends.</v>

914
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:52.620
<v Speaker 17>That was a classic example that I used to actually you know that's what does</v>

915
00:43:52.621 --> 00:43:52.950
<v Speaker 17>that.</v>

916
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:53.910
<v Speaker 10>That's not a word.</v>

917
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.110
<v Speaker 10>It's like a Jeff Dunham bit or something.</v>

918
00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:58.770
<v Speaker 10>No not Jeff Dunham.</v>

919
00:43:58.860 --> 00:43:59.693
<v Speaker 10>What's his name.</v>

920
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.970
<v Speaker 10>I might be a redneck guy Fox or Foxworthy.</v>

921
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:07.680
<v Speaker 10>Jeff Foxworthy doesn't have a dad like dark here like like things he would write</v>

922
00:44:07.681 --> 00:44:11.860
<v Speaker 10>down like D G E 80s DG.</v>

924
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:18.630
<v Speaker 34>Like you know there is like red and a redneck vocabulary.</v>

925
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.240
<v Speaker 10>Have you ever seen that show Swamp People.</v>

964
00:46:05.501 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 43>picture though because it has it all and all together.</v>

965
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.510
<v Speaker 43>What the fuck man.</v>

966
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.760
<v Speaker 19>No one knows what any motive yet.</v>

967
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:16.320
<v Speaker 19>Where we're at now in the news.</v>

968
00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:21.160
<v Speaker 2>It's all purely speculation because the brother's dead and the youngest brother</v>

969
00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:25.810
<v Speaker 2>is he got shot in the throat Apparently kneeling ways communicating is writing</v>

970
00:46:25.811 --> 00:46:26.644
<v Speaker 2>things down.</v>

971
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Here's something I just understand.</v>

972
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:33.790
<v Speaker 2>And of course there's a million people online that are shouting out false flag</v>

973
00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:37.360
<v Speaker 2>false flag the government trying to take out our weapons away and tight down</v>

974
00:46:37.361 --> 00:46:39.940
<v Speaker 2>security and that's why that's why this is happening.</v>

975
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.300
<v Speaker 35>Did you read the kid's Twitter like I stayed up all night.</v>

976
00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:44.470
<v Speaker 35>Sure yeah.</v>

977
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:45.340
<v Speaker 19>Twitter was spooky.</v>

978
00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:46.350
<v Speaker 19>I didn't see it.</v>

979
00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:46.570
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

980
00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.850
<v Speaker 19>His to his Twitter was really spooky it was weird.</v>

981
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:51.520
<v Speaker 42>It seemed normal day but then he would throw in like little things like fuck the</v>

982
00:46:51.521 --> 00:46:54.370
<v Speaker 42>police and then or something like Mohammed something.</v>

983
00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:58.960
<v Speaker 34>Well I think if you're going to paraphrase a guy he's a fucking murder or the</v>

984
00:46:58.961 --> 00:47:03.820
<v Speaker 34>least he could do is go to his Twitter page you lazy and actually read the</v>

985
00:47:03.821 --> 00:47:04.600
<v Speaker 34>night.</v>

986
00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.000
<v Speaker 43>I'm not my greatest guy.</v>

987
00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:07.540
<v Speaker 43>That's what he said.</v>

988
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:08.560
<v Speaker 43>That was one of his tweets.</v>

989
00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.540
<v Speaker 43>Yeah.</v>

990
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.160
<v Speaker 19>He goes on mostly kind of a stress free guy.</v>

991
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:14.080
<v Speaker 19>This is after he had blown people up.</v>

992
00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.580
<v Speaker 19>Yeah allegedly.</v>

993
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:19.560
<v Speaker 19>Of course this is the kid that survived the one that's dead.</v>

994
00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.750
<v Speaker 19>There's all these disputes about what happened to him.</v>

995
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:24.730
<v Speaker 19>Some people are saying the cops ran over him.</v>

996
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.260
<v Speaker 19>He's saying his brother ran over him</v>

997
00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.130
<v Speaker 19>the whole thing sounds like and people are crying out conspiracy.</v>

998
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:35.000
<v Speaker 19>One thing you have to realize about information whenever there's a tragedy or</v>

999
00:47:35.001 --> 00:47:38.930
<v Speaker 19>whenever there's anything that's like really scary like this you know there's a</v>

1000
00:47:38.931 --> 00:47:39.764
<v Speaker 19>terrorist bombing.</v>

1001
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.550
<v Speaker 19>It's people panic and you get a whole bunch different versions of the truth.</v>

1002
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.730
<v Speaker 19>And it's not a conspiracy a lot of times it's just.</v>

1003
00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.200
<v Speaker 19>No one knows what the fuck is going on.</v>

1004
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:53.060
<v Speaker 19>Everybody's terrified and stories spread very quickly like they thought at one</v>

1005
00:47:53.061 --> 00:47:56.210
<v Speaker 19>point in time that one of the suspects was a missing University student from</v>

1006
00:47:56.211 --> 00:47:57.044
<v Speaker 19>Brown.</v>

1007
00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:03.100
<v Speaker 19>And he was believes an Indian young man and his family had been looking for him</v>

1008
00:48:04.101 --> 00:48:07.220
<v Speaker 19>for like a month and they distributed this video and people are saying this is</v>

1009
00:48:07.221 --> 00:48:08.210
<v Speaker 19>one of the suspects.</v>

1010
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:09.570
<v Speaker 19>This is really what happened.</v>

1011
00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.390
<v Speaker 19>You become like a jihadist and left.</v>

1012
00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:12.770
<v Speaker 19>But that wasn't true at all.</v>

1013
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:15.500
<v Speaker 19>By the morning we found out it was a totally different person.</v>

1014
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:16.340
<v Speaker 19>So this is not.</v>

1015
00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:20.300
<v Speaker 19>This isn't like a conspiracy to like hide that information.</v>

1016
00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:25.570
<v Speaker 19>And I think that's really important when when people are looking at events like</v>

1017
00:48:25.701 --> 00:48:30.701
<v Speaker 19>this we'll wait till the dust settles don't just start fucking calling out</v>

1018
00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:36.820
<v Speaker 19>conspiracy and calling out red flags and false flags saying that it's some you</v>

1019
00:48:39.531 --> 00:48:42.170
<v Speaker 19>know nefarious thing going on.</v>

1020
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:44.270
<v Speaker 19>Whatever it is is horrific.</v>

1021
00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:50.020
<v Speaker 19>But jumping on the immediate conspiracy bandwagon is like Man that is one of the</v>

1022
00:48:51.081 --> 00:48:53.810
<v Speaker 19>worst things for the cause of questioning things.</v>

1023
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:58.610
<v Speaker 19>And if you ever wanted to be a good disinformation agent what you do is the</v>

1024
00:48:58.611 --> 00:49:00.590
<v Speaker 19>moment that anything happens.</v>

1025
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:05.510
<v Speaker 19>Start yelling and screaming it's a conspiracy and expose every single aspect of</v>

1026
00:49:05.511 --> 00:49:06.344
<v Speaker 19>it.</v>

1027
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.250
<v Speaker 19>That you you feel is corrupt.</v>

1028
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:12.240
<v Speaker 19>That would be the best way for the government to protect themselves from any</v>

1029
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:17.780
<v Speaker 19>thoughts of being labeled you know as being a part of a conspiracy because</v>

1030
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.530
<v Speaker 19>there's so many nutty people that do that with every single event that it's like</v>

1031
00:49:22.531 --> 00:49:24.740
<v Speaker 19>they've cried wolf you know.</v>

1032
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:25.933
<v Speaker 42>Yeah</v>

1033
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:30.420
<v Speaker 42>I was so nervous with Greg Fitzsimmons that night because he was actually down</v>

1034
00:49:30.421 --> 00:49:33.870
<v Speaker 42>there doing shows and I texted him and he said that the shows were canceled he</v>

1035
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.880
<v Speaker 42>uses in his bed watching movies.</v>

1036
00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:36.910
<v Speaker 42>Yeah shows your accounts.</v>

1037
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.540
<v Speaker 42>Oh that one night don't know if it was.</v>

1038
00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.570
<v Speaker 42>Was it Friday night.</v>

1039
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.460
<v Speaker 42>That was he flew all the way down there.</v>

1040
00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:43.810
<v Speaker 42>Yeah that was it was crazy man.</v>

1041
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.400
<v Speaker 42>Friday night I was what was even crazier is how horrible CNN was.</v>

1042
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.600
<v Speaker 42>There were like an hour and a half behind but then you'd like Look was it has to</v>

1043
00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:53.130
<v Speaker 42>have Watertown that jam gave me.</v>

1044
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.890
<v Speaker 42>It was just like guys throwing grenades.</v>

1045
00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.040
<v Speaker 42>This happening this happened like it was so insane reading that.</v>

1046
00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:00.540
<v Speaker 42>And it was also.</v>

1047
00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.140
<v Speaker 42>It was amazing how censored everything was or delayed it was on the news.</v>

1048
00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.680
<v Speaker 42>It's like you think you know that shit's you know people are getting grenades</v>

1049
00:50:07.681 --> 00:50:09.690
<v Speaker 42>thrown and that would be on the news immediately you know.</v>

1050
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.090
<v Speaker 42>But they were just like talking like oh you know we're still looking for this</v>

1051
00:50:12.091 --> 00:50:12.840
<v Speaker 42>guy.</v>

1052
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.670
<v Speaker 9>It's incredible everybody's a witness now and everybody's a cameraman now.</v>

1053
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.270
<v Speaker 9>Like what.</v>

1054
00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:22.980
<v Speaker 9>What's happening is you know people on the streets can beat the news.</v>

1055
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.360
<v Speaker 9>Yeah because they're right there too.</v>

1056
00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:29.700
<v Speaker 11>You also don't get a filter meaning you don't get anyone correcting it either.</v>

1057
00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.770
<v Speaker 11>So it's interesting because you get you get instantaneous news but you don't get</v>

1058
00:50:34.771 --> 00:50:35.604
<v Speaker 11>it vetted.</v>

1059
00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.630
<v Speaker 11>No it doesn't.</v>

1060
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:39.390
<v Speaker 11>People don't make sure that everything that's coming through is kosher.</v>

1061
00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:41.790
<v Speaker 11>Not to the news always get it gets it right.</v>

1062
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:42.683
<v Speaker 10>They don't.</v>

1063
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:46.010
<v Speaker 10>And I guess it's better to do it that way where it eventually sorts itself out</v>

1064
00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:52.070
<v Speaker 10>but the people that would step in and sabotage that process and create</v>

1065
00:50:52.501 --> 00:50:56.250
<v Speaker 10>disinformation like a government agency could be pretty fucking successful at</v>

1066
00:50:56.251 --> 00:50:59.790
<v Speaker 10>doing that I think and there's probably a bunch of people that are hired to do</v>

1067
00:50:59.791 --> 00:51:01.260
<v Speaker 10>that shit all the time.</v>

1068
00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 44>I've been accused of it myself but I will tell you that is incorrect</v>

1069
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:11.700
<v Speaker 44>and that I think like in those Starsky and Hutch movies like when someone would</v>

1070
00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:16.590
<v Speaker 44>say one or TV show or any any cop show these to have to remember in the old days</v>

1071
00:51:16.591 --> 00:51:19.270
<v Speaker 44>like someone would say if you're a copy of tell me like when someone's an</v>

1072
00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:20.213
<v Speaker 44>undercover cop.</v>

1073
00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.530
<v Speaker 13>Oh yeah and mirrors like a secret password.</v>

1074
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:22.970
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:24.480
<v Speaker 13>You got to ask him Are you a cop.</v>

1076
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:25.540
<v Speaker 13>I think Oh shit.</v>

1077
00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:26.190
<v Speaker 13>Yeah I'm a cop.</v>

1078
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:28.300
<v Speaker 13>Yeah and I'm too smart for you Jack.</v>

1079
00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:29.430
<v Speaker 13>You can't buy this heroin.</v>

1080
00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:34.440
<v Speaker 10>You know there was like some magic word I think that was a creation of fiction.</v>

1081
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.760
<v Speaker 10>Yeah yeah I think they changed that.</v>

1082
00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:36.923
<v Speaker 45>Yeah</v>

1083
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.070
<v Speaker 45>but people always thought that.</v>

1084
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:47.290
<v Speaker 29>But you know that's that's probably some disinformation the cops put out there.</v>

1085
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:54.100
<v Speaker 14>There was an accusation recently that the DEA put out a false paper about them</v>

1086
00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:59.810
<v Speaker 14>not being able to track people by using a message because I messages over the</v>

1087
00:51:59.811 --> 00:52:00.644
<v Speaker 14>Internet.</v>

1088
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.250
<v Speaker 14>And so there was like an article like and I'm like a tech site like if you're</v>

1089
00:52:04.251 --> 00:52:07.230
<v Speaker 14>planning to sell drugs like do it through I message why.</v>

1090
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.380
<v Speaker 17>Because the DEA says it can't read it.</v>

1091
00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:13.640
<v Speaker 17>And then you know the DEA is pressuring Apple but it turned out that was fake.</v>

1092
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:17.480
<v Speaker 17>There's like the DEA made that just get a bunch of assholes that are drug</v>

1093
00:52:17.481 --> 00:52:21.800
<v Speaker 17>dealers you know your dog just I message me I don't know what accent that is if</v>

1094
00:52:21.801 --> 00:52:22.850
<v Speaker 17>that's your nationality.</v>

1095
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.750
<v Speaker 5>I apologize.</v>

1096
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.390
<v Speaker 5>It was just a spur of the moment thing.</v>

1097
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:32.020
<v Speaker 29>I mean no disrespect but you know like the DEA made a they put out fake news to</v>

1098
00:52:34.101 --> 00:52:37.160
<v Speaker 29>trick dummies into using a message to sell drugs.</v>

1099
00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:38.720
<v Speaker 10>It's a good idea.</v>

1100
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.290
<v Speaker 46>It is it's very crafty but it's one of those things where it gets to the point</v>

1101
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:47.400
<v Speaker 46>of you know when that's not total entrapment.</v>

1102
00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.330
<v Speaker 46>That's just lying.</v>

1103
00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:53.550
<v Speaker 14>But what happens when you have undercover people when you have undercover people</v>

1104
00:52:53.551 --> 00:52:56.370
<v Speaker 14>involved those undercover people sell you coke and then you arrest them.</v>

1105
00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:58.350
<v Speaker 17>That's crazy.</v>

1106
00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.990
<v Speaker 17>You know why it's crazy because there's no real Coke.</v>

1107
00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:01.350
<v Speaker 17>OK.</v>

1108
00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:03.150
<v Speaker 17>You're not selling coke you're arresting them.</v>

1109
00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:06.990
<v Speaker 17>So you're saying that they wanted to buy coke but you weren't even really</v>

1110
00:53:06.991 --> 00:53:07.710
<v Speaker 17>selling coke.</v>

1111
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:11.400
<v Speaker 17>You just got them to act through the moments to get point and get out and talk</v>

1112
00:53:11.401 --> 00:53:11.790
<v Speaker 17>through it.</v>

1113
00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:12.900
<v Speaker 17>There was no coke to buy.</v>

1114
00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.220
<v Speaker 17>There's no crime to commit.</v>

1115
00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:17.580
<v Speaker 17>They might have thought they were going to commit a crime but there was no real</v>

1116
00:53:17.581 --> 00:53:17.880
<v Speaker 17>Coke.</v>

1117
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.780
<v Speaker 17>They're not really buying anything.</v>

1118
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:19.770
<v Speaker 17>Not really selling anything.</v>

1119
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.710
<v Speaker 17>There was no real transaction to fake transaction.</v>

1120
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:24.330
<v Speaker 17>You're playing make believe.</v>

1121
00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 17>And that's fucked up because you're also trying to arrest people because the</v>

1122
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:31.350
<v Speaker 17>more b b arrest the better your career looks.</v>

1123
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 17>So it becomes a quantifiable thing so you can talk someone into doing something</v>

1124
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:38.040
<v Speaker 17>illegal and then arrest them.</v>

1125
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:39.450
<v Speaker 17>And then it helps you.</v>

1126
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:42.420
<v Speaker 2>But that's crazy because people talk people in the suck their dick.</v>

1127
00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:46.020
<v Speaker 2>People talk people into doing all sorts of stupid shit they didn't really want</v>

1128
00:53:46.021 --> 00:53:46.770
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1129
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:49.770
<v Speaker 2>They just did because they got persuaded people could be persuasive.</v>

1130
00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 2>So if you're some crazy sociopathic Fuck that just so happens to be an</v>

1131
00:53:54.031 --> 00:53:58.170
<v Speaker 2>undercover cop and you want to talk people into doing shit for you so you can</v>

1132
00:53:58.171 --> 00:53:59.004
<v Speaker 2>arrest them.</v>

1133
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 2>We need to put you in a cage OK.</v>

1134
00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:04.510
<v Speaker 29>You you crazy fuck yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 30>How do you guys find out about that.</v>

1140
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:14.060
<v Speaker 10>Well the Internet is one of the first we had to vet it but we just figured we'd</v>

1141
00:54:15.061 --> 00:54:15.894

1145
00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:25.340

1146
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.180
<v Speaker 10>and then arrest you.</v>

<v Speaker 29>Powerful Chris Hansen.</v>

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:13.770
<v Speaker 29>I don't think so.</v>

1196
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:23.430
<v Speaker 10>First of all I think you have to get people to sign releases to air that stuff.</v>

1197
00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:25.590
<v Speaker 10>I don't know how they got anybody to sign a release.</v>

1225
00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:28.380
<v Speaker 38>like how to make a bomb.</v>

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:29.500
<v Speaker 38>Just to see if that's out there.</v>

1227
00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.140
<v Speaker 38>Like nobody knows if that's out there.</v>

1228
00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:33.810
<v Speaker 38>If you don't google it and everybody's afraid to google it.</v>

1229
00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:34.830
<v Speaker 38>Makes sense.</v>

1230
00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:35.160
<v Speaker 36>Yeah.</v>

1231

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:36.690
<v Speaker 36>Did you do it.</v>

1233
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:37.530
<v Speaker 36>No I didn't.</v>

1234
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:39.570
<v Speaker 34>I don't want anything to happen.</v>

1235
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.570
<v Speaker 9>Which is why I think I left an impression.</v>

1236
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:43.470
<v Speaker 9>You know something.</v>

1237
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:44.460
<v Speaker 9>I was curious about.</v>

1238
00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:47.910
<v Speaker 9>I wish there was a thing you could google where it's like I don't know.</v>

1239
00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:52.400
<v Speaker 48>I just don't get it but it seems like any crazy kid.</v>

1240
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:53.503
<v Speaker 48>I don't know</v>

1241
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:55.560
<v Speaker 48>the Internet's power.</v>

1242
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:59.150
<v Speaker 14>The scariest thing about shows like catch predator is you see that these guys</v>

1243
00:57:59.151 --> 00:58:03.320
<v Speaker 14>are like broken you know you see they're like horrified when they get caught.</v>

1244
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:05.000
<v Speaker 14>You see they know that it's fucked up.</v>

1245
00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 14>It's not like these remorseless cold insensitive unfeeling you know they're not</v>

1246
00:58:11.151 --> 00:58:13.580
<v Speaker 14>scared when they get caught these guys fall apart.</v>

1247
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.390
<v Speaker 19>You see they're horrified at who they are.</v>

1248
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:22.290
<v Speaker 19>It's really it's scary scary to say because it's like a glimpse into madness.</v>

1249
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:24.540
<v Speaker 19>You know that guy Chris Hansen.</v>

1250
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:25.770
<v Speaker 19>I guarantee you.</v>

1251
00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:31.370
<v Speaker 14>Now this sounds like some hippie bullshit but being around people that are that</v>

1252
00:58:31.531 --> 00:58:36.531
<v Speaker 14>fucked up on a regular basis and broadcasting them and paying your bills based</v>

1253
00:58:39.331 --> 00:58:43.350
<v Speaker 14>on broadcasting them and all and I mean like under the guise I guess you're</v>

1254
00:58:43.351 --> 00:58:45.570
<v Speaker 14>pulling these people off the street and that's always a good thing.</v>

1255
00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.400
<v Speaker 9>Well you know what happened to him right.</v>

1256
00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:48.413
<v Speaker 9>What was it.</v>

1257
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:52.920
<v Speaker 9>Was that he got caught cheating on his wife or something I got some big media</v>

1258
00:58:52.921 --> 00:58:53.390
<v Speaker 9>thing.</v>

1259
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:55.020
<v Speaker 44>Then he got investigated with a camera.</v>

1260
00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:56.620
<v Speaker 44>He was out with another bomb.</v>

1261
00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:57.420
<v Speaker 44>Me.</v>

1262
00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.400
<v Speaker 44>Look I don't know what the fuck the guy's marriage was like.</v>

1263
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:00.383
<v Speaker 44>You know I don't want to.</v>

1264
00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.100
<v Speaker 44>Crack on the guy for that.</v>

1265
00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.200
<v Speaker 44>I think there's a big difference between that.</v>

1266
00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:07.500
<v Speaker 44>And you know of course you know some.</v>

1267
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:09.990
<v Speaker 44>Pocket child some consensual.</v>

1268
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.810
<v Speaker 44>Shit he did with Secretary whoever.</v>

1269
00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:14.723
<v Speaker 44>That freak is.</v>

1270
00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:21.520
<v Speaker 44>Oh I hate him for that but being around all those people that were kid fuckers</v>

1271
00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:22.560
<v Speaker 44>man.</v>

1272
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:27.630
<v Speaker 19>That's gonna wear on your soul that's going to wear in your soul did you even</v>

1273
00:59:27.631 --> 00:59:31.170
<v Speaker 19>see these people over and over again and being in their presence when you know</v>

1274
00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:35.550
<v Speaker 19>most of them are probably I mean I guess this isn't their first time I would I</v>

1275
00:59:35.551 --> 00:59:39.270
<v Speaker 19>would assume this isn't the first time they probably already had sex with young</v>

1276
00:59:39.271 --> 00:59:41.550
<v Speaker 19>kids or any so you watch.</v>

1277
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:46.120
<v Speaker 19>It's just it's it's just it's really it's gonna be a really depressing view of</v>

1278
00:59:46.121 --> 00:59:51.100
<v Speaker 19>the world and it's only so many different things you can expose yourself to in a</v>

1279
00:59:51.101 --> 00:59:56.101
<v Speaker 19>24 hour time period and you got you know 365 of those 24 hour time periods in a</v>

1280
00:59:56.231 --> 00:59:59.380
<v Speaker 19>year and you got a hundred of those years if you keep your shit together but</v>

1281
00:59:59.381 --> 01:00:00.250
<v Speaker 19>most likely no.</v>

1282
01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:04.660
<v Speaker 19>And you're gonna spend time hanging around pedophiles all the time.</v>

1283
01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:08.350
<v Speaker 19>And it's one thing if you're a guy and that's your job pull them off the street.</v>

1284
01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:13.440
<v Speaker 19>But I don't I'm not exactly sure what good it does making a show out of that.</v>

1285
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.800
<v Speaker 19>You know I mean except scare the fuck out of everybody and make us aware.</v>

1286
01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:23.440
<v Speaker 46>But I feel like you know not that I mind them being outed because it's such a</v>

1287
01:00:23.441 --> 01:00:25.690
<v Speaker 46>heinous crime against humanity.</v>

1288
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.033
<v Speaker 28>But</v>

1289
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.550
<v Speaker 28>man it seems like a fucked up thing to broadcast.</v>

1290
01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:32.530
<v Speaker 28>You know it's like what do we want to concentrate on.</v>

1291
01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.400
<v Speaker 28>It's one thing to like work on cleaning that up but as a piece of entertainment</v>

1292
01:00:36.401 --> 01:00:40.450
<v Speaker 28>programming you're gonna you're going to concentrate on someone who wants to</v>

1293
01:00:40.451 --> 01:00:43.060
<v Speaker 28>victimize children and you're just gonna focus on that a lot.</v>

1294
01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:46.390
<v Speaker 9>I think it was a hit because you know they're the ultimate bad guys.</v>

1295
01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.350
<v Speaker 9>Well you know you're looking at the villain of all villains right.</v>

1296
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.130
<v Speaker 19>No matter how fucked up your own life is right.</v>

1297
01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:51.870
<v Speaker 19>Right.</v>

1298
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:52.140
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

1299
01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.130
<v Speaker 19>Nobody's lower than a child molester.</v>

1300
01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:59.040
<v Speaker 17>Everybody can go that fuckin piece of shit that fuckin p has to be on the couch</v>

1301
01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:00.400
<v Speaker 17>picking your fat toes.</v>

1302
01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.780
<v Speaker 17>Smoking a cigarette.</v>

1303
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.500
<v Speaker 17>You see they're just picking dry skin and your toes and just drop it on the</v>

1304
01:01:05.501 --> 01:01:07.340
<v Speaker 17>floor of this motherfucker.</v>

1305
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.960
<v Speaker 17>That piece of shit I hope he writes I hope he writes in jail.</v>

1306
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:12.970
<v Speaker 17>Death is too good for him.</v>

1307
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:13.990
<v Speaker 17>I hope he rot in jail.</v>

1308
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.730
<v Speaker 17>You know what they do to child molesters.</v>

1309
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
<v Speaker 19>They get him in their persons fucking wretched stupid human being is barely an</v>

1310
01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.533
<v Speaker 19>ape.</v>

1311
01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:25.000
<v Speaker 19>They get the shit on this child molester and feel better.</v>

1312
01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.510
<v Speaker 36>That voice grosses me out the bastard later.</v>

1313
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:32.350
<v Speaker 18>I feel bad I and do it from Boston and Boston is in a bad position right now.</v>

1314
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:38.870
<v Speaker 20>Oh just don't you know this Boston thing.</v>

1315
01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.900
<v Speaker 20>When one of the things that is fascinating is that they like there was a thing</v>

1316
01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:48.440
<v Speaker 20>about how they weren't going to read him his rights and then</v>

1317
01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:55.030
<v Speaker 20>this you know this thing about how whether or not they were going to try him as</v>

1318
01:01:55.031 --> 01:01:58.090
<v Speaker 20>an enemy combatant or try him as a civilian.</v>

1319
01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.930
<v Speaker 20>It's really fascinating that that's becoming like a real issue.</v>

1320
01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:06.270
<v Speaker 20>You know the way they decide to approach it like is this guy an American that</v>

1321
01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:10.660
<v Speaker 20>we're gonna try as an American you know or someone who lets someone when someone</v>

1322
01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:11.980
<v Speaker 20>commits any form of terrorism.</v>

1323
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.160
<v Speaker 20>Are they are they instantly just out of the club.</v>

1324
01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 20>Or do we try him as one of us you know.</v>

1325
01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.070
<v Speaker 20>Is it or is it a war thing.</v>

1326
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:19.943
<v Speaker 20>Are we at war.</v>

1327
01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:21.970
<v Speaker 19>How we gonna how we're going to go forward in this</v>

1328
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:24.600
<v Speaker 19>Yeah it's interesting.</v>

1329
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:27.480
<v Speaker 19>It's once it's interesting the way we label things.</v>

1330
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.120
<v Speaker 19>You know and it's interesting.</v>

1331
01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:31.920
<v Speaker 19>OK.</v>

1332
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.920
<v Speaker 19>Any conspiracy theory aside that all these nutty ideas that are floating around.</v>

1333
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:38.820
<v Speaker 14>One thing we know for sure</v>

1334
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:45.050
<v Speaker 14>there was bombs that a person put in place that killed a bunch of people that</v>

1335
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:45.940
<v Speaker 14>didn't do anything wrong.</v>

1336
01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:52.060
<v Speaker 14>And we have to figure out how the fuck that happens and I know that sounds super</v>

1337
01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:57.531
<v Speaker 14>simplistic but as a human as a species that's evolving clearly as we were</v>

1338
01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:03.420
<v Speaker 14>talking about the Mongols earlier and like what they used to do a thousand years</v>

1339
01:03:03.421 --> 01:03:08.421
<v Speaker 14>ago like our most heinous acts pale in comparison to those of our ancestors.</v>

1340
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:15.500
<v Speaker 46>But when something like this happens you realize that people are still capable</v>

1341
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.920
<v Speaker 46>of such embarrassing ruthless stupidity arrogance and just horrific</v>

1342
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:30.820
<v Speaker 46>insensitivity towards their fellow man.</v>

1343
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:35.750
<v Speaker 22>The idea that you could just take a bunch of people you don't know and kill them</v>

1344
01:03:35.751 --> 01:03:39.570
<v Speaker 22>and maim home and just you just were in the wrong spot at the wrong time and I</v>

1345
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:44.200
<v Speaker 22>got a message and there's only one thing that gets people to do that Fox by the</v>

1346
01:03:44.201 --> 01:03:48.010
<v Speaker 22>way and that's an ideology right.</v>

1347
01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:50.630
<v Speaker 19>It could either be a religion or could be a cult.</v>

1348
01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.000
<v Speaker 19>Or it can be you know some group that you belong to that sworn allegiance to a</v>

1349
01:03:55.001 --> 01:03:57.010
<v Speaker 19>certain code or set of rules.</v>

1350
01:03:57.530 --> 01:04:00.970
<v Speaker 19>But that's the only way you get people to do shit like that if they don't have</v>

1351
01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:01.690
<v Speaker 19>an ideology.</v>

1352
01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:02.830
<v Speaker 19>They just don't do that.</v>

1353
01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:04.150
<v Speaker 19>Doesn't make sense.</v>

1354
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:09.510
<v Speaker 46>There's no evolutionary benefit to doing that other than pleasing a group of</v>

1355
01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:14.360
<v Speaker 46>other like minded psychopaths someone you have to be</v>

1356
01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.960
<v Speaker 46>amongst a group of people that have very specific beliefs that above all else</v>

1357
01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:24.493
<v Speaker 46>take precedent.</v>

1358
01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:29.750
<v Speaker 46>So that you're willing to put your humanity aside for your crazy beliefs in a</v>

1359
01:04:29.751 --> 01:04:34.751
<v Speaker 46>completely irrational display of destructive power and that you can kill</v>

1360
01:04:35.901 --> 01:04:36.734
<v Speaker 46>innocents.</v>

1361
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:40.700
<v Speaker 46>That only comes from ideology and we get really lost.</v>

1362
01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.960
<v Speaker 14>When we start talking about religious freedom and religion and you know an</v>

1363
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:51.950
<v Speaker 14>atheists are guilty of this just as much as really religious people are because</v>

1364
01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:57.520
<v Speaker 14>whether you call it being a Muslim whether you call it being a Buddhist whether</v>

1365
01:04:57.651 --> 01:05:01.760
<v Speaker 14>you call it being a vegan whether you call it being a Christian whether you call</v>

1366
01:05:01.761 --> 01:05:05.810
<v Speaker 14>it being a Republican whether you call it being a Democrat whether you call it</v>

1367
01:05:05.811 --> 01:05:10.811
<v Speaker 14>being a progressive when you lock yourself in anything you become a part of</v>

1368
01:05:14.951 --> 01:05:17.630
<v Speaker 14>something that's almost been decided for you.</v>

1369
01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:23.090
<v Speaker 24>You you you you you lock into a pre arranged set of opinions on things and some</v>

1370
01:05:26.081 --> 01:05:31.081
<v Speaker 24>of them are bat shit fucking crazy and just like the Mongols got a hundred</v>

1371
01:05:32.111 --> 01:05:37.111
<v Speaker 24>thousand mother fuckers to roam across Russia and Europe and China and slaughter</v>

1372
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:39.880
<v Speaker 24>millions of people.</v>

1373
01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 24>You can't do that unless you've got a cause you can't do that unless you're part</v>

1374
01:05:44.891 --> 01:05:45.724
<v Speaker 24>of a group.</v>

1375
01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:48.940
<v Speaker 20>You can't do that unless your group is separate from the other groups.</v>

1376
01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:53.050
<v Speaker 20>And the only way that ever works is someone's got to talk you into that shit.</v>

1377
01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 20>You've got to be a part of something.</v>

1378
01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:59.440
<v Speaker 20>And with this kid apparently was or he was you know the one they're saying did</v>

1379
01:05:59.441 --> 01:06:02.800
<v Speaker 20>it he was a pretty radical religious young man.</v>

1380
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:04.720
<v Speaker 20>Now whether or not that's true.</v>

1381
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.673
<v Speaker 20>Who knows science.</v>

1382
01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:09.520
<v Speaker 9>It has to be it seems to be the one thing that all these people have in common.</v>

1383
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:14.790
<v Speaker 20>Yeah well I think the false flag people are thinking that like somebody gave</v>

1384
01:06:14.921 --> 01:06:18.970
<v Speaker 20>them all this stuff and that they were talked into doing it and then it was a</v>

1385
01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:23.200
<v Speaker 20>plan to erode civil liberties that they would sacrifice a few Americans and</v>

1386
01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.680
<v Speaker 20>clamp down on laws.</v>

1387
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:28.930
<v Speaker 28>And this is this really is classically what military leaders have been doing</v>

1388
01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:30.040
<v Speaker 28>since the beginning of time.</v>

1389
01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:33.850
<v Speaker 28>You know like we're talking about armies in the past would actually sacrifice</v>

1390
01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:37.840
<v Speaker 28>soldiers and slaughter them so that the rest of the people could eat you know</v>

1391
01:06:37.841 --> 01:06:39.280
<v Speaker 28>they would cannibalize themselves.</v>

1392
01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:40.120
<v Speaker 28>That was they.</v>

1393
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.290
<v Speaker 28>They had to talk somebody into doing something like that.</v>

1394
01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.750
<v Speaker 28>You know I mean</v>

1395
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:48.480
<v Speaker 28>the first time somebody says that's super awkward Yeah.</v>

1396
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:54.270
<v Speaker 28>It's fuckin you know it's hard to believe that in this day and age with the like</v>

1397
01:06:55.691 --> 01:06:59.890
<v Speaker 28>if you look at like how amazing humans are capable of being you know.</v>

1398
01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:05.550
<v Speaker 16>Like here's a perfect example Oprah now I know Brian doesn't like my love for</v>

1399
01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:08.334
<v Speaker 16>Oprah.</v>

1400
01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:11.300
<v Speaker 35>I love that you're I Oprah I think it's Brian.</v>

1401
01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:17.370
<v Speaker 44>He goofs on me but it's an honest appreciation for what she does because Oprah</v>

1402
01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:23.040
<v Speaker 44>like you know I have a friend who worked for and is like man she's like super</v>

1403
01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.710
<v Speaker 44>yuppie bitch.</v>

1404
01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.150
<v Speaker 44>Barely an hour and how the fuck are you going to try to be a standup comedian</v>

1405
01:07:29.151 --> 01:07:31.300
<v Speaker 44>you can't even go two hours without paying.</v>

1406
01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.150
<v Speaker 44>My friend was like he worked for and he was like pow.</v>

1407
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.410
<v Speaker 44>She's like intense you know.</v>

1408
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:36.570
<v Speaker 44>You know she's like really.</v>

1409
01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:41.550
<v Speaker 44>She has an idea what she wants and she gets done and you know he was like I</v>

1410
01:07:41.551 --> 01:07:45.210
<v Speaker 44>think he's been intimidated by too because he was working for but like stop and</v>

1411
01:07:45.211 --> 01:07:50.211
<v Speaker 44>think about how much nice that lady does like that lady is like so nice.</v>

1412
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:53.070
<v Speaker 44>All those women that come to her show they feel great.</v>

1413
01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.750
<v Speaker 44>Everybody leaves positive.</v>

1414
01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:00.360
<v Speaker 44>I was reading this thing the other day on negative energy and that there was</v>

1415
01:08:00.361 --> 01:08:03.300
<v Speaker 44>some sort of a study that actually showed that negative energy is contagious.</v>

1416
01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:07.110
<v Speaker 44>If you find out you know if you if you're hanging around people that are</v>

1417
01:08:07.111 --> 01:08:11.010
<v Speaker 44>negative it doesn't just affect you when you communicate with them and becomes a</v>

1418
01:08:11.011 --> 01:08:12.720
<v Speaker 44>part of the way you communicate as well.</v>

1419
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:16.860
<v Speaker 44>It becomes contagious and one like super aggressive contagious negative person</v>

1420
01:08:16.861 --> 01:08:18.480
<v Speaker 44>can actually infect like a company.</v>

1421
01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:24.020
<v Speaker 44>I think that's why it's important that I mean companies have been really focused</v>

1422
01:08:24.151 --> 01:08:24.780
<v Speaker 44>on that.</v>

1423
01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:27.990
<v Speaker 44>I think ones that are really aware of the social structure within the</v>

1424
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
<v Speaker 44>organization they want to make sure that you don't get like a really negative</v>

1425
01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:37.810
<v Speaker 44>Downer type person in any sort of a role because if you get them you know that</v>

1426
01:08:37.811 --> 01:08:39.210
<v Speaker 44>they can really infect.</v>

1427
01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:42.300
<v Speaker 44>Like if they're especially if you had some guy like you work on a big project</v>

1428
01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:45.550
<v Speaker 44>you got some one guy who's leading and he's a douche bag and everybody shows up</v>

1429
01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:50.570
<v Speaker 44>work like oh it's there's very few things in life worse than being stuck like</v>

1430
01:08:51.571 --> 01:08:54.510
<v Speaker 44>working in a job it sucks with a boss who's an asshole.</v>

1431
01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:55.260
<v Speaker 44>Right.</v>

1432
01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:59.280
<v Speaker 7>Why do why are all bosses mostly assholes to me making my list.</v>

1433
01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:04.310
<v Speaker 7>I look back at all the jobs I've ever had you know and it's the majority like</v>

1434
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:07.650
<v Speaker 7>they were always the assholes they were never the people you hung out with or</v>

1435
01:09:07.651 --> 01:09:10.860
<v Speaker 7>wanted to hang out with you know they're always there I was always a terrible</v>

1436
01:09:10.861 --> 01:09:11.400
<v Speaker 7>employee.</v>

1437
01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.540
<v Speaker 44>So I think anytime a boss got mad at me I totally deserved it.</v>

1438
01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:16.740
<v Speaker 11>There was a shitty.</v>

1439
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:22.100
<v Speaker 11>I did a shit job mowing lawns when I was a you know a lot landscaper.</v>

1440
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:28.320
<v Speaker 10>I remember the guy hired me to fuckin scalped this law and I did not work a lot</v>

1441
01:09:28.321 --> 01:09:29.040
<v Speaker 10>more.</v>

1442
01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.080
<v Speaker 10>I lied just like you get the job like my friend did.</v>

1443
01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.170
<v Speaker 10>And you said you could do it easy so often it's not hard but it was hard.</v>

1444
01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:36.030
<v Speaker 10>The first time I did it was kind of hard to figure out.</v>

1445
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:39.930
<v Speaker 10>These are old shitty lawnmowers you know and I sculpt the shit out his lawn.</v>

1446
01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.360
<v Speaker 35>You fucking hate most don't you hate it.</v>

1447
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:44.220
<v Speaker 35>That used to be torture.</v>

1448
01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.780
<v Speaker 35>It's not it's it's not easy.</v>

1449
01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:50.040
<v Speaker 10>Oh yeah but when I was in high school my friend Chris he one of the things about</v>

1450
01:09:50.041 --> 01:09:51.990
<v Speaker 10>Boston about growing up in Boston.</v>

1451
01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.930
<v Speaker 10>Boston is like a really in G.</v>

1452
01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:56.820
<v Speaker 10>They have a lot of ingenuity.</v>

1453
01:09:57.090 --> 01:09:59.280
<v Speaker 10>There's a lot of like people get shit done.</v>

1454
01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:01.440
<v Speaker 10>So like it's a strong work ethic.</v>

1455
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:05.940
<v Speaker 10>They're like clearly way stronger work ethic than I ever experienced here in</v>

1456
01:10:05.941 --> 01:10:06.570
<v Speaker 10>California.</v>

1457
01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:09.990
<v Speaker 10>Like people are so used to getting up in the morning shoveling their car out</v>

1458
01:10:09.991 --> 01:10:14.991
<v Speaker 10>from the snow they're used to shit like it's a different kind of like there's a</v>

1459
01:10:17.531 --> 01:10:19.180
<v Speaker 10>different kind of like mentality there.</v>

1461
01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:28.020
<v Speaker 49>I had an example where we talked about just before that Boston yes fuck</v>

1462
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:36.850

1463
01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:41.410
<v Speaker 49>S.A.</v>

1464
01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:42.243
<v Speaker 49>after burying it.</v>

1465
01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:43.100
<v Speaker 50>I didn't.</v>

1466
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.850
<v Speaker 50>I took it but not until right before the show.</v>

<v Speaker 10>It was the the mowing lawns things about oh my friend Chris.</v>

1471
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.870
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1472
01:10:55.870 --> 01:11:00.130
<v Speaker 10>When I was in high school this is what it was when everybody else was like you</v>

1473
01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:04.890
<v Speaker 10>know I had a job like Poppa Gino's and shit I was like making spaghetti and I</v>

1474
01:11:04.891 --> 01:11:06.850
<v Speaker 10>was like pretty easy boring job.</v>

1475
01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:09.850
<v Speaker 24>This kid had a lawn mower empire.</v>

1476
01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:12.760
<v Speaker 24>He had a landscaping empire.</v>

1477
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:14.110
<v Speaker 14>He had a brand new car.</v>

1478
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:15.880
<v Speaker 14>He had people working for him.</v>

1479
01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.650
<v Speaker 14>He had lawns that were going while he was at school.</v>

1480
01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:19.710
<v Speaker 14>He had guys working farm.</v>

1481
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:23.530
<v Speaker 14>They were cutting lawns wise at school and he would come home and he would go</v>

1482
01:11:23.531 --> 01:11:26.650
<v Speaker 14>and work till nighttime and they'd show up for work the next day.</v>

1483
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.030
<v Speaker 14>He always have new sneakers on.</v>

1484
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:29.620
<v Speaker 14>He was like a grown man.</v>

1485
01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:34.650
<v Speaker 14>By the time we were 17 this fucking kid I had never been around more people.</v>

1486
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:36.700
<v Speaker 14>That made me feel like a lazy bitch.</v>

1487
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:40.720
<v Speaker 14>There was so many dudes like my friend Jimmy that I used to love Jimmy to tell</v>

1488
01:11:40.721 --> 01:11:41.740
<v Speaker 14>yo this guy.</v>

1489
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:45.340
<v Speaker 14>Like he had from the time he was in high school he had his own electrical</v>

1490
01:11:45.341 --> 01:11:46.030
<v Speaker 14>business.</v>

1491
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:47.410
<v Speaker 14>He worked for a guy for a little while.</v>

1492
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Started doing work on the same time he got at a high school just got his own</v>

1493
01:11:51.161 --> 01:11:56.080
<v Speaker 2>business bus and asked 10 12 hours a day drive it all out ran like a maniac.</v>

1494
01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:01.520
<v Speaker 2>It was you while you're around people like that like you you develop that sort</v>

1495
01:12:01.691 --> 01:12:04.860
<v Speaker 2>of you know that sort of tenacity that exists.</v>

1496
01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Like not a lot of spots in this country you know.</v>

1497
01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:12.310
<v Speaker 2>And I think that dealing with like environmental conditions there's something</v>

1498
01:12:12.311 --> 01:12:13.144
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

1499
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:15.340
<v Speaker 2>It's why people from New York tend to be funnier.</v>

1500
01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:19.270
<v Speaker 2>You know people from Boston tend to be funnier because they're dealing with so</v>

1501
01:12:19.271 --> 01:12:20.440
<v Speaker 2>much bullshit all the time.</v>

1502
01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.410
<v Speaker 9>Definitely and controls.</v>

1503
01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:28.240
<v Speaker 9>I definitely think where you're coming up with that raised has a lot to do with</v>

1504
01:12:28.241 --> 01:12:32.650
<v Speaker 9>that type of crazy factor of your communication skills really.</v>

1505
01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:36.340
<v Speaker 9>I think it's down to like you know small talk if it's the city that you're</v>

1506
01:12:36.341 --> 01:12:37.120
<v Speaker 9>raised in.</v>

1507
01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.080
<v Speaker 9>It rains a lot.</v>

1508
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:42.220
<v Speaker 9>You're going to end up having to talk with your friends more or if it snows a</v>

1509
01:12:42.221 --> 01:12:44.290
<v Speaker 9>lot if it rains a lot if it's a windy city.</v>

1510
01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.153
<v Speaker 9>Things like that.</v>

1511
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:46.090
<v Speaker 9>It's true.</v>

1512
01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:48.070
<v Speaker 9>And I think to be indoors or really apply.</v>

1513
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:49.240
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1514
01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.200
<v Speaker 10>Socially for sure.</v>

1515
01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:51.063
<v Speaker 10>Right yeah.</v>

1516
01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:53.470
<v Speaker 10>In California you could sleep outside and live right.</v>

1517
01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.850
<v Speaker 36>I drank I drank.</v>

1518
01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:00.410
<v Speaker 36>Tom Hardy didn't talk on the porch was smoking cigarettes.</v>

1519
01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.900
<v Speaker 11>That's a Don't you think that Ohio of today growing up in the same place where</v>

1520
01:13:04.901 --> 01:13:08.200
<v Speaker 11>you grew up would be very different because the Internet because kids growing up</v>

1521
01:13:08.201 --> 01:13:10.420
<v Speaker 11>with the Internet be a lot more tolerable.</v>

1522
01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:11.140
<v Speaker 18>That's for sure.</v>

1523
01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:11.700
<v Speaker 18>Yeah right.</v>

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:18.430
<v Speaker 11>The whole world also got lights turned on everywhere lights turned on and the</v>

1528

1615
01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:17.630
<v Speaker 52>You know with all the waiters that lady that drives around in that pink Corvette</v>

1616
01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:18.720
<v Speaker 52>that's all yesterday.</v>

1617
01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.010
<v Speaker 52>This was my night Yes sir excuse me last week.</v>

1618
01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:26.420
<v Speaker 52>This was my point that I see her maybe once a week and it's always random places</v>

1619
01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:29.090
<v Speaker 52>like I'll see her in Hollywood once I hear a lot around here.</v>

1620
01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.690
<v Speaker 52>But like that you just need to tell people what she is.</v>

1621
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:37.990
<v Speaker 52>She used to be like a rich wife I guess that would post photos or these</v>

1622
01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:39.990
<v Speaker 52>billboards like all over.</v>

1623
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:43.040
<v Speaker 52>Just kind of promoting her and I don't think she really had.</v>

1624
01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:44.050
<v Speaker 52>Well that's one way to describe.</v>

1625
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.480
<v Speaker 52>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.020
<v Speaker 52>I don't think she really had anything going.</v>

1627
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.940
<v Speaker 52>She just had a lot of money to play with and so she pretty much made her seem</v>

1628
01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:53.240
<v Speaker 52>like she was a big deal when she really wasn't used as a rich wife.</v>

1629
01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.290
<v Speaker 11>Yeah well the billboards were these giant billboards.</v>

1630
01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:58.850
<v Speaker 11>See Angelina on them in like big letters like whoa it's Angelina.</v>

1631
01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.760
<v Speaker 11>And she's this really pale lady with giant tits.</v>

1632
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:05.640
<v Speaker 11>Yeah and she looks a little odd like she looks like.</v>

1633
01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.730
<v Speaker 11>Like really like photo shopped.</v>

1634
01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:12.260
<v Speaker 11>Like really like brightly lit like it's really hard to discern like key features</v>

1635
01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.230
<v Speaker 11>because she's apparently she's very old.</v>

1636
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.390
<v Speaker 11>And when I came to L.A.</v>

1637
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:20.180
<v Speaker 11>in 94 she had big billboards all around town.</v>

1638
01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:23.630
<v Speaker 11>Like several of them that said Angelina it was just her and then her</v>

1639
01:18:23.631 --> 01:18:24.520
<v Speaker 11>management's number.</v>

1640
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:25.970
<v Speaker 11>It was her in her underwear.</v>

1641
01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:26.973
<v Speaker 11>It was really high.</v>

1642
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.240
<v Speaker 11>Yeah it was kind of crazy because you know she was.</v>

1643
01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:32.420
<v Speaker 11>She had a really nice body I guess.</v>

1644
01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:32.750
<v Speaker 41>Yeah.</v>

1645
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:33.440
<v Speaker 41>Back in the day.</v>

1646
01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:33.930
<v Speaker 41>I do that.</v>

1647
01:18:33.930 --> 01:18:34.250
<v Speaker 41>Yeah.</v>

1648
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:35.083
<v Speaker 41>And that's like.</v>

1649
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:36.613
<v Speaker 41>What's her face.</v>

1650
01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:38.173
<v Speaker 41>Dolly Parton.</v>

1651
01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:38.750
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:41.990
<v Speaker 11>But by the time she was doing this I mean who knows how old she was in that</v>

1653
01:18:41.991 --> 01:18:46.991
<v Speaker 11>picture but the the one that you see today bears no resemblance.</v>

1654
01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:48.980
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1655
01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.750
<v Speaker 9>I had no idea who she was.</v>

1656
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:55.490
<v Speaker 9>And we were shooting something at Hollywood Highland one night and that crazy</v>

1657
01:18:55.491 --> 01:19:00.491
<v Speaker 9>like area and all of a sudden she pulls up and people were like Oh my God</v>

1658
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:01.670
<v Speaker 9>there's Angelina.</v>

1659
01:19:01.890 --> 01:19:06.890
<v Speaker 9>And it took I had no idea who this was and it took it like four people 20</v>

1660
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.910
<v Speaker 9>minutes to be able to explain to me what the big thing was there.</v>

1661
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:12.640
<v Speaker 9>Well I think she's in L.A.</v>

1662
01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:13.483
<v Speaker 9>she's like a..</v>

1663
01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:14.750
<v Speaker 9>Like an icon.</v>

1664
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:17.330
<v Speaker 18>Yeah she's probably 60 years old at least.</v>

1665
01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.560
<v Speaker 18>She still dresses like she's like 75.</v>

1666
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:20.450
<v Speaker 18>I've seen her several.</v>

1667
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:23.450
<v Speaker 9>I wonder what she wanted if she wanted to be an actress or like what.</v>

1668
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:25.340
<v Speaker 9>Oh that's a good question.</v>

1669
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:26.940
<v Speaker 9>Interesting marketing campaign.</v>

1670
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:30.650
<v Speaker 7>But what's really weird is is that how much I sear and jump in.</v>

1671
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:33.510
<v Speaker 7>That's like one of the only cars where you're like Oh that's her.</v>

1672
01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.070
<v Speaker 7>That's her.</v>

1673
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.903
<v Speaker 7>That's her.</v>

1674
01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:39.140
<v Speaker 7>Like how many times you actually drive by people you probably know right and</v>

1675
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:40.830
<v Speaker 7>drive around the same cars.</v>

1676
01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.760
<v Speaker 7>It's just so weird how small Los Angeles actually is.</v>

1677
01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:47.170
<v Speaker 10>At that point you will in that sense and you know it's also like the spots that</v>

1678
01:19:47.171 --> 01:19:50.650
<v Speaker 10>she hits the spots you're at like I said I just saw the coffee being there.</v>

1679
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:52.120
<v Speaker 10>That's what she looks like now.</v>

1680
01:19:52.230 --> 01:19:55.620
<v Speaker 10>Yeah yeah yeah man.</v>

1681
01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.153
<v Speaker 43>All right.</v>

1682
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:58.460
<v Speaker 43>I'm sure she's a nice lady.</v>

1683
01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:02.480
<v Speaker 43>I mean you know I don't know hate but you wouldn't do that.</v>

1684
01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.920
<v Speaker 43>No I mean look man.</v>

1685
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:08.750
<v Speaker 14>Nothing wrong with being that you know that's who she is she's fabulous.</v>

1686
01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:10.893
<v Speaker 43>Let her go get it.</v>

1687
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:11.743
<v Speaker 43>Fuck this look.</v>

1688
01:20:12.130 --> 01:20:14.030
<v Speaker 43>Look that Brian put that away</v>

1689
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:17.060
<v Speaker 43>all the way.</v>

1690
01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:20.720
<v Speaker 43>She's your grandmother man.</v>

1691
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:21.650
<v Speaker 43>Show some respect.</v>

1692
01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:26.390
<v Speaker 19>I don't know if she's a mother or a grandmother but you know that that whole</v>

1693
01:20:26.391 --> 01:20:29.150
<v Speaker 19>wanting to be famous thing is a strange thing.</v>

1694
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.400
<v Speaker 19>She was like one of the original reality stars.</v>

1695
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:34.580
<v Speaker 19>She created her own reality show by just putting up billboards.</v>

1696
01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:39.890
<v Speaker 19>A reality show became her life you know no one was filming it but her life was a</v>

1697
01:20:39.891 --> 01:20:40.670
<v Speaker 19>reality show.</v>

1698
01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:44.360
<v Speaker 19>You know I know she was I knew she was a couple of years after living here.</v>

1699
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:48.500
<v Speaker 19>So I've known who she was since 96 ish 97 ish.</v>

1700
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:50.423
<v Speaker 19>Wow.</v>

1701
01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:55.400
<v Speaker 9>I remember when she pulled up she had her face covered with like some kind of</v>

1702
01:20:55.401 --> 01:20:57.130
<v Speaker 9>like one of those Asian aliens.</v>

1703
01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:58.220
<v Speaker 9>Yeah and shoot.</v>

1704
01:20:58.340 --> 01:20:59.360
<v Speaker 29>She was mysterious.</v>

1705
01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:00.860
<v Speaker 29>Yeah well</v>

1706
01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:02.960

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:07.200
<v Speaker 29>That's uh that's a strange strange world we live in my friends man.</v>

1708
01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:11.100
<v Speaker 7>If I was a porn star hot chick porn star I would buy a pink Corvette and be her</v>

1709
01:21:11.101 --> 01:21:11.940
<v Speaker 7>new competition.</v>

1710
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:13.110
<v Speaker 13>I'd be so rude.</v>

1711
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:15.810
<v Speaker 13>You can call yourself Anzalone.</v>

<v Speaker 42>Yeah or Angelina.</v>

1713
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:21.000
<v Speaker 10>That's a good idea though because I mean that's how she got her attention to</v>

1714
01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:25.290
<v Speaker 10>seeing that you know pink Corvette the money girl Angelina maybe you could have</v>

1715
01:21:25.291 --> 01:21:30.291

1716
01:21:31.651 --> 01:21:35.830
<v Speaker 10>to freelance in your porn career and that you know that will be the whole thing.</v>

1717
01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.130
<v Speaker 10>So the husband has no idea what's going on he comes home.</v>

1718
01:21:38.190 --> 01:21:39.690
<v Speaker 10>What is happening in here.</v>

1719
01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.950
<v Speaker 10>Who are these guys.</v>

1724
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:58.530

1725
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.413
<v Speaker 22>I should been.</v>

1726
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:02.520
<v Speaker 53>Not going anywhere.</v>

1727
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.180
<v Speaker 41>Have you ever been with a girl that you're just completely haunted about like</v>

1728
01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:10.980
<v Speaker 41>that you think about like even after it happened it was like Why the fuck did I</v>

1729
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:11.730
<v Speaker 41>do that.</v>

1730
01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:12.960
<v Speaker 41>That's part of being truck son.</v>

1731
01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole part of being drunk.</v>

1732
01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:16.740
<v Speaker 2>That's a beauty of life.</v>

1733
01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:20.040
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't have those stories then you wouldn't have those awkward moments.</v>

1734
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:23.040
<v Speaker 2>And if you didn't have those awkward moments you wouldn't have some really</v>

1735
01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:25.880
<v Speaker 2>hilarious shit to talk about when everyone else is drunk as well.</v>

1736
01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I can understand what you're saying here.</v>

1737
01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what drunks have the best stories.</v>

1738
01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.310
<v Speaker 2>The being drunk drunk stories when they could just really cut loose and be free</v>

1739
01:22:35.311 --> 01:22:36.240
<v Speaker 2>and not worried about it.</v>

1740
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:40.440
<v Speaker 2>I have friends from back in the Boston days of the best stories when they're</v>

1741
01:22:40.441 --> 01:22:43.980
<v Speaker 2>drunk and then somewhere along the line those folks become alcoholics anonymous</v>

1742
01:22:43.981 --> 01:22:46.500
<v Speaker 2>people and all the stories stop.</v>

1743
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1744
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:50.660
<v Speaker 41>I feel like I'm going to start getting into alcoholics anonymous soon.</v>

1745
01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:51.880
<v Speaker 41>Speaking at the Comedy Store.</v>

1746
01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:55.710
<v Speaker 41>Going at comedy clubs so much you just have to fucking during me and Tony battle</v>

1747
01:22:55.711 --> 01:22:58.870
<v Speaker 41>with this almost every single night where we're like have you got a drink.</v>

1748
01:22:58.920 --> 01:22:59.753
<v Speaker 41>Yeah.</v>

1749
01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:04.980
<v Speaker 9>Because you know I mean it's just you know what's interesting about you know</v>

1750
01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:09.900
<v Speaker 9>it's like either the night's going great and you want to drink to celebrate or</v>

1751
01:23:09.901 --> 01:23:11.140
<v Speaker 9>it's a fucking boring night.</v>

1752
01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:13.050
<v Speaker 9>You want to drink to have more fun.</v>

1753
01:23:13.410 --> 01:23:17.070
<v Speaker 9>It's like there's never ever a time where I'm just like in the middle like you</v>

1754
01:23:17.071 --> 01:23:17.790
<v Speaker 9>know.</v>

1755
01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:21.930
<v Speaker 30>I just said yeah we're going to do it every night.</v>

1756
01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:24.640
<v Speaker 4>Have a show though man it really can wear on you.</v>

1757
01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:29.970
<v Speaker 9>Well you know I'm very lucky because on my end of it I'll sometimes only have a</v>

1758
01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:34.971
<v Speaker 9>half a drink or one drink because I'm very little and I'm very reactive.</v>

1759
01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.590
<v Speaker 29>And so how many beers does it take to get you fucked up.</v>

1760
01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:42.060
<v Speaker 29>Two and a half probably.</v>

1761
01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.220
<v Speaker 29>Yeah two and a half beers and fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>

1764
01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:50.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1765
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Three and I just decide to tell a story that I wasn't sure if I was gonna tell.</v>

1766
01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:58.350
<v Speaker 9>Yeah I normally don't get to my third during Ken till pretty late.</v>

1767
01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:59.460
<v Speaker 9>Oh really that's funny.</v>

1768
01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:02.040
<v Speaker 10>Yeah that's weird.</v>

1769
01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:02.993
<v Speaker 10>How much you weigh.</v>

1770
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:08.000
<v Speaker 10>Probably about 127 right around there.</v>

1771
01:24:08.690 --> 01:24:11.040
<v Speaker 54>And if you think about a beer is what a pound</v>

1772
01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.353
<v Speaker 54>right.</v>

1773
01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.380
<v Speaker 36>Yeah I guess so.</v>

1774
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:20.570
<v Speaker 19>I'd say subtle of Jack Daniels fucks me up essentially you get to like one</v>

1775
01:24:20.571 --> 01:24:24.050
<v Speaker 19>percent of your body weight fairly quickly 1 percent by weight in beer.</v>

1776
01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.580
<v Speaker 29>Oh that's interesting.</v>

1777
01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:28.753
<v Speaker 29>Yeah.</v>

1778
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:31.260
<v Speaker 41>Would you say what about Jack Daniels.</v>

1779
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:34.300
<v Speaker 13>I've gotten to the point where I think one bottle of Jack Daniels would fuck me</v>

1780
01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:37.870
<v Speaker 13>shut up son you fucking start slurring when you open the cap.</v>

1781
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:42.270
<v Speaker 13>Larry slurring in and then alive.</v>

1782
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:45.620
<v Speaker 10>Sometimes I feel like I'm talking about like bleeding from the liver until I</v>

1783
01:24:45.621 --> 01:24:46.454
<v Speaker 10>expire.</v>

1784
01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:55.670
<v Speaker 10>Yeah it's interesting that no one's figured out a way to create the effect of</v>

1785
01:24:55.671 --> 01:24:58.850
<v Speaker 10>alcohol without the horrific effects to your fucking body.</v>

1786
01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:00.980
<v Speaker 38>Well gee you know my way works.</v>

1787
01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:04.640
<v Speaker 38>You could just get down to one hundred and twenty seven and just sip on a drink</v>

1788
01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:05.474
<v Speaker 38>all night long.</v>

1789
01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.940
<v Speaker 31>Feel great or black out every night because you keep forgetting nearly one sex</v>

1790
01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.030
<v Speaker 31>sounds now right.</v>

1791
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:14.870
<v Speaker 31>Like you imagine it like a guy like Tate would take could.</v>

1792
01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.820
<v Speaker 31>Well he doesn't drink but in his prime.</v>

1793
01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.960
<v Speaker 31>Big guy you know the guys can put away more like Joey.</v>

1794
01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:24.060
<v Speaker 31>Joey could put away some fuckin booze at the wedding.</v>

1795
01:25:24.150 --> 01:25:24.740
<v Speaker 31>Joey</v>

1796
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:28.140
<v Speaker 41>Joey barely ever drinks but when he does he always gets the most.</v>

1797
01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:32.080
<v Speaker 41>He said so cute that you'll get like I got an orange cream sickle.</v>

1798
01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:33.240
<v Speaker 41>He was a good man.</v>

1799
01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:37.190
<v Speaker 29>That's why you know people like pina coladas and shit.</v>

1800
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:37.670
<v Speaker 29>Yeah yeah.</v>

1801
01:25:37.670 --> 01:25:41.780
<v Speaker 29>Fucked up and some folks only allow them that on when they're on vacation.</v>

1802
01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:43.063
<v Speaker 29>But men.</v>

1803
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:46.340
<v Speaker 29>Well when men are drinking they weren't manly shit.</v>

1804
01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.770
<v Speaker 29>They want something that is mixing up.</v>

1805
01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:53.050
<v Speaker 22>Oh yeah right.</v>

1806

<v Speaker 41>I have a long night of drinking.</v>

1808
01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:58.573
<v Speaker 41>Don't be a pussy.</v>

1809
01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.670
<v Speaker 41>You're saying you rather drink with them than drink with us.</v>

1810
01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.660
<v Speaker 41>No I mean how would you have you.</v>

1811
01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 41>How dare you let me know what you have because I'm pretty hung over right now.</v>

1812
01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.830
<v Speaker 29>Well I'm about to go watch a fucking UFO documentary.</v>

1814
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:17.180
<v Speaker 29>I'm not really big on watching UFO documentaries while sober there's a spray</v>

1815
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:18.200
<v Speaker 29>something's gonna go wrong.</v>

1817
01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:24.560
<v Speaker 36>few seconds.</v>

<v Speaker 18>Seems super healthy.</v>

1820
01:26:27.710 --> 01:26:32.090
<v Speaker 18>You should give give that to yourself right before you leave the house.</v>

1821
01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.770
<v Speaker 41>How long does it last.</v>

1822
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:37.370
<v Speaker 55>It doesn't say just a few 5 seconds.</v>

<v Speaker 55>No.</v>

1826
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.760
<v Speaker 55>I don't know what it is.</v>

1827
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:43.330
<v Speaker 55>It's one spray releases.</v>

<v Speaker 18>How would you show me that they got some sportscaster some sportscaster got</v>

1831
01:26:55.971 --> 01:26:56.900
<v Speaker 18>pulled over for.</v>

1832
01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:58.713
<v Speaker 14>Is it Al Michaels.</v>

1833
01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:01.050
<v Speaker 14>I got pulled over and he was on the limit.</v>

1834
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:05.150
<v Speaker 31>It was absent at the limit 0 8 and 0 9.</v>

1835
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:06.800
<v Speaker 31>What happens then when you're out.</v>

1836
01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:07.940
<v Speaker 51>Here's a link.</v>

1837
01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:10.850
<v Speaker 51>Don't you first have to do the drug test.</v>

1838
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.330
<v Speaker 42>You know like you walk around like a buffoon and then if you fail that then you</v>

1839
01:27:14.331 --> 01:27:14.990
<v Speaker 42>have to do it.</v>

1840
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:18.410
<v Speaker 42>He obviously I guess showed signs that he can't do.</v>

1841
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:20.030
<v Speaker 42>You know balance on one foot.</v>

1842
01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:20.690
<v Speaker 42>You know so.</v>

1843
01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:21.710
<v Speaker 10>Well not necessarily.</v>

1844
01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.410
<v Speaker 10>They might have just asked him and he said he would take the test cause you only</v>

1845
01:27:24.411 --> 01:27:25.130
<v Speaker 10>had one drink.</v>

1846
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:25.860
<v Speaker 10>That's what he's saying.</v>

1847
01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:27.050
<v Speaker 10>Saying he only had one drink.</v>

1848
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:29.350
<v Speaker 10>I think that I read that note.</v>

1849
01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:30.050
<v Speaker 10>You know what.</v>

1850
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:31.550
<v Speaker 10>That's what the I'm sorry.</v>

1851
01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:33.830
<v Speaker 10>That's what Reese Witherspoon's husband said.</v>

1852
01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.270
<v Speaker 10>You got the wrong drunk.</v>

1853
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:40.110
<v Speaker 10>He said he only had one job but the Al Michaels guy he tested on the limit.</v>

1854
01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.810
<v Speaker 10>And he's a fuckin man's man.</v>

1855
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:43.190
<v Speaker 10>He's a fuckin sportscaster.</v>

1856
01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.070
<v Speaker 10>He told me that guy doesn't know how to drive when he's a little tipsy.</v>

1857
01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:47.533
<v Speaker 10>He's an 0 8.</v>

1858
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.290
<v Speaker 10>Let him go.</v>

1859
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:53.290
<v Speaker 10>You pussy don't you appreciate a good game of hockey being called by the maestro</v>

1860
01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:54.950
<v Speaker 10>and he let him go.</v>

1861
01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:57.680
<v Speaker 10>It's not like you're letting go of criminal 0 8.</v>

1862
01:27:57.830 --> 01:28:00.370
<v Speaker 9>Not something pro drinker that's a pro socialized.</v>

1863
01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.300
<v Speaker 9>Like I've known him since he was a baby.</v>

1864
01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:03.253
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1865
01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:04.093
<v Speaker 10>0 8.</v>

1866
01:28:04.130 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 10>The fuck out of here.</v>

1867
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.890
<v Speaker 10>What a pussy society we have.</v>

1868
01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.113
<v Speaker 10>That's not drunk.</v>

1869
01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.150
<v Speaker 10>OK if he's drunk.</v>

1870
01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:09.980
<v Speaker 10>Yeah for sure.</v>

1871
01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:11.810
<v Speaker 10>Arrest him asshole.</v>

1872
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:12.920
<v Speaker 10>That's ridiculous.</v>

1873
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.670
<v Speaker 10>People driving around drunk are assholes but people driving around that are</v>

1874
01:28:16.671 --> 01:28:18.440
<v Speaker 10>barely buzzed at 0 8.</v>

1875
01:28:18.650 --> 01:28:19.370
<v Speaker 10>Come on.</v>

1876
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:23.450
<v Speaker 10>How do I know that your body functions as good as mine does when I'm drunk.</v>

1877
01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.313
<v Speaker 10>How about that.</v>

1878
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:25.460
<v Speaker 10>Your reaction time.</v>

1879
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:26.340
<v Speaker 10>How good is your outlook.</v>

1880
01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:30.410
<v Speaker 10>How do I know you're not a dullard without with a slow right foot.</v>

1881
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:32.800
<v Speaker 3>You just can't get to that burger on time.</v>

1882
01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:39.930
<v Speaker 29>You know maybe Al Michaels could still even eat whatever he is 70 and still do a</v>

1883
01:28:40.461 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 29>solid two step hits that break like a champ.</v>

1884
01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:45.170
<v Speaker 29>Not saying he should drive drunk.</v>

1885
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:47.210
<v Speaker 29>I'm saying what's 0 8.</v>

1886
01:28:48.330 --> 01:28:49.300
<v Speaker 29>Looks like a drink right.</v>

1887
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.760
<v Speaker 29>Yeah pretty close yeah.</v>

1888
01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:56.300
<v Speaker 29>I would like to see what a 0 8 guy looks like performing stuff.</v>

1889
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:58.440
<v Speaker 29>You know I wouldn't like to see him go through that.</v>

1890
01:28:58.820 --> 01:28:59.480
<v Speaker 29>I would like to.</v>

1891
01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:02.060
<v Speaker 9>I'm sure he's always nowhere when he's calling the Super Bowl.</v>

1892
01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:03.790
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean bright you know.</v>

1893
01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:06.950
<v Speaker 2>You know one that doesn't count though here's the thing though is the adrenaline</v>

1894
01:29:06.951 --> 01:29:08.150
<v Speaker 2>that you get when you get pulled over.</v>

1895
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that would have some sort of a recuperative effect.</v>

1896
01:29:11.630 --> 01:29:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a little a little driving a little shitty cause you're kind of</v>

1897
01:29:15.141 --> 01:29:18.740
<v Speaker 2>hammered and you get pulled over and it might jolt you into a position where you</v>

1898
01:29:18.741 --> 01:29:22.790
<v Speaker 2>could possibly perform the test a little better than you could be but it's not</v>

1899
01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:23.840
<v Speaker 2>going to make you less drunk right.</v>

1900
01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:26.090
<v Speaker 29>So 0 8 is still in 0 8.</v>

1901
01:29:26.290 --> 01:29:27.123
<v Speaker 29>She blew it.</v>

1902
01:29:28.190 --> 01:29:33.190
<v Speaker 56>Yeah I think it's just entirely too low to blanket that that's considered a DUI.</v>

1903
01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:38.880
<v Speaker 56>Because I mean you know if you go out to dinner and you have a drink like a</v>

1904
01:29:39.021 --> 01:29:43.130
<v Speaker 56>margarita and a bartender like cause it's stronger than normal.</v>

1905
01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:47.270
<v Speaker 56>Are you saying that just having one margarita with dinner you should go to jail</v>

1906
01:29:47.290 --> 01:29:50.450
<v Speaker 56>and you know get all these things on your license that you think you know that</v>

1907
01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:53.120
<v Speaker 56>you're gonna run into a pile into a school of children.</v>

1908
01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:54.470
<v Speaker 56>Like I don't buy that.</v>

1909
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:56.190
<v Speaker 56>I think that's I think that's it.</v>

1910
01:29:56.570 --> 01:29:57.540
<v Speaker 56>I don't know I'm not a big fan.</v>

1911
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:58.850
<v Speaker 56>I think aging needs to change.</v>

1912
01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:02.330
<v Speaker 10>I think that's a dosage issue where you're talking about the dosage issue and</v>

1913
01:30:02.331 --> 01:30:04.820
<v Speaker 10>that they really should get in trouble if they're doing that.</v>

1914
01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:07.790
<v Speaker 10>I mean people don't want to get in trouble you go you go.</v>

1915
01:30:07.810 --> 01:30:09.530
<v Speaker 10>This proves the good the stiffest drinks.</v>

1916
01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.030
<v Speaker 5>You really should let people know what the fuck you serve them and if you're</v>

1917
01:30:14.031 --> 01:30:17.060
<v Speaker 5>serving them some margaritas It's got twice the alcohol in it you're trying to</v>

1918
01:30:17.061 --> 01:30:21.230
<v Speaker 5>get customers that way you could fuck somebody up if they know exactly how they</v>

1919
01:30:21.231 --> 01:30:24.800
<v Speaker 5>usually rocket you know they have this thing I'm good for one margarita and then</v>

1920
01:30:24.801 --> 01:30:26.840
<v Speaker 5>I back the fuck off and then I get home and I'm fine.</v>

1921
01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.320
<v Speaker 5>And then also the guys hand driving on.</v>

1922
01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:32.870
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't know what happens because you you say saying essentially like doubled</v>

1923
01:30:32.871 --> 01:30:33.560
<v Speaker 5>his dose.</v>

1924
01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.930
<v Speaker 51>Yeah I'm just saying it's way too low I think.</v>

1925
01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:37.400
<v Speaker 17>Yeah but not to you.</v>

1926
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:39.080
<v Speaker 17>I guess I see your point.</v>

1927
01:30:39.410 --> 01:30:40.040
<v Speaker 29>Definitely.</v>

1928
01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.930
<v Speaker 29>But I'm not convinced.</v>

1929
01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:46.160
<v Speaker 29>I don't have any data I want to see a guy who's at a weight go through all that</v>

1930
01:30:46.161 --> 01:30:46.700
<v Speaker 29>shit.</v>

1931
01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.340
<v Speaker 18>Is it based on what percentage you are.</v>

1932
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:49.260
<v Speaker 18>Your fine too.</v>

1933
01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:50.600
<v Speaker 18>You know I want to do it.</v>

1934
01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.080
<v Speaker 18>I want to.</v>

1935
01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.310
<v Speaker 18>I want not to get you guys together.</v>

1936
01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:53.203
<v Speaker 18>No.</v>

1937
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:54.303
<v Speaker 18>No I don't want to.</v>

1938
01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.680
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing I've been really careful about my entire life.</v>

1939
01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:03.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important to be safe when you're operating a vehicle.</v>

1940
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea that you would operate a vehicle with your body all fuck in half</v>

1941
01:31:08.241 --> 01:31:09.074
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1942
01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:13.300
<v Speaker 2>That's so scary to me it's so scary to be the driver it's so scary thinking that</v>

1943
01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:14.840
<v Speaker 2>so many people out there that are doing it.</v>

1944
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:20.110
<v Speaker 46>It's so selfish and stupid but I think that I would like to find out what it</v>

1945
01:31:22.191 --> 01:31:24.110
<v Speaker 46>feels like to be at 0 8.</v>

1946
01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:27.480
<v Speaker 10>And do you know any of those tests any of those lean.</v>

1947
01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:28.463
<v Speaker 10>I wouldn't know.</v>

1948
01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:32.750
<v Speaker 10>What is it like if they say like you know I'm not gonna drive but get me to the</v>

1949
01:31:32.751 --> 01:31:33.200
<v Speaker 10>limit.</v>

1950
01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.033
<v Speaker 10>Give me a breathalyzer.</v>

1951
01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.650
<v Speaker 10>OK you're at 0 8 now.</v>

1952
01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:39.410
<v Speaker 10>Like whether it's three drinks or two drinks and now make me do your stuff.</v>

1953
01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:40.910
<v Speaker 10>I want to know what it feels like.</v>

1954
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:43.130
<v Speaker 12>Buy you can buy a breathalyzer on Amazon you should do it.</v>

1955
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:44.750
<v Speaker 12>I don't want to do it because I don't want to.</v>

1956
01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:48.900
<v Speaker 12>I definitely don't want to drive by but I would like to drive on a course I</v>

1957
01:31:48.901 --> 01:31:53.310
<v Speaker 12>would like to go on a course and see like get me to 0 9 and let me see what I</v>

1958
01:31:53.311 --> 01:31:53.880
<v Speaker 12>can do.</v>

1959
01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:57.270
<v Speaker 56>I think you're gonna be surprised how exactly normal you're gonna be feeling.</v>

1960
01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:02.280
<v Speaker 10>I wonder why I wonder because I've been drunk and as of you I wonder.</v>

1961
01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:04.980
<v Speaker 10>I wonder what it's like to do that.</v>

1962
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:10.430
<v Speaker 14>Well I would but then again like telling people that 0 8 or 0 9 is the limit</v>

1963
01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:16.700
<v Speaker 14>means that's probably where most people who are not in the best shape or don't</v>

1964
01:32:16.891 --> 01:32:19.590
<v Speaker 14>have the best talents for alcohol where they start to falter.</v>

1965
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:23.970
<v Speaker 44>So if you make it a public policy that's probably a good idea to do it on the</v>

1966
01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:28.610
<v Speaker 44>conservative side you know ethnic humor you had a fun funny thing was talking</v>

1967
01:32:28.611 --> 01:32:30.950
<v Speaker 44>about like it should really be based on your tolerance and they should you</v>

1968
01:32:30.951 --> 01:32:34.960
<v Speaker 44>should have like a license that indicate their tolerance but that shit changes</v>

1969
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:35.260
<v Speaker 44>too.</v>

1970
01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:36.500
<v Speaker 44>Because dudes start falling apart.</v>

1971
01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:37.880
<v Speaker 36>Yeah.</v>

1972
01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:40.740
<v Speaker 36>You have to just take a license test Sara tolerance test once a year.</v>

1973
01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:44.780
<v Speaker 3>It's so incredibly irresponsible to tell people they can drink more.</v>

1974
01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:45.813
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1975
01:32:46.150 --> 01:32:50.120
<v Speaker 3>You know they tell people that the legal limit as is that you could drink a</v>

1976
01:32:50.121 --> 01:32:50.954
<v Speaker 3>little more.</v>

1977
01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:53.940
<v Speaker 53>Fuck just fucking green light.</v>

1978
01:32:54.630 --> 01:32:55.463
<v Speaker 53>I love that.</v>

1979
01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:57.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah and God dance like me boy.</v>

1980
01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.590
<v Speaker 5>I got tolerance like.</v>

1981
01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:01.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean think about like that my friend Justin.</v>

1982
01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:02.870
<v Speaker 5>Here's a perfect example.</v>

1983
01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:06.380
<v Speaker 5>You know my friend Justin said that seven foot tall did not find Justin's like a</v>

1984
01:33:06.381 --> 01:33:07.220
<v Speaker 5>legitimate giant.</v>

1985
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:08.083
<v Speaker 5>He's enormous.</v>

1986
01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:10.780
<v Speaker 5>And if you go drink for drink with him you're gonna die.</v>

1987
01:33:11.210 --> 01:33:13.170
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to die you're not the same species as him.</v>

1988
01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.940
<v Speaker 5>He's a completely different human being.</v>

1989
01:33:15.010 --> 01:33:17.210

01:34:28.931 --> 01:34:30.190
<v Speaker 41>booze alone.</v>

<v Speaker 29>Well I want to see the picture of his hand because it's so silly.</v>

2025
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:44.230
<v Speaker 9>You know Rowdy Roddy Piper started coming by the comedy store a couple of years</v>

2026
01:34:44.231 --> 01:34:47.410
<v Speaker 9>ago and once in a while he'll swing in and he's friends with a few of us there.</v>

2027
01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:51.550
<v Speaker 9>And man he's so great at hanging out and telling stories.</v>

2028
01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:55.050
<v Speaker 9>And one of the stories that he told us was about Andre the Giant.</v>

2029
01:34:55.110 --> 01:34:59.230
<v Speaker 9>Somebody was guys you know because they did the road together for a decade or</v>

2030
01:34:59.231 --> 01:34:59.380
<v Speaker 9>right.</v>

2031
01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:00.070
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

2032
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:05.070
<v Speaker 9>And he talks about how one time they were at a bar and there were these college</v>

2033
01:35:06.041 --> 01:35:09.370
<v Speaker 9>kids like you know fuck you Andre the Giant</v>

2034
01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:15.640
<v Speaker 9>that they're drinking beers at that one time a kid drinks a beer throws the</v>

2035
01:35:15.641 --> 01:35:18.040
<v Speaker 9>empty can at the back Andre the Giant said and he goes.</v>

2036
01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:19.240
<v Speaker 9>Don't do that again.</v>

2037
01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:23.380
<v Speaker 9>And then later on he takes an empty can and he throws it at the back onto the</v>

2038
01:35:23.381 --> 01:35:25.140
<v Speaker 9>giant's head and they do that and they all sure.</v>

2039
01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:26.733
<v Speaker 9>Oh my God.</v>

2040
01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.630
<v Speaker 9>And they all run outside.</v>

2041
01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:33.310
<v Speaker 9>Running away from Andre the Giant who got up and is now chasing them and they</v>

2042
01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:37.690
<v Speaker 9>all got in their car all at once but Andre caught up to the car before it drove</v>

2043
01:35:37.691 --> 01:35:39.580
<v Speaker 9>away and he just flipped.</v>

2044
01:35:39.730 --> 01:35:41.680
<v Speaker 9>He he picked up the coin as you hear the story.</v>

2045
01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:42.700
<v Speaker 9>Rowdy Roddy Piper.</v>

2046
01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:43.420
<v Speaker 9>Really.</v>

2047
01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:43.780
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2048
01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:46.000
<v Speaker 9>It's got to be a true story too even if it's not.</v>

2049
01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:46.953
<v Speaker 34>Let's let him tell it.</v>

2050
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:50.680
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that picture hilarious though him holding the beer can.</v>

2051
01:35:51.010 --> 01:35:52.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like a little bait.</v>

2052
01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like you ever see like a little kids refrigerators that they would fake</v>

2053
01:35:55.811 --> 01:35:56.260
<v Speaker 4>refrigerator.</v>

2054
01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.093
<v Speaker 4>That's what looks like.</v>

2055
01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.530
<v Speaker 41>One hundred and nineteen beers in six hours.</v>

2056
01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:00.730
<v Speaker 43>God that's what they're trying.</v>

2057
01:36:01.230 --> 01:36:02.110
<v Speaker 43>Yeah that's what he drank.</v>

2058
01:36:02.170 --> 01:36:03.003
<v Speaker 43>Yeah yeah.</v>

2059
01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.240
<v Speaker 43>How big was that guy.</v>

2060
01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:06.630
<v Speaker 49>What was his height and weight</v>

2061
01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.370
<v Speaker 49>7 1 7 foot 1.</v>

2062
01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.330
<v Speaker 17>And he wasn't just tall.</v>

2063
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:15.700
<v Speaker 17>He was enormous.</v>

2064
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:16.623
<v Speaker 17>Oh yeah.</v>

2065
01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:21.760
<v Speaker 49>God damn between 6 and 7 5 and over 5 some between 6 7 7 5 and over 500 pounds.</v>

2066
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:28.570
<v Speaker 10>And then I also saw some that's a very whole fucking they measure him right.</v>

2067
01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.950
<v Speaker 53>You know what the problem with that is wrestling they lie you know six foot</v>

2068
01:36:33.190 --> 01:36:38.190
<v Speaker 53>eleven 3000 pound twisted steel you know they lie just to make guys look bigger.</v>

2069
01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:44.200
<v Speaker 31>But that guy was like legitimately enormous like in a real wrestling match he</v>

2070
01:36:44.201 --> 01:36:45.034
<v Speaker 31>would beat everybody.</v>

2071
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:49.930
<v Speaker 9>I also heard a thing that that big body slam that was like from the big wrestle</v>

2072
01:36:49.931 --> 01:36:54.280
<v Speaker 9>mania to where Hulk Hogan body slams the ultimate bad guy Andre the Giant.</v>

2073
01:36:54.370 --> 01:36:54.850
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

2074
01:36:54.850 --> 01:36:59.020
<v Speaker 9>And it's like you could tell Andre the Giant jumps into it with all his might</v>

2075
01:36:59.030 --> 01:37:00.470
<v Speaker 9>and Hogan's just trying to.</v>

2076
01:37:00.610 --> 01:37:01.190
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2077
01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:03.070
<v Speaker 9>All he needs to do is go like that.</v>

2078
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:04.810
<v Speaker 9>It's amazing that he can even hold them up.</v>

2079
01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:09.160
<v Speaker 9>And he said that when he did that he could feel every disc in his back just go</v>

2080
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:10.690
<v Speaker 9>up up up up up up up up.</v>

2081
01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:11.500
<v Speaker 9>Hulk Hogan.</v>

2082
01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:11.980
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2083
01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:15.220
<v Speaker 9>And then he laid down Andre the Giant and he was just so glad that that was the</v>

2084
01:37:15.221 --> 01:37:18.250
<v Speaker 9>end of the match because he he ruined his back.</v>

2085
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:19.143
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2086
01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:21.220
<v Speaker 10>His back is fucked up now right.</v>

2087
01:37:22.190 --> 01:37:23.140
<v Speaker 10>He's had surgery.</v>

2088
01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:24.130
<v Speaker 8>All these guys are.</v>

2089
01:37:24.370 --> 01:37:28.210
<v Speaker 8>Those guys are unbelievable warriors because they were doing it every night and</v>

2090
01:37:28.211 --> 01:37:29.320
<v Speaker 8>sold out arenas.</v>

2091
01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:30.243
<v Speaker 8>You don't realize.</v>

2092
01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:30.670
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2093
01:37:30.670 --> 01:37:31.970
<v Speaker 8>They had to put on a show.</v>

2094
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:33.190
<v Speaker 8>They were going non-stop.</v>

2095
01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:37.990
<v Speaker 8>And like even Piper just like six or seven months ago he was by the store.</v>

2096
01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:42.760
<v Speaker 8>He would come in like once in a while every few days for you know just then.</v>

2097
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:43.790
<v Speaker 8>Anyway he could.</v>

2098
01:37:43.810 --> 01:37:47.410
<v Speaker 8>He kept going Oh my shoulder saw my shoulder so I'm going to the doctor on</v>

2099
01:37:47.411 --> 01:37:48.244
<v Speaker 8>Wednesday.</v>

2100
01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:50.470
<v Speaker 8>It's still worked out for four hours today.</v>

2101
01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:54.490
<v Speaker 8>Well my shoulder saw Hannah finding out that he had a technically broken his</v>

2102
01:37:54.491 --> 01:37:55.324
<v Speaker 8>neck.</v>

2103
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:58.990
<v Speaker 8>A broken neck and the doctor's like it's not your shoulder it's your neck and</v>

2104
01:37:58.991 --> 01:37:59.824
<v Speaker 8>it's broken.</v>

2105
01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:03.670
<v Speaker 10>So it was like pinching a nerve and Ryder was hurting his shoulder right.</v>

2106
01:38:03.970 --> 01:38:05.020
<v Speaker 9>But he he's just.</v>

2109
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:11.620

2129
01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.050
<v Speaker 30>I haven't watched wrestling.</v>

2130
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:53.260
<v Speaker 30>What you're doing is cyberbullying right now.</v>

2134
01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.290
<v Speaker 18>You know we all do you guys take our clothes off.</v>

2135
01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:06.270
<v Speaker 18>Yes.</v>

2136
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:06.550
<v Speaker 18>Right.</v>

2137
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:08.110
<v Speaker 18>Did you reenact the moves with lube.</v>

2138
01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:09.123
<v Speaker 18>Yes.</v>

2139
01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:13.240
<v Speaker 18>Hey what do you think about this CSPAN thing.</v>

2140
01:39:13.450 --> 01:39:16.660
<v Speaker 18>The bill that passed the House it's fucked up crazy scary.</v>

2141
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:21.550
<v Speaker 2>If you guys don't know about the House of Representatives passed Cisco which is</v>

2142
01:39:21.551 --> 01:39:26.551
<v Speaker 2>the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act by a 288 to 127 vote and it's</v>

2143
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:35.200
<v Speaker 2>the ideas supposedly that it's meant to enhance national security by</v>

2144
01:39:35.201 --> 01:39:40.201
<v Speaker 2>facilitating sharing of electronic information between like this quote between</v>

2145
01:39:40.511 --> 01:39:45.511
<v Speaker 2>say a private company and the government this is a story from media dot com and</v>

2146
01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:53.400
<v Speaker 2>the way they describe it is that if the government like say if a private company</v>

2147
01:39:54.671 --> 01:39:58.090
<v Speaker 2>in the government deemed threatening the bill's opponents maintain it will make</v>

2148
01:39:58.091 --> 01:40:03.091
<v Speaker 2>sharing of personal private information far too easy so I guess the idea is what</v>

2149
01:40:06.081 --> 01:40:11.081
<v Speaker 2>is it what is the main the main idea about behind this bill is that they're</v>

2150
01:40:11.331 --> 01:40:15.150
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to see every website you've ever visited every Web site will</v>

2151
01:40:15.170 --> 01:40:19.180
<v Speaker 2>have a bill to share the information of different people who have gone to them</v>

2152
01:40:19.190 --> 01:40:24.190
<v Speaker 2>that would just you know I have no idea what the exact specific thing is but</v>

2153
01:40:26.150 --> 01:40:27.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah it seems like that's what I was talking about.</v>

2154
01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:32.820
<v Speaker 57>But it isn't going to be vetoed by Obama.</v>

2155
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because he didn't have but he didn't veto the NDAA.</v>

2156
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:42.140
<v Speaker 2>You know I mean Obama is a hilarious kind of situation because he's super</v>

2157
01:40:43.231 --> 01:40:48.231
<v Speaker 2>intelligent he's half black he's you know from a single parent household but</v>

2158
01:40:49.770 --> 01:40:53.520
<v Speaker 2>he's still like votes just like the Republicans do.</v>

2159
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.540
<v Speaker 2>He still does stuff that the Republicans do like it's really strange.</v>

2160
01:40:58.070 --> 01:41:03.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like if he was a white guy people would be fuckin furious if he was a white</v>

2161
01:41:03.421 --> 01:41:07.980
<v Speaker 2>guy of privileged background and he made the choices that he's made as far as</v>

2162
01:41:07.981 --> 01:41:12.981
<v Speaker 2>like bailing out the banks as far as passing the NDAA not vetoing in all these</v>

2163
01:41:13.291 --> 01:41:16.140
<v Speaker 2>different things that have happened the drones all these different things that</v>

2164
01:41:16.141 --> 01:41:17.490
<v Speaker 2>have happened while he was in office.</v>

2165
01:41:17.730 --> 01:41:20.640
<v Speaker 2>If he was a white guy of privilege he would be getting crucified.</v>

2166
01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:22.013
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>

2167
01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:27.410
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the perfect plan like if you were a military strategist and</v>

2168
01:41:27.841 --> 01:41:31.020
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to take over the company you would do it with a situation like</v>

2169
01:41:31.021 --> 01:41:36.021
<v Speaker 2>that you wouldn't just go get some super elite rich guy you'd get some guy who</v>

2170
01:41:36.031 --> 01:41:41.031
<v Speaker 2>you would associate automatically with progressive liberal sensibilities and</v>

2171
01:41:43.441 --> 01:41:45.900
<v Speaker 2>then you do all that creepy shit right under his nose.</v>

2172
01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:46.960
<v Speaker 9>It's really interesting.</v>

2173
01:41:47.010 --> 01:41:49.190
<v Speaker 9>His big slogan was change yeah.</v>

2174
01:41:49.290 --> 01:41:53.760
<v Speaker 22>And looking back on it now it's like well he changed a little you know drone</v>

2175
01:41:53.761 --> 01:41:58.761
<v Speaker 22>attacks went from 50 up to like 300 changed a lot in Pakistan.</v>

2176
01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:03.150
<v Speaker 22>It's not funny but fuck man.</v>

2177
01:42:04.050 --> 01:42:09.050
<v Speaker 22>I don't know it's uh it's it's just seems like it if if he really could change</v>

2178
01:42:10.331 --> 01:42:10.630
<v Speaker 22>things.</v>

2179
01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:14.410
<v Speaker 21>If you really could like influence this society and how is the time to do</v>

2180
01:42:14.411 --> 01:42:19.411
<v Speaker 21>something you know instead of just these speeches sort of reactionary speeches</v>

2181
01:42:19.661 --> 01:42:22.480
<v Speaker 21>dealing with each and every issue whether it's Sandy Hook or whether it's</v>

2182
01:42:22.930 --> 01:42:27.930
<v Speaker 21>whether it's this Boston thing like wonder what if anything could be done to</v>

2183
01:42:31.281 --> 01:42:33.890
<v Speaker 21>sort of enact a</v>

2184
01:42:35.630 --> 01:42:40.630
<v Speaker 21>a change in a culture a plea for for a change in a culture.</v>

2185
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:45.760
<v Speaker 21>And if anybody could do that it's got to be the president.</v>

2186
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:48.160
<v Speaker 21>You know and the president addresses.</v>

2187
01:42:48.610 --> 01:42:53.610
<v Speaker 21>He does these national speeches where he addresses policies and he addresses not</v>

2188
01:42:55.631 --> 01:43:00.400
<v Speaker 21>national affairs as far as security affairs and then threats and various things</v>

2189
01:43:00.401 --> 01:43:01.234
<v Speaker 21>along those lines.</v>

2190
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:06.390
<v Speaker 21>But what this country's really fucking needs they need of a different not not a</v>

2191
01:43:09.951 --> 01:43:12.320
<v Speaker 21>different person but a different mantra.</v>

2192
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:15.410
<v Speaker 21>We need a new way of looking at things.</v>

2193
01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:16.700
<v Speaker 21>We need a speech.</v>

2194
01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:22.240
<v Speaker 21>We need something that gets people believe and we need an I have a dream that I</v>

2195
01:43:22.461 --> 01:43:26.810
<v Speaker 21>have a dream Martin Luther King's speech to this day.</v>

2196
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:28.030
<v Speaker 21>That shit resonates.</v>

2197
01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.390
<v Speaker 21>No one's doing the I Have A Dream today.</v>

2198
01:43:31.930 --> 01:43:33.100
<v Speaker 21>Everyone's doing the.</v>

2199
01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:38.080
<v Speaker 21>We're all gonna get along and change and hope and you know and make it more</v>

2200
01:43:38.081 --> 01:43:40.970
<v Speaker 21>affordable and healthcare for everyone.</v>

2201
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:42.260
<v Speaker 58>And gay marriage.</v>

2202
01:43:43.330 --> 01:43:48.330
<v Speaker 21>But no one has a speech about uniting humanity and getting us to understand that</v>

2203
01:43:51.370 --> 01:43:56.290
<v Speaker 21>our lives really are truly only better when people around us lives are better as</v>

2204
01:43:56.291 --> 01:44:01.070
<v Speaker 21>well and that United there's enough resources for everybody there's enough love</v>

2205
01:44:01.150 --> 01:44:03.730
<v Speaker 21>everybody is enough nuff health for everybody.</v>

2206
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:04.743
<v Speaker 21>There really is.</v>

2207
01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:10.090
<v Speaker 21>It's just the current system in the current ideology that we have is not based</v>

2208
01:44:10.091 --> 01:44:12.080
<v Speaker 21>on the reality that we're an expiring lifeform.</v>

2209
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:17.260
<v Speaker 21>And then we have a temporary time here on this planet and to waste it not being</v>

2210
01:44:17.261 --> 01:44:22.261
<v Speaker 21>aware of the full reality of the situation is a shame and a guy like Obama has</v>

2211
01:44:24.561 --> 01:44:29.150
<v Speaker 21>the opportunity to do that but he doesn't ever say anything like that.</v>

2212
01:44:29.690 --> 01:44:33.950
<v Speaker 21>He never says anything that really inspires people to look at it in a completely</v>

2213
01:44:33.951 --> 01:44:34.784
<v Speaker 21>different way.</v>

2214
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:39.110
<v Speaker 21>He never says anything like I think you have to.</v>

2215
01:44:39.230 --> 01:44:44.230
<v Speaker 21>If you're in a position to be the fucking President of the United States that's</v>

2216
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:48.110
<v Speaker 21>a position with very few human beings ever get to reach.</v>

2217
01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:50.240
<v Speaker 15>I mean maybe he will when he's leaving.</v>

2218
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:52.260
<v Speaker 15>Maybe we will once he leaves.</v>

2219
01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.810
<v Speaker 15>Maybe you can't when you're there.</v>

2220
01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:54.973
<v Speaker 15>I mean who knows.</v>

2221
01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:58.100
<v Speaker 15>I mean maybe it really is an incredibly restrictive environment.</v>

2222
01:44:58.130 --> 01:45:03.130
<v Speaker 21>And he has no room to free ball and no room to go outside of what they want him</v>

2223
01:45:04.551 --> 01:45:06.230
<v Speaker 21>to distribute as policy.</v>

2224
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:06.840
<v Speaker 21>I don't know.</v>

2225
01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:10.490
<v Speaker 21>Mean I don't know what the fuck the situation's like but if this world ever</v>

2226
01:45:10.491 --> 01:45:15.491
<v Speaker 21>needed someone to speak up and someone to just make some fucking sense someone</v>

2227
01:45:16.581 --> 01:45:21.581
<v Speaker 21>to make some sense and not talk politics you know not talk religion just talk</v>

2228
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:26.830
<v Speaker 21>humanity not talk nationalistic not talk conflict just make some sense.</v>

2229
01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:34.540
<v Speaker 36>Well I guess this is the you know this the same bill was vetoed last year by the</v>

2230
01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:40.300
<v Speaker 36>White House and it looks like you know it just it's one of those things that's</v>

2231
01:45:40.431 --> 01:45:43.040
<v Speaker 36>just poorly written and everyone knows that type thing.</v>

2232
01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:44.520
<v Speaker 39>So so is the India.</v>

2233
01:45:44.610 --> 01:45:47.630
<v Speaker 9>Unfortunately pass really hard through Congress.</v>

2234
01:45:48.110 --> 01:45:51.080
<v Speaker 9>The thing is it didn't pass as hard in Congress the first time.</v>

2235
01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:54.020
<v Speaker 9>Well I think that I read something about it this morning.</v>

2236
01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:56.990
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the way the government set up and I'm obviously not an expert on</v>

2237
01:45:56.991 --> 01:46:01.430
<v Speaker 2>government but I know that a lot of the the way it's set up is that you know we</v>

2238
01:46:01.431 --> 01:46:06.431
<v Speaker 2>have representatives and you know we can't all be there while policy is being</v>

2239
01:46:06.711 --> 01:46:10.340
<v Speaker 2>dictated so our representatives go there and they make sure that everything</v>

2240
01:46:10.341 --> 01:46:14.990
<v Speaker 2>represents their constituents but clearly a better way to do all that is the</v>

2241
01:46:14.991 --> 01:46:15.824
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>

2242
01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:17.970
<v Speaker 17>If anybody had to be phased out.</v>

2243
01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:22.430
<v Speaker 17>Oh it's the majority of politicians they're involved in making laws.</v>

2244
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 17>You could face those guys can get all new jobs you know.</v>

2245
01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:27.950
<v Speaker 9>Have you seen House of Cards.</v>

2246
01:46:28.190 --> 01:46:28.590
<v Speaker 9>No.</v>

2254
01:46:41.630 --> 01:46:44.900
<v Speaker 9>What they're actually doing and it's all just it's.</v>

2256
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.903
<v Speaker 9>It's all just deals.</v>

2258
01:46:50.481 --> 01:46:53.270
<v Speaker 9>third wall or whatever and just start flicking at the camera telling you what</v>

2259
01:46:53.271 --> 01:46:54.590
<v Speaker 9>he's thinking in the middle of scenes.</v>

2260
01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:55.160
<v Speaker 9>It's pretty.</v>

2261
01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:55.820
<v Speaker 9>It's really great.</v>

2262
01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:59.600
<v Speaker 14>Oh it's the there's everyone else freeze in the background freeze like they're</v>

2263
01:46:59.601 --> 01:47:01.530
<v Speaker 14>playing the game sort of pretty much.</v>

2264
01:47:01.570 --> 01:47:01.690
<v Speaker 14>There's</v>

2265
01:47:01.690 --> 01:47:06.020
<v Speaker 9>still still the you know they blur out but then it's just him just know it'll be</v>

2266
01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.040
<v Speaker 9>a cross meeting table from somebody like here's what I'm about to do and they</v>

2267
01:47:10.041 --> 01:47:11.780
<v Speaker 9>don't know it but here's how I'm going to do it.</v>

2268
01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:12.733
<v Speaker 9>Watch this.</v>

2269
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:16.070
<v Speaker 9>Oh and it's amazing it's really just politicking.</v>

2270
01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:20.210
<v Speaker 9>You learn a lot about you know even show business and networking overall from</v>

2271
01:47:20.450 --> 01:47:23.060
<v Speaker 9>how these politicians operate because that's all that they're doing is playing</v>

2272
01:47:23.061 --> 01:47:27.320
<v Speaker 9>gossip games and texting and it's a broken system and they're all criminals</v>

2273
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:28.670
<v Speaker 9>keeping us from the Internet.</v>

2274
01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:29.600
<v Speaker 14>That's what it is.</v>

2275
01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.840
<v Speaker 14>They're trying to tighten down on this fuckin system and what they don't want to</v>

2276
01:47:32.841 --> 01:47:37.010
<v Speaker 14>do is admit that this could all be handled way better with voting online.</v>

2277
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:38.210
<v Speaker 14>Let's do it that way.</v>

2278
01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.770
<v Speaker 14>Every person has an I.D.</v>

2279
01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.461
<v Speaker 14>every I.D.</v>

2280
01:47:40.461 --> 01:47:42.440
<v Speaker 14>is just like your fucking social security card.</v>

2281
01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:45.740
<v Speaker 14>Yet only do it once boom and you vote online.</v>

2282
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:46.663
<v Speaker 8>Yep.</v>

2283
01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:49.160
<v Speaker 8>And when that happens that's when things get good.</v>

2284
01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:50.530
<v Speaker 14>You can't control that bitch.</v>

2285
01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:51.950
<v Speaker 14>You can't you can't control that.</v>

2286
01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:52.730
<v Speaker 14>They'll deal.</v>

2287
01:47:52.730 --> 01:47:54.140
<v Speaker 14>They'll never allow something like that.</v>

2288
01:47:54.170 --> 01:47:55.080
<v Speaker 14>They will fight it till death.</v>

2289
01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:57.610
<v Speaker 14>That literally might be where the revolution lies.</v>

2290
01:47:57.810 --> 01:48:00.770
<v Speaker 14>I is getting people to vote online because they would essentially be giving up</v>

2291
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:05.830
<v Speaker 14>all of their tricks but they've been using over the past decades to manipulate</v>

2292
01:48:06.110 --> 01:48:07.400
<v Speaker 14>how ah ah ah.</v>

2293
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.870
<v Speaker 14>People are picked how our presidents picked how laws are passed and all that</v>

2294
01:48:11.871 --> 01:48:14.600
<v Speaker 14>shit has been manipulated everything should be done the popular vote now.</v>

2295
01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:48:15.170 --> 01:48:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it a fascinating idea that there would so try hard.</v>

2297
01:48:18.130 --> 01:48:20.030
<v Speaker 2>They would try so fucking hard to avoid.</v>

2298
01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah that would be like a real tipping point.</v>

2299
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:26.130
<v Speaker 2>This country will really realize we're being run by vampires.</v>

2300
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2301
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.320
<v Speaker 11>Like how quickly they would fuckin shriek into the dark corners of the room when</v>

2302
01:48:31.321 --> 01:48:34.290
<v Speaker 11>you open the drapes and take a good look at the real scenario.</v>

2303
01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.420
<v Speaker 11>Then I try to like give the people what they want.</v>

2304
01:48:36.450 --> 01:48:38.470
<v Speaker 11>They're trying to profit off the current system.</v>

2305
01:48:38.970 --> 01:48:41.050
<v Speaker 11>The current corrupt system as in place got.</v>

2306
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:44.790
<v Speaker 11>Tony you need to write your clean young man you can run for president.</v>

2307
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:48.960
<v Speaker 39>You're very likeable could probably pull it off.</v>

2308
01:48:49.050 --> 01:48:49.650
<v Speaker 27>You think you could.</v>

2309
01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:52.650
<v Speaker 27>There was a period of time when I was a kid and I wanted to but you wanted to be</v>

2310
01:48:52.651 --> 01:48:53.400
<v Speaker 27>president at one point.</v>

2311
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:54.390
<v Speaker 10>Time for a little moment.</v>

2312
01:48:54.450 --> 01:48:55.770
<v Speaker 10>Did you fall on your head or something.</v>

2313
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:57.960
<v Speaker 10>What made you want to be president.</v>

2314
01:48:59.040 --> 01:48:59.700
<v Speaker 10>How do you get sick.</v>

2315
01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:00.420
<v Speaker 10>We deliver now.</v>

2316
01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:02.760
<v Speaker 9>I thought it was just very very young.</v>

2317
01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:03.600
<v Speaker 9>I thought it was going.</v>

2318
01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:04.680
<v Speaker 9>Did you have the fever.</v>

2319
01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:05.460
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2320
01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:06.300
<v Speaker 9>The president's fever.</v>

2321
01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:08.190
<v Speaker 9>He had the president's fever.</v>

2322
01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:12.420
<v Speaker 9>You know when we all go through that score and sixteen you're lying in your bed</v>

2323
01:49:12.421 --> 01:49:13.254
<v Speaker 9>dying.</v>

2324
01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:14.690
<v Speaker 9>Yeah I got obsessed with.</v>

2325
01:49:15.210 --> 01:49:18.510
<v Speaker 9>There was a period where as a kid I was obsessed with like the Declaration of</v>

2326
01:49:18.511 --> 01:49:20.640
<v Speaker 9>Independence and how it came to be in like a hole.</v>

2327
01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:21.090
<v Speaker 9>I read it.</v>

2328
01:49:21.090 --> 01:49:24.660
<v Speaker 9>I remember reading a whole book about John Hancock when I started practicing my</v>

2329
01:49:24.661 --> 01:49:25.710
<v Speaker 9>signature all the time.</v>

2330
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:29.670
<v Speaker 9>I was obsessed with John and I thought that was so cool that this guy had the</v>

2331
01:49:29.671 --> 01:49:32.940
<v Speaker 9>balls to be like here you go here I am and I did this.</v>

2332
01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:36.030
<v Speaker 9>Who would be the first person to be president that doesn't have the fake</v>

2333
01:49:36.031 --> 01:49:40.950
<v Speaker 9>president voice who'll be the first person that just talks to everybody a person</v>

2334
01:49:40.951 --> 01:49:45.951
<v Speaker 9>who changes the world who doesn't have a way of speaking with long vague pauses</v>

2335
01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:50.640
<v Speaker 9>when I believe what I believe for you.</v>

2336
01:49:51.450 --> 01:49:55.890
<v Speaker 10>And for me and for our great nation is that we must unite.</v>

2337
01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:01.410
<v Speaker 10>Imagine if it is it's so bizarre that fucking guy was over your house bitch why</v>

2338
01:50:01.411 --> 01:50:02.244
<v Speaker 10>are you talking like that.</v>

2339
01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:06.750
<v Speaker 10>Why are you talking this fake stupid voice but you get away with that when it's</v>

2340
01:50:06.751 --> 01:50:08.820
<v Speaker 10>a big group of people and you're a politician.</v>

2341
01:50:09.150 --> 01:50:12.870
<v Speaker 15>We know that you're talking in the fake us most old school way possible.</v>

2342
01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:15.210
<v Speaker 15>You might as well be in the theater you dummy.</v>

2343
01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:18.030
<v Speaker 17>It might as well be in the theater back when they didn't have microphones when</v>

2344
01:50:18.031 --> 01:50:20.040
<v Speaker 17>they just have to shout out their stupid lines.</v>

2345
01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:24.480
<v Speaker 35>Imagine a strip club deejay being the president just shook up deejay with no</v>

2346
01:50:24.481 --> 01:50:28.590
<v Speaker 35>microphones coming up to the main stage.</v>

2347
01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.350
<v Speaker 28>It's time</v>

2348
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:36.240
<v Speaker 28>and then a bunch of banjo players behind have the music because you don't have</v>

2349
01:50:36.241 --> 01:50:37.460
<v Speaker 28>electricity do they.</v>

2350
01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:39.840
<v Speaker 35>I country at a bomb threat.</v>

2351
01:50:41.130 --> 01:50:45.780
<v Speaker 14>I got more information or more evidence to the poor people that think that I'm</v>

2352
01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:47.010
<v Speaker 14>in league with the devil.</v>

2353
01:50:47.490 --> 01:50:50.790
<v Speaker 14>I wore this t shirt on Fox.</v>

2354
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:54.240
<v Speaker 14>It was the Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia.</v>

2355
01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:58.980
<v Speaker 14>They when I ordered the DVD they found out we talked about on the podcast so the</v>

2356
01:50:58.981 --> 01:51:02.610
<v Speaker 14>people that make it they sent me these cool T-shirts and one of them was that</v>

2357
01:51:02.611 --> 01:51:07.590
<v Speaker 14>famous picture of Nixon meeting Elvis leather shaking hands but they replaced</v>

2358
01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:12.000
<v Speaker 14>Elvis's head with Jessica White and Nixon with the devil himself and says like</v>

2359
01:51:12.001 --> 01:51:17.001
<v Speaker 14>the devil and so just go and I wore nuts on Fox and I got like a hundred tweets</v>

2360
01:51:17.011 --> 01:51:17.270
<v Speaker 14>go.</v>

2361
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:19.620
<v Speaker 10>What the fuck are you wearing on TV.</v>

2362
01:51:20.010 --> 01:51:24.510
<v Speaker 10>I didn't even think about it but for a good portion of this knucklehead country.</v>

2363
01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:29.540
<v Speaker 10>If you have a shirt on that has a devil's face it says the devil like these</v>

2364
01:51:29.971 --> 01:51:34.971
<v Speaker 10>dummies actually think that you like you're you're down with the devil like the</v>

2365
01:51:35.071 --> 01:51:40.071
<v Speaker 10>devil and that's what that's where we draw the line in this kooky country even</v>

2366
01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:45.320
<v Speaker 10>even you know even religious people like you can say that you believe in God</v>

2367
01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.750
<v Speaker 10>you're allowed to say that you even want to say that God talk to me.</v>

2368
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:51.090
<v Speaker 10>You know I saw a guy say that the other day didn't even bother me.</v>

2369
01:51:51.390 --> 01:51:53.490
<v Speaker 10>There was a guy that was in Austin Texas.</v>

2370
01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:54.840
<v Speaker 10>There was a guy that was at a red light.</v>

2371
01:51:55.170 --> 01:51:55.860
<v Speaker 14>He was begging.</v>

2372
01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:57.210
<v Speaker 14>He had a cardboard thing.</v>

2373
01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:00.840
<v Speaker 14>And the guy in the car rolled down the window said Hey man.</v>

2374
01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:02.920
<v Speaker 14>God just talk to me and told me I should give you this.</v>

2375
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:04.140
<v Speaker 14>And he gave the guy 20 bucks.</v>

2376
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:10.220
<v Speaker 10>That doesn't bother me but if the guys roll down that window it Hey man I was</v>

2377
01:52:10.221 --> 01:52:13.970
<v Speaker 10>just speaking to Satan and he thought you could use this to party with me.</v>

2378
01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:17.890
<v Speaker 10>You're not talking to Satan anybody believes in Satan as an asshole like you're</v>

2379
01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:18.920
<v Speaker 10>allowed to believe in God.</v>

2380
01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:22.370
<v Speaker 10>But if you say you believe in Satan everybody tells you to go fuck yourself.</v>

2381
01:52:22.610 --> 01:52:26.450
<v Speaker 46>You have to be like way deep in cuckoo for cocoa pops.</v>

2384
01:52:33.110 --> 01:52:36.020
<v Speaker 14>Have you ever met someone who actually believed in Satan and you didn't know</v>

2385
01:52:36.021 --> 01:52:37.790
<v Speaker 14>that they believed in Satan until you got to know them.</v>

2386
01:52:38.130 --> 01:52:41.450
<v Speaker 14>I mean you know like shit I feel like I've met a couple of people that really</v>

2387
01:52:41.451 --> 01:52:42.560
<v Speaker 14>wanted to be different.</v>

2388
01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:44.990
<v Speaker 9>And I couldn't pull it off though.</v>

2389
01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:49.810
<v Speaker 2>You know they don't have the commitment I met a girl once and she was with her</v>

2390
01:52:49.811 --> 01:52:53.530
<v Speaker 2>sister and it was total innocent conversation.</v>

2391
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:56.250
<v Speaker 2>You know nothing nothing crazy.</v>

2392
01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:01.380
<v Speaker 2>God said it was totally normal and she brought up something I think it had to do</v>

2393
01:53:01.901 --> 01:53:02.734
<v Speaker 2>with gay marriage.</v>

2394
01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it had to do with that and it was something about a bill being passed</v>

2395
01:53:06.890 --> 01:53:10.780
<v Speaker 2>and it was many many years ago so my memory's a little foggy but I do remember</v>

2396
01:53:10.781 --> 01:53:12.820
<v Speaker 2>this whenever the controversy was.</v>

2397
01:53:13.090 --> 01:53:15.640
<v Speaker 2>She said she goes it's not God's way.</v>

2398
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:20.660
<v Speaker 2>And I said I remember like stopping and like all the sudden going whoa what</v>

2399
01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:21.980
<v Speaker 2>would happen with this conversation.</v>

2400
01:53:22.010 --> 01:53:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Like what did you just say.</v>

2401
01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:24.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not it's not God's way.</v>

2402
01:53:24.610 --> 01:53:25.720
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what God's way is.</v>

2403
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Do you do you really talk to God.</v>

2404
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Like where are you getting this from.</v>

2405
01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:32.890
<v Speaker 2>And she goes Oh that's Satan's his scales have covered your eyes.</v>

2406
01:53:33.610 --> 01:53:38.200
<v Speaker 2>She actually said that to me his scales have cut and I'll never forget me</v>

2407
01:53:38.201 --> 01:53:40.980
<v Speaker 2>looking at her and her sister and god damn you crazy bitches.</v>

01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:42.730
<v Speaker 2>And the girl was.</v>

2410
01:53:42.730 --> 01:53:43.990
<v Speaker 2>She was so pretty too.</v>

2411
01:53:44.170 --> 01:53:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God she's beautiful.</v>

2416
01:53:56.530 --> 01:53:57.730
<v Speaker 2>We have so much work to do here.</v>

2417
01:53:57.970 --> 01:54:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking on this project like to just just to communicate with you and get</v>

2418
01:54:01.691 --> 01:54:04.570
<v Speaker 2>you to a point of rational objective thinking.</v>

2419
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:07.230
<v Speaker 2>We take three for mushroom trips right.</v>

2420
01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:09.560
<v Speaker 36>Have you heard of a guy named Pier Popoff.</v>

2421
01:54:10.030 --> 01:54:11.110
<v Speaker 36>He's a pastor.</v>

2422
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:12.780
<v Speaker 36>He's televangelist guys.</v>

2423
01:54:12.970 --> 01:54:13.803
<v Speaker 36>What did he do.</v>

2424
01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:14.643
<v Speaker 51>Blow some money.</v>

2425
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:18.280
<v Speaker 51>I saw him the other day I watched I was sleeping on the couch and I woke up in</v>

2426
01:54:18.281 --> 01:54:23.281
<v Speaker 51>his head when the shows are not paid shows commercials and I was amazed what</v>

2427
01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.820
<v Speaker 51>woke me up because I was kind of like half listening to while sleeping.</v>

2428
01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:31.840
<v Speaker 51>What was amazing how the things that they sang it just seemed illegal like they</v>

2429
01:54:31.841 --> 01:54:35.590
<v Speaker 51>were like you like oh you know we're gonna sing you some miracle water.</v>

2430
01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:39.010
<v Speaker 51>This water is you know miracle water you're going to open up these envelopes.</v>

2431
01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:42.760
<v Speaker 51>And then they start showing Mike testimonials like a people and they're like You</v>

2432
01:54:42.761 --> 01:54:45.190
<v Speaker 51>know I sent in my or I read the letters.</v>

2433
01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:49.510
<v Speaker 51>And then just a week later I got a new house in a car and then the next person</v>

2434
01:54:49.511 --> 01:54:51.550
<v Speaker 51>was like I got two hundred thousand dollars.</v>

2435
01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:55.300
<v Speaker 51>And then his other one like a guy just walked up and gave me a check for 15</v>

2436
01:54:55.301 --> 01:54:58.660
<v Speaker 51>million dollars and it was it was like the most fake shit ever.</v>

2437
01:54:58.930 --> 01:55:02.800
<v Speaker 51>And so then I started really researching this guy and there's all these videos</v>

2438
01:55:02.801 --> 01:55:03.640
<v Speaker 51>about him online.</v>

2439
01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:08.560
<v Speaker 51>I guess he's been ripping people off for a long time and one of the best videos</v>

2440
01:55:08.770 --> 01:55:12.960
<v Speaker 51>is one where he just goes up and he goes where's where so-and-so so-and-so is</v>

<v Speaker 51>One of the Scott things that this Peter Popoff does.</v>

2509
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:06.510
<v Speaker 51>He also sends you a barley cake from the Bible where it's like kind of like that</v>

<v Speaker 15>of the North a great cloud and a fire in folding itself in brightness was about</v>

2570
02:00:50.371 --> 02:00:55.371
<v Speaker 15>it and out of the midst thereof as the color of Amber out of the midst of the</v>

2571
02:00:56.161 --> 02:00:58.090
<v Speaker 15>fire OK.</v>

2572
02:00:58.180 --> 02:00:59.013
<v Speaker 22>House audio file</v>

2573
02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:01.300
<v Speaker 22>hmm.</v>

2574
02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:04.470

2576
02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:11.310
<v Speaker 15>And this also out of the midst there of came the likeness of four living</v>

2577
02:01:11.311 --> 02:01:13.800
<v Speaker 15>creatures and this was their appearance.</v>

2578
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:15.540
<v Speaker 15>They had the likeness of a man.</v>

2579
02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:17.053
<v Speaker 15>Whoa.</v>

2580
02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:22.580
<v Speaker 15>After everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their feet were</v>

2581
02:01:23.011 --> 02:01:27.780
<v Speaker 15>straight and the sole of their feet was like the soul of a calf's foot and they</v>

2582
02:01:27.930 --> 02:01:31.260
<v Speaker 15>sparkled like the color of burnished brass.</v>

2583
02:01:31.770 --> 02:01:32.940
<v Speaker 15>What a trippy book.</v>

2584
02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:34.890
<v Speaker 15>People like Oh my God it's so real.</v>

2585
02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:37.560
<v Speaker 17>I hear God's words when you're saying these things.</v>

2586
02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:42.240
<v Speaker 17>God is speaking to me through your words please read on and they had the hands</v>

2587
02:01:42.241 --> 02:01:46.980
<v Speaker 17>of man under their wings on their four sides and they had and therefore had</v>

2588
02:01:46.981 --> 02:01:47.850
<v Speaker 17>their faces in their ways.</v>

2589

<v Speaker 10>Somebody might have just made all this up and me like an asshole is reading this</v>

2592
02:01:57.870 --> 02:01:58.703

2593
02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.000
<v Speaker 39>I'm not reading any further.</v>

2597
02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:10.410
<v Speaker 51>They walked up with their four faces and they said Why are you guys cooking</v>

2598

<v Speaker 51>things in shit.</v>

2599
02:02:11.730 --> 02:02:15.420
<v Speaker 15>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of</v>

2600
02:02:15.421 --> 02:02:16.254
<v Speaker 15>lightning.</v>

2601
02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:20.190
<v Speaker 15>Now as I behold the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth by the</v>

2602
02:02:20.191 --> 02:02:22.770
<v Speaker 15>living creatures with his four faces.</v>

2603

2610
02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:43.460
<v Speaker 15>When those went these went and when those stood still these stood and when those</v>

2611
02:02:43.651 --> 02:02:46.290
<v Speaker 15>were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up.</v>

2612
02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:48.380
<v Speaker 15>That guy is this glass all alien.</v>

2613
02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:49.980
<v Speaker 15>That guy is just that's word salad.</v>

2614
02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.000
<v Speaker 15>That guy's high as fuck.</v>

2615
02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:53.430
<v Speaker 15>He just ramblin high as fuck.</v>

2616
02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:57.210
<v Speaker 40>I said the same thing in Joshua Tree one time and this is the stuff by the way</v>

2617
02:02:57.211 --> 02:02:59.490
<v Speaker 40>that they kept in you know.</v>

2618
02:02:59.550 --> 02:03:03.150
<v Speaker 10>I mean think about that like especially in the New Testament the New Testament.</v>

2619
02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:06.840
<v Speaker 10>They they had to like have like meetings inside Ed what's in there.</v>

2620
02:03:07.110 --> 02:03:07.320
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>

2621
02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:11.510
<v Speaker 18>Leave this if you look at two crazy if you look at that is it go for twelve</v>

2622
02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:11.820
<v Speaker 18>quote.</v>

2623
02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:15.810
<v Speaker 18>Now it's totally changed has nothing to do like really lately different.</v>

2624
02:03:15.870 --> 02:03:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh they've altered the quote Well you know it also it's probably so hard.</v>

2625
02:03:19.330 --> 02:03:20.960
<v Speaker 2>You should talk to a linguist right.</v>

2626
02:03:21.090 --> 02:03:25.260
<v Speaker 2>You know I talked to a language scholar the other day ironically enough for a</v>

2627
02:03:25.261 --> 02:03:26.094
<v Speaker 2>Bigfoot show.</v>

2628
02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:31.640
<v Speaker 2>And if you talked to a linguist they'll tell you that it started off it was a</v>

2629
02:03:32.461 --> 02:03:36.420
<v Speaker 2>spoken story for the longest time before anyone even wrote it down.</v>

2630
02:03:36.690 --> 02:03:40.770
<v Speaker 2>And the the bible must many of the stories in the Bible probably existed before</v>

2631
02:03:40.771 --> 02:03:43.500
<v Speaker 2>language or before written language.</v>

2632
02:03:44.010 --> 02:03:48.690
<v Speaker 2>So like like a lot of the stories in the Bible also they're like really similar</v>

2633
02:03:48.691 --> 02:03:50.700
<v Speaker 2>to the same stories of ancient Mesopotamia.</v>

2634
02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2635
02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Like somewhere and like the epic of Gilgamesh is like really close to the epic</v>

2636
02:03:55.111 --> 02:03:56.160
<v Speaker 2>of Noah Noah's Ark.</v>

2637
02:03:56.190 --> 02:03:58.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's really like a lot of similarities.</v>

2638
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah in a lot of the stories.</v>

2639
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.440
<v Speaker 2>So they had to write it down the road down and probably let's say the first ship</v>

2640
02:04:04.441 --> 02:04:08.070
<v Speaker 2>was the Sumerians so they wrote it down and I think it's called cuneiform or</v>

2641
02:04:08.071 --> 02:04:08.904
<v Speaker 2>cuneiform.</v>

2642
02:04:08.970 --> 02:04:13.470
<v Speaker 2>They wrote it down then and then eventually it became ancient Hebrew and then</v>

2643
02:04:13.530 --> 02:04:18.530
<v Speaker 2>they're going to translate it ancient Hebrew to Latin and then as translated to</v>

2644
02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Greek as translated to English like they had to fuck it up in a lot of ways</v>

2645
02:04:24.151 --> 02:04:24.984
<v Speaker 2>along the way.</v>

2646
02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:27.660
<v Speaker 2>When you deal with some wacky ass languages.</v>

2647
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Q Matt I mean how many people even exist and know how to convert all that shit.</v>

2648
02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:34.140
<v Speaker 14>Yeah I mean languages are lost.</v>

2649
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:34.590
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

2650
02:04:34.590 --> 02:04:38.700
<v Speaker 14>And when they go over the the dead sea scrolls is the real trip factory.</v>

2651
02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:42.720
<v Speaker 14>Read some of the shit that's in the dead sea scrolls the dead sea scrolls of the</v>

2652
02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:47.750
<v Speaker 14>oldest version of the Bible by far by almost a thousand years I think it was</v>

2653
02:04:47.761 --> 02:04:52.761
<v Speaker 14>found in a place called Kumbh Ron in these these caves in the side of a mountain</v>

2654
02:04:53.491 --> 02:04:58.160
<v Speaker 14>like a side of a hill and these caves have these clay pots and in them with</v>

2655
02:04:58.161 --> 02:05:01.530
<v Speaker 14>these they literally made out of animal skins and it's the oldest stories of the</v>

2656
02:05:01.531 --> 02:05:06.531
<v Speaker 14>Bible and it's all trippy fucking shit it's all you read it and you go it makes</v>

2657
02:05:07.981 --> 02:05:10.270
<v Speaker 14>Ezekiel sound normal right.</v>

2658
02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:14.850
<v Speaker 39>And it's so nutty that even though it's the oldest version of the Bible they're</v>

2659
02:05:14.851 --> 02:05:17.310
<v Speaker 39>very resistant to release it.</v>

2660
02:05:17.670 --> 02:05:20.790
<v Speaker 39>And I like to say oh we're going to revise the bible now according to the dead</v>

2661
02:05:20.791 --> 02:05:21.624
<v Speaker 39>sea scrolls.</v>

2662
02:05:21.650 --> 02:05:22.483
<v Speaker 39>They're like you know what.</v>

2663
02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:23.850
<v Speaker 39>We've been reading this for a while.</v>

2664
02:05:23.890 --> 02:05:26.130
<v Speaker 39>Maybe we need to fucking just bury this bitch</v>

2665
02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:32.700
<v Speaker 39>because that's where that guy John Marco Allegro who's the the dead sea scrolls</v>

2666
02:05:35.691 --> 02:05:36.230
<v Speaker 39>guy.</v>

2667
02:05:36.230 --> 02:05:38.870
<v Speaker 11>He was like the head translator for the dead sea scrolls.</v>

2668
02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:40.610
<v Speaker 11>He said the whole thing was about mushrooms.</v>

2669
02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:44.480
<v Speaker 11>He his he wrote a book called The Sacred mushroom in the cross.</v>

2670
02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:48.950
<v Speaker 11>He was the only scholar on the whole dead sea scrolls committee that was</v>

2671
02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:50.060
<v Speaker 11>agnostic.</v>

2672
02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:53.660
<v Speaker 11>He was ordained minister but then studying theology realized it was horseshit</v>

<v Speaker 4>company that saw it last night and he said is really interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Myanmar.</v>

2693
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:44.103
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2694
02:06:44.150 --> 02:06:45.680
<v Speaker 2>So this dead sea scrolls.</v>

2695
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:51.550
<v Speaker 2>This guy John Marco Allegro said after like 14 years of study that the entire</v>

2696
02:06:52.281 --> 02:06:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Christian religion was really about fertility rituals and mushrooms.</v>

2697
02:06:58.010 --> 02:07:01.790
<v Speaker 2>It was about tripping balls on psychedelic mushrooms and it was about fertility</v>

2698
02:07:01.791 --> 02:07:06.791
<v Speaker 2>treatments and fertility festivals and that they would fertility rituals and</v>

2699
02:07:07.311 --> 02:07:11.660
<v Speaker 2>that like becoming pregnant was like the most important thing like keeping a</v>

2700
02:07:11.661 --> 02:07:15.830
<v Speaker 2>baby alive is really difficult and becoming pregnant and having you know a child</v>

2701
02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:17.770
<v Speaker 2>was like the most important thing to look forward to.</v>

2702
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a serious urgency to having children because people were fragile</v>

2703
02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:28.240
<v Speaker 2>you know and they also knew a lot about the indigenous psychedelic plants and</v>

2704
02:07:30.351 --> 02:07:34.070
<v Speaker 2>especially what they think the Amanita miscarry mushroom he thinks was one of</v>

2705
02:07:34.071 --> 02:07:37.190
<v Speaker 2>the big ones that these people just didn't want anybody else to know about it so</v>

2706
02:07:37.191 --> 02:07:38.300
<v Speaker 2>they hid their stories.</v>

2707
02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:43.660
<v Speaker 2>They hit him in parables and you know they hid the how they know what their</v>

2708
02:07:44.331 --> 02:07:46.280
<v Speaker 2>history of the use of this stuff.</v>

2709
02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting stuff that I'm way too stupid to understand whether he's</v>

2710
02:07:49.221 --> 02:07:51.140
<v Speaker 2>right or whether the other people are right.</v>

2711
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:55.640
<v Speaker 2>But the guy is a legit scholar you know he's not a stoner he's not like one of</v>

2712
02:07:55.641 --> 02:07:57.390
<v Speaker 2>those guys is trying to justify mushroom use.</v>

2713
02:07:57.430 --> 02:08:02.430
<v Speaker 8>There is something the Times that I've tried mushrooms in which I know it sounds</v>

2714
02:08:02.991 --> 02:08:05.480
<v Speaker 8>stereotypical but I really think there's something there.</v>

2715
02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:10.780
<v Speaker 8>I mean there's like definitely beyond science and rationale and what I've been</v>

2716
02:08:11.421 --> 02:08:16.160
<v Speaker 8>told to expect in this and that there's something there's something extra wild</v>

2717
02:08:16.161 --> 02:08:21.161
<v Speaker 8>about him and you know nothing's really that great as when you can really enjoy</v>

2718
02:08:24.081 --> 02:08:24.710
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

2719
02:08:24.710 --> 02:08:29.710
<v Speaker 8>Yeah and and it makes for everything I mean luckily you know they're finally</v>

2720
02:08:30.621 --> 02:08:34.100
<v Speaker 8>coming out with these studies that are showing what it's doing for depression</v>

2721
02:08:34.101 --> 02:08:39.101
<v Speaker 8>and anxiety and it's it's super natural cure at times for people even with what</v>

2722
02:08:42.201 --> 02:08:43.034
<v Speaker 8>they called.</v>

2723
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:46.390
<v Speaker 8>What are they come when it's a lifelong diagnosis.</v>

2724
02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:48.110
<v Speaker 8>Chronic depression.</v>

2725
02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:51.710
<v Speaker 10>I mean people have bounced out of it when they thought that they were going to</v>

2726
02:08:51.711 --> 02:08:54.920
<v Speaker 10>be miserable for the rest of their lives it's like Oh thanks a real</v>

2727
02:08:54.921 --> 02:08:59.921
<v Speaker 10>consciousness reset on a real life a real one not not not just like blowing on</v>

2728
02:09:00.021 --> 02:09:03.350
<v Speaker 10>your hand and pretending you feel better it's it's real it's legit.</v>

2729
02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:07.940
<v Speaker 19>Listen to some of the shit that's in the dead sea scrolls by the way.</v>

2730
02:09:08.190 --> 02:09:10.910
<v Speaker 19>There is people that are working really hard to try to turn that around as of</v>

2731
02:09:10.930 --> 02:09:15.450
<v Speaker 19>the John Hopkins study and yeah my friend Aubrey was just at maps the</v>

2732
02:09:15.890 --> 02:09:19.430
<v Speaker 19>psychedelic meaning whatever the hell it is I forget what the what it was I</v>

2733
02:09:19.431 --> 02:09:20.390
<v Speaker 19>stand for maps.</v>

2734
02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Same map psychedelic I should know because they're doing a lot of really good</v>

2735
02:09:27.911 --> 02:09:32.800
<v Speaker 2>work and letting people know it Intel multidisciplinary Association for</v>

2736
02:09:32.801 --> 02:09:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelic Studies and you know they're they're hitting them with hard science</v>

2737
02:09:36.281 --> 02:09:39.280
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again and showing how many people it can be beneficial</v>

2738
02:09:39.281 --> 02:09:43.120
<v Speaker 2>for which model and a lot of people that are trying to hold back those people</v>

2739
02:09:43.121 --> 02:09:44.200
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to hold it back.</v>

2740
02:09:44.230 --> 02:09:48.040
<v Speaker 2>It would be beneficial to them as well so people don't understand is that your</v>

2741
02:09:48.041 --> 02:09:53.041
<v Speaker 2>desire for your resistance to psychedelics is the very reason you need</v>

2742
02:09:53.471 --> 02:09:54.670
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics in the first place.</v>

2743
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 2>If you really understood what you were resisting like you're really holding God</v>

2744
02:09:57.911 --> 02:10:00.190
<v Speaker 2>back you really you really want to believe in God.</v>

2745
02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Take 6 grams of mushrooms you'll see him.</v>

2746
02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah you really party with them.</v>

2747
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:05.150
<v Speaker 2>You'll hang out with them.</v>

2748
02:10:05.150 --> 02:10:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Dude DMV you'll have you'll meet God for sure.</v>

2749
02:10:08.230 --> 02:10:11.680
<v Speaker 2>You say it sounds crazy it sounds like an idiot saying it and I agree it's I.</v>

2750
02:10:11.770 --> 02:10:13.000
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like an idiot it's me.</v>

2751
02:10:13.570 --> 02:10:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you but I think it's probably exactly what Zeke was talking about</v>

2752
02:10:19.091 --> 02:10:19.750
<v Speaker 2>in that story.</v>

2753
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:20.830
<v Speaker 2>But he was tripping his balls off.</v>

2754
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2755
02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:25.180
<v Speaker 2>He had some crazy psychedelic experience you probably ate some mushrooms or or</v>

2756
02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:30.360
<v Speaker 2>you know the Moses burning bush scholars to this day actively in in Jerusalem</v>

2757
02:10:32.111 --> 02:10:32.260
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2758
02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:36.370
<v Speaker 2>There's a movement for scholars to recognize the possibility that Moses was on</v>

2759
02:10:36.371 --> 02:10:37.360
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs.</v>

2760
02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:41.830
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why it's all a burning bush like one of the big</v>

2761
02:10:41.831 --> 02:10:46.650
<v Speaker 2>bushes that they that they associate with that area as the acacia tree the</v>

2762
02:10:46.750 --> 02:10:49.360
<v Speaker 2>acacia Bush rich and DMC.</v>

2763
02:10:50.050 --> 02:10:53.260
<v Speaker 17>And if that doesn't mean that if they figured out how to extract that shit and</v>

2764
02:10:53.261 --> 02:10:55.480
<v Speaker 17>smoke it burning bush is right there.</v>

2765
02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:56.350
<v Speaker 17>Yeah he met God.</v>

2766
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:58.730
<v Speaker 17>He found out the 10 you know it sounds like what God would say of your high end</v>

2767
02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:01.600
<v Speaker 17>EMT all those ten commandments they sound pretty right.</v>

2768
02:11:01.630 --> 02:11:01.870
<v Speaker 17>Yeah.</v>

2769
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:03.010
<v Speaker 17>Don't fuck your neighbor's wife.</v>

2770
02:11:03.310 --> 02:11:04.143
<v Speaker 17>Don't kill him.</v>

2771
02:11:04.630 --> 02:11:05.200
<v Speaker 17>Be nice.</v>

2772
02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:08.740
<v Speaker 17>Yeah it sounds like would be empty with W like it literally is exactly what</v>

2773
02:11:08.741 --> 02:11:09.160
<v Speaker 17>D.N.A.</v>

2774
02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:09.670
<v Speaker 17>would tell you.</v>

2775
02:11:09.670 --> 02:11:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Translated to the filters of time thousands of years of various languages.</v>

2776
02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:16.330
<v Speaker 2>But if some guy had some breakthrough experience back then I was trying to</v>

2777
02:11:16.570 --> 02:11:17.920
<v Speaker 2>enlighten all the people around him.</v>

2778
02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:19.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what he would say.</v>

2779
02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I came back from God.</v>

2780
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:25.470
<v Speaker 2>God gave me this message and then over X amount of years of idiots talking about</v>

2781
02:11:25.541 --> 02:11:26.374
<v Speaker 2>it would not know.</v>

2782
02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:28.960
<v Speaker 24>Wrote it on stone tablets.</v>

2783
02:11:29.150 --> 02:11:30.710
<v Speaker 24>Well how did he know it was God's word.</v>

2784
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:31.990
<v Speaker 24>Well God gave him.</v>

2785
02:11:32.230 --> 02:11:36.650
<v Speaker 28>Giants don't mean when people exaggerate and tell stories of course good a</v>

2786
02:11:36.651 --> 02:11:40.420
<v Speaker 28>thousand years of people explaining what happened they're going to fuck it up</v>

2787
02:11:40.421 --> 02:11:42.370
<v Speaker 28>and butcher it just makes sense.</v>

2788
02:11:42.850 --> 02:11:44.990
<v Speaker 9>What was the name of that Mel Brooks movie.</v>

2789
02:11:45.010 --> 02:11:48.340
<v Speaker 9>It's one of my favorite scenes in comedy history with Mel Brooks is playing</v>

2790
02:11:48.341 --> 02:11:51.160
<v Speaker 9>Moses and he comes around the corner at three tablets.</v>

2791
02:11:51.890 --> 02:11:56.890
<v Speaker 9>My Lord I give you these 15 and he drops the one these ten commandments.</v>

2792
02:11:57.850 --> 02:11:58.540
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2793
02:11:58.540 --> 02:11:59.920
<v Speaker 9>So funny.</v>

2794
02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:04.600
<v Speaker 39>This is a this is a fucking fascinating.</v>

2795
02:12:04.630 --> 02:12:09.630
<v Speaker 39>These quotes I mean again I can't tell you if these quotes are really from the</v>

2796
02:12:11.411 --> 02:12:14.460
<v Speaker 39>actual dead sea scrolls but it's</v>

2797
02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:18.280
<v Speaker 39>it's really wild crazy shit.</v>

2798
02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:23.800
<v Speaker 39>It's it's it's hard to understand how you translate things to English because</v>

2799
02:12:23.891 --> 02:12:24.520
<v Speaker 39>it's not.</v>

2800
02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:29.440
<v Speaker 39>You're also trying to like display the intent with a completely different style</v>

2801
02:12:29.441 --> 02:12:30.370
<v Speaker 39>of communicating.</v>

2802
02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:34.600
<v Speaker 39>You know like this style of communicating that they had back then is probably so</v>

2803
02:12:34.630 --> 02:12:39.310
<v Speaker 39>alien to us like socially and so they try to alter it to get it to fit and how</v>

2804
02:12:39.311 --> 02:12:42.100
<v Speaker 39>we feel they would communicate if they lived today.</v>

2805
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:44.343
<v Speaker 39>Yeah.</v>

2806
02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:51.040
<v Speaker 39>Many will attempt to steal your crown and rob you of your joy but they can never</v>

2807
02:12:51.041 --> 02:12:53.620
<v Speaker 39>succeed because of my presence with you.</v>

2808
02:12:54.190 --> 02:12:57.640
<v Speaker 39>What you have hidden in the deep recesses of your heart can never be removed by</v>

2809
02:12:57.641 --> 02:12:58.870
<v Speaker 39>the enemy of your soul.</v>

2810
02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:04.150
<v Speaker 39>Maintain a strong faith in me and my word and you shall never perish but enjoy</v>

2811
02:13:04.151 --> 02:13:06.790
<v Speaker 39>life everlasting which I have provided you.</v>

2812
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:08.080
<v Speaker 39>That's sounds like a cult leader.</v>

2813
02:13:08.370 --> 02:13:11.640
<v Speaker 39>It sounds like a dude is trying to get his dick sucked and he knows where all</v>

2814
02:13:11.641 --> 02:13:12.474
<v Speaker 39>the gold is</v>

2815
02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:15.580
<v Speaker 39>yeah life everlasting.</v>

2816
02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.090
<v Speaker 40>That's a hard promise to keep.</v>

2817
02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:20.110
<v Speaker 39>Who knows if that's what it's really said though.</v>

2818
02:13:20.570 --> 02:13:24.320
<v Speaker 39>That's the really fascinating stuff about all this really ancient shit.</v>

2819
02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:29.380
<v Speaker 39>It's like piecing together the past so fucking hard to figure out when anybody</v>

2820
02:13:30.501 --> 02:13:35.180
<v Speaker 39>really said like this stuff that I've been telling you about this Dan Carlin's</v>

2821
02:13:35.181 --> 02:13:37.760
<v Speaker 39>Hardcore History that I've been listening to for the past couple of months.</v>

2822
02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:41.900
<v Speaker 39>They don't even know what gang is kind of looked like they don't only look like</v>

2823
02:13:41.930 --> 02:13:43.040
<v Speaker 39>they don't know where they buried them.</v>

2824
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:46.130
<v Speaker 39>They don't they they don't have any direct quotes from him.</v>

2825
02:13:46.690 --> 02:13:51.380
<v Speaker 39>They have quotes from like people that met with like Russian historians like</v>

2826
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:56.410
<v Speaker 39>emissaries and you know diplomats that met to like demand things before they you</v>

2827
02:13:58.041 --> 02:14:00.050
<v Speaker 39>know for the Mongols descended upon them.</v>

2828
02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:05.920
<v Speaker 27>Shit I read I read a thing about that exactly that they hired like 50 people to</v>

2829
02:14:06.591 --> 02:14:11.591
<v Speaker 27>bury gang is gone and then they hired 100 people to kill those 50 people so that</v>

2830
02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:16.610
<v Speaker 27>nobody knew where he was buried and then they hired 500 people to kill those</v>

2831
02:14:16.611 --> 02:14:20.240
<v Speaker 27>hundred people that killed the 50 people in case any of them told them a thing</v>

2832
02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:24.320
<v Speaker 27>you know and they would just ambush these groups of people that were under their</v>

2833
02:14:24.321 --> 02:14:28.180
<v Speaker 27>own command in order to protect the secret of gang is gone.</v>

2834
02:14:28.490 --> 02:14:29.570
<v Speaker 19>They're bad motherfuckers.</v>

2835
02:14:29.630 --> 02:14:32.210
<v Speaker 19>They were willing to take it to a level that human beings today could never</v>

2836
02:14:32.211 --> 02:14:33.044
<v Speaker 19>conceive of.</v>

2837
02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:38.050
<v Speaker 8>That's all I do now as I absorb all these these this is history is unbelievable</v>

2838
02:14:38.631 --> 02:14:39.050
<v Speaker 8>to me.</v>

2839
02:14:39.050 --> 02:14:44.050
<v Speaker 8>And now with the Internet you can go non stop tangent to tangent to tangent.</v>

2840
02:14:44.150 --> 02:14:46.350
<v Speaker 8>You can forget what originally got you there.</v>

2841
02:14:46.370 --> 02:14:50.810
<v Speaker 8>Next thing you could just be on the different scope of the universe.</v>

2842
02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:55.840
<v Speaker 11>But for some reason like tragic events of twelve A.D. don't bother me as much as</v>

2843
02:14:57.681 --> 02:14:59.630
<v Speaker 11>like Boston of 2013.</v>

2844
02:14:59.690 --> 02:15:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Like I stopped reading about the Boston tragedy.</v>

2845
02:15:02.770 --> 02:15:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want to you know I'm hearing about this guy lost his legs and this</v>

2846
02:15:05.511 --> 02:15:09.230
<v Speaker 2>people you know these people were permanently injured and this person died and</v>

2847
02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:11.510
<v Speaker 2>it's you know it's so depressing.</v>

2848
02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:14.990
<v Speaker 2>But for whatever reason I can read about gangs can't or listen to this audiotape</v>

2849
02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:15.853
<v Speaker 2>bugging his car.</v>

2850
02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:16.693
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't bother me.</v>

2851
02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2852
02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Sweet don't know how.</v>

2853
02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:25.070
<v Speaker 24>People are terrible they're capable of such horrible horrible behavior.</v>

2854
02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:26.150
<v Speaker 39>We don't know.</v>

2855
02:15:26.150 --> 02:15:28.190
<v Speaker 39>We're not used to or not around that often.</v>

2856
02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:31.040
<v Speaker 39>You have to see something happen to just understand.</v>

2857
02:15:31.100 --> 02:15:34.050
<v Speaker 39>Oh yeah there's some of us out there that are just fucking nuts right.</v>

2858
02:15:34.850 --> 02:15:37.700
<v Speaker 9>It's just in in in the evolution of things.</v>

2859
02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:42.200
<v Speaker 9>It's hard to it's hard to get all the way clear after a thousand years ago the</v>

2860
02:15:42.201 --> 02:15:46.490
<v Speaker 9>Mongol Lloyds were killing tens of thousands of Mongol Lloyd's great well with</v>

2861
02:15:46.491 --> 02:15:47.750
<v Speaker 9>long goals whatever</v>

2862
02:15:49.370 --> 02:15:51.800
<v Speaker 9>you can say whatever man they'll come they'll come get you.</v>

2863
02:15:52.350 --> 02:15:53.720
<v Speaker 39>The thing is China's like their hero.</v>

02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:36.630
<v Speaker 5>And they had theirs there's the stages in the bag and there's a disco in the</v>

2910
02:17:36.631 --> 02:17:41.631
<v Speaker 5>front and the disco was like well it wasn't the highest end.</v>

2911
02:17:41.850 --> 02:17:43.400
<v Speaker 28>This guy you know not a holiday.</v>

2912
02:17:43.550 --> 02:17:44.180
<v Speaker 28>Yeah yeah.</v>

2913
02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:44.540
<v Speaker 28>Yeah.</v>

2914
02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:47.900
<v Speaker 28>And there was like all this music was playing every time the back door would</v>

2915
02:17:47.930 --> 02:17:48.320
<v Speaker 28>open.</v>

2916
02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:49.153
<v Speaker 59>You would hear</v>

2917
02:17:51.130 --> 02:17:51.963
<v Speaker 59>it</v>

2918
02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:55.410
<v Speaker 59>and then it would close and then you'd go back to your act.</v>

2919
02:17:55.420 --> 02:17:55.520
<v Speaker 59>It</v>

2920
02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:56.720
<v Speaker 39>would be like literally this quiet.</v>

2921
02:17:57.080 --> 02:17:58.070
<v Speaker 39>And the door would open.</v>

2922
02:17:58.100 --> 02:18:00.750
<v Speaker 39>So it's just constant open and shut into pee.</v>

2923
02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:05.630
<v Speaker 37>You had to go that way I think yeah I might have made that up to now.</v>

2924
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:07.280
<v Speaker 37>No it wasn't a good gig.</v>

2925
02:18:07.460 --> 02:18:10.360
<v Speaker 37>That club was notoriously like.</v>

2926
02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:12.020
<v Speaker 37>Not really.</v>

2927
02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:12.853
<v Speaker 37>Did you ever do it.</v>

2928
02:18:12.890 --> 02:18:13.700
<v Speaker 37>No.</v>

2929
02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:14.180
<v Speaker 37>Never.</v>

2930
02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:14.700
<v Speaker 37>Never.</v>

2931
02:18:14.700 --> 02:18:16.100
<v Speaker 9>Some areas started out here.</v>

2932
02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:19.250
<v Speaker 9>So do you wanna go back to just let everybody know I went back a couple of times</v>

2933
02:18:19.251 --> 02:18:23.330
<v Speaker 9>when I first started and did pretty big shows at a different bar.</v>

2934
02:18:23.550 --> 02:18:25.130
<v Speaker 9>But I was at a bar.</v>

2935
02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:27.290
<v Speaker 29>Oh you just did like you got your own thing.</v>

2936
02:18:27.410 --> 02:18:27.690
<v Speaker 29>Yeah.</v>

2937
02:18:27.690 --> 02:18:28.790
<v Speaker 29>Looking you fuckin stud.</v>

2938
02:18:28.970 --> 02:18:29.250
<v Speaker 29>Yeah.</v>

2939
02:18:29.250 --> 02:18:30.410
<v Speaker 29>Would you do with you bring somebody.</v>

2940
02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:33.200
<v Speaker 9>It was just me actually just you by yourself.</v>

2941
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:34.330
<v Speaker 9>Yeah I have.</v>

2942
02:18:34.670 --> 02:18:35.410
<v Speaker 9>You're a savage.</v>

2943
02:18:35.410 --> 02:18:39.860
<v Speaker 9>Yeah I have a big a good great group of friends back in Youngstown.</v>

2944
02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:41.400
<v Speaker 29>How much time do you have altogether.</v>

2945
02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:46.850
<v Speaker 8>Well altogether it's weird because no matter what I'm trying to do I always go</v>

2946
02:18:46.851 --> 02:18:51.530
<v Speaker 8>off on tangents and whatever so that's always I have to end up doing less than</v>

2947
02:18:51.650 --> 02:18:52.760
<v Speaker 8>my goal anyway.</v>

2948
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:56.390
<v Speaker 37>And you makes a good problem to have.</v>

2949
02:18:56.510 --> 02:19:00.080
<v Speaker 37>Yeah yeah it is that you get that problem we do a lot of comedy.</v>

2950
02:19:00.470 --> 02:19:03.920
<v Speaker 37>Yeah I do a lot of comedy on stage yeah.</v>

2951
02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:05.660
<v Speaker 37>How many days a week are you going up every night.</v>

2952
02:19:05.810 --> 02:19:06.643
<v Speaker 9>That's how you do it.</v>

2953
02:19:06.890 --> 02:19:10.100
<v Speaker 9>Some nights like last week I had a couple nights where it was three shows in one</v>

2954
02:19:10.101 --> 02:19:12.530
<v Speaker 9>night flying around just doing it.</v>

2955
02:19:12.890 --> 02:19:17.090
<v Speaker 28>Isn't it amazing when you do that because coming home comes party DNA you know</v>

2956
02:19:17.210 --> 02:19:18.320
<v Speaker 28>really gets in that groove.</v>

2957
02:19:18.710 --> 02:19:19.450
<v Speaker 28>It's hard to do.</v>

2958
02:19:19.450 --> 02:19:20.180
<v Speaker 28>Trying to do.</v>

2959
02:19:20.180 --> 02:19:20.780
<v Speaker 28>Oh yeah.</v>

2960
02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:22.070
<v Speaker 28>I find I balance.</v>

2961
02:19:22.310 --> 02:19:23.143
<v Speaker 28>I like to do that.</v>

2962
02:19:23.510 --> 02:19:24.590
<v Speaker 28>I never liked you every night.</v>

2963
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:26.090
<v Speaker 28>I like to do like three or four nights a week.</v>

2964
02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:29.840
<v Speaker 28>Then I like to take nights a week off and not even think about comedy and just</v>

2965
02:19:29.841 --> 02:19:34.070
<v Speaker 28>write where I don't I don't even I don't even entertain the idea of going</v>

2966
02:19:34.071 --> 02:19:34.490
<v Speaker 28>onstage.</v>

2967
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:39.380
<v Speaker 28>I just go over ideas you know and I find that there's like for me I can't just</v>

2968
02:19:39.410 --> 02:19:40.640
<v Speaker 28>always be going onstage.</v>

2969
02:19:40.850 --> 02:19:45.500
<v Speaker 28>It's like a lot of time has to be spent especially now working on I don't know</v>

2970
02:19:45.501 --> 02:19:48.980
<v Speaker 28>like my sixth or seventh hour or something like that and all the time I put out</v>

2971
02:19:48.981 --> 02:19:49.814
<v Speaker 28>specials and shit.</v>

2972
02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:55.180
<v Speaker 28>It's like I have to I have to figure out like new angles and new points of view</v>

2973
02:19:55.311 --> 02:19:56.660
<v Speaker 28>and not even this whole new point of view.</v>

2974
02:19:56.700 --> 02:20:00.680
<v Speaker 28>But new subjects new new different things that interests me new points that I</v>

2975
02:20:00.681 --> 02:20:01.290
<v Speaker 28>have.</v>

2976
02:20:01.290 --> 02:20:03.920
<v Speaker 28>I feel like I don't I don't just get that I I just go on stage a lot.</v>

2977
02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:08.090
<v Speaker 28>I have to spend a lot of time doing other shit you know and I think about that</v>

2978
02:20:08.091 --> 02:20:11.300
<v Speaker 28>actively now whereas when I was younger than I really think about that actively</v>

2979
02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:15.590
<v Speaker 28>like I would just try to like right you know I just try to come up with new bits</v>

2980
02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:18.260
<v Speaker 28>but now I make myself do things.</v>

2981
02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:22.550
<v Speaker 28>So the cool stuff will come out of my interesting stuff to talk about.</v>

2982
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:26.870
<v Speaker 8>It was very soon after I started standup once and the first couple weeks I found</v>

2983
02:20:26.871 --> 02:20:31.820
<v Speaker 8>a book that Stephen King wrote called on writing yeah great book unbelievable</v>

2984
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:36.200
<v Speaker 8>because it's a it's obviously you know it's not a fiction he's just talking</v>

2985
02:20:36.201 --> 02:20:40.700
<v Speaker 8>about his work ethic of writing and he's like I don't think I'm a writer if I</v>

2986
02:20:40.701 --> 02:20:42.950
<v Speaker 8>take a day off what am I that I'm just some guy.</v>

2987
02:20:43.370 --> 02:20:48.370
<v Speaker 8>And so I started applying that during the day and I figured you know on top of</v>

2988
02:20:48.411 --> 02:20:52.410
<v Speaker 8>writing my own standup if I keep up this habit of writing for a few hours every</v>

2989
02:20:52.411 --> 02:20:53.390
<v Speaker 8>day during the day</v>

2990
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:57.110
<v Speaker 8>then then it will get better.</v>

2991
02:20:57.260 --> 02:20:58.280
<v Speaker 8>And it did.</v>

2992
02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:01.240
<v Speaker 8>Sure enough you know luckily I'm a member of the Writers Guild now.</v>

2993
02:21:01.710 --> 02:21:02.450
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2994
02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:04.220
<v Speaker 8>Working on the show and everything.</v>

2995
02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:09.460
<v Speaker 8>So the habit was really it was that book that gave me the confidence because</v>

2996
02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:11.960
<v Speaker 8>you're listening to Stephen King.</v>

2997
02:21:12.410 --> 02:21:13.270
<v Speaker 8>I mean yeah.</v>

2998
02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:14.750
<v Speaker 8>One of the best at what he does.</v>

2999
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:16.790
<v Speaker 2>So one of the best of all time.</v>

3000
02:21:16.850 --> 02:21:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah yeah.</v>

3001
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm a huge fan of that guy and I just I can't have a thing about people</v>

3002
02:21:21.231 --> 02:21:22.064
<v Speaker 2>that produce stuff.</v>

3003
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I find that like for me one of the most inspirational things is to be</v>

3004
02:21:27.351 --> 02:21:31.190
<v Speaker 2>around a lot of other inspirational people you know like when I like when I go</v>

3005
02:21:31.191 --> 02:21:34.820
<v Speaker 2>to a UFC I want to work out and after I come home I want to fucking work out</v>

3006
02:21:34.821 --> 02:21:36.200
<v Speaker 2>like crazy when I go see comedy.</v>

3007
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:38.870
<v Speaker 2>I want to write and I think that's what's really important.</v>

3008
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:39.800
<v Speaker 8>Oh totally.</v>

3009
02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:42.470
<v Speaker 8>I do that all the time even with the music that I listen to.</v>

3010
02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:46.640
<v Speaker 8>Going somewhere getting ready for something you know at night.</v>

3011
02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:51.840
<v Speaker 8>I listen a big powerful music that'll get me you know sort of hyped and inspired</v>

3012
02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:56.540
<v Speaker 8>a lot of live shows is that type of music that I listen to and you hear the</v>

3013
02:21:56.541 --> 02:21:57.890
<v Speaker 8>crowd just yeah.</v>

3014
02:21:58.440 --> 02:21:58.960
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3015
02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:02.840
<v Speaker 8>In these breaks or at the beginnings or at the end of the song and that's the</v>

3016
02:22:02.841 --> 02:22:07.040
<v Speaker 8>stuff that takes every little bit of Mojo one can absorb to be able to kick it</v>

3017
02:22:07.041 --> 02:22:07.874
<v Speaker 8>back out.</v>

3018
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.730
<v Speaker 10>Yeah that's why I really like music as well.</v>

3019
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:14.600
<v Speaker 10>I think music is one of the cool things to see because it's like the energy is</v>

3020
02:22:14.601 --> 02:22:17.030
<v Speaker 10>putting it but it's totally different from comedy.</v>

3021
02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:20.690
<v Speaker 10>It's like some new facet of some new energy some new thing.</v>

3022
02:22:20.930 --> 02:22:25.220
<v Speaker 10>And like when I listen to a song like some songs or suck something about it like</v>

3023
02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:29.780
<v Speaker 10>like there's a lyrical quality to like writing in songs that I started to</v>

3024
02:22:29.781 --> 02:22:32.630
<v Speaker 10>realize somewhere along the line is applicable to comedy as well.</v>

3025
02:22:32.900 --> 02:22:37.900
<v Speaker 10>Like when a good joke is written correctly and a joke has a good economy of</v>

3026
02:22:38.481 --> 02:22:43.481
<v Speaker 10>words and the right words to describe the right situations it has like a</v>

3027
02:22:43.581 --> 02:22:45.200
<v Speaker 10>rhythmic quality to it.</v>

3028
02:22:45.530 --> 02:22:50.530
<v Speaker 10>And I think that's sort of that's sort of underestimated or overlooked by a lot</v>

3029
02:22:50.811 --> 02:22:51.500
<v Speaker 10>of comedians.</v>

3030
02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:56.480
<v Speaker 10>The impact that that sort of rhythm to the delivery has the impact of it I think</v>

3031
02:22:56.481 --> 02:22:57.330
<v Speaker 10>is pretty substantial.</v>

3032
02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:58.250
<v Speaker 10>Oh totally.</v>

3033
02:22:58.250 --> 02:23:01.520
<v Speaker 10>But we don't think about that we just think about what is funny but it's not</v>

3034
02:23:01.521 --> 02:23:06.521
<v Speaker 10>just that it's like it's funny and it's also good and it's smooth and it's a lot</v>

3035
02:23:06.651 --> 02:23:10.160
<v Speaker 10>of things to it to make it more enjoyable more interesting to listen to.</v>

3036
02:23:10.190 --> 02:23:13.220
<v Speaker 8>A perfect example of what you're talking about right now with the rhythm and</v>

3037
02:23:13.221 --> 02:23:14.720
<v Speaker 8>like timing and everything.</v>

3038
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:18.920
<v Speaker 8>Last night I'm hosting at the Comedy Store it's like 40 comedians everybody</v>

3039
02:23:18.921 --> 02:23:22.640
<v Speaker 8>that's new and employees after that and then paid regular whatever and in the</v>

3040
02:23:22.641 --> 02:23:27.620
<v Speaker 8>middle of it a cook that the Mexican guy Aldo don't show who works the deep</v>

3041
02:23:27.621 --> 02:23:28.700
<v Speaker 8>fryer at the Comedy Store.</v>

3042
02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:32.480
<v Speaker 8>Hey man I want to go on stage and barely speaks English at all.</v>

3043
02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:37.500
<v Speaker 8>I mean the impression I just did is making him sound much more American than he</v>

3044
02:23:37.641 --> 02:23:38.450
<v Speaker 8>is.</v>

3045
02:23:38.450 --> 02:23:41.080
<v Speaker 8>And he he wants to do comedy and I go you know what man.</v>

3046
02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:41.600
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>

3047
02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:43.230
<v Speaker 8>But it's just gonna be two minutes okay.</v>

3048
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:46.220
<v Speaker 8>This way in case it's you know do whatever is right.</v>

3049
02:23:46.820 --> 02:23:48.950
<v Speaker 8>But you know and he goes up.</v>

3050
02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:53.330
<v Speaker 8>But it was hilarious because nobody could understand a single word but he was</v>

3051
02:23:53.331 --> 02:23:56.780
<v Speaker 8>completely committed and then all of a sudden he's making this noise and you</v>

3052
02:23:56.781 --> 02:24:00.800
<v Speaker 8>really you don't you don't know even know what the noise he was making was but</v>

3053
02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:05.830
<v Speaker 8>his commitment and his beats with it just he crushed he crushed and all these</v>

3054
02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:11.060
<v Speaker 8>other comedians that do it every night and look at going up in that room at the</v>

3055
02:24:11.061 --> 02:24:12.800
<v Speaker 8>Comedy Store is like this is it.</v>

3056
02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:15.710
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to show them what I would do on The Tonight Show if I was on it</v>

3057
02:24:15.711 --> 02:24:16.400
<v Speaker 8>tonight.</v>

3058
02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:20.270
<v Speaker 8>Then you have the guy work in the frying pans who nobody understands a word.</v>

3059
02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:23.720
<v Speaker 8>There's people that spend so much time writing and everything but there he is.</v>

3060
02:24:23.810 --> 02:24:27.830
<v Speaker 8>And it sure it's a silly instance but it was extremely funny.</v>

3061
02:24:27.950 --> 02:24:32.950
<v Speaker 8>If I'm cracking up and the audience is laughing and people are then it's funny.</v>

3062
02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:35.990
<v Speaker 17>And but you know it's really and he did it without a word.</v>

3063
02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:38.990
<v Speaker 44>How do you how do you recreate that could you recreate that with another</v>

3064
02:24:38.991 --> 02:24:39.410
<v Speaker 44>audience.</v>

3065
02:24:39.410 --> 02:24:40.100
<v Speaker 44>Maybe not.</v>

3066
02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:44.450
<v Speaker 44>And make maybe that would only work in that sort of a really lose situation</v>

3067
02:24:44.451 --> 02:24:45.440
<v Speaker 44>where it's a comedy store.</v>

3068
02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:47.030
<v Speaker 44>Bunch comedians in the crowd right.</v>

3069
02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:50.280
<v Speaker 10>You want to go up you go up and like no expectations right.</v>

3070
02:24:50.370 --> 02:24:53.460
<v Speaker 10>You know I mean it's like Could you recreate that and become a comedian.</v>

3071
02:24:53.540 --> 02:24:54.090
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

3072
02:24:54.090 --> 02:24:58.460
<v Speaker 10>It was yeah because you know how that that's a weird realization you have where</v>

3073
02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:03.050
<v Speaker 10>just because a joke kills in one place it could bomb another place of total and</v>

3074
02:25:03.051 --> 02:25:04.340
<v Speaker 10>you say it the exact same way.</v>

3075
02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:06.000
<v Speaker 10>Yeah well what the fuck yeah.</v>

3076
02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:09.480
<v Speaker 10>And then you realize well well there isn't like this isn't always work like this</v>

3077
02:25:09.481 --> 02:25:13.160
<v Speaker 10>this weird idea I'm throwing out there yeah some people are gonna buy into it</v>

3078
02:25:13.161 --> 02:25:14.090
<v Speaker 10>and some people are not.</v>

3079
02:25:14.570 --> 02:25:16.640
<v Speaker 10>And sometimes it sounds like the greatest joke ever written.</v>

3080
02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:18.350
<v Speaker 10>Sometimes it sounds like you're a fool.</v>

3081
02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:21.920
<v Speaker 8>Yeah because sometimes there's something that happened the first time you did it</v>

3082
02:25:21.921 --> 02:25:25.310
<v Speaker 8>when it worked that you did before that you don't normally do that you forgot</v>

3083
02:25:25.311 --> 02:25:27.170
<v Speaker 8>that you did and it worked because of that.</v>

3084
02:25:27.710 --> 02:25:31.220
<v Speaker 28>And I think a good thing for young comics to realize is that that's good.</v>

3085
02:25:32.050 --> 02:25:32.670
<v Speaker 28>It's good.</v>

3086
02:25:32.670 --> 02:25:35.640
<v Speaker 28>All those bombing and failing and not getting it right.</v>

3087
02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:36.230
<v Speaker 28>It's good.</v>

3088
02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:37.040
<v Speaker 28>Oh yeah totally.</v>

3089
02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:39.960
<v Speaker 28>Because if you don't have it you're not going to appreciate when it goes well.</v>

3090
02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:44.300
<v Speaker 27>I remember in my first few weeks of doing it somebody went to a comedian came up</v>

3091
02:25:44.301 --> 02:25:47.630
<v Speaker 27>to me who I won't say his name but he was terrible.</v>

3092
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:52.750
<v Speaker 8>And he goes Hey man you know the trick is bomb as often as you can.</v>

3093
02:25:53.930 --> 02:25:57.740
<v Speaker 9>I'm thinking myself Oh yeah that's what you would do you'll lose there if that's</v>

3094
02:25:57.741 --> 02:25:58.700
<v Speaker 9>what you're doing anyway.</v>

3095
02:25:59.180 --> 02:26:01.190
<v Speaker 9>But mostly I got Americans to bomb.</v>

3096
02:26:01.430 --> 02:26:02.840
<v Speaker 9>What was his rationale.</v>

3097
02:26:02.900 --> 02:26:05.840
<v Speaker 9>Well he goes you know because now's the time to knock bombing out.</v>

3098
02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:07.580
<v Speaker 9>Oh you know how to bomb now.</v>

3099
02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:11.060
<v Speaker 9>It ended up making some sense Labor's terrible.</v>

3100
02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:12.140
<v Speaker 9>So how did you have such wisdom.</v>

3101
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:13.190
<v Speaker 9>Right exactly.</v>

3102
02:26:13.850 --> 02:26:14.660
<v Speaker 9>Somebody must have.</v>

3103
02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:17.390
<v Speaker 9>Somebody must have told him that like hey you know look at it this way in a</v>

3104
02:26:17.391 --> 02:26:19.270
<v Speaker 9>positive sense you're bombings.</v>

3105
02:26:19.310 --> 02:26:20.143
<v Speaker 9>Good.</v>

3106
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:23.900
<v Speaker 31>I don't think back means funny anymore makes me sad.</v>

3107
02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:25.070
<v Speaker 31>It's funny to you right now.</v>

3108
02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:26.330
<v Speaker 31>So close yeah.</v>

3109
02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:28.310
<v Speaker 60>Now just madness.</v>

3110
02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:33.020
<v Speaker 31>I look at it I just see madness this people that you know that are going to try</v>

3111
02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:37.310
<v Speaker 31>for years and years and years and know it's never gonna happen right doesn't</v>

3112
02:26:37.311 --> 02:26:38.144
<v Speaker 31>exist for them.</v>

3113
02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:40.173
<v Speaker 9>Yeah</v>

3114
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:45.460
<v Speaker 9>it is creepy and I've seen it with a few people but you with anything.</v>

3115
02:26:45.490 --> 02:26:48.100
<v Speaker 44>I mean you watch American Idol and people saying and you like how is this person</v>

3116
02:26:48.101 --> 02:26:49.330
<v Speaker 44>think they've been saying they're crazy.</v>

3117
02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:52.840
<v Speaker 44>How does this person think anything what anybody wants it must be that for if</v>

3118
02:26:52.841 --> 02:26:54.190
<v Speaker 44>you're a literary agent.</v>

3119
02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:58.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean imagine how many people send you secret stories like Holy fuck are you</v>

3120
02:26:58.181 --> 02:27:00.240
<v Speaker 2>reading this nuts fucking work.</v>

3121
02:27:00.610 --> 02:27:01.443
<v Speaker 2>Read this.</v>

3122
02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:03.840
<v Speaker 2>What what is that.</v>

3123
02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Tony why why are some people so goddamn delusional.</v>

3124
02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Is there a broad spectrum of human beings and the amount of voltage your battery</v>

3125
02:27:10.251 --> 02:27:12.950
<v Speaker 2>puts out and some people are just designed to dig holes.</v>

3126
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:18.190
<v Speaker 8>I think that the delusion is you know the delusion needs to be that with tons of</v>

3127
02:27:21.201 --> 02:27:23.570
<v Speaker 8>work at something you can accomplish it.</v>

3128
02:27:24.410 --> 02:27:26.900
<v Speaker 8>Not that the delusion is I can do this.</v>

3129
02:27:27.350 --> 02:27:31.250
<v Speaker 8>It's you've got to everybody that has ever been good at anything worked at it</v>

3130
02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:32.480
<v Speaker 8>you know and I mean a lot.</v>

3131
02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:34.790
<v Speaker 8>So it's not and they wanted it.</v>

3132
02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:36.710
<v Speaker 10>And even if you work out it doesn't mean you gonna get it.</v>

3133
02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:41.450
<v Speaker 10>Especially with things like talent things like talent is a weird thing.</v>

3134
02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:46.280
<v Speaker 39>Like these guys I've seen guys that like they train striking like for MDMA.</v>

3135
02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:47.930
<v Speaker 39>They train it for years.</v>

3136
02:27:48.020 --> 02:27:49.550
<v Speaker 39>They fucking trained for years.</v>

3137
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:52.100
<v Speaker 39>But then when it comes and actually fight they can't pull it off.</v>

3138
02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:54.170
<v Speaker 39>They just they can't strike with people again.</v>

3139
02:27:54.410 --> 02:27:55.280
<v Speaker 39>They don't move right.</v>

3140
02:27:55.310 --> 02:27:58.340
<v Speaker 39>They're too slow for whatever reason it is they can never figure it out.</v>

3141
02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:01.790
<v Speaker 39>And there's other guys who show em a couple of moves they lose like fucking pros</v>

3142
02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:04.400
<v Speaker 39>like instantly and they crush you and knock you out with one punch.</v>

3143
02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:05.540
<v Speaker 21>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

3144
02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:06.590
<v Speaker 21>It's like either.</v>

3145
02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:08.930
<v Speaker 21>I mean it's like that guy clearly has a gift right.</v>

3146
02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:11.470
<v Speaker 21>This guy clearly no matter how hard he works he's never going to get there.</v>

3147
02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:12.673
<v Speaker 21>It's true.</v>

3148
02:28:13.170 --> 02:28:17.870
<v Speaker 20>The weird thing about this life boy must be a real curse led to a crazy feeling</v>

3149
02:28:17.871 --> 02:28:18.890
<v Speaker 20>to be one of those guys.</v>

3150
02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:21.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like trying to pursue something and you having no success and you can't</v>

3151
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:24.500
<v Speaker 2>connect the dots and you can't move forward.</v>

3152
02:28:25.050 --> 02:28:30.050
<v Speaker 8>Man it's you know before anything was happening you know before when I was still</v>

3153
02:28:30.771 --> 02:28:34.190
<v Speaker 8>not making money and before I was getting past at the clubs and Hollywood and</v>

3154
02:28:34.191 --> 02:28:37.010
<v Speaker 8>everything it was extremely low.</v>

3155
02:28:37.260 --> 02:28:41.090
<v Speaker 8>You know I was able to keep having fun by surrounding myself around funny</v>

3156
02:28:41.091 --> 02:28:43.790
<v Speaker 8>friends and everything but man was it hard.</v>

3157
02:28:44.330 --> 02:28:47.930
<v Speaker 10>Yeah it's depressing Yeah pressing as fuck when you're not making it deck out</v>

3158
02:28:47.931 --> 02:28:48.650
<v Speaker 10>there.</v>

3159
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:51.350
<v Speaker 10>It's hard but isn't it like a real character builder.</v>

3160
02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:52.560
<v Speaker 10>Once you're through to the other side.</v>

3161
02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:54.500
<v Speaker 10>Like oh yeah he must be so happy right now.</v>

<v Speaker 9>Yeah it was a blast.</v>

3181
02:29:17.390 --> 02:29:21.260
<v Speaker 9>I listened to the set the next day and I just couldn't even believe it.</v>

3182
02:29:21.390 --> 02:29:23.390
<v Speaker 9>This was really wild.</v>

3183
02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:27.410
<v Speaker 9>So we caught all those in the sound and the power of that one was that the</v>

3184
02:29:27.411 --> 02:29:28.280
<v Speaker 9>biggest crowd you ever worked.</v>

3185
02:29:29.570 --> 02:29:31.280
<v Speaker 8>I think so right or right around there.</v>

3186
02:29:31.370 --> 02:29:36.110
<v Speaker 8>I should know but it's it's been right around there with a couple of shows the</v>

3187
02:29:36.111 --> 02:29:37.890
<v Speaker 8>quote that was sorry about this guy Phil Elmore.</v>

3188
02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:38.600
<v Speaker 44>He's a writer.</v>

3189
02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:40.070
<v Speaker 44>He wrote this on his Twitter.</v>

3190
02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:43.880
<v Speaker 44>So as a writer never has a vacation for a writer life consists of either writing</v>

3191
02:29:43.881 --> 02:29:44.870
<v Speaker 44>or thinking about writing.</v>
