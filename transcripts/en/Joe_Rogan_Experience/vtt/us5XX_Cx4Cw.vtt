00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem in psychiatry is there are no real biological markers.</v>

3
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to use a radiographic studies like Spec Scans,</v>

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:13.314
<v Speaker 1>Mris,</v>

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>pet scans and what have you as rationale for starting people on medication,</v>

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>but there's absolutely,</v>

7
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>in the biomarker,</v>

9
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>the biomarker panel that we have,</v>

10
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>this is a direct correlation between someone having had a head trauma regardless</v>

11
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:32.031
<v Speaker 1>of it was Mildura blast trauma like Andrew had or a slip and fall or someone</v>

12
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:37.341
<v Speaker 1>coming up and hitting you behind the head or mma or boxers or mou type and</v>

13
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely zero that they use to regulate what they're doing.</v>

14
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.851
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

15
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

16
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>today's Thursday,</v>

17
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>let's try this drug or this is Friday or else this month we're giving you this</v>

18
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Satchel of meds.</v>

19
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>As many of the vets have come up and told me,</v>

20
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>depending upon the day of the week dictated what groupings of medications they</v>

21
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>were given and so what,</v>

22
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>but let's break it down for people.</v>

23
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>What do you feel is the underlying cause of all this?</v>

24
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>It's related to Tbi.</v>

25
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.133
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

26
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.251
<v Speaker 1>great question,</v>

27
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is number one,</v>

28
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>from the head trauma,</v>

29
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>it elicits chemical changes in the brain that we call inflammation and this</v>

30
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>inflammation leads to disruption of chemical processes.</v>

31
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

32
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>the old alkaline batteries or the car batteries where we used to put distilled</v>

34
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>water into it.</v>

35
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>if you put coca cola in it,</v>

37
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>it totally changes the ability of electrons to be conducted just like in the</v>

38
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:29.694
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

39
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>So the chemistry of the brain is altered by the inflammation and it starts</v>

40
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>shutting down systems so that the nerves in left side of the brain can talk to</v>

41
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>the right side or the frontal lobe of the brain can talk to the temporal lobe of</v>

42
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>

43
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>So you have disruption of executive function,</v>

44
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>which is your ability to make correct decisions about things right and wrong.</v>

45
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have over a million veterans incarcerated?</v>

46
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>That's because they can't make the right correct decisions about how to respond</v>

47
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>to an innocuous,</v>

48
00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.801
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>approached by an individual that they don't know and they respond by assault or</v>

51
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>physical or anger or the yelling at people.</v>

52
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>And that leads them into jail or into incarceration.</v>

53
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.913
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

54
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>the inflammation leads to hormonal deficiencies in the brain.</v>

55
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>And what we found is that there's,</v>

56
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>since 1986,</v>

57
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:25.521
<v Speaker 1>Dr Lou at a Paris found that we have enzyme systems that take cholesterol and</v>

58
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:31.371
<v Speaker 1>converted into hormones that actuate and regulate our brain function from</v>

59
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia to als to Parkinson's disease to bipolar,</v>

60
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>to all the different disorders.</v>

61
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent article that I sent out to our journal Group and Andrew's in</v>

62
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

63
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>and it was about management of neuroinflammation,</v>

64
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>brain inflammation to treat psychiatric diseases.</v>

65
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>In the past six months,</v>

66
00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>we've been starting to see a lot of articles talking specifically about</v>

67
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>inflammation,</v>

68
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>creating all these things that we're trying to treat with medications that are</v>

69
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.063
<v Speaker 1>ineffective.</v>

70
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

71
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.373
<v Speaker 1>last month,</v>

72
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.223
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>had a class in</v>

74
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Arizona and I presented a group of articles and one of the key articles was the</v>

75
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>fact that they found people with a typical depression that's depression that</v>

76
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>doesn't respond to traditional medication.</v>

77
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>So you're on whole bunch of 13 medications and you still depressed.</v>

78
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>So they found in 61 percent of these people who were still depressed with</v>

79
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>atypical depression that they had growth hormone deficiency and then when they</v>

80
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>replaced the growth hormone within one to two months,</v>

81
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>their depression disappeared and they had some beneficial side effects.</v>

82
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>They slept better,</v>

83
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>they had more mental energy,</v>

84
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.630
<v Speaker 1>they were socially more adaptable and they're reactive scores that creates an</v>

85
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>assault situation.</v>

86
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.200
<v Speaker 1>They were calm.</v>

87
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Someone said boo to them and they said,</v>

88
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

89
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>who do you as opposed to getting into their face.</v>

90
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very clear and it's becoming clearer and clearer in the literature</v>

91
00:03:58.151 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>

92
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Now we've been doing this since 2004 and the inflammation is really the problem.</v>

93
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>So unfortunately there is no specific medication.</v>

94
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.060
<v Speaker 1>They talk about use of aspirin and Ibuprofen in things like Alzheimer's disease,</v>

95
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>which is an inflammatory disease.</v>

96
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I know I shared it with you in the past that if a football player has one major</v>

97
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>concussion on the field,</v>

98
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.160
<v Speaker 1>he's 19 times at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's between 30 and 49 years</v>

99
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>of age because it's an inflammatory illness.</v>

100
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not genetics by itself.</v>

101
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>There are people with genetic predisposition to it because they generate this</v>

102
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>thing called Beta amyloid,</v>

103
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.493
<v Speaker 1>but trauma,</v>

104
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.630
<v Speaker 1>any kind of trauma to the head can elicit increased production of Beta amyloid</v>

105
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>and lead to these problems.</v>

106
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I get.</v>

107
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.071
<v Speaker 2>I get heavy.</v>

108
00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:50.870
<v Speaker 2>You know I'm going to talk about life and death.</v>

109
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.370
<v Speaker 2>You got talk about life now.</v>

110
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.350
<v Speaker 2>That is what we're doing.</v>

111
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.850
<v Speaker 2>We're living in some people who are dying.</v>

112
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.283
<v Speaker 2>That's life and death.</v>

113
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.130
<v Speaker 2>We're all.</v>

114
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.260
<v Speaker 2>What's really interesting is that we're all going to die.</v>

115
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

116
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.150
<v Speaker 2>And add that everybody pushes away and I guess that's normal to push away,</v>

117
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.500
<v Speaker 2>thoughts of your death,</v>

119
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.090
<v Speaker 2>but the real enlightened,</v>

120
00:05:17.091 --> 00:05:17.924
<v Speaker 2>like the Buddhist,</v>

121
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Buddhist,</v>

122
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.753
<v Speaker 2>eastern,</v>

123
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.541
<v Speaker 2>eastern and stuff,</v>

124
00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:24.860
<v Speaker 2>they say the way to get enlightened is to die.</v>

125
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.790
<v Speaker 2>If you can check this out,</v>

126
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.870
<v Speaker 2>is to die before you die.</v>

127
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Meaning lately kind of go into the fear and they claim that the fear is</v>

128
00:05:38.631 --> 00:05:40.250
<v Speaker 2>releasing ego,</v>

129
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.850
<v Speaker 2>which what they mean by ego is like,</v>

130
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 2>like you have this beautiful studio when you have a career and a wife and a kid.</v>

131
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.621
<v Speaker 2>Kids,</v>

132
00:05:48.621 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

133
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.283
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

134
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.260
<v Speaker 2>and it's like letting.</v>

135
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't be attached to it,</v>

136
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 2>you have to die to that.</v>

137
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:01.701
<v Speaker 2>Like in other words,</v>

138
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 2>you don't own your wife,</v>

139
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 2>you don't own,</v>

140
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.803
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

141
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 2>anything really because we're just,</v>

142
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>

143
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.970
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line of it is,</v>

144
00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 2>is we are temporary.</v>

145
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes and empowerment it.</v>

146
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't mean you can't enjoy,</v>

147
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:17.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 2>like you're in the prime of your life,</v>

149
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

150
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 2>So why think about your fucking death,</v>

151
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

152
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

153
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.120
<v Speaker 3>then the incredible institutional entrenchment that happens when you adopt a</v>

154
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:32.444
<v Speaker 3>certain view,</v>

155
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

156
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.900
<v Speaker 3>And then it's so hard to reverse out of that particular chosen line of thinking,</v>

157
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 3>it becomes almost impossible.</v>

158
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

159
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 3>this institutions are not built for that.</v>

160
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 3>They're not really built for science.</v>

161
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.321
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

162
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 3>science is supposed to be,</v>

163
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.713
<v Speaker 3>as I said earlier,</v>

164
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 3>self-doubting self questioning.</v>

165
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 3>You have new observations,</v>

166
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 3>so you change your course.</v>

167
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:53.490
<v Speaker 3>That's what science is supposed to be like you,</v>

168
00:06:53.491 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 3>you test things and they don't work out.</v>

169
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 3>And then you move on to another idea.</v>

170
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.830
<v Speaker 3>But an institution is,</v>

171
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 3>is it's almost like institutional sciences click an oxymoron because an</v>

172
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 3>institution is meant to not flip flop on their publics.</v>

173
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Not to change their views,</v>

174
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.103
<v Speaker 3>not to lose,</v>

175
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 3>not to allow people to lose faith in them.</v>

176
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.670
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

177
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.040
<v Speaker 3>it's there,</v>

178
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.580
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

179
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.820
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

180
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 3>it's the wrong kind of body to do science.</v>

181
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.293
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

182
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 3>so it's made me much more,</v>

183
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 3>a much more cautious about how much I want our government to do,</v>

184
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

185
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 3>because if I had just turned over this one little leaf and found this huge</v>

186
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:32.900
<v Speaker 3>disastrous program,</v>

187
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.291
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

188
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:33.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

189
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I just wonder if I'd turned over any other leaf.</v>

190
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.400
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

191
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

192
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

193
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 3>what else would I find?</v>

194
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd find similar in competence probably.</v>

195
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

196
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

197
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.973
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

198
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.680
<v Speaker 3>so it's changed my political thinking quite a bit.</v>

199
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.623
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

200
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 3>and then I think it's also,</v>

201
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

202
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 3>when I see the way that the scientific debate is played out and I,</v>

203
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:53.391
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

204
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 3>I know the science so intimately now,</v>

205
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.593
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

206
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

207
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.590
<v Speaker 3>I know I've read every single nutrition experiment that has really been done</v>

208
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 3>since the mid fifties.</v>

209
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.211
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

210
00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:05.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

211
00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 3>when I see the way the debate plays out in public,</v>

212
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

213
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I see that a American heart association,</v>

214
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Presidential Advisory,</v>

215
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.610
<v Speaker 3>which I just see as a,</v>

216
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:12.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

217
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 3>it's not honest science or our last dietary guidelines,</v>

218
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:19.160
<v Speaker 3>expert committee in their report saying,</v>

219
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:19.994
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

220
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.103
<v Speaker 3>we should,</v>

221
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 3>we should all eat a plant based diet.</v>

222
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.331
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

223
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:23.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

224
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 3>I can see how bad that science is.</v>

225
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.833
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

226
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

227
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.240
<v Speaker 3>I see that,</v>

228
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.690
<v Speaker 3>that I can see now so much better the,</v>

229
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.440
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

230
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 3>the way that PR firms spin messages and the way those messages are echoed all</v>

231
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:37.881
<v Speaker 3>over and the way,</v>

232
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:38.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

233
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 3>it's just the way it's what's happening in our politics.</v>

234
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:40.230
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

235
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 3>it's happening in our science.</v>

236
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

237
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:42.640
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

238
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.640
<v Speaker 3>and so I think it makes me somewhat despair about our ability to have good</v>

239
00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:54.560
<v Speaker 3>science rise to the top because you knew when you have institutions like Harvard</v>

240
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:55.394
<v Speaker 3>and tufts,</v>

241
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

242
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 3>all of our top institutions are so deeply invested in this wrong hypothesis.</v>

243
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:00.451
<v Speaker 3>Yet I don't even know.</v>

244
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where people should turn to,</v>

245
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

246
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

247
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

248
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 3>how do we sort ourselves out of this mess?</v>

249
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.243
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

250
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.250
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

251
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:09.671
<v Speaker 3>nutrition,</v>

252
00:09:09.671 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 3>science is in bad shape and I,</v>

253
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

254
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 3>it changed my,</v>

255
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 3>it's changed my faith in expert advice.</v>

256
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's the bottom line.</v>

257
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.070
<v Speaker 3>I really don't trust expert advice because I see the way it is manipulated by</v>

258
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.950
<v Speaker 3>financial interests and professional interests and intellectual conflicts of</v>

259
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 3>interest and,</v>

260
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:30.631
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

261
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:30.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

262
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 3>even little tiny things like anything,</v>

263
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 3>a warning label on a bottle,</v>

264
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:34.411
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

265
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:35.244
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

266
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 3>careful of this plastic or this or that.</v>

267
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

268
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe anything unless I go back to their original science and read it</v>

269
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 3>all myself,</v>

270
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:42.960
<v Speaker 3>which I can never do.</v>

271
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 3>I just don't trust anything anymore.</v>

272
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good place to be.</v>

273
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.333
<v Speaker 3>It isn't.</v>

274
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:48.520
<v Speaker 3>I need to spend.</v>
