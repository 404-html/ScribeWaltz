00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>One of the most interesting things that I learned from the injury was,</v>

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>was how,</v>

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>how your physical health or wellbeing alters your,</v>

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>your perception of the world.</v>

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

8
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.363
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>have you ever heard of this study?</v>

11
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

12
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>they do like the hot and cold cups study where they have someone come in to fill</v>

13
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>out a survey,</v>

14
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>that's what they tell them.</v>

16
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>And then a person gets in an elevator and they,</v>

17
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.121
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:30.541
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

19
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>there's someone in there like confederate,</v>

21
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>an actor is in there that's like,</v>

22
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>here I,</v>

23
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.781
<v Speaker 1>my hands are full.</v>

24
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Could you hold this cup for me?</v>

25
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's either like a hot cup of coffee or whatever,</v>

26
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>or a cold drink and the person says,</v>

27
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.871
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

28
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Takes the drink,</v>

29
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>goes up the elevator,</v>

30
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:46.134
<v Speaker 1>gets off,</v>

31
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>gives it back to them,</v>

32
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>says buy,</v>

34
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>goes in and takes the survey and then afterwards,</v>

35
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>and this is what it's actually about.</v>

36
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.481
<v Speaker 1>Afterwards they go,</v>

37
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>did you meet anyone?</v>

38
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And the way in.</v>

39
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And I got actually someone I met someone in the elevator and then they'll,</v>

40
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.771
<v Speaker 1>there'll be like,</v>

41
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>so uh,</v>

42
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>

43
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>can you describe that person?</v>

44
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>And if they had,</v>

45
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>if they had the hot drink,</v>

46
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.723
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

47
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>they were more,</v>

49
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>they would more often describe them as being like warm or friendly.</v>

51
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>And if they had the cold drink,</v>

52
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

53
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>they would describe them as like a cold or distant.</v>

54
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.023
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

55
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>and the idea is,</v>

56
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>is that that,</v>

57
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.893
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

59
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>the way our brains evolved kind of these,</v>

60
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>these higher ideas of,</v>

61
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>of what like being distant as a personality trait or whatever means he has to be</v>

62
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>built over this preexisting kind of,</v>

63
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>five senses kind of software.</v>

65
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

66
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

68
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>so there's all these metaphors for things.</v>

69
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>So you call someone like bright or you say we're having a deep conversation or</v>

70
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>someone's shallow.</v>

71
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these ways in which we describe life is,</v>

72
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>is kind of used through these physical metaphors.</v>

73
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>And I remember when I,</v>

74
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>when I broke my feet,</v>

75
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking the whole fucking world is broken.</v>

76
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.411
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

77
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking like eyes on eyes going down this mountain for like three,</v>

78
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>three hours and I wasn't just worried about my feet eyes also like in the</v>

79
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 1>fucking political system is it?</v>

80
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Like everything just seemed broken like the whole world.</v>

81
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>And then I also remember after I got the second surgery,</v>

82
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>after the bone infection and stuff and having to change all this,</v>

83
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I remember feeling like,</v>

84
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.990
<v Speaker 1>like something like this nagging feeling that I couldn't get over.</v>

85
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I was like some things like missing from my life.</v>

86
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>There's just this deep like whole like somewhere in my soul in my leg.</v>

87
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And then one day I realized I'm like,</v>

88
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.021
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

89
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking hole in my foot.</v>

90
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.670
<v Speaker 1>There's an actual hole in my feet,</v>

91
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>foot.</v>

92
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what's missing.</v>

93
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

94
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>and just how much that,</v>

95
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.983
<v Speaker 1>that your,</v>

96
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>your physical senses can alter what your perception of the world is.</v>

97
00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>The food</v>

98
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.401
<v Speaker 2>denial,</v>

99
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 2>floods and the food jumps out of the ground and under the,</v>

100
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 2>under the,</v>

101
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

102
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

103
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>

104
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.380
<v Speaker 2>with a series of genuinely enlightened rulers,</v>

105
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:17.100
<v Speaker 2>or at least pretty close to enlightened real is ruling them.</v>

106
00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>It all lasts for 3,500 years.</v>

107
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 2>And how did they live?</v>

108
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 2>You'll see everything that they did.</v>

109
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:22.691
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

110
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 2>until quite recently,</v>

111
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 2>there were no such things as jobs that were trades and crafts and skills and</v>

112
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>arts and everybody.</v>

113
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

114
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

115
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 2>and in Europe,</v>

116
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 2>the combination of an oppressive church and then oppressive nobility kept</v>

117
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:40.924
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

118
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 2>immersed in serfdom in one way or another.</v>

120
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 2>But what people actually did with that lives was in some sense or another</v>

121
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 2>transformational,</v>

122
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.711
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

123
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot of smarts to be a good peasant.</v>

124
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 2>All of these things that people used to do as a matter of course,</v>

125
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:56.921
<v Speaker 2>and in Egypt,</v>

126
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:57.754
<v Speaker 2>you see it,</v>

127
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 2>you see it carved into the walls and everyone thinks these are the scenes of</v>

128
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.094
<v Speaker 2>daily life.</v>

129
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>While they are scenes of daily life with the decodeable as transformational</v>

130
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:08.284
<v Speaker 2>activities.</v>

131
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 2>So anything that you do,</v>

132
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.270
<v Speaker 2>and boy,</v>

133
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 2>you're doing marshal,</v>

134
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 2>you have arts.</v>

135
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 2>This is a highly developed skill.</v>

136
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.520
<v Speaker 2>You will are somebody that you wouldn't be if you were,</v>

137
00:04:19.521 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 2>didn't have that scale.</v>

138
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 2>If you were doing a podcast and what you did for a living was flipping burgers</v>

139
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:25.984
<v Speaker 2>at Mcdonald's,</v>

140
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be Joe Rogan.</v>

141
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.650
<v Speaker 2>The you've,</v>

142
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

143
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

144
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 2>you've been doing your homework without maybe even thinking that it was</v>

145
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:34.174
<v Speaker 2>homework.</v>

146
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.741
<v Speaker 2>Cause any,</v>

147
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 2>anything that you're involved in that,</v>

148
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 2>that you go at with a quest for perfection of whatever it is,</v>

149
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 2>has this transformational value.</v>

150
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 2>And when you recognize,</v>

151
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.753
<v Speaker 2>when you know it,</v>

152
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.391
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

153
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 2>when you know it intellectually,</v>

154
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 2>when you can articulate it,</v>

155
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.163
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

156
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.633
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

157
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 2>it implements the actually the activity itself.</v>

158
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's possible even to do that.</v>

159
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 2>You could be an,</v>

160
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 2>or you could be an enlightened Burger flipper and the Sophie's are very good at,</v>

161
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.563
<v Speaker 2>the Sufi is</v>

163
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.821
<v Speaker 2>in life,</v>

164
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 2>but not as inland.</v>

165
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Why sorry is in life but not have it.</v>

166
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.891
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

167
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

168
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 2>you can practice waking up as it were in the midst of the most mundane thing you</v>

169
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.083
<v Speaker 2>could be.</v>

170
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

171
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>you could be an enlightened garbage,</v>

172
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 2>garbage collector as long as you knew what you were doing.</v>

173
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different thing.</v>

174
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.821
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>

175
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a garbage collector.</v>

176
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a totally different thing to collect the garbage consciously than it is</v>

177
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 2>to just do it resentfully because that's the only job that they can get all,</v>

178
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

179
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.610
<v Speaker 2>so when,</v>

180
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.471
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking,</v>

181
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:44.601
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

182
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 2>it's not as though this is,</v>

183
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not as though this is</v>

184
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 2>anything actually new.</v>

185
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 2>It's as the oldest idea that ever was and it's something that people have been</v>

186
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 2>doing for thousands and thousands of years.</v>

187
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

188
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I had hunted</v>

189
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 3>around that area previously and so I knew there was elk in the area.</v>

190
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.403
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

191
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I just had never been that far back in before.</v>

192
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.130
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you to tell you the truth,</v>

193
00:06:08.131 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

194
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 3>and nearly completely failed on me because I went days and days about here and</v>

195
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:11.841
<v Speaker 3>I'll see,</v>

196
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

197
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.213
<v Speaker 3>an elk.</v>

198
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.460
<v Speaker 3>But the sign was there to say that we're in,</v>

199
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.031
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>

200
00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 3>it's just that the grizzlies and the,</v>

201
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 3>the walls were hunting that area so hard that had shut the fuck up and push a</v>

202
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 3>lot of them out of the area.</v>

203
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

204
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 3>And then all those Neilia new food source.</v>

205
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.653
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

206
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.430
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

207
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.120
<v Speaker 4>So when you get in there and you don't see anything for a couple of days,</v>

208
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.601
<v Speaker 4>like what,</v>

209
00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:36.070
<v Speaker 4>what is the mindset like?</v>

210
00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:36.540
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

211
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.850
<v Speaker 3>There's heaps of doubt and there's always that.</v>

212
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like you second guess yourself.</v>

213
00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:42.540
<v Speaker 3>This was a Steven move.</v>

214
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:43.530
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't have came in here.</v>

215
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.030
<v Speaker 3>You need to change spots.</v>

216
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.893
<v Speaker 3>But then it's like,</v>

217
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.980
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>

218
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 3>your experience in this for a reason,</v>

219
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:49.830
<v Speaker 3>and this is how hunting should be,</v>

220
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.790
<v Speaker 3>hunting should be hard.</v>

221
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.860
<v Speaker 3>You should hunting should never be,</v>

222
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.880
<v Speaker 3>unless you've done your research going into a place and there's just like gain</v>

223
00:06:56.881 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 3>walking past everywhere.</v>

224
00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.520
<v Speaker 3>There should always be cause that's the hunt,</v>

225
00:06:59.521 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

226
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

227
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Finding it or going through the hardship to find it,</v>

228
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 3>tracking it,</v>

229
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.860
<v Speaker 3>fondant,</v>

230
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.311
<v Speaker 3>find them.</v>

231
00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Where's the better spot within that area.</v>

232
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.990
<v Speaker 3>So at the same time that my is like,</v>

233
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

234
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.120
<v Speaker 3>you've made a bad decision.</v>

235
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.590
<v Speaker 3>This is a crap spot to be.</v>

236
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.260
<v Speaker 3>There's the whole experience of lock nut.</v>

237
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.520
<v Speaker 3>This is how hunting should be.</v>

238
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.900
<v Speaker 3>It should be difficult.</v>

239
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.660
<v Speaker 3>You should have to work your ass off to try and find the animal.</v>

240
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.940
<v Speaker 3>And when you actually do find the animal,</v>

241
00:07:23.941 --> 00:07:24.930
<v Speaker 3>how much better is it?</v>

242
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

243
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:31.191
<v Speaker 3>it's just like if you haunted for 11 months and you didn't say a bowl,</v>

244
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:33.661
<v Speaker 3>you found a boy,</v>

245
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:34.890
<v Speaker 3>you had a shot in your missed.</v>

246
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.940
<v Speaker 3>But then the next one you get,</v>

247
00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:37.590
<v Speaker 3>how good is that next one that you get?</v>

248
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.371
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

249
00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:39.300
<v Speaker 3>if that was the case,</v>

250
00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:42.210
<v Speaker 3>and it was very similar on this trip where I put in all that effort,</v>

251
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.680
<v Speaker 3>didn't see an animal.</v>

252
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.360
<v Speaker 3>One opportunity,</v>

253
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.440
<v Speaker 3>a bull comes in.</v>

254
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

255
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 3>I ended up calling that bull from like a mile away.</v>

256
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.910
<v Speaker 3>You can just hearing coming up this canyon and I did that shot and dude,</v>

257
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:54.744
<v Speaker 3>I tee it up.</v>

258
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.110
<v Speaker 3>I was crying because I knew how much had gone into it.</v>

259
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

260
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.150
<v Speaker 3>and it's not just the effort,</v>

261
00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:00.570
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

262
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.410
<v Speaker 3>like obviously I'm,</v>

263
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm away from my wife Kim and the kids.</v>

264
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm away from the kids for a month now.</v>

265
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.670
<v Speaker 3>There's all that sacrifice is all the hard shit.</v>

266
00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:09.570
<v Speaker 3>There's all the effort.</v>

267
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:10.741
<v Speaker 3>There's walking in,</v>

268
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:13.530
<v Speaker 3>there's putting up with that absolutely atrocious weaver.</v>

269
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.970
<v Speaker 3>And then finally one opportunity comes up and you kill that animal as well as</v>

270
00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:18.631
<v Speaker 3>kill an animal.</v>

271
00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:19.620
<v Speaker 3>That's a hard thing to do,</v>

272
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:20.911
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

273
00:08:20.911 --> 00:08:21.630
<v Speaker 3>I bowled up.</v>

274
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.060
<v Speaker 3>I was crying like I think I cried a dozen times.</v>

275
00:08:24.061 --> 00:08:26.550
<v Speaker 3>Every time I thought about it when I was standing over the ball,</v>

276
00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:27.384
<v Speaker 3>I was crying.</v>

277
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.283
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

278
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:28.920
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

279
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.480
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's got to be that hard.</v>

280
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.250
<v Speaker 3>So you can appreciate their animal.</v>

281
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.790
<v Speaker 3>So you realize what has to go into the hunt to actually get something killed.</v>

282
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.040
<v Speaker 3>Should I think every hunt should be like that.</v>

283
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I hope they're not.</v>

284
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.031
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

285
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:39.540
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

286
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.680
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of elk.</v>

287
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:41.993
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

288
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:50.710
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
