00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>one of the most interesting things that I learned from the injury was,</v>

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>was how,</v>

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>how your physical health or wellbeing alters your perception of the world.</v>

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I um,</v>

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>have you ever heard of the study?</v>

8
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>They do like the hot and Cold Cup study where they have someone come in to fill</v>

9
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>out a survey,</v>

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>that's what they tell them.</v>

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>And then a person gets in an elevator and they,</v>

13
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.541
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

15
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>there's someone in there like confederate,</v>

17
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>an actor is in there that's like,</v>

18
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>here I,</v>

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.751
<v Speaker 1>my hands are full.</v>

20
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Could you hold this cup for me?</v>

21
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's either like a hot cup of coffee or whatever,</v>

22
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>or a cold drink and the person says,</v>

23
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>sure takes the drink,</v>

24
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>goes up the elevator,</v>

25
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:46.134
<v Speaker 1>gets off,</v>

26
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>gives it back to them,</v>

27
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>says Bob goes in and takes the survey and then afterwards,</v>

29
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>and this is what it's actually about.</v>

30
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.481
<v Speaker 1>Afterwards they go,</v>

31
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>did you meet anyone?</v>

32
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And the way in.</v>

33
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

34
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>of actually someone I met someone in the elevator and then they'll,</v>

35
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.771
<v Speaker 1>they'll be like,</v>

36
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:02.604
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

37
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>

39
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>can you describe that person?</v>

40
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>And if they had,</v>

41
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>if they had the hot drink,</v>

42
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

43
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>they were more,</v>

45
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>they would more often describe them as being like warm or friendly.</v>

47
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>And if they had the cold drink they would,</v>

48
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.610
<v Speaker 1>they would describe them as cold or distant.</v>

49
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.003
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

50
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 1>and the idea is,</v>

51
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:22.774
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

52
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.251
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

53
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>that the way our brains evolved kind of these,</v>

55
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>these higher ideas of,</v>

56
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>of what like being distant as a personality trait or whatever means he has to be</v>

57
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>built over this preexisting kind of a five senses kind of software.</v>

58
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

59
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

60
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>so there's all these metaphors for,</v>

61
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>so you call someone like bright or you say we're having a deep conversation or</v>

62
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>someone's shallow.</v>

63
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these ways in which we describe life is,</v>

64
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>is kind of used through these physical metaphors.</v>

65
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>And I remember when I,</v>

66
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>when I broke my feet,</v>

67
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking the whole fucking world is broken.</v>

68
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember thinking like eyes on eyes going down this mountain for like</v>

69
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:12.084
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

70
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.043
<v Speaker 1>three hours.</v>

71
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't just worried about my feet.</v>

72
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:20.091
<v Speaker 1>Eyes also like in the political system is like everything just seemed broken</v>

73
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:25.371
<v Speaker 1>like the whole world and then I also remember after I got the second surgery,</v>

74
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>after the bone infection and stuff and having to change all of this,</v>

75
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:33.471
<v Speaker 1>I remember feeling like like something like this nagging feeling that I couldn't</v>

76
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:36.181
<v Speaker 1>get over.</v>

77
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

78
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>something's missing from my life.</v>

79
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>There's just this deep,</v>

80
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:41.920
<v Speaker 1>like whole,</v>

81
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>like somewhere in my soul in my leg.</v>

82
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>And then one day I realized I'm like,</v>

83
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.021
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

84
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking hole in my foot.</v>

85
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>There's an actual hole in my foot.</v>

86
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what's missing.</v>

87
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

88
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>and just how much that that your,</v>

89
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>your physical senses can alter what your perception of the world is.</v>

90
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>The food denial,</v>

91
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 2>floods and the food jumps out of the ground and under the,</v>

92
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>under the,</v>

93
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.480
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

94
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.930
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

95
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.763
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

96
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.590
<v Speaker 2>with a series of genuinely enlightened rulers or at least pretty close to</v>

97
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:17.090
<v Speaker 2>enlightened rule is ruling them.</v>

98
00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 2>That all lasts for 3,500 years and how did they live?</v>

99
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 2>You'll see everything that they did.</v>

100
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:22.691
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

101
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 2>until quite recently,</v>

102
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.130
<v Speaker 2>there were no such things as jobs that were trades and crafts and skills and</v>

103
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>arts and everybody,</v>

104
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

105
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>yes in Europe,</v>

106
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.270
<v Speaker 2>the combination of or a repressive church and then oppressive nobility kept</v>

107
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:41.840
<v Speaker 2>everybody you know,</v>

108
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 2>immersed in serfdom in one way or another,</v>

109
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 2>but what people actually did with that lives was in some sense or another</v>

110
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>transformational all of it.</v>

111
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot of smarts to be a good peasant.</v>

112
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.300
<v Speaker 2>All of these things that people used to do as a matter of course,</v>

113
00:03:56.301 --> 00:03:56.891
<v Speaker 2>and in Egypt,</v>

114
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:57.724
<v Speaker 2>you see it,</v>

115
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 2>you see it carved into the walls and everyone thinks these are the scenes of</v>

116
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 2>daily life where they are scenes of daily life with the decodable as</v>

117
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 2>transformational activities.</v>

118
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 2>So anything that you do on doing doing martial arts,</v>

119
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 2>this is a highly developed skill.</v>

120
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 2>You are somebody that you wouldn't be if you didn't have that skill.</v>

121
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 2>If you were doing a podcast and what you did for a living was flipping burgers</v>

122
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:25.984
<v Speaker 2>at Mcdonald's.</v>

123
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be Joe Rogan do you've,</v>

124
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

125
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

126
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 2>you've been doing your homework without maybe even thinking that it was</v>

127
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:34.174
<v Speaker 2>homework.</v>

128
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Because anything that you're involved in that,</v>

129
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 2>that you go at with a quest for perfection of whatever it is,</v>

130
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 2>has this transformational value,</v>

131
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 2>and when you recognize,</v>

132
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.753
<v Speaker 2>when you're not with,</v>

133
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.421
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

134
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 2>when you know it intellectually,</v>

135
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 2>when you can articulate it,</v>

136
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.120
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't fit,</v>

137
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 2>it implements the actually the activity itself.</v>

138
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's possible even to do that.</v>

139
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 2>You could be,</v>

140
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 2>it could be an enlightened burger.</v>

141
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Flipper and the Sophie's are very good at the Sufi is</v>

142
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.821
<v Speaker 2>in life,</v>

143
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 2>but not in la by sorry is in life,</v>

144
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.283
<v Speaker 2>but not have it.</v>

145
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.891
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

146
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

147
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 2>you can practice waking up as it were in the midst of the most mundane thing.</v>

148
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.933
<v Speaker 2>You could be.</v>

149
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.400
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

150
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>you could be an enlightened garbage,</v>

151
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 2>garbage collector as long as you knew what you were doing.</v>

152
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different thing.</v>

153
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine that.</v>

154
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Not Garbage collector,</v>

155
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 2>that's a totally different thing to collect the garbage consciously.</v>

156
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Men just do it resentfully because that's the only job that they can get all.</v>

157
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.093
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

158
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 2>so when,</v>

159
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.471
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking,</v>

160
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:44.601
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

161
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:45.830
<v Speaker 2>it's not as though this is,</v>

162
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.590
<v Speaker 2>it's not as though this is</v>

163
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.450
<v Speaker 2>anything actually new.</v>

164
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 2>It's the oldest idea that ever was and it's something that people have been</v>

165
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 2>doing for thousands and thousands of years.</v>

166
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I had hunted</v>

167
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 3>around that area previously and so I knew there was elk in the area.</v>

168
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 3>I just had never been that far back in before.</v>

169
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 3>And I tell you to tell you the truth,</v>

170
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.590
<v Speaker 3>it is nearly completely filed on me because I went days and days of out here and</v>

171
00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll see an elk,</v>

172
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 3>but the sign was there to say that we're in,</v>

173
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.041
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>

174
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 3>it's just that the greys leads and the wolves were hunting that area so hard</v>

175
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 3>that it shut the fuck up and pushed a lot of them out of the area.</v>

176
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

177
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 3>And then I was nearly new food source.</v>

178
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.603
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

179
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.430
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

180
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.120
<v Speaker 4>So when you get in there and you don't see anything for a couple of days,</v>

181
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.661
<v Speaker 4>like what,</v>

182
00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:34.841
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

183
00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:36.030
<v Speaker 4>what is the mindset like?</v>

184
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

185
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.520
<v Speaker 3>There's heaps of doubt and there's always that lucky second guess yourself.</v>

186
00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:42.540
<v Speaker 3>This is a stupid move.</v>

187
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:43.530
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't have came in here.</v>

188
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.060
<v Speaker 3>You need to change spots,</v>

189
00:06:45.061 --> 00:06:45.894
<v Speaker 3>but then it's like.</v>

190
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.980
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

191
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.580
<v Speaker 3>your experience in this for a reason,</v>

192
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.830
<v Speaker 3>this is how hunting should be.</v>

193
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Hunting should be hard.</v>

194
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.050
<v Speaker 3>You should hunting,</v>

195
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.070
<v Speaker 3>never be unless you've done your research going into a place and they're just</v>

196
00:06:56.071 --> 00:06:57.610
<v Speaker 3>like game walking past year,</v>

197
00:06:57.611 --> 00:06:57.990
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

198
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.890
<v Speaker 3>There should always be,</v>

199
00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.491
<v Speaker 3>because that's the hunt,</v>

200
00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:00.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

201
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Finding it or gone through the hardship to find it,</v>

202
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.051
<v Speaker 3>tracking it,</v>

203
00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:07.380
<v Speaker 3>fond and find them where's the better spot within that area.</v>

204
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.990
<v Speaker 3>So at the same time that my mind's like,</v>

205
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

206
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.120
<v Speaker 3>you've made a bad decision.</v>

207
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.590
<v Speaker 3>This is a crap spot to be.</v>

208
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.260
<v Speaker 3>There's the whole experience of lock nut.</v>

209
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.520
<v Speaker 3>This is how hunting should be.</v>

210
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Should be difficult.</v>

211
00:07:18.901 --> 00:07:21.660
<v Speaker 3>You should have to work your ass off to try and find the animal.</v>

212
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.940
<v Speaker 3>And when you actually do find that animal,</v>

213
00:07:23.941 --> 00:07:24.900
<v Speaker 3>how much better is it?</v>

214
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

215
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:27.790
<v Speaker 3>it's just like if,</v>

216
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.790
<v Speaker 3>if you hunted for 11 months and you didn't say a bowl,</v>

217
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.661
<v Speaker 3>you found a bowl,</v>

218
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:34.890
<v Speaker 3>you had a shot in your midst,</v>

219
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.940
<v Speaker 3>but then the next one you get,</v>

220
00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:37.590
<v Speaker 3>how good's that next one that you get?</v>

221
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.401
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

222
00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:41.580
<v Speaker 3>if that was the case and it was very similar on this trip where I put in all</v>

223
00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:42.414
<v Speaker 3>that effort,</v>

224
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.680
<v Speaker 3>didn't say an animal.</v>

225
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.360
<v Speaker 3>One opportunity,</v>

226
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.440
<v Speaker 3>a bull comes in.</v>

227
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I ended up calling that bull from like a mile away.</v>

228
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:53.910
<v Speaker 3>You could just hear him coming up this canyon and I did that shot and dude,</v>

229
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:54.744
<v Speaker 3>I teared up.</v>

230
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.110
<v Speaker 3>I was crying because I knew how much had gone into it,</v>

231
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

232
00:07:58.621 --> 00:08:00.150
<v Speaker 3>and it's not just the effort,</v>

233
00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:00.571
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

234
00:08:00.571 --> 00:08:01.404
<v Speaker 3>like obviously I'm,</v>

235
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm away from my wife Kim and the kids.</v>

236
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm away from the kids for a month now.</v>

237
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.670
<v Speaker 3>There's all that sacrifice is all the hard shit.</v>

238
00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:09.570
<v Speaker 3>There's all the effort.</v>

239
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:10.741
<v Speaker 3>There's walking in,</v>

240
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:13.530
<v Speaker 3>there's putting up with that absolutely atrocious wherever.</v>

241
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.970
<v Speaker 3>And then finally one opportunity comes up and you kill that animal as well as</v>

242
00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:18.631
<v Speaker 3>kill an animal.</v>

243
00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:19.620
<v Speaker 3>That's a hard thing to do,</v>

244
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:20.911
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

245
00:08:20.911 --> 00:08:21.660
<v Speaker 3>I balled up.</v>

246
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.060
<v Speaker 3>I was crying like I think I cried a dozen times.</v>

247
00:08:24.061 --> 00:08:26.590
<v Speaker 3>Every time I thought about it when I was standing over the ball,</v>

248
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:27.424
<v Speaker 3>I was crawling.</v>

249
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.263
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

250
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:28.920
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

251
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.480
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's got to be that hard.</v>

252
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 3>So you can appreciate that animal so you realize what has to go into the hunt</v>

253
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.820
<v Speaker 3>actually get someone killed.</v>

254
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.040
<v Speaker 3>Should I think everyone should be like that?</v>

255
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I hope they're not.</v>

256
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.031
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

257
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:39.480
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

258
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.680
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of elk.</v>

259
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
