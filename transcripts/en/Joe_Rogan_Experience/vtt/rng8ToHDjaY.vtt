all sorts of different,

16
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.760
let's try and get me to sign in here.
No one's trying to do that.
We,

17
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:01.500
monster.com forward slash show.

18
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.850
Why is it doing something weird or that it didn't do before?
Um,

19
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.250
anyway,
scientifically designed to challenge your brain and do it like,

20
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.260
like a game.
So it makes it fun.
Um,

21
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.700
I enjoy playing the games only takes a few minutes a day and over time you can

22
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.910
actually track your progress online and compare yourself to others if you're one

23
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:27.750
of those mother fuckers that I was to compare yourself to others.
Like I,

24
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.860
there was this one guy,

25
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.950
I remember this documentary about what the smartest man in the world and he

26
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:35.970
worked as a bouncer in a bar in long island and I'm like,
ah,

27
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.080
no you're not okay.

28
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.700
You're not because you work as a bouncer in a bar in La and you're just not the

29
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.960
fucking smartest guy in the world.

30
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.770
And he was this guy who was giving rambling on and on and he was super verbose

31
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:49.800
and using a lot of big words and going on about,
you know,

32
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:53.550
he's the first guy ever that's come come the closest to ultimate meaning to

33
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:58.260
remember that guy,
big fat face dummy.
I thought he was just very,
very cold out,

34
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.880
convinced why?
Because he got a good number on a Mensa test,
you know,

35
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:07.050
so he's,
he's good at figuring out how to count up numbers socially.

36
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.310
He's a mess.
Uh,

37
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:11.460
unable to see how goofy he sounds saying he's the smartest man in the world.

38
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.730
No self deprecating skills.
Thinks he's a bad ass.

39
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:18.150
Cause he was a bouncer at a bar in long island and think it's like some sort of

40
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:22.470
a run UNESCO cataract character,
you know,
just a rebel.
He's a,

41
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.230
he's a bouncer,
but he's the smartest man in the world.
Now you're not dead.

42
00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:27.510
But if you were smartest man in the world,

43
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.780
you would realize being a bouncer at a fucking bar in long island sucks a fat

44
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:35.040
deck and you'd get a better job.
Dummy.
That job's dumb.

45
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.020
Not The answer.
Now,
I was a security guard at one point in time.
I'm not above,

46
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.820
I'm talking,
I'm not above,
don't get me wrong,

47
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.890
but you can't claim smartest guy in the world.

48
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:47.850
And that's where you found yourself at 40 so shut your hole and go to Lumosity.

49
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.220

52
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.500
it's a fun way to do things that,
you know,

53
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.680
Nord Nerilee would feel just like games,

54
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.300
but these games actually are scientifically designed through something called

55
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:13.370
neuroplasticity,
which I'm too stupid to understand.
Uh,

56
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.500

iPad with a free Lumosity APP.

99
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.670
<v 1>We had an issue.
We had a little,
a little sound issue.</v>

100
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.100
We wanted to make sure that everything was clean and smooth.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.130

uh,
hey,
what's up fuckers?
What are you doing?

104
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.130
<v 2>We're,
you know,
we're chilling.
We're so excited to be in California.
Yeah.</v>

105
00:06:20.131 --> 00:06:24.180
What happened?
Nashville lost its charm.
Well,
oh well knowing when we left,

106
00:06:24.181 --> 00:06:25.800
let's put it that way.
Was it really?
Yeah,

107
00:06:25.801 --> 00:06:29.790
it was snowing and it's really interesting because the whole city really shuts

108
00:06:29.791 --> 00:06:34.410
down like at like schools close and I'm talking like a mile dusting,

109
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.580
just like

110
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.180
<v 1>they just told you already.
It was like rain out here.
Right here.</v>

111
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:43.260
People Freak out.
But worse though,
right?
The freak out.
Do you mean like Joe?
Yeah.

112
00:06:43.261 --> 00:06:47.970
Joey was he Thompson?
Guerra.
Joey was with,
I forget who he was with in um,
Oregon.

113
00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:52.200
They were up in Oregon doing shows and it a freak snowstorm blanketed the city

114
00:06:52.201 --> 00:06:55.250
and then it got icy rain below it.
Yeah.

115
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.430
So it was snow on top of icy rain.
It was just the whole city just shut down.

116
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.630
<v 2>I mean,
if,
if they don't have the,
you know,
uh,
the salt trucks and all that stuff,</v>

117
00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:07.390
and if people don't know how to drive it,
they really shouldn't,
you know?

118
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.070
But it's really interesting.
I mean,
they,

119
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.870
they closed school for like three days and you know,
the roads were really fine.

120
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.300
Right.
It's just,
it was amazing.

121
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.080
<v 1>What do you guys think about Nashville?
Has the charm worn off?</v>

122
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.250
Are you bored with it?
Already?

123
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.650
<v 3>Talk.
And we came back the other night.
We got,</v>

124
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.090
got into la yesterday and walked into this bar and all these people that I knew

125
00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:31.750
were there and all these friends and it just felt good man.
And there's friends.

126
00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:34.630
There's really it.
Nashville is interesting because when you first get there,

127
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.460
it's such an open community and people welcome you in and everyone's sweetened.

128
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.840
You have friends and all of a sudden you're,
you,
you go out to the barn,

129
00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:41.674
you know people.

130
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.350
But there's a difference when you see people you've been with for eight years,

131
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.910
10 years,
it just feels right.

132
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.680
<v 1>Good.
Right,
right.
So coming back,
I don't know.
Beautiful.
They're kind of wistful.</v>

133
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.070
Do you guys,
do you,
do you mess the,

134
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:56.200
like the largeness of the city or is it the people,

135
00:07:56.201 --> 00:08:00.070
the attitude like Di did you feel different?
Like a different vibe?

136
00:08:00.071 --> 00:08:01.460
I've never lived in that bro.
Yeah,

137
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.540
but did you get like a different vibe from the people?

138
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.590
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean the,
the d well first of all,
I mean,</v>

139
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.780
you can drive around the whole city in like 15 minutes.
I mean,
it's just,
you're,

140
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.190
the days feel longer because you're not stuck in your car trying to get here to

141
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.390
there like you do in La.
It doesn't,
you know what I mean?

142
00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:22.250
It's you just sort of like,
everything is really accessible,
which is,

143
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.000
which was great because as far as our productivity and working on the record,

144
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:29.610
which is kind of why we went there,
um,
to write and have all this space,

145
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.750
Richard and then we just kept,
we still not done with do it there.

146
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.100
We keep coming back here to work on.
Yeah,
it's true.
So it's really interesting,

147
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:40.280
like how,
you know there's,
there's some,
there's a number of reasons why,
you know,

148
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:43.640
it's,
it's a much more affordable town and all that stuff,
but,
but when you,

149
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.650
when I come to California now,
I really feel like,
like this intense energy,

150
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:51.170
like you're like vibrating.
It's so exciting.
I just,
you know,

151
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:55.950
you kind of feel like,
it's like this shock of you.
You're just awake

152
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.280
<v 1>and there's all this stuff happening.
There's so many,</v>

153
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.000
so many fucking people and Nashville's great.

154
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.630
It's just like really chill,
you know?
Good.

155
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.880
Sometimes when you have it for a long time,
you kind of get a little stir crazy.

156
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.340
It just doesn't look good to look my crazy eyes.

157
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.210
The diversity here,
it's a completely different game in terms of that there,

158
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:26.211
there's this really interesting going on of like Bible belt conservatism and

159
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.040
freaky people.
You know,
there's kind of different 50 people area,

160
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.500
but that's spreading quirky.
People are spreading.
We're windows.

161
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.960
It's more fun to be a Weirdo.
That Bible Belles Shit.

162
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.010
Once he catch a few of them fucking kids doing weird shit.

163
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.970
We're supposed to be all high Falutin that's kind of game over there.
Yeah,

164
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:46.770
it's game over.
They start losing credibility.

165
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.960
I definitely feel a little more self aware in Nashville as far as like my,

166
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:54.120
you know,
my fucking potty mouth and my,
you know,

167
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:58.320
just being loud and loud because there's a lot more,

168
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:03.410
I feel like [inaudible] liquored up.

169
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.300
You picked it up.
I think people are a little more reserved.
Of course.
Yeah.

170
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.390
I genuinely really enjoy playing there.
I think it's one of my favorite places.

171
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.460
I love the people there.
I love the small town thing about it too.

172
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.320
I just think people are super friendly there,

173
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.510
but I wonder if I would go crazy if I lived there.

174
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.770
The by the Bible belt thing would probably can avoid it and it's honestly,
it's,

175
00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:30.060
it seems fairly segregated.
It's like you just don't walk down that street.

176
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.120
That's hilarious.
Yeah,
that's true.
Amazing.
People believe in dinosaurs.

177
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.220
They're street.
Not so much.
Somebody tweeted me something with some woman,

178
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:38.750
you know,

179
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:43.020
they were just talking about the dinosaurs must've probably drown and she wasn't

180
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:46.260
trolling,
uh,
that,
that Noah didn't have room for them on the Ark,

181
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:50.940
so they probably won't drown.
He knows our Facebook page and someone,

182
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:52.920
someone sent me a tweet,
can you believe this silly bitch?

183
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.860
And it was a two or Facebook page because it was so ridiculous that random

184
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:58.320
people that didn't even know her.
We're going to her Facebook page and be like,

185
00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:01.740
pitch,
are you fucking crazy?
Dinosaurs drowned.

186
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.750
It's fucking Russell Kroll's fault.
He decided to do this God damn Noah movie.

187
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:08.850
And the whole thing gets stirred up again.
No,

188
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.170
he's dead.
It's a Darren our foam long ski,

189
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:18.171
whenever his name was [inaudible] [inaudible] who is a apparently bad

190
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.580
motherfucker.
He's done a lot of pretty bad ass movies,
right?
Yeah.

191
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.890
But what else has he done?
Oh God.
Did he do gladiator?

192
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.930
I don't know who that is.
Have you seen the ads for Noah?
Nope.

193
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.980
<v 4>Which page?
Damn it.
That's exciting.
And I would love to give him a French braid,</v>

194
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.720
which you really like.
Rocket Jamaica style up.
Just checking in once.

195
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.120
He's like the Denzel

196
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.070
of white people kind of does spray since all the,
never got fat.

197
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.273
Awesome

198
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.120
speech.
A story.

199
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.693
You'll love this movie.

200
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.230
<v 1>You know,
they,
I don't,
you know,
fantasy kind of like Lord of the rings.</v>

201
00:12:18.231 --> 00:12:20.270
I'm so grateful,
Lord of the Rings.
I'm like,
God,

202
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.140
I really enjoyed Lord of the rings too.
I love fantasy movies.
They're fun.

203
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:29.090
I had high hopes for the new code and movie didn't really work out.

204
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.900
It's terrible shit.
But it was good.
Like halfway into it I was like,

205
00:12:32.901 --> 00:12:33.740
it's still pretty good.

206
00:12:33.741 --> 00:12:38.741
And then the new Conan is the guy from game of Thrones who played,

207
00:12:38.871 --> 00:12:42.770
um,
the barbarian dude was banging Khaleesi

208
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:54.010
I bet that dude,
he's a very nice guy,
too.
Big giant handsome bastard.
And uh,

209
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:58.810
he was the perfect Conan Lenny Kravitz daughter or something.
Could they or no,

210
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.130
that'll work.
That'll,
that'll last.
Sorry.

211
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.530
Wait to be optimist.
He's awesome.
I mean,

212
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:13.030
he's just too handsome to be running around.
They're married to anybody.
But,
uh,

213
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.760
the,
uh,
the movie was like,
it held promise,
you know,

214
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.110
it looked like it was going to be good,

215
00:13:18.111 --> 00:13:22.130
but like all these fucking movies and eventually falls apart unfortunately.

216
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.620
But I gave it a shot.
I don't,
didn't remember that coming out.

217
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.670
Did it get good reviews or it did dog shit reviews wasn't that good.

218
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.460
But he's the perfect Connie on.
If they had a good writer,

219
00:13:31.461 --> 00:13:34.100
like if you got James Cameron involved and he,
you know,

220
00:13:34.101 --> 00:13:37.610
put together like some Avatar type tone and movie,
it would be the shit.

221
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.390
Cause the guys,
the perfect coin he got can act as ass off.
He's good.
You know,

222
00:13:41.391 --> 00:13:44.810
he really would have been Conan,
but they gave him a dog shit movie.

223
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.630
That's a bummer.
It is.
And you can't turn that role.
It's like,
it's a huge role.

224
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:52.280
You know,
you can't turn it down and then everything else falls through.

225
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.990
Well nobody remembers anyway.
You guys didn't remember it.
Nobody remembers.

226
00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.180
I think making movies must be hard.
Uh,
fuck.
So yeah,

227
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:05.330
you do it at home.
There's so many people involved.
There's too many people.

228
00:14:05.331 --> 00:14:08.330
The beautiful thing about what you guys do is who do you,
you know,

229
00:14:08.331 --> 00:14:12.230
you fucking talk amongst yourselves.
You know,
you say you want more of this,

230
00:14:12.231 --> 00:14:15.050
and he says he wants more of that and together you find some sort of a happy

231
00:14:15.051 --> 00:14:16.400
medium and you create your shit.

232
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.870
But could you imagine if you had a bunch of money people?
Well,

233
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.360
I'm not saying it's easy at all,
but different of less intervention.

234
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:28.190
Then you making a movie,
man,
you got hundreds of people that have their say.

235
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.890
You have so many people that you have.

236
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.050
You have to consider what kind of movie you're making.

237
00:14:33.051 --> 00:14:35.180
If you're making an independent movie,
right?

238
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.110
Even then you guys still have a deal with 15 people.

239
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.800
Some actor wants to do a fucking monologue in the middle of the scene.

240
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:43.820
You're like,
probably this is not the part.
The part is not,

241
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.360
it doesn't do a monologue,
man.
I'll do it.
If I could do a monologue here.
Well,

242
00:14:47.361 --> 00:14:51.980
this is a different movie.
Then the guys deaf,
he can't talk.
He can be

243
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.330
<v 5>like the end psych.
Here's what I heard.
This was always about making choices.</v>

244
00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.920
<v 1>Choice.
It's,
it's just when you deal with a lot of people,</v>

245
00:14:59.921 --> 00:15:02.920
it's very difficult to have a creative vision that goes through.

246
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.120
Do you guys have any,
like,
do you,
does your manager ever say,
look,
you need more,

247
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.950
more jokes or more songs about this or more songs about that had stuff like that

248
00:15:11.951 --> 00:15:13.020
before and gross.

249
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.550
<v 5>Yeah.
Well,
I mean at the end of the day it's like if you have,
we really</v>

250
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.080
too difficult to work with like that.

251
00:15:22.081 --> 00:15:24.920
We don't right now we don't have a manager right now.
Maybe that's what happened.

252
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.350
<v 1>Then I may your manager and I'll tell him what was it I had done?</v>

253
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:31.750
Me Your agent or your manager,
can you remember an agent?

254
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.400
<v 5>Yeah.
And that was an amicable thing,
but just,</v>

255
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.870
I don't know what kind of like the tiger,
I don't like you.
You don't like me.

256
00:15:36.871 --> 00:15:40.390
Let's get out of here.
But people say Amazon

257
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.810
<v 1>divorce is like,
well,
it's amicable.
Who?
No,
it's not amicable.</v>

258
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.360
You got so sick of each other that you went to court.
Okay.

259
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:51.200
Don't tell me to amicable like each other's still as human beings.

260
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.440
But that shit ain't amicable.
You don't live together anymore.
You don't fuck,

261
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:55.490
you guys got divorced

262
00:15:55.730 --> 00:16:00.030
<v 5>[inaudible] I heard a new term for that today though.</v>

263
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.420
Cause I was reading about the Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin.
It just came up.

264
00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:07.740
I wasn't looking for it.
It's an unconscious wait,
wait,
conscious on partnering,

265
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.510
partnering,
Janet,
Gwyneth Paltrow,
splitting up with her man.
Just partnering.

266
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:17.390
So sad.
I'm a fucking romantic day.
I bet you are.

267
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.280
I believe it.
And we'll loosen this other one would love,
Hey,

268
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:26.220
I'm just saying he wants to live with Paltrow four though or that guy from

269
00:16:26.221 --> 00:16:30.540
Coldplay.
I'm sure he's a fucking whiny vagina to Jesus Christ.

270
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:35.700
I mean anybody who writes and sings those songs,
beautiful songs as they may be.

271
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.290
Why are you not like tears that a single and how come your songs aren't about

272
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:43.020
celebrating the fact that you're a fucking rockstar?

273
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.110
How come your songs aren't celebrating the fact that

274
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.460
it truly is?
Dude,

275
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.720
so celebration,
you're unbelievable.
Kool and the gang knew how to do it.

276
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.390
Stevie wonder knew how to do it.
But most people,
I bet most of the bands

277
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.020
<v 1>that you listened to,
right?
Depressing shit a long time.
Is that easier?</v>

278
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.220
It's just easy to access that.
So or easier.

279
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.320
Is it easier also to not be like,

280
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:17.570
like a sort of a superficial dommy who's singing about happiness?

281
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:21.590
Like if you sing about moodiness,
like you're automatically deep and meaningful.

282
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:26.540
Yeah,
Bro.
Like I remember that movie.
21 grams.
You remember that movie recently?

283
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:31.160
It's so sad.
It's so sad.
And I made a decision after I saw that movie.
I said,

284
00:17:31.161 --> 00:17:35.420
never again will I go see a movie that's trying to make me sad.
Like I don't,

285
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.430
I don't buy the idea that it's deep because it makes you feel like shit.

286
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.120
I don't buy it.
I know what you're doing.
You're,
you're,
it's,
this is a game here.

287
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.330
Everything falls apart.
Everything goes to shit at the end.

288
00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:51.690
You feel all this loss and then I,
I know what you did.
You guys fucked me.

289
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.910
You pretended that you were doing something deep.
You're not,

290
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.750
you're just doing something depressing,
depressing and deeper.

291
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.290
Not the same goddamn thing

292
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:03.600
<v 2>it's on,
on.
Um,
I recently saw that movie.
Was it the lone ranger?</v>

293
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.200
Wait,

294
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.350
<v 6>no,
no.
India.</v>

295
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.370
Not the lone ranger.
Not the lone ranger.

296
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.580
<v 2>The uh,
the one with Mark Wahlberg.
Oh my God.
I'm so sorry.
The lone soldier.</v>

297
00:18:16.581 --> 00:18:21.170
Lone survivor.
Survivor.
God,
Samsonite.
Um,
it was,

298
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.860
but,

299
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.370
but that was based off of a true story and actually has some relevance as far as

300
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.120
the reality that we live in right now.
Yeah,
definitely.
But that,

301
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.690
that is a little bit different.
That's not necessarily like,
Hey,

302
00:18:32.691 --> 00:18:37.130
I'm making this movie to fuck you up.
Yeah.
But it really fucked me up.

303
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.490
I had to go drive around for like 20 minutes after I left the movie theater.

304
00:18:40.491 --> 00:18:44.840
And it was um,
I mean,
did you see it?
I watched part of it.

305
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.350
<v 1>Um,
those movies kind of bummed me out.
Yeah.</v>

306
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.430
Marcus Luttrell is a guy I've met at the UFC a few times.
Okay.
Who's the,

307
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.970
the story?
The story's based on,
he's actually in the movie.
Had a part.
He did.

308
00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.440
Yeah.
But he,
um,
you know his real story.
You've met him.
Yeah.

309
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.150
I have a real hard time.

310
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.200
I'm watching dramatizations with Marky mark and someone else play in these guys.

311
00:19:07.341 --> 00:19:10.580
I know it was awesome and I'm not putting him down.
I love Mark Wahlberg.

312
00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:13.760
I'm a huge fan.
I thought he was great in that movie with the Rock.

313
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:17.210
He's fucking great kids.
A great actor.
It's not that.
It's just,

314
00:19:17.211 --> 00:19:21.230
I know he's Marky mark teglar though.
He wouldn't.
Yeah,
whoever he is,

315
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.650
he's Mark Wahlberg.
I know he's Mark Walberg and I know who the guy is.

316
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.080
I know that guy.
Marcus Luttrell is a real person.

317
00:19:27.081 --> 00:19:30.800
So when I'm watching a recreation it's,
it's weird,

318
00:19:30.801 --> 00:19:32.600
but I can't separate myself from the art.

319
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.440
I enjoy them much more in works of fiction that I do and break recreation's.

320
00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:39.980
I never enjoy recreation's cause I'm always like that and fucking happen like

321
00:19:39.981 --> 00:19:43.580
that.
That's probably bullshit.
He's pumped about titanic is what you're saying.

322
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.610
Well titanic is different because it had Leonardo and Kate and the chemistry

323
00:19:49.011 --> 00:19:50.520
there just went great

324
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:57.130
dining ramp and the young man with passion poetry and it's hard to know.

325
00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.250
It's just,
I think,
I don't like recreation's.
You know,
I just,

326
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.710
I know it's too much fuckery involved in the creation of those things,

327
00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.860
but kind of like a frozen guy.
I love frozen.
I saw it twice.

328
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.000
You come over my house at any point in time when you here,

329
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.493
<v 6>they'll start saying it.</v>

330
00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.650
<v 1>Robert had they jump up on the couch and start singing.
That's amazing.</v>

331
00:20:23.651 --> 00:20:26.440
Little girls love princesses,
man.
There's nothing you can do about that.

332
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:30.280
There's this rapper that has the second best song,
but he's like,
man,

333
00:20:30.281 --> 00:20:33.190
I could have had the number one song if it wasn't because of the frozen

334
00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:35.070
soundtrack.
Can you imagine that?

335
00:20:35.071 --> 00:20:38.800
He just loses a good fucking movie man for little kids.

336
00:20:38.801 --> 00:20:42.490
It's not a good movie for adults,
but as an adult you can enjoy it.

337
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.920
Like I find that there's a lot of these movies that they,

338
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.790
they're made for little kids.
Yeah.

339
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:51.100
But do a really good job and you can actually sit and enjoy the movie with your

340
00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:54.580
kids.
Like I saw the bodies movie,
the Lego movies

341
00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.070
by yourself.
Did you?
Not Easy.
They're,
yeah.
But yeah,
it did.
It was a good move.

342
00:21:00.071 --> 00:21:00.910
And it brought me up.

343
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.830
I felt like I was walking out with a whole bunch of friends.

344
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.760
I saw Mr Peabody the in the wayback machine this weekend.

345
00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:11.830
Whenever the fuck it's called,
it's a really good,
first of all,

346
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:16.150
the animation is fucking amazing.
The dog,
the dog made a tablet.

347
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.700
It's fucking bad ass.
It's fine.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
It's fun.
You know,

348
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.610
and it's,
it's also like the,

349
00:21:24.611 --> 00:21:27.850
just what they can do with animation now when they are operating the time

350
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:30.850
machine,
you're like,
God damn,
they make shit look beautiful.

351
00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.780
You don't make Scooby doo look like dog shit.
You know,

352
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:39.340
you stop and look at the kind of like,
this is Mr Peabody.
Really?
This was good.

353
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.230
Yeah,
no,
you got to see the,
uh,

354
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.980
the time machine series when he actually uses the time machine.

355
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:47.820
You've got to find,
look for it and find a video that when,

356
00:21:47.821 --> 00:21:50.320
when they operate the time machine,
you see the graphics involved.

357
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:55.060
It's like a whole,
my God,
these kids today,
they're so spoiled.
Yeah,
it's true.

358
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.240
It's true.
I up,
I was a big fan of pop was great,
came out,

359
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.170
but that's depressing as fuck.
That guy's essentially suicidal.
No Dash.

360
00:22:03.171 --> 00:22:04.004
It's good to have

361
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.740
<v 2>darkness for kids.
You have to get a little introduction in reality.
I am.
I am,</v>

362
00:22:08.741 --> 00:22:11.830
because I'll be honest with you,
I'm not,
I'm not going to get into details,

363
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:16.660
but like I had a real solid shattering of my idealism in my adulthood that was

364
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:21.430
like really intense.
And it's,
it's interesting when you sort of,

365
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.260
I mean,
just could have prepared you for that.
Well,
yeah.
Fuck yeah.
No,
I'm not.

366
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.180
I'm kind of fucking around,
but I'm not fucking around,
but,
but,

367
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:31.990
but I'm serious as far as like,
you know,
the princess reality for little kids,

368
00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:36.350
you know,
if you,
if you sort of had this like fairy tale,
right?
It's just a,

369
00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.830
and not in an aggressive way.
Um,

370
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.780
so my ex boyfriend wrote this book that is actually,
it's a children's book.

371
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.410
It's called Kate's first mate.
Um,
and it's about relationships,

372
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:50.230
but it's written as a children's book and it's actually really amazing.

373
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.770
And he sells it,
um,

374
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.510
like hotcakes and all these like kind of little hipster stores in California.

375
00:22:55.511 --> 00:23:00.220
And,
um,
it's published.
And it's a really interesting look at,
um,

376
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.490
you know,
choose choosing a partner for,
you know,

377
00:23:03.491 --> 00:23:04.600
when you're a kid and just sort of,

378
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.890
rather than like prince charming comes in on a white horse,
you know,

379
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:13.810
it's just sort of has this really great way to kind of just give a small

380
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:16.420
introduction to kids about,
you know,
reality.

381
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:19.000
And sometimes it doesn't work out and you go through the storm and then you come

382
00:23:19.001 --> 00:23:23.040
out,
you know,
captaining the ship with euro,
with your partner.
You

383
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.690
<v 1>know what's interesting man?
Man,
you know,
man.
Yeah,
Bro.
People,
friends,</v>

384
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.310
Babe.
What's interesting friends is how,
um,

385
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:36.000
how much they're trying to take when they take old stories and they pull all the

386
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:39.570
teeth out of them.
Like it's,
it's really kind of fascinating,

387
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.400
like the big bad wolf or any of these stories like there,

388
00:23:44.401 --> 00:23:47.400
there's this,
uh,
this trend.
What is this ad?

389
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.580
There's a lot of people that think that Disney's frozen.

390
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:54.410
It's teaching kids to be in like gay,
like Disney's gay propaganda.
Um,

391
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:59.150
excellent.
And Idiots.
Why was it,
what's gay about frozen?
They,

392
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.330
they said that the,
the main character,
uh,
with the other girl,

393
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:05.450
I never saw it so I don't know.
But the main character?
Yeah,

394
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.440
sister that they're gay.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Just don't even click on that.

395
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.530
And about beastiality too because of the,
the animals were her friends.
Oh,

396
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.560
teaching kids about these.
What about your pet on the podcast?

397
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:21.710
I'd like to see that one.
Not even know where the podcast is.

398
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.360
Fuck all these fucking dummies.
God dammit.

399
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.400
I don't remember what we're talking about.
How they took the old
days.

400
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.690
Take all these stories like the big bad wolf and they little or little red

401
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:39.110
riding hood and they kinda like dress it down.

402
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:41.780
They take away all the violence and scariness out of it.

403
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.860
And you get a version of like for kitchens like Rapunzel.

404
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:49.740
Here's a perfect example.
Think it was scary.
Like real ones were really starting,

405
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.400
which she,
she took her puzzle,

406
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.510
cut her hair off and pretended that the guy was climbing your hair.

407
00:24:56.511 --> 00:24:59.780
And then pushed him off and he got blinded.
That's the original story.

408
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:03.470
Fell into a briar Bush and his eyes got fucking gouged out.

409
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.040
That's the original story.
If you read the original one,
you're like,
Whoa,

410
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:11.840
brothers Grimm.
Yeah.
All that stuff is sticking out a dead chicken bone.

411
00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:16.010
They think it's their finger.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well,
and the wolf,

412
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.100
eight Little Red Riding Hood and the grandmother,
I mean,

413
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:21.650
she died in the original one.
The,
in the original,

414
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.190
she was eaten by the wolf and then somehow or another,

415
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:27.630
the hunter cut her out of the wolf or something like that.
No.

416
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.190
What I do remember that.
Yeah,
the grandma and her,
they're both,
okay.

417
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.100
I caught him out and bring it back to real town.
You know,

418
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.600
this is what's really happening.
Well,
it's just weird how,
you know,

419
00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:42.320
they try to like slowly but surely over time take the teeth out of a lot of

420
00:25:42.321 --> 00:25:46.070
those things.
It's like if you go back and watch cartoons from,

421
00:25:46.071 --> 00:25:49.370
like when I was a kid,
they were all about violence.
Yeah.

422
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.420
Cartoons were all about anvils falling on people's heads and explosions,

423
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.610
spinning a duck's beak around a circle.

424
00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:56.141
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

425
00:25:56.141 --> 00:26:00.940
But then you have some really terrible things that there's never one thing,

426
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.480
one reason to blame for when there's like a school shooting or something like

427
00:26:04.481 --> 00:26:08.860
that.
But then that is the basis of changing the whole,
you know,
viewing,

428
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.150
um,
demographic and you know,
watering it down so it's not as violent.
Like,

429
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.050
you know,
I don't,
I don't really have an opinion on it,
but,

430
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.280
but that's where it comes from.

431
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.900
<v 1>I don't know if there's a direct correlation between viewing violence and</v>

432
00:26:21.901 --> 00:26:24.300
enacting violence.
I'm really not sure if there is,

433
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.400
nor my sure if it's ever been proven.

434
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.650
Because you see more violence now than ever.

435
00:26:28.651 --> 00:26:32.450
And I would say that's probably the least violent time we've ever existed in a

436
00:26:32.451 --> 00:26:33.284
on earth.

437
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:37.720
But I know that kids have done shit they saw in commercials or cartoons.
Rather.

438
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:38.491
My cousin,

439
00:26:38.491 --> 00:26:40.860
Mikey hit his brother over the head with a frying pan because they thought it

440
00:26:40.861 --> 00:26:42.250
was going to turn into another shape

441
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:48.840
and cracked him over the head.
Turn to the shape of a frying pan.

442
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:54.370
You fucking walked up to his little brother Room Bong and hear screaming and the

443
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.610
dad beat the shit out of him.
It was craziness.
It's dark.
It was dark.

444
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:01.410
How do you come out to the,
okay,
that's fucked up.

445
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:02.610
That kids always been fucked up.

446
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.130
I avoided him ever since I was like seven when I read,

447
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:07.320
when I get out of the Catholic school,
I've waited.
My cousin to

448
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.630
I kept,
might not even be my cousin Mikey.
Mikey made it,

449
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:15.990
actually been his neighbor and now that I think about it,
either way,

450
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.350
not good to hit kids in the head with a frying pan and he learned it from a

451
00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:24.330
television show.
Some cartoon you,
your head is like,
you gotta do that.

452
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.950
Shakes it back.
Nobody ever dies.

453
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:31.590
But everybody gets blown to fucking smithereens.

454
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:35.010
I mean all the shit that happened to wile e coyote and you know,
the end,

455
00:27:35.011 --> 00:27:39.750
he would pop his head up and fucking dust would fall off of them and he's fine

456
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.160
that fucker,
but it was all violence.
There's none of that today.

457
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:48.180
You will never see a kid's show today that has violence in it.

458
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.080
They just don't have it.
Everything's cutesy.

459
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.750
Panda was pretty hardcore raising pussies.
No one shot the panda.

460
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.460
Spanish had been hit with a fucking missile cannon balls in their

461
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.330
cannon balls a little bit,
but no one got hurt,
right?
No,
no.

462
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.980
There was no serious dog.
Humans where feelings.

463
00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:12.870
So feelings are more valuable sometimes,

464
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.680
but at the same time you have this whole world of really fucked up abstract

465
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:19.350
cartoons and shit,
right?
That is available to kids.

466
00:28:19.351 --> 00:28:22.320
It's not presented to them really.
But if you Google some weird stuff,

467
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.330
you can find anything you want.

468
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:27.070
You can be a five year old now and probably a year,

469
00:28:27.071 --> 00:28:30.390
a five year old that's Google and your parents are doing a Shitty fucking job

470
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:31.160
listening to you.

471
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.370
Don't you don't leave five-year-old's in front of a fucking computer.
However,

472
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.740
kids,
I can't,
I have no,
no,
it's a lot than back in the day.

473
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.950
You were saying something.
That was it.

474
00:28:40.951 --> 00:28:44.760
I just feel this is me assuming or guessing that you can get into some weird

475
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:48.150
stuff too.
You could if you had no oversight,

476
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.700
but you should have oversight when you're five.
You know,

477
00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:52.590
it's like we were talking about when I was,
uh,

478
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.610
when I did a magic show in fisherman's wharf when I was eight.
Why did I do that?

479
00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:59.550
Because nobody was watching me.
It's ridiculous.
Like,
you know,

480
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:03.360
anybody tells you I was raised correctly.
Uh,
you know,
a point to that and go,

481
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.100
do you think it's an eight year old?

482
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.920
Should be able to just walk down the street and not tell anybody where he's

483
00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:11.010
going?
That's ridiculous.
Like that's not a good move.

484
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.590
That's pretty profound though,
that you were like,
did you take the train walk?

485
00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.550
Yeah.
Well I lived in San Francisco.
Yeah,
no,
it was during the day.

486
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.060
I live pretty close to fisherman's wharf.
I noticed that people were doing these,

487
00:29:24.061 --> 00:29:26.310
um,
one person shows on fisherman's wharf.

488
00:29:26.311 --> 00:29:28.380
They had like a little box out and people throw money in it.

489
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:29.670
So I did a magic show

490
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.170
and it's almost good that no one stopped you.
Right.

491
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.850
You didn't have oversight and you figure your shit out.

492
00:29:35.851 --> 00:29:39.240
Maybe something horrible could have before.
Man Almost got raped by some dude,

493
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.980
but she did a got lucky,
the library and library and saw the guy and yelled,

494
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:49.450
I was ready to go out this guy's car.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh my God.

495
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.600
That was the same age I was.
Um,
I was really in a monsters,

496
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:53.990
like monster books and stuff like that.

497
00:29:53.991 --> 00:29:57.220
And so I was at the library and the monster section pulling out these books and

498
00:29:57.221 --> 00:30:01.900
this guy came up to me and told me that he had monster books in his car.
And,
uh,

499
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:05.050
I didn't know any better.
I was only eight years old,
so I was like,
okay,

500
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.900
you got monster books.
I thought it was just a guy with monster bucks.

501
00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.290
Go sit in your lap for some monster books.
And as I was walking towards the car,

502
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.910
well as I was walking towards the car,
the library and starts screaming,
you know,

503
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:18.520
you get away from him.
That guy just got out of prison.

504
00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.780
That guy just got out of prison by Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

505
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.970
Apparently he was like a known pedo and they would have to watch him when he

506
00:30:24.971 --> 00:30:29.020
would go to the library cause you'd go scouting around for kids.
Yeah,

507
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.540
<v 2>I had some weird stuff when I was a kid,
you know,</v>

508
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:37.310
there was this a older boy who was in the neighborhood and um,

509
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.880
I was a little tomboy.
I'd always be like playing in the backyard,
you know,
like,

510
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:45.680
you know,
I dunno,
like chopping trees,
whatever.
We grew up on an acre.

511
00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:46.933
Um,

512
00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:52.060
and I had this really interesting moment where I was in the backyard and I was

513
00:30:52.071 --> 00:30:56.000
obsessed with fishing.
I love to fish.
I still do.
And um,

514
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.920
and I was talking about it,
you know,
it was really weird,

515
00:30:57.921 --> 00:31:02.921
didn't have a lot of friends and this older boy was like maybe 14 and I was nine

516
00:31:04.401 --> 00:31:07.610
or 10 comes out of the wood line.
It's like,
hey Suzanne,

517
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.030
there's a large mouth bass and the creek.
You've got to come see it right now.

518
00:31:11.031 --> 00:31:14.660
You gotta come see it.
And I remember it like me,
okay,
let me get my shoes.

519
00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.370
Like I'm going to,
okay,
I got to go to the house.

520
00:31:16.371 --> 00:31:20.450
And like I think my parents are out and my sisters and I would always like we

521
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.900
were when we were kids,
everybody be running around like playing baseball.

522
00:31:23.901 --> 00:31:28.190
Like there was like a pack of kids and my sisters were home but I didn't know

523
00:31:28.191 --> 00:31:28.551
where they were.

524
00:31:28.551 --> 00:31:32.120
And I ran upstairs to get my shoes and then all of a sudden I had this moment of

525
00:31:32.121 --> 00:31:35.480
uh,
I was totally terrified.

526
00:31:35.481 --> 00:31:39.640
I was just all of a sudden I felt like really weird.
And I,

527
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.540
I went upstairs in my bedroom,

528
00:31:41.541 --> 00:31:44.540
which overlooked the backyard and I watched him and I didn't leave.

529
00:31:44.541 --> 00:31:46.850
I got really scared and um,

530
00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.660
and I watched him and I watched him kind of wait around for while and leave.

531
00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.220
And like later this kid was like,

532
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.480
like years later it was like blowing up squirrels in his tree house and like it

533
00:31:58.481 --> 00:32:02.030
got like he was hurting like the neighborhood animals and like got into some

534
00:32:02.031 --> 00:32:05.720
serious trouble and he was a violent kid and now as an adult,
like there's,

535
00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.360
there's no way,
there was a large amount of bass in the creek.

536
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.450
It was like this tiny little creek.
And I really do,
when I think about it,

537
00:32:11.451 --> 00:32:15.770
I feel like I avoided a really weird situation.
I don't fucking know.

538
00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.590
<v 1>Oh fucker knows.
I mean you might've been the first one that he killed.</v>

539
00:32:18.591 --> 00:32:21.680
It might've been,
the circumstances were right.
You never know.

540
00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.990
<v 2>But I,
I really like it was like,
it's,
it's so funny.</v>

541
00:32:23.991 --> 00:32:27.200
Like I don't remember everything but I will never forget that feeling of like,

542
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.080
like I was just terrified.
I didn't want to go back.

543
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.360
<v 1>And you never know,
like certain circumstances,</v>

544
00:32:32.361 --> 00:32:35.420
like people are like really close to doing something fucked up and never do it

545
00:32:35.421 --> 00:32:37.520
until a circumstance arises.

546
00:32:37.521 --> 00:32:40.010
That might've been the circumstance that pushed the guy

547
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.710
<v 0>over the edge.</v>

548
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.831
<v 5>Well,</v>

549
00:32:40.831 --> 00:32:44.310
the person that blows up animals in their tree house has some serious issues.

550
00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.880
He asked me,
well,
anybody who does torture

551
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:49.900
<v 0>animals,
that's like one of the first things they look for.
Yeah.
You know when,</v>

552
00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:53.890
when you find out that your son has been nail a squirrel to a board and sticking

553
00:32:53.891 --> 00:32:57.790
sticks up its ass and stuff like that,
like that kid's a monster.

554
00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:00.980
Like you got to,
you got a bunch of bad connections.
Yeah.

555
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.650
And you should take the little fucker fishing.

556
00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.460
Take him out in the middle of the ocean.
Yeah.

557
00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:13.860
<v 5>Sorry it didn't work out.
Sorry Buddy.
Sorry Pal.</v>

558
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:17.970
I raised a monster.
Take it out.
Take it out to the ocean.

559
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:22.590
Fishing though.
Efficiencies,
great physicians,
Great Psychos,
band,

560
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.840
Pontoon boat and in Tennessee and that was really fun.
Ted Is,

561
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.650
he's got great bass.
Russians didn't catch a fish,

562
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.650
but man drank a whole bunch of beer.
Got a Sun Tan,

563
00:33:31.651 --> 00:33:35.010
if you can believe that because I'm white is goat cheese.
It's very rare.

564
00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:39.050
So are you guys gonna move back?
What are you gonna do?
Man?

565
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.330
We've got to make some money.
We got to places.
Record.

566
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.420
My basement is an isolation tank in it for in there.
Hey,

567
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:51.450
did we talk about that thing you didn't tell putting us in that time?
Yeah,

568
00:33:51.451 --> 00:33:55.860
we met crash.
How was the experience?
So we didn't talk about it.
How was it?

569
00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.810
It was,
it was awesome.
I uh,
I kind of freaked out at one point.
Did Ya?

570
00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:05.010
Yeah,
because I started to get really,
um,
I was like,
oh my God,

571
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:10.170
what if a would have crashed,
forgot to close the air open air thing.
And I,

572
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:12.810
I started to like,
then I was like,
okay,
breathe.
I can't breathe.

573
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:15.330
And I was like trying to find the door and then I got the water in my eye and I

574
00:34:15.331 --> 00:34:19.870
was like,
you panics.
Is that,
oh yeah,

575
00:34:19.871 --> 00:34:22.770
I lost it.
You panic toad dairy.
It was a real cute,

576
00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:26.490
precious moment I had naked in that tank.

577
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.720
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
The next time relax or you'll be fine.
It's hard.

578
00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:34.920
That's a new experience.

579
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:39.310
<v 0>Yeah.
That is not,
uh,
something I'm accustomed to.
That's the thing about it.</v>

580
00:34:39.311 --> 00:34:41.980
It's like,
it's not one of those things you get used to the first time.

581
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.500
And you get better at it.
The like,

582
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:47.050
my body's so used to it that I get in there and my body goes,
Whoa,

583
00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:49.570
we're in the tank.
And then I just let go.
Like immediately,

584
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:53.620
like the first when I first started doing,
I'd be like,
I had all this busy work.

585
00:34:53.621 --> 00:34:56.500
Like I'd want to itch something,
something.
Yeah.

586
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.720
But now you can just settle in.

587
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.390
But you can come up with some great ideas in there too.

588
00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.960
It's like you never get a chance to be alone with yourself like you do in that

589
00:35:04.961 --> 00:35:05.650
tank.

590
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:09.560
Have you really want to be a moody depressing fuck and write some shit that's

591
00:35:09.561 --> 00:35:10.510
gonna make people cry?

592
00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.710
<v 5>No thank God.
The spa spot</v>

593
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.560
<v 0>in a box of block figure things out.</v>

594
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.460
I just think there's no better place for me to figure things out.

595
00:35:20.461 --> 00:35:22.680
Like anytimes I have real problems in my life.

596
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.050
Anytime there's any disputes or any time I'm doing something I don't want to be

597
00:35:28.051 --> 00:35:28.680
doing,

598
00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.010
I get in that tank and it sort of provides me with the resources to come up with

599
00:35:32.011 --> 00:35:34.890
the right answers other cause.
Other than that tank.
You don't,

600
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.370
you don't get alone time like that.
You never alone time from your body

601
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.520
<v 1>and that's where you made it to no,
I don't ever meditate outside the tank.
Yeah.</v>

602
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.850
Except I guess a little bit doing yoga.
I guess a little bit of that.

603
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:48.030
It's meditation,
but it's Yoga,
you know,
it's the whole thing.

604
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.850
The tank is just the mind,
you know.
But I don't,

605
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.910
I don't fuck around with regular meditation.
To me it's like,

606
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.380
it's like running when you have a car.
I'm like,
I want to get to Vegas.
Um,

607
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:01.790
probably going to drive,
you know,
it took a lot longer to walk,
like,

608
00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:06.270
just sitting like
this is what oming is.

609
00:36:06.271 --> 00:36:10.370
It's walking to Vegas.
Oh,
I don't know.
I'm into it.

610
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.710
I'm not going to lie.
We try mentality in the clients.
You don't have a tent.

611
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.730
If you get a tank basement and,
and the tank,
it's a tote.
Some next level.
Well,

612
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:25.580
shit,
Elman is Hank.
I opened,
it.

613
00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.370
Sank.
Do I do,
uh,
these breathing exercises in a tank where I've,

614
00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.740
I breathe in for one minute and then I breathe out for one minute.
Yeah.

615
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.500
One slow minute breathing in and one slow minute breathing out.
Yeah.
Yeah.

616
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:41.650
It's really hard that you,
in fact,
actually where Jason Bourne,

617
00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.600
you know the first Jason Bourne movies I enjoyed,

618
00:36:46.601 --> 00:36:50.320
but the new one with that fucking Guy Jeremy Renner.

619
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.720
It's too much fake karate going on.
So much shit that the body can't do.

620
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.693
I'm not buying it.

621
00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.070
You let us live in our fantasize guys living in the fucking frozen north and his

622
00:37:00.071 --> 00:37:03.390
underwear,
they'd come and get him.
They activate them.
Things wrong with that.

623
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.800
Guys going to get hypothermia.

624
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:08.980
He's a fucking human jumping off of buildings and ending on people's heads.

625
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.900
No Angle.
Real nothing.
I'm not buying it.
And here's the big one.

626
00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.440
Doesn't have sex with anybody.
I know.
That is a bummer.
It's ridiculous.

627
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.910
Don't do that.
Spies of bone and everywhere.
Well,
it's what we're doing here.

628
00:37:21.911 --> 00:37:25.720
We're the pussification of the American male is almost complete.

629
00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:30.550
Our superheroes in even get pussy James Bond fucked everyone.
Okay?

630
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.340
He was from England.
God dammit,
and he fucked everyone.

631
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:38.620
He'd fucked everyone he drank.
We even know how he takes his fucking Martinis.

632
00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:43.000
Shaken.
Never stirred.
We know how he likes his drugs.
That's,

633
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.270
that's fucking the murderers drug distribution.

634
00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.750
He got mad pussy fucked and he had so much pussy.

635
00:37:49.751 --> 00:37:54.280
He had a movie called Octopussy.
I mean,
Jesus fucking Christ.

636
00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.290
He's a winner.
Meanwhile,

637
00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.340
Jeremy Renner saves the girl who's hotter than the surface,
the fucking sun.

638
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.100
He's hanging out with her all movie long.

639
00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:07.660
Obviously she's enthralled with him and the end of the movie is so symbolic of

640
00:38:07.661 --> 00:38:07.990
the,

641
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:12.670
the neutering of the American male that even the super bad ass murdering

642
00:38:12.671 --> 00:38:17.671
superstars sit like there on the boat together and they're sitting across from

643
00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:20.860
each other.
Why do you think that on the table?

644
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.500
Did you see maybe I want to know how they got out of that.
There was,

645
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:30.820
there was a very intense intimate friends have been barely once the credits

646
00:38:32.561 --> 00:38:35.050
roll.
We're going to no,
no,
no.
I didn't see that.

647
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.430
Why couldn't you bone before the credits rolled at all?

648
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.170
I didn't see what you're saying.

649
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.860
I didn't see any bone and going on ever in their future.
No.
It was unspoken,

650
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.250
I think.
Is Dick's broken?
I think in order to be able to flip like that

651
00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:54.340
in real life.
I'm sure it works great,
but that Jeremy Renner in the movie though,

652
00:38:54.341 --> 00:38:58.420
the Jason Warren Guy,
Jason Bourne,
he was the new guy.
He was,

653
00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.340
I don't know what I'm talking to another guy,

654
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.210
whatever his fucking name was born,
born with a broken dick.

655
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:07.910
The guy's kicking everybody's ass and it's,

656
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:11.170
this girl clearly wants to throw down.
She's like staring at him.
I'm like,

657
00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:12.010
Oh my God,
you're the best.

658
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:15.020
You saved my life over and over again and you're single.
And I'm saying,
oh,

659
00:39:15.021 --> 00:39:17.860
like what do we fucking around for it and this and he's just standing there

660
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.330
staring at her.
I'm your robot.
I will kill for you,
but I cannot fuck.

661
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.770
He didn't have any romantic attachment to it.
There's no kissing.

662
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.780
There was no hugging a personality thing.

663
00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.630
The next Jason Bourne Guy,
whatever his name is,
because it's not his fault.
No,

664
00:39:34.631 --> 00:39:38.800
he's simple.
He's symptomatic of a problem we have in society.

665
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.850
The,
the sexuality of the American male is a dangerous thing.

666
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.880
The neutering of the American male is a lot of people's goals.

667
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.151
Ultimately,

668
00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:54.151
as we move away from our primate warring lifestyle into this transcendental

669
00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:00.670
experience where we pass through the the next dimension and we exist in the

670
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:04.210
world of information purely without any of the needs of the flesh,

671
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.420
that's what we're moving away from.
That's why people don't want to be Harry.

672
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:11.440
That's why everybody wants to shave your Bush,
shave everything down back though.

673
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.240
It's like skinnier jeans.
It's not going to last.

674
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.550
When push comes to shove,
I think it's all the same thing.

675
00:40:21.551 --> 00:40:22.720
I think we're moving away from,

676
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.780
from animal instincts and so even in our superheroes,

677
00:40:25.781 --> 00:40:26.980
we want no animal instincts.

678
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.720
He's just a killing martial arts robot who doesn't want to fuck at the end of
it,

679
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:36.160
he sits down there and there's no threat whatsoever that he only saved all those

680
00:40:36.161 --> 00:40:39.220
people because he wants a fucker because the people that wrote the movie wanted

681
00:40:39.221 --> 00:40:43.240
to widen their audience instead.
Well that's one way of looking at it.

682
00:40:43.241 --> 00:40:46.150
But why would that,
why would that be appealing?

683
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.050
More people watch porn than almost anything on the Internet.

684
00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:53.020
It's some insane amount of bandwidth allocated.

685
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.380
While I try that something Brian's Dad,

686
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:04.180
sorry Gary.
Go all together.
One,
two,
three.

687
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.700
Sorry.

688
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.040
You're taking it out of context like you always do Brian.

689
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.630
I'm tired of your bullshit.

690
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.510
Just because you're on the internet doesn't mean you have to get back at me for

691
00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:21.400
everything that ever happened.
Yeah,
I dunno.
I Dunno what it is,

692
00:41:21.401 --> 00:41:26.260
but I think there is a move without a tout to moving away from animal instincts.

693
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:30.180
So I think that was a female empowerment thing going on and that's an animal and

694
00:41:30.181 --> 00:41:33.410
it's take right.
What female empowerment do you think?
Well,
I'm actually,
I'm,

695
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.520
you know,
I'm just going to go with it,

696
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:39.170
but I was stumbled across some pornography for the first time.

697
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.863
Well,

698
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:45.080
I was brushing my teeth and I stepped over a sock and went flying forward and my

699
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:48.500
head hit a nursing civic thing on the laptop.

700
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.080
I'm just going to barrel through this because I thought it was interesting.

701
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:58.550
It was purely sociological.
Um,
they,
there's like this,

702
00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.950
they have all these different texture and you Pete,
Betty be tough.

703
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:03.263
We don't have to

704
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.750
give me what I need as he comes in.
He goes,

705
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.530
I realize the path that I'm going down.
I feel like I said we'll around and go,

706
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.910
oh no,
no,
no.
Well,
this was the first,

707
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.900
it was like a casting couch scenario.
Right.
But they usually have,

708
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.510
the catechesis isn't just important.
It's,
it's just in general.

709
00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.400
Those are Green Simmons favorites.

710
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:36.320
You bring in a chick and you kind of did basin and make her a,

711
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.000
do whatever you want her to do.

712
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:42.950
But this flipped it around completely and had this chick completely dominating a

713
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:46.130
whole group of guys.
There's a whole series of them.
I never seen that before.

714
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.550
That's rare as fuck.
Dude.
You're talking about traveling around though.

715
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:53.020
It's coming around.
San had this on her phone.
Bookmarks,

716
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.700
bookmark,
double bookmarks.
Put the cloud saved to cloud.
Yes.

717
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.200
Email to be.
And
um,

718
00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.680
I,
you know,
I don't know.
I mean for women?
Yeah,
most certainly.

719
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.340
But it's also like think about the fantasies that exists for men.

720
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.500
Really unrealistic fantasies of,
you know,

721
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.160
you order a pizza and the pizza grill comes over and she's wearing a bikini and

722
00:43:16.161 --> 00:43:18.440
next thing you know she's blowing you and your friend,
you know,

723
00:43:18.441 --> 00:43:21.320
and you're both banging her.
Is that realistic?
Is that coming around?
No,

724
00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:24.590
and it doesn't represent real life represents what people want to take a shower.

725
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.740
But I mean if you wanted like porn for women,

726
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.380
porn for women I don't think would even be that.

727
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:34.520
I think porn for women would probably be far more romantic.
You know,
I spent,

728
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:38.780
I think also I think there's a difference between the visual aspect,

729
00:43:38.781 --> 00:43:41.270
like what men find appealing,
what women find appealing.

730
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:46.500
It's like women are into like books like 50 shades of grey type pornography,

731
00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:52.280
but some women are into less visual representations of sexuality.

732
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.980
They don't watch it as much,
you know?

733
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:58.450
I mean women don't watch it as much as men do to store.

734
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.740
How much stigma is involved with that?
You know,
this,

735
00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:05.930
this website is to rows and weird.
So women stay away from it.
Not necessarily.

736
00:44:05.931 --> 00:44:08.130
They don't want to know about that because mom,

737
00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:09.770
you watch what they want when they were alone,

738
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.850
you were alone actually like real.
Do you know what I mean?

739
00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:17.960
Like if it's not like if someone's actually,
if a woman's actually coming,

740
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:22.520
that's the best one.
If you ask me as far as like staged porn,
right.

741
00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.960
Cause if it's just for the,
for the dude,
there's a lot,

742
00:44:26.961 --> 00:44:29.360
a lot of that too,
right?
It's plays up for the dues

743
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.980
myself up here for

744
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.380
<v 5>that last thing.
You're fucking,
you're a pointer and you got one call out.</v>

745
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.580
Exactly how it is.
Really did eat her out.

746
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.410
She likes him.
Our farm.

747
00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:50.920
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
I see.
I think a lot of women are into porn.
Don't get me wrong,</v>

748
00:44:50.921 --> 00:44:54.880
I'm not delusional.
But I think that there's a lot of,

749
00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:58.990
a lot more women or into a literature,
um,

750
00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.600
pornography than men are in a literature.
Pornography.

751
00:45:01.601 --> 00:45:04.450
Like almost no men are into literature,
pornography.

752
00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:05.880
<v 2>Very rarely.</v>

753
00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:10.480
I'm reading this book called one Kuwaiti for Murakami Book and it's,

754
00:45:10.481 --> 00:45:14.980
it's really interesting.
Once you 84,
what is it about?
It's um,

755
00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:20.440
God,
it's,
it's hard to explain it's fiction.

756
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:25.900
Um,
and it's,
it's kind of a spin there.
There's a lot of 1984,
um,

757
00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:30.670
kind of like the,
the author is,
you know,
Trulia,

758
00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:35.170
Orwell fan and there's just kind of a lot of nuances as far as like,
um,

759
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:39.340
this kind of,
I don't want to say apocalyptic,
but,
um,

760
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:45.790
God,
it's about a lot of confusing things,
but technically it's a romance,

761
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:50.860
but there's all this sort of,
there's like a kind of like two worlds colliding.

762
00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.753
They're sort of like,

763
00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:55.360
like there's two moons in the sky and there's kind of this really interesting

764
00:45:55.361 --> 00:45:57.510
concept.
But,
um,
I,

765
00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:02.610
there's a lot of graphic sexual content and Ben and I were sitting on a plane.

766
00:46:02.981 --> 00:46:03.700
Yeah.

767
00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.150
<v 5>He was like,
Jesus.
Every time I look over there's,
you know,
there's one thing,</v>

768
00:46:07.151 --> 00:46:09.880
you know,
the boner going on.
There's like a taught nipple.
Like,

769
00:46:09.881 --> 00:46:14.050
I just catch and that's just read this an 800 page book and every single time I

770
00:46:14.051 --> 00:46:16.830
can glance over it.
It's really funny because I'm not sure.

771
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:21.270
<v 2>It's really a great,
it's a really great story.
Um,
and I'll be honest with you,</v>

772
00:46:21.271 --> 00:46:25.740
I'm not,
I'm not one that's like,
yeah,
I need it fucking dirty novel to,
you know,

773
00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:29.600
whatever.
Um,
butter my scone.
But I,
I definitely,

774
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.650
<v 5>but I definitely like,
we've been traveling a lot,</v>

775
00:46:36.651 --> 00:46:40.110
we've had a few flights shows recently and when I'm reading look at it,
you know,

776
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:43.160
come on.
That's what I'm saying.

777
00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.220
So when I'm reading it in public and I'm sitting on an airplane,

778
00:46:46.221 --> 00:46:50.720
I feel like I pulled a book closer to myself cause I'm just like,
oh my God,

779
00:46:50.721 --> 00:46:53.240
you know what if it's just,
you know,
it's such a,

780
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:55.100
well it's interesting that books can,
you have,
have

781
00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.460
<v 1>sexuality like raw sexuality mixed in with the story,</v>

782
00:46:58.461 --> 00:46:59.840
but they can't have that in a movie.

783
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.980
Like a movie could never have people graphically fucking movie you just saw,

784
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:06.590
I just saw a movie people graphically fucking,

785
00:47:06.591 --> 00:47:11.360
it was called blue is the warmest color.
It was a French French?
Yes.
Oh,
William.

786
00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.960
Um,
remember Brown bunny.
Do you remember that?
Yeah.

787
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:18.740
That guys like black because that movie is he really?
Yeah.

788
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.370
What is his fucking name?
Vincent Gallo.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He mean,

789
00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.280
I literally saw um,
these,

790
00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:29.450
these people reviewing that movie or you know,
talk informally.

791
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.750
They were talking about it and they were like,
he's a piece of shit.

792
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:33.130
He'll never work again.
Wow.

793
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:37.840
And all because he made that Chloe's vendors girl,
she,

794
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:41.350
she just sucked his dick on screen and he came all over on screen.

795
00:47:41.351 --> 00:47:45.820
Like you actually see him orgasm in the movie,
but the movie is before that,

796
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.500
a real movie.
It's like,

797
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:51.490
this is just a sex scene in a movie where you actually get to see the sex and

798
00:47:51.491 --> 00:47:55.180
they decided to just go for it.
So they decided to make a movie and have,

799
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:59.650
why is it okay to have a sex scene where you don't see sex,

800
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.900
but when you have a sexy,
we see sex.

801
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:05.590
Like they were angry at him because he made them watch that.
Like that was,

802
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:09.490
I was listening to this man and he's two women talk about it and they're,

803
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:14.580
their specific point was that they were angry that he made them watch that he

804
00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:18.940
made them more sense if they,
if they were watching the movie,

805
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.410
everybody had to know that that was [inaudible] everybody this,

806
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.160
I think they were one of the first people to see it.

807
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.630
And I think everybody that went in to see that movie knew there was a

808
00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:30.520
controversial thing like that had gotten out.

809
00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.960
But I don't think they realize you're gonna Watch Vincent Gallo literally put

810
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:36.850
his Dick in a girl's mouth.
And it was a long,

811
00:48:36.851 --> 00:48:40.390
I mean I seen it wasn't like for a brief like American Werewolf in London.

812
00:48:40.391 --> 00:48:43.390
Do you see the wolf and then it cuts to black.
Now this is like,

813
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.750
it wasn't just the size deck and you saw her mouth and then cut.

814
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:50.340
That might've been another blanket.
Do you think that,
I mean,

815
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:52.630
I didn't see the movie,
so I don't really have,
I didn't either,

816
00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:56.220
but I watched the one second.
Do you think that that was like,
Hey,

817
00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:00.550
do this or do you think it was really a form of artistic expression?

818
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.690
I personally think it was a form of artistic expression that he also wanted to

819
00:49:04.691 --> 00:49:05.524
do.

820
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:10.000
I think it's both and I think that's part of what people got angry about with

821
00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:14.860
the idea is that like I'm looking,
when I see a guy act really well,

822
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:17.950
I'm looking at Dick wagging already.
You know?

823
00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:22.990
I mean that's what you're doing by excel,
but in your expression,
you know,

824
00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:27.820
in your expression of,
you know,
the powerful,
the anger of your acting.

825
00:49:27.821 --> 00:49:30.850
I'm looking at your tears,
you're screaming at someone.

826
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.440
I'm also aware that you're aware that you're awesome at doing that.

827
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:39.070
And then me being aware that you're aware that you're awesome and doing that,

828
00:49:39.071 --> 00:49:41.140
there's a certain amount of inherent Dick Wagging.

829
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:43.610
It's one of the reasons why people have a,

830
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:48.660
like an almost automatic distaste for some famous men or some powerful man or

831
00:49:48.851 --> 00:49:52.690
men that are in the public spotlight is cause they know they have to be at least

832
00:49:52.691 --> 00:49:55.780
somewhat enamored of themselves,
which is a form of Dick Wagging.

833
00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:59.470
So when you're doing that Dick Wagging and then you're also sticking your dick

834
00:49:59.471 --> 00:50:02.860
in Chloe's of agendas,
diseases,
mouth,

835
00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:07.930
like Jesus fucking Christ,
man,
you're double Dick Wagon.
That's what you're doing,

836
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.440
your Dick Wagon because you're up there on the big screen and your Dick Wagon

837
00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:16.441
cause you're standing there and these ridiculous fucking tailored weird clothes.

838
00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:19.630
Cause you want to be interesting.
If you're fucking handmade shoes,

839
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:24.760
I just want to hit you wanna fuck I saw the scene.

840
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:27.380
I don't really want to hit him.
I probably would get along with that.
Dude.

841
00:50:27.381 --> 00:50:30.830
I probably like him.
You know,
I think he's probably a freak.

842
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:33.290
You should totally bring him on a podcast.
That's really interesting.

843
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:36.440
Well he wasn't around for a while and then he did a vodka commercial.

844
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:40.640
There was a vodka commercial that he was a part of,
some big uh,
vodka campaign.

845
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:43.880
But I don't know like what kind of films he's been in since then.

846
00:50:43.881 --> 00:50:47.870
But I do know that there was from my limited amount of experience in show

847
00:50:47.871 --> 00:50:51.320
business,
because I kind of,
when I started doing fear factor,

848
00:50:51.321 --> 00:50:56.090
I basically divorced myself almost entirely of the acting world.
Sure.
You know,

849
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.580
it was only in it for like five years when I was doing news radio.

850
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:02.450
And then when I started doing that I just Kinda,
I was just out of that world.

851
00:51:02.451 --> 00:51:05.420
So I never,
I never hung out with those people,
not around those people.

852
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:10.080
But when I did,
my limited interaction with people led me to,

853
00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:14.600
to think that they're probably like almost universally people wanted him

854
00:51:14.601 --> 00:51:18.140
blackballed because that movie,
Oh I think it was so common

855
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:21.040
<v 2>boundary of like,
you know,
if you have like</v>

856
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:25.060
when people have controversial sex scenes that come up,

857
00:51:25.061 --> 00:51:28.510
like I kind of remember eyes wide shut.
That's just what comes to mind.

858
00:51:28.511 --> 00:51:30.910
When that movie came out,
people were like,
oh my God,
you know,

859
00:51:30.911 --> 00:51:35.560
there's some serious shit in there.
And then,
you know,
keep pushing the envelope.

860
00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:40.650
But I think you know what actual sex scene in a non quote unquote pornographic

861
00:51:41.261 --> 00:51:45.280
film.
It's like all of a sudden all the filmmakers are like,
oh,
what the fuck,

862
00:51:45.281 --> 00:51:48.310
what,
you know,
why did you,
you totally like,
you know,
shooting almost.

863
00:51:48.311 --> 00:51:52.040
You can do that.
And I know everybody's paying attention to it.
Yeah,
well it just,

864
00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.440
it's not,
um,
the,

865
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:57.670
the formal kind of traditional sense of a sex scene.

866
00:51:57.671 --> 00:52:02.380
So I'm sure filmmakers would be a little bit perturbed,
but I don't give a shit.

867
00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:03.580
That's just my take on it.

868
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:07.310
<v 1>Apparently homeboys still doing movies for him.</v>

869
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:12.370
He did buffalo 66 was a really interesting movie to Brown bunny was in 2004 and

870
00:52:14.091 --> 00:52:17.450
he did a couple of movies since then,
you know,

871
00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.500
here and there like little parts and weird shit that,
do you ever get um,

872
00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:25.970
movie offers or yeah,
like that these days.
Yeah.
Not good ones,

873
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:30.380
but yeah,
they're never,
it's never worth it because it might even,

874
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:32.030
it was like one of them was a big movie,

875
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:36.020
but it wasn't that much money and I had to go somewhere for like a couple of

876
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:36.853
weeks and I was like,

877
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:41.030
you gotta you gotta pay me a lot of money and it's gotta be worth my while.

878
00:52:41.031 --> 00:52:43.910
It's going to be interesting for me to want to do it or I got to know somebody

879
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:46.670
in it that I'm gonna enjoy hanging out with.
Sure.
Like otherwise,

880
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:50.200
like I'd rather just do a free podcast.
Sounds ridiculous.

881
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:55.040
I'd rather do a set of the ice house,
like at a certain point in time it's like,

882
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:55.880
what do you want?

883
00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:58.820
Do you want a bunch of money or do you want to do things that you enjoyed doing?

884
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.150
And the more you say,
I want a bunch of money,

885
00:53:02.151 --> 00:53:05.690
the less you're going to do things you enjoy doing.
And the more you say,

886
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.270
I want to do things I enjoy doing somehow or another,

887
00:53:08.271 --> 00:53:11.770
the more money you start making.
Yeah,
it doesn't make any sense.
And that's it.

888
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.793
Let's do that.

889
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.270
<v 2>Doing it.
Yeah.
Money.
Actually,
you know what,
I'll be honest with you.
Um,
please do.</v>

890
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.130
It's been,
you know,
I think I'm always honest.

891
00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:24.030
<v 1>Um,
but hey,
well please don't tell me that.
Um,</v>

892
00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:25.860
make it seem like a special moment.

893
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:30.170
<v 5>We've had a really great year so far as far as um,</v>

894
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:34.270
<v 2>great year so far as far as shows that have been coming in.</v>

895
00:53:34.271 --> 00:53:39.070
Like we've had a few private gigs where those are,
are really,
um,

896
00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:42.760
fruitful.
You know,
someone's like,
literally,
we actually,
um,

897
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:47.900
this was amazing to play to a Gig for a birthday party,
but it was a very,

898
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.020
um,
well set up.

899
00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:54.970
It was the 21st birthday party.
This girl 2021 years old.

900
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:56.710
Um,
but her,

901
00:53:56.730 --> 00:54:01.150
her father's a Microsoft exec and they are fans of our band and it was such a

902
00:54:01.151 --> 00:54:06.040
great opportunity to make new friends,
but also,
you know,
get,

903
00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.420
get paid well,

904
00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:11.320
which was actually really cool because that's helping us finish this record and

905
00:54:11.321 --> 00:54:12.700
things like that kind of keep happening.

906
00:54:12.701 --> 00:54:15.010
We're getting these phone calls of like someone saying,
Hey,

907
00:54:15.011 --> 00:54:17.170
we have this festival.
It's a small town festival,

908
00:54:17.171 --> 00:54:20.650
but we'd love to bring you in and you know,
it's all kind of working out,

909
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:25.960
you know,
in a way that we're really grateful for because it's sort of like,

910
00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:27.850
we've been doing this for eight years,
you know,

911
00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:32.800
and it's nice to have those things when they come up and not have to have a side

912
00:54:32.801 --> 00:54:33.550
job right now.

913
00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:33.911
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

914
00:54:33.911 --> 00:54:37.900
Well you guys are really fucking talented and the world is very strange right

915
00:54:37.901 --> 00:54:39.100
now when it comes to music.

916
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:44.580
It's just the way to distribute things is gone topsy turvy the record companies

917
00:54:45.641 --> 00:54:48.560
are whack that stuff.
It's,
it's,
you just have to figure,

918
00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:52.890
you have to do it on your own and internet and will the Internet,
we,
we have,
uh,

919
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.100
you can do live shows.

920
00:54:54.101 --> 00:54:57.250
There's a thing called stage it and we've done a few of those and we're actually

921
00:54:57.251 --> 00:55:00.160
going to do one soon.
Um,
but,
but touring,
you know,

922
00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.970
touring just can't sell records anymore.
It's not the same.

923
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:08.240
About the same.
It's not the same.
No,
it's not like,
but we actually have,

924
00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.190
like when we went to Europe,

925
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.730
<v 2>we actually just got off the road,
uh,
this past,
at the end of last year,</v>

926
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.660
we opened up for a guy named Jake Bugg

927
00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:18.490
<v 5>and
well we got,</v>

928
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:20.960
you can't bite the hand that man,
we totally,

929
00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.060
it was amazing.
Now he's a,
he's like a British rock sensation.

930
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:30.790
Oh cool.
When he took us overseas with them and it was amazing.

931
00:55:30.791 --> 00:55:35.620
It was really hard.
Like we got our asses handed to us and in the UK that was,

932
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:36.893
um,

933
00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:41.770
rowdy crowds and we played as a duo in front of like 6,000 people instead of

934
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:45.010
like when we played the full band and you get like drums and bass and it's like,

935
00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.670
you know,
router rounds man.
But I'll tell you what,

936
00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:50.440
England was rough on us,

937
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:53.590
<v 2>but Europe was amazing.
They,
uh,</v>

938
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.090
were probably some of the best crowds we've ever had.

939
00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.170
<v 5>You guys have opened for quite a few famous people.</v>

940
00:55:59.171 --> 00:56:03.060
Who else were you guys opened for?
We,
what'd we do last?

941
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.430
We did show crow wheel.
Yeah,
that's what I was talking about.
What was Alex?

942
00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.670
It was great.
Man.
She,
she likes to hang out with.
She's super sweet.

943
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.920
She just kept everything she did.

944
00:56:11.921 --> 00:56:15.580
She did have these little speeches during her set talking about how she needed

945
00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:18.340
to,
we had a Kickstarter at the time.

946
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:22.300
I don't think she really understood the concept of to get you guys some money at

947
00:56:22.301 --> 00:56:24.070
your Kickstarter.
Yeah.
But she'd say things like,

948
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.120
<v 1>vote for honey,
honey.
That's not,
no,
it's not a</v>

949
00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:33.010
campaign as a difference.
So cool though.
That's so cool.

950
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:36.460
She was amazing.
She's got a beautiful voice,
ma'am.
She's a beautiful woman.

951
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:39.940
Like just,
she's really,
and she's like an empire builder too.

952
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:43.270
That's what it's so cool to see the people in her position.
We'll figure it out.

953
00:56:43.271 --> 00:56:45.160
Okay.
I've had this,
I've had a successful music career,

954
00:56:45.161 --> 00:56:49.930
but I can just branch out now.
This whole universe of show crow.
Right,

955
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:54.340
right,
right.
Yeah.
I enjoy her music,
man.
Aye.
What time?

956
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:57.380
I was in my car and my friend Eddie,
uh,

957
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:59.860
it was in the car with me and he asked me if I could,
uh,

958
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.420
give his girlfriend a ride somewhere.

959
00:57:01.421 --> 00:57:06.280
So she hopped in the car and Sheryl Crow was playing and uh,
it was like,

960
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:09.190
is this a joke?
Like you're playing this as a joke?
And I'm like,

961
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.350
I like Sheryl Crow.
And was like,
no,
you don't.

962
00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:13.840
Like Sheryl Crow became like an argument with her and I,

963
00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:17.180
whether or not I like Sheryl Crow.
You being ironic like,
no,

964
00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:21.580
my favorite mistake is like a great fucking song.
It's a beautiful song.

965
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:25.060
She's like,
no,
you're,
you're like a monkey.
Like you're like eight.

966
00:57:25.061 --> 00:57:29.740
When she was like mocking me,
it was all in fun.
It was in good fun.
She's like,

967
00:57:29.741 --> 00:57:33.160
shouldn't be be listening to like death metal or something or something with a

968
00:57:33.161 --> 00:57:34.800
confederate flag attached to it

969
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.630
doing your show.
We have all these dudes come up.
I know we've told you that.
Yeah.

970
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:47.260
These dudes come out tatted up six foot five and we playing a ballad and just be

971
00:57:47.261 --> 00:57:51.670
like,
you know,
screaming before the show,
during the ballads.
It's amazing.

972
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:56.850
We have the nicest,
they're the best and everyone always asks about your like

973
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.790
great hugs.
It's really

974
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:05.510
cool when we guys,

975
00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:09.610
when we guys word and we did that show together.

976
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:13.180
December 21st,
2012 shell.
That was fun to shit.

977
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:18.180
That was the first and only time I've ever done a show like that or it was Doug.

978
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:23.110
Stan hope.
Joey Diaz.
You guys.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah,
I'm in.
Let's do it.

979
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:26.920
I'm totally down.
We could totally do that again if that was really fun.

980
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:30.670
It was really interesting to Nashville weird people out.
What's that?

981
00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.980
Do it the international?
Yeah,
I kind of,

982
00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:36.730
I have a friend who has a club in Nashville.
I'm in town.
I do his club.

983
00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:42.460
Yeah,
he supports comedy.
It's like this is not a big scene.

984
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:43.230
The clubs,

985
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:47.430
there's a weird thing with me with certain certain small clubs like I kind of

986
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.770
have to do them.
I said I have to support them and that's one of them.

987
00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:54.340
It's like not a lot of comedy out there.
I feel like he's an island in the,

988
00:58:54.341 --> 00:58:57.010
you know,
and I know he gets good acts there on a regular basis,

989
00:58:57.011 --> 00:59:00.610
but I always feel the need.
Like the Ice House is another one.

990
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:03.640
Like I would never do a theater in Pasadena.
It's never going to happen.

991
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:04.960
If I'm in Pasadena,

992
00:59:04.961 --> 00:59:08.170
I do the ice house just because of the fee owners is my friend.

993
00:59:08.171 --> 00:59:12.670
And it's supports comedy.
Loyalty.
It's fucking awesome.
Well,
it's that.

994
00:59:12.671 --> 00:59:16.690
It's also,
you don't,
I don't need to do anything else.
You know what I mean?

995
00:59:16.691 --> 00:59:19.510
It's not like a desperate moment where if I don't do the theater,

996
00:59:19.511 --> 00:59:21.980
my kid's going to be hungry.
You know,
you

997
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.530
<v 2>were on fire.
That end of the world show was amazing.</v>

998
00:59:24.531 --> 00:59:28.130
There was something magical happening that night.
It was fun.
And Doug,
Stan Hope,

999
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:31.900
<v 0>oh,
he's awesome.
And Joey and Joey Diaz is awesome.
God,</v>

1000
00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:35.890
that show couldn't have been more fun.
It was beautiful.
It was a beautiful show.

1001
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:40.660
The audience was so nice too.
They were so fun and so they enjoyed it so much.

1002
00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:42.680
It was just so cool.
You know?

1003
00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:46.750
That's the one most surprising thing about all this is not just the connection

1004
00:59:46.751 --> 00:59:49.750
to all these people that we've sort of like somehow or another fostered,

1005
00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:53.350
but how nice they are.
Like when we do shows like we do shit.

1006
00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:57.730
I did show the other day in Chicago and after the show I took pictures of the

1007
00:59:57.731 --> 01:00:01.420
pizza for two hours cause went outside and I said anybody who wants to take a

1008
01:00:01.421 --> 01:00:03.580
picture,
I said I'll be here until the last one he leave.

1009
01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:07.990
I stood on a behind a table and I just,
I said this is what we're going to do.

1010
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.490
I'll do five minutes on this side,

1011
01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.670
five minutes in the middle and then in five minutes on that side and then we'll

1012
01:00:12.671 --> 01:00:16.360
keep switching and we just went every five minutes and I set my timer on my

1013
01:00:16.361 --> 01:00:19.160
phone and at five minutes I bet.
All right I'm moving,
I'm moving.

1014
01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:23.170
Then I'd go do this side.
Like it was just a swarm of people around these tables.

1015
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:28.560
But what my point was was for two hours nobody was a dick,

1016
01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:33.730
not one person.
Everyone was cool as fuck.
Not,
why would the person,

1017
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.250
this is actually Dallas I did in Chicago too,

1018
01:00:36.251 --> 01:00:40.570
but this is the most recent was Dallas.
But it was just no one at all.

1019
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:44.260
Like nothing.
Not One person.
No one tried to cut in line.

1020
01:00:44.261 --> 01:00:45.600
No one was a shithead knowing

1021
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.010
<v 2>Dick to you.
I'm like,
well to anybody we've seen a little bit of that.</v>

1022
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:50.990
You see people not even with us necessarily.

1023
01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:54.590
We tour with other acts and people at the merch booth get aggressive with

1024
01:00:54.591 --> 01:00:57.230
whoever's signing say,
hey,
this is what I want.

1025
01:00:57.231 --> 01:01:00.110
Give me basically you owe this to me.
That kind of mentality.

1026
01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:04.520
<v 0>It does happen.
I think it all,
I mean,
I don't know cause I,</v>

1027
01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:07.020
I'm trying to figure out how this happened,
you know,
cause isn't,

1028
01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:11.800
it never happened to me before,
like before the podcast and before,
um,

1029
01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:15.550
you know,
social media essentially when I was dealing with people,

1030
01:01:15.551 --> 01:01:17.410
I was dealing with people that knew me from something else.

1031
01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:21.160
They knew me from fear factor or they knew me from the UFC or the new me from

1032
01:01:21.161 --> 01:01:25.180
news radio,
you know,
or they knew me from comedy.
Those were the options.

1033
01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:29.050
It wasn't.
They knew me like these people just all know me.
It's weird.

1034
01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.130
It's totally different.
It's like they say hi like they know me,

1035
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:36.430
you know like dude,
what's up?
And I'm like,
what's up?
What's going on?
You know,

1036
01:01:36.431 --> 01:01:37.390
it's,
it's very strange.

1037
01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:39.623
<v 2>I mean they get,</v>

1038
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:44.490
you get to reveal these really amazing parts of yourself and your,

1039
01:01:44.491 --> 01:01:46.740
and your mind on your podcast.

1040
01:01:46.741 --> 01:01:50.530
And I think that's such a great thing about what you're doing and what,
you know,

1041
01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:53.940
most podcasts,
if they're good ones,
you know,
you have,

1042
01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:58.380
you create good conversation,
you create real situations of,

1043
01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:01.380
of conversation and people get to witness that.
And that's so cool.

1044
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:03.540
<v 0>While they also get to be a part of it,
you know,</v>

1045
01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:04.940
because they get to see the whole thing.

1046
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:07.190
Like one of the things I like about this pod,
cause we don't,

1047
01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.840
we don't like edited,
it goes out live.
It's all,
you know,
it is what it is.

1048
01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:16.340
And because of that you kind of get to see who everybody really is.

1049
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:20.430
If it was really produced and there was all these fast edits and there was all

1050
01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:22.050
this,
you know,
you know,

1051
01:02:22.051 --> 01:02:27.051
really preplan segments and it would feel less like you were really there.

1052
01:02:27.391 --> 01:02:28.770
You might enjoy it still,

1053
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.230
but you wouldn't feel like you know the people that well.
Yeah.

1054
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.940
And at people that are stuck in some shit spot wherever the fuck you are.

1055
01:02:35.941 --> 01:02:40.170
If you're in Bangor,
Maine or not,
not to be smirch Bangor,
it's a fine community.

1056
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:41.303
But if you're anywhere,

1057
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.610
if you're in some weird spot and you know you don't have a lot of cool people

1058
01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:48.630
around you,
you could listen to honey honey talk,
you can listen to Adam Carolla,

1059
01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:49.740
you could,
you know there's,

1060
01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:53.160
there's a bunch of people that you're going to get to listen to the way they

1061
01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:53.580
think.

1062
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:58.580
And I know for a fact that I have part of who I am has been formed by listen to

1063
01:02:59.011 --> 01:03:02.730
be before smarter and more experienced in myself talk and that there,

1064
01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:05.220
there are thoughts shaped my reality.

1065
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:10.580
And so to be able to introduce other people to the thoughts and ideas that have

1066
01:03:12.271 --> 01:03:13.320
shaped my reality,

1067
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:17.370
my thoughts and ideas that I've gotten from those thoughts and ideas and other

1068
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:20.220
people's thoughts and ideas that continue to shape my reality.

1069
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:22.440
It's not just me putting on a show,

1070
01:03:22.441 --> 01:03:25.470
it's me being a part of it and the audience be a party of it too.

1071
01:03:25.471 --> 01:03:26.790
Everyone's a part of it.
It's like,

1072
01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:28.180
<v 2>I'll tell you what,</v>

1073
01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.480
I think that it's an incredible thing that you're doing that and you're

1074
01:03:31.481 --> 01:03:35.500
continuing to do that because if the majority of people are watching bullshit

1075
01:03:35.501 --> 01:03:36.760
reality shows,
you know,

1076
01:03:36.761 --> 01:03:41.700
where they're scripted and staged and they're supposed to do these candid,
um,

1077
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:46.300
examples of,
of really asinine shit,

1078
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:49.340
it really annoys me.
You know,
like real housewives and it's like,
right?

1079
01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:52.390
Like trying to make something like,
Oh,
you're,

1080
01:03:52.391 --> 01:03:54.850
you're wearing the same dress as me or whatever.

1081
01:03:54.851 --> 01:03:57.400
The fuck be important and I'm going to fight you.
I don't even know.

1082
01:03:57.401 --> 01:04:00.400
I don't watch that shit.
Right.
I think it's,
it's bad for you,
right?

1083
01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:03.760
I think that it lowers your

1084
01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:07.960
vibration.
You know what I mean?
Like,
and,
and when you're,

1085
01:04:07.961 --> 01:04:11.740
you're doing what you're doing,
which is um,
being,

1086
01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.770
I think you're brilliant,
I'm not trying to be weird,
but you're,

1087
01:04:14.771 --> 01:04:18.280
you have this incredible mind and you share it with people and lots of different

1088
01:04:18.281 --> 01:04:19.750
people and you have these situations,

1089
01:04:19.751 --> 01:04:23.640
it's really great to listen to and you're right.
People learn from it.

1090
01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:27.320
<v 0>Well I'm definitely not brilliant but what I am is curious and have a lot of</v>

1091
01:04:27.321 --> 01:04:32.321
free time and so I keep thinking about shit because I have the ability to do so.

1092
01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:37.670
I mean I don't know if people were like born to do anything in life.

1093
01:04:37.671 --> 01:04:41.480
I don't know if anybody was born to do anything in life but I think for sure if

1094
01:04:41.481 --> 01:04:42.980
you follow your passion,

1095
01:04:42.981 --> 01:04:47.870
you feel like you were born to do this if for sure if you actually do what you

1096
01:04:47.871 --> 01:04:49.280
enjoy out of life.

1097
01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.370
And there was some really weak ass article that somebody posted the other day

1098
01:04:52.371 --> 01:04:55.700
that I'm sick and tired of rich people saying to follow your passion.

1099
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.620
It was hilariously stupid.
Whoever,
whatever dumb ass road.

1100
01:04:59.621 --> 01:05:03.350
And he actually had to change the title the next day because of a barrage of

1101
01:05:03.351 --> 01:05:04.184
hate that he,

1102
01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.640
he got from it when it was about Richard Branson and a bunch of people saying,

1103
01:05:07.641 --> 01:05:08.570
follow your passion.

1104
01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.350
And he was saying essentially that most people shouldn't follow their passion

1105
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:15.350
and in fact they should keep their passion as a hobby.
Yeah.
You know why?

1106
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:17.650
Cause he's a weak bitch.
He's a week

1107
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:22.570
<v 1>and he's worried that he possibly wasted his life writing shitty articles like</v>

1108
01:05:22.571 --> 01:05:23.770
this.
And in fact he did.

1109
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:27.970
And he was also talking about how fortunate he is personally to do what he does.

1110
01:05:27.971 --> 01:05:32.830
But all these self deprecating throws to poverty in it and all this nonsense in

1111
01:05:32.831 --> 01:05:33.270
it.
I sent you,

1112
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:38.270
essentially what he's doing was who's a writing a thing that was downplaying

1113
01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:43.780
greatness and inspiration.
And when someone says follow your passion,
you know,

1114
01:05:43.781 --> 01:05:48.580
if anybody that says don't do that is a fucking idiot.
Because here's the thing,

1115
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.150
if you love making guitars,
okay,
and you just love guitars,

1116
01:05:52.151 --> 01:05:55.210
you left making guitars.
He said,
God,
I would love to make guitars for living.

1117
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.480
Someone fucking does that.
Okay.

1118
01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:02.020
There's a guy out there and he gets up every morning and he makes fucking

1119
01:06:02.021 --> 01:06:05.530
guitars and if that's what he loves to do,
that guy loves life.

1120
01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.020
We're not talking about breathing underwater.
Fuck face.

1121
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:10.780
We're not talking about flying to the moon with a fucking rubber band.

1122
01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.490
We're talking about making guitars.

1123
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.900
If your passion is making guitars and you read that asshole's article which
says,

1124
01:06:16.901 --> 01:06:21.280
don't follow your passion,
fuck you stupid.
Fuck you.
You weak dummy.

1125
01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:26.170
You fucking disease of ideas.
You're a disease idea.
That's what you are.

1126
01:06:26.171 --> 01:06:31.171
You're a rotten little weak man with poor hormones and you can't figure out that

1127
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:35.560
your passion doesn't necessarily mean rich like I'm so tired of rich people

1128
01:06:35.561 --> 01:06:38.140
saying,
follow your passion.
Shut,
fuck up.

1129
01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.890
What difference does it make if they're rich,
everyone should say,

1130
01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:44.590
follow your passion.
That's how buildings got made.

1131
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:46.480
That's why airplanes were invented.

1132
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:49.840
That's why you could watch fucking television because someone followed their

1133
01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:52.120
passion.
What happens when you read Lord of the Rings?

1134
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:56.050
You're reading someone's passion,
you're wearing clothes,
you're wearing passion,

1135
01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.540
you're listening to music,
you're listening to passion.

1136
01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:03.400
I'm reading your stupid fucking article.
Your lack of passion is your passion.

1137
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.210
Your lack of following your passion is what you're so passionate about

1138
01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:11.800
portraying.
Shut up to him,
man.
Shut up.
Hey Man,

1139
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:15.460
I'm going to hold you down.
And a buddy,
your scone,
you fuckhead,

1140
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:25.960
who is the name?
What's the name of Diego?
Peru for toning.
Powerful Diego.

1141
01:07:25.961 --> 01:07:30.910
Peru for 20
fucking Tommy.

1142
01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:33.950
Follow your passion guide again,
honey.

1143
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:38.530
Honey is following their passion or the mom and dad.
I get the feeling,

1144
01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:43.030
I mean that guy.
I don't really to point out like if that guy listens to this,

1145
01:07:43.031 --> 01:07:47.470
like Joe Rogan hates me,
smirked at me.
I don't really hate that guy at all.

1146
01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:48.370
I just would,

1147
01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:51.950
I would advise against further communications in that sort of thing.

1148
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.130
Don't be a naysayer.
You know what I mean?
Let,

1149
01:07:54.131 --> 01:07:55.690
let somebody have their fucking moment.

1150
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:59.230
Let somebody fail if they're going to fail or succeed.
I understand.

1151
01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:04.930
I truly understand his point.
But W,
W,
w you know,
I mean,
but his,
all of his,

1152
01:08:04.931 --> 01:08:07.060
you know,
his talk,
one of the things that Richard Branson said,

1153
01:08:07.061 --> 01:08:10.300
you should have a couch in your kitchen and this guy was like taking issue with,

1154
01:08:10.301 --> 01:08:14.320
if your kitchen is big enough to have a couch in it,
like stop,
stop.

1155
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.010
It doesn't mean you're rich.
A lot of people give,
get

1156
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.940
<v 0>a kid fucking couch and a kitchen.
She shut the fuck up.
You know,</v>

1157
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:23.950
like I hate that real obvious pandering or I can't afford to have a coach in my

1158
01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:27.310
kitchen.
My kitchen is not big enough.
Like,

1159
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:32.510
well fucking whatever dude.
You know,
you're talking nonsense.
There's God,

1160
01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:36.560
there's a better message than that.
It's not,
it's not,
you know,
it's not,

1161
01:08:36.561 --> 01:08:38.150
don't follow your passions.
It's not,

1162
01:08:38.151 --> 01:08:40.190
you're better off keeping your passions as your hobby.

1163
01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:42.380
That is absolutely ridiculous.

1164
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.220
And the only person that was any choice in life that's,

1165
01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:46.150
that doesn't make any sense.

1166
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.950
The person that would say that as a person who hasn't followed their passions,

1167
01:08:48.951 --> 01:08:51.770
it doesn't make a living off of it because if you can make a living off of it.

1168
01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:55.610
I do not work.
I don't work.

1169
01:08:55.611 --> 01:08:57.350
I don't have any jobs.

1170
01:08:57.530 --> 01:09:01.220
Even my jobs are not jobs and I'm not the only one.

1171
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:05.120
I know people that make pool cues.
My friend Eric,
he makes pool cues.

1172
01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.230
It makes beautiful pool cues.
He doesn't work.
I mean he makes pool cues.

1173
01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:09.860
He loves it.

1174
01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:13.100
He makes them for free and gives them out to people sometimes because he loves

1175
01:09:13.101 --> 01:09:15.920
doing it.
He loves would.
He loves creating things,
construct.

1176
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.870
He started doing it while he was in the military.

1177
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.920
He did it as a hobby just for fun cause he loves doing it,
you know,

1178
01:09:21.921 --> 01:09:24.890
and so when he's making money doing it,
he's not really working.

1179
01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:29.210
What he's doing is following his passion and if you could figure out a way to do

1180
01:09:29.211 --> 01:09:31.710
that for money,
God dammit.

1181
01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.780
Why would you ever try to encourage someone to not do that?
That's so crazy.

1182
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:38.660
It's even what we were talking about before.
If you just start doing it,

1183
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:41.780
eventually the money's going to reveal itself.
Hopefully the support,

1184
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:44.390
maybe it's not,
you know,
your whole lifestyle is being provided for,

1185
01:09:44.391 --> 01:09:46.910
but you can do something with it.
Yeah.
Hopefully.

1186
01:09:46.911 --> 01:09:51.110
Unless you like make weird shit like custom badminton rackets and nobody wants

1187
01:09:51.111 --> 01:09:55.190
to buy toothpick tps or something going to something that's your passion.

1188
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:58.960
Some days it's going to catch on.
So weird shit.
People do well shit,

1189
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:01.760
it's amazing and sometimes weird.
Shit's worth a lot of money.

1190
01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:02.750
Like I saw something,

1191
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:06.890
it was a Faberge egg that someone found in like a garage sale or something like

1192
01:10:06.891 --> 01:10:11.480
that and they,
it was worth like 10 million bucks.
No,
I do you see that?

1193
01:10:11.481 --> 01:10:14.470
No.
Pull that article up.
Faberge egg found.

1194
01:10:14.471 --> 01:10:16.970
They were like trying to collect scrap,
but I looked at it,
I was like,
oh my God,

1195
01:10:16.971 --> 01:10:19.580
I wouldn't give you a dollar for that.
If you had that in my house,

1196
01:10:19.581 --> 01:10:23.350
I'd fucking push it out the door.
You try to leave it in the house.
I was like,
no,

1197
01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.900
you can't leave this here.
You're so,
it's so funny.

1198
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.160
<v 2>Recently,
I,
I was,
uh,</v>

1199
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:33.800
I saw this article on beanie babies and it was like worth like $10,000 or,

1200
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.730
and I was like,
Holy Shit.
Like my grandmother sent us all these beanie babies.

1201
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:38.400
Oh Wow.

1202
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.840
<v 0>Look at that.
Faberge a meal worth up to 20 million found by scrap metal dealer.</v>

1203
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.980
What are you going to do with it?

1204
01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.520
How is that worth $20 million month that in my bathroom,
that is so dumb.

1205
01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:51.300
The idea that that's where 20 million bucks,
it's

1206
01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.020
<v 2>silly,
but you know,
you got to let somebody have their passion.</v>

1207
01:10:54.021 --> 01:10:56.180
If that Faberge egg egg.
That's what I said.

1208
01:10:56.470 --> 01:11:00.800
<v 0>Yeah.
But he traps,
I mean,
I guess maybe it's like really beautiful upclose yes.</v>

1209
01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.510
<v 2>So recently I was a,</v>

1210
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:08.950
I saw this article on being babies and there's a collection in my parents'

1211
01:11:09.051 --> 01:11:11.750
basement given to us by my grandparents.
When we were kids,

1212
01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.880
my grandma would send like the Princess Diana

1213
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.020
<v 5>beanie baby and we have like,
there's like a hundred of them.
And so I was like,</v>

1214
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:21.020
I was like,
Ma Ma,
I'm going to go in the basement.

1215
01:11:21.021 --> 01:11:24.450
I think I'm gonna make some money.
I was like looking up all this shit,

1216
01:11:24.451 --> 01:11:27.990
hoping I could sell something on Ebay because they were going for like $15,000

1217
01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:34.590
for it.
But it had to be like,
it was really weird.
It had to be like,
um,

1218
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:40.250
there would be like a technical flaw on the tag and somebody out there would pay

1219
01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:45.870
$15,000 for whatever.
It's so weird.
Yeah,

1220
01:11:45.871 --> 01:11:48.000
I didn't come up with anything good.
I was really bummed,

1221
01:11:48.001 --> 01:11:51.570
but I was downstairs in the basement for like an hour and a half trying to come

1222
01:11:51.571 --> 01:11:56.020
up with something
hustler.
Um,

1223
01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:58.230
the ones that we owe nothing,
maybe like 10 bucks,

1224
01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:04.190
10 bucks or 15 or less sentimental value of my grandmother Florence fantasy.

1225
01:12:04.441 --> 01:12:08.330
So man is amazing.
I see,
I understand it.

1226
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:13.260
It's weird how things become like super worth money.
Very,

1227
01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:15.810
very expensive and it doesn't make sense.

1228
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:22.990
And it was $500,000 and apparently he's this amazing hand built.

1229
01:12:24.211 --> 01:12:26.520
Why?
But it wasn't like covered in diamonds or anything like that.

1230
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:30.030
It was just this amazing handcrafted watch.

1231
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.730
But it's still just a watch just because it's hand crafted.

1232
01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:37.560
Like if someone gave you a handcrafted spoon would,

1233
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:39.120
how much more would that be worth?

1234
01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:43.920
It was the handcrafted spoon made by Jimi Hendrix.
Fuck yeah,

1235
01:12:43.921 --> 01:12:45.150
I'd be pumped about that spoon.

1236
01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:48.160
I pay a few grand for a handcrafted spoon made by Jimi Hendrix.

1237
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.460
Never eat soup without that spoon

1238
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.820
spoon around my neck because I don't know.
It's like guitars.

1239
01:12:56.821 --> 01:12:58.380
You'll find guitars for 200 grand,

1240
01:12:58.381 --> 01:13:02.660
250 but most of the people that buy them don't play him too.

1241
01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.270
We'll just wants glass box.
Legendary.

1242
01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:12.420
They're irreplaceable.
There's know.
What is it like a 55 gold top?

1243
01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:16.920
The 59 Les Paul Gold.
Top news is worth a ridiculous amount of money.

1244
01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:20.740
I don't know.
I don't know.
It depends.
It always flexes.

1245
01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.560
But you could probably sell one for like a hundred grand.
There's,

1246
01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.530
it's like that with old cars now.

1247
01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:30.150
You know there's certain like old barracudas that are worth over a million

1248
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:32.610
dollars and this is the Plymouth,

1249
01:13:32.611 --> 01:13:37.611
a shitty old Plymouth and the ones they want are the ones that are completely

1250
01:13:37.801 --> 01:13:42.240
stock.
Like no new wheels,
no new tires,

1251
01:13:42.241 --> 01:13:45.810
no new interior,
everything stock,
everything from the factory,

1252
01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:50.820
little push button radio and people will pay exorbitant amounts to passion to

1253
01:13:52.351 --> 01:13:57.290
find one person
59 the less cross.

1254
01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.590
You just need one person to give enough of a shit to say that that's worth

1255
01:14:01.591 --> 01:14:06.090
$100,000 and then it is.
That's true.
It's like as soon as it becomes a demand,

1256
01:14:06.091 --> 01:14:09.810
right?
Yeah.
This weird thing,
especially if there's a finite amount,

1257
01:14:09.811 --> 01:14:12.880
like there's a finite amount of 1972

1258
01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:17.140
<v 1>Volkswagens.
Yeah.
If you find a 1972 Volkswagen bug,</v>

1259
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:19.810
this is only a few of those that were ever made.

1260
01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:21.490
You know how many of them are are their lefts,

1261
01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:25.150
you know if you could get a pristine one becomes very valuable

1262
01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.220
<v 2>about that is that some people actually make a business out of just the,</v>

1263
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:31.620
the tastemaking trend setting in general.

1264
01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:35.150
Like they might not even be like a car maven,
but they like,

1265
01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:40.260
they can be privy to the oncoming trend of,
do you know what I mean?
Like,

1266
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:43.730
like all of a sudden everybody wants those 79 or whatever.
He said.
Volkswagens.

1267
01:14:43.731 --> 01:14:46.980
Yeah,
and then you could just be like this trader,

1268
01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:51.610
you know the Ebay middleman traitor.
No,
I mean trader traders.
Yeah.

1269
01:14:52.770 --> 01:14:54.500
<v 1>Yeah.
Those are the sweet old Volkswagen.</v>

1270
01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.940
My Buddy Jimmy Lawless used to have one of those when we were 18 prowl around

1271
01:14:58.941 --> 01:15:03.770
and this fucking little tiny Volkswagen is at 18 yeah.
His name is Jimmy.

1272
01:15:03.771 --> 01:15:07.810
Lost his whole life.
Pretty hardcore.
No,
Jimmy was a good dude.
Yeah.

1273
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:11.120
Jimmy's a bad ass name.
Yeah,
it is.
I was always jealous.

1274
01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.920
We've recently come across some great names.

1275
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:16.930
I met somebody in England and his last name was dragon.
Oh Shit.

1276
01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.850
Wake up every morning just feeling like you're fucking rocket rockets.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1277
01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:25.400
There was a rocket,
one of my best friends named Eddie Bravo.
That's ridiculous.

1278
01:15:25.401 --> 01:15:28.910
Yeah.
That guy,
the bravos ridiculous name.
People do believe it's a real name.

1279
01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:33.820
Come on letter.
Your name.
That's his fucking name.
Yeah,
that's a,

1280
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:37.900
I was stuck with Joe Joe Rogan.
It's very boring stuff in their name.

1281
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:40.460
That's all right now I made something out of it.

1282
01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.790
It's easy to spell.
Yeah.

1283
01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.090
Egg is the baddest motherfucker vol time because they came up to him and they

1284
01:15:47.091 --> 01:15:50.270
told him,
you got to change that shit.
And he's like,
well,
I don't think so.

1285
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:55.900
Got Dude's name.
What is the original Santa Su?

1286
01:15:55.910 --> 01:16:00.650
So damn,
that's even better.
Oh Man.
When you go solo,

1287
01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.193
well,
you know,

1288
01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.790
why are you trying to

1289
01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:16.070
be supportive in man
fucking bullshitting?
I just can't help it.

1290
01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.400
I can't help it.
I have bad instincts.
Oh Man.

1291
01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:24.170
Comedian instincts and always say something fucked up.
Destroy all day.

1292
01:16:24.171 --> 01:16:25.730
I find them all fucking day.

1293
01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:31.390
<v 2>You know what,
we're,
we uh,
we've weathered the storms over the years.</v>

1294
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:34.790
It's been rough.
I'm sure.
Fucking rough.
Yeah.

1295
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:37.600
<v 1>Well you guys get along remarkably well.
And you know,</v>

1296
01:16:37.601 --> 01:16:41.530
one of the things I really enjoy about hanging out with you guys is how,

1297
01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:46.120
look no one gets along 100% of the time.
It just doesn't work.

1298
01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.960
There's no human beings,
whether it's mother and son,

1299
01:16:49.961 --> 01:16:53.830
whether it's father and daughter,
whether it's brothers and sisters,

1300
01:16:53.831 --> 01:16:57.760
whether it's friends and neighbors.
No one gets along 100% of the time.

1301
01:16:57.761 --> 01:17:02.230
It's going to be bumps,
but you guys are,
you have a great energy about you,

1302
01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:07.000
like you guys are friends,
you guys are co creators,

1303
01:17:07.001 --> 01:17:10.070
your,
your,
your collaborators.
You know,

1304
01:17:10.071 --> 01:17:12.350
you have a very unique bond because of that.

1305
01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:15.680
And it's interesting to pal around with you guys,
like to go to dinner with you,

1306
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:20.330
hang out with you.
Cause your bond is,
is,
it's unique,

1307
01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:24.930
but it's also very pure.
And that sounds gross to say that hate,

1308
01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:28.720
hate my own words.
Fight pretty early on,
honestly.

1309
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.390
You figured out how to fight each other and not have it not hurt each other.

1310
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:37.190
Destroy.
Yeah.
But,
um,
well you don't insult each other.
That's,

1311
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:41.660
you know,
I had,
I had a friend,
we were having this conversation a while back.

1312
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:45.710
He was talking about his wife and he's like,
you know where everything's fine,

1313
01:17:45.711 --> 01:17:49.880
but man,
when we fight,
uh,
we both go for the drug dealer right away.

1314
01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:52.640
And I go like,
what do you,
yeah.
And I go,
what do you like?
What do you mean,

1315
01:17:52.641 --> 01:17:55.010
go for the jugular?
And he goes,
well,
you know,
we just,

1316
01:17:55.011 --> 01:17:57.950
we know the one thing that really fucks with each other.

1317
01:17:57.951 --> 01:18:00.440
So we automatically go to that and I go,
okay,

1318
01:18:00.441 --> 01:18:03.430
who's the first person is doing that?
You know,
I don't want to say,

1319
01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.910
<v 2>you know what,
I think I'm in any situation where you're,
um,</v>

1320
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.870
you're introduced to conflict.
[inaudible] depending on like,

1321
01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.770
sometimes you want to fight,
you know,
it's like you can,
you can,
uh,

1322
01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.210
be quick with your words,
you know,
whatever it say mean shit,
but that,

1323
01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.680
that's kind of pointless.
You know,
at the end of the day,

1324
01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:25.620
usually you're fighting depending on who you're fighting with.
But like,

1325
01:18:25.621 --> 01:18:30.420
it's your loved ones,
at least in my disposition.
And I love them.

1326
01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:35.340
I don't want to hurt them.
So you,
when you approach,
you know,

1327
01:18:35.341 --> 01:18:39.540
a confrontation,
in my opinion,
this is something actually I really learned a lot.

1328
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:44.100
My relationship with Ben in his band has made my other relationships in my life

1329
01:18:44.101 --> 01:18:45.870
so much better because we had,

1330
01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.320
<v 1>because we have to fight it</v>

1331
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:55.790
<v 2>so hard for,
um,
sometimes not all the time for this,</v>

1332
01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:59.270
this union for our project.
And what we care about so much.

1333
01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:03.890
And so you have to be a good listener and you have to be humble and you have to

1334
01:19:03.891 --> 01:19:06.740
like,
you know,
put your fucking foot in your mouth sometimes.
And,

1335
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:11.330
and when I approach a confrontation with like my sister or my mom and like my

1336
01:19:11.331 --> 01:19:14.660
family and I,
we love each other,
we love each other so much,
we fight hard,

1337
01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.790
you know,
and it sucks and it's painful.

1338
01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:20.300
<v 1>Where are you guys like your fight?
Like get angry at each other?
Yeah,</v>

1339
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:22.720
there's a lot of stuff.
I'm not going to get into it but,

1340
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:27.120
but stuff happens over a couple more drinks.
Keep easy Rogan.

1341
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.700
I'm fucking watch yourself.
Um,
but the,
the point is that if you approach

1342
01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:34.900
<v 2>any conflict or confrontation literally,</v>

1343
01:19:34.901 --> 01:19:37.510
and I'm not trying to be weird with love and you're like,

1344
01:19:37.570 --> 01:19:41.520
I love this person and you listen you,

1345
01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:46.450
I think more often than not you can really come to a resolve or just a better

1346
01:19:46.451 --> 01:19:47.560
understanding of that person.

1347
01:19:47.561 --> 01:19:50.650
You will continue to learn more about people in your life.
It's not like you,

1348
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:53.940
this,
you have this all encompassing knowledge of somebody you know

1349
01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.660
<v 1>as useful side of fighting too.</v>

1350
01:19:55.661 --> 01:19:58.030
Cause then we're hammering shit out that makes us not get along.

1351
01:19:58.031 --> 01:20:01.180
Maybe we would get along more in the future and figure out what it's been.

1352
01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:04.360
Maybe there's been something you've been doing,
which sucks.

1353
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:08.100
And I need to get away from those people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I had a girlfriend

1354
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:12.340
<v 0>once that really liked to fight and uh,
well,
you know,
it's all right.</v>

1355
01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:17.400
I got rid of her.
She was a crazy bitch.
Like fuck.
But there was,

1356
01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:19.580
um,
there was one moment where we're,

1357
01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:22.770
we're heading out to some party and I guess she was stressed out or something

1358
01:20:22.771 --> 01:20:27.170
like that.
So she yelled at me like out of nowhere.
And uh,
and I just,

1359
01:20:27.171 --> 01:20:29.490
this is the first time she ever yelled at me and I go,
hey,
listen,
I grow,

1360
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:31.260
we can't talk like this.
You can't,

1361
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:32.880
you can't have this conversation with me like this.
Like,

1362
01:20:32.881 --> 01:20:35.670
are you not allowed to yell at me?
I go,
none of my friends yell at me.

1363
01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:39.660
No one yells at me.
I don't yell at him either.
I go,
if you're my friend,
I go,

1364
01:20:39.661 --> 01:20:41.790
why would you,
why do it?
Why would you yell at me?

1365
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.830
You don't yell at me if you're more concerned with it.

1366
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:50.790
Just exploding,
throwing up your own energy,

1367
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:53.280
then you are with the repercussions is going to have on the people around you.

1368
01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:56.670
That's an ultimately very selfish thing to do.
And I go,
we can't,

1369
01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:00.780
we can't ever talk like that.
And she looks like immediate,
like deflated,

1370
01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:02.820
like all of her anger like went away.

1371
01:21:02.821 --> 01:21:05.970
It was a very weird moment and we just sat down and we had a conversation.

1372
01:21:05.971 --> 01:21:09.780
That tone exactly that.
The tone is everything.
That's pretty powerful man.

1373
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:13.660
Tony do that well,
it was pretty powerful but she couldn't help herself.
She was,

1374
01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.090
she was,
I don't know what it was.

1375
01:21:15.091 --> 01:21:18.930
It was something that our child had because we wound up staying friends,

1376
01:21:18.931 --> 01:21:22.230
but we broke up and then she started dating some new guy and um,

1377
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:26.100
she calls me up and she's like really frustrated.

1378
01:21:26.130 --> 01:21:28.630
She's really frustrated because she can't keep yelling at this.

1379
01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:30.020
She can't keep from yelling at this guy.

1380
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:32.700
She keeps yelling at them and she doesn't know what to do.
She's like,

1381
01:21:32.701 --> 01:21:35.790
I yell at him and he takes it and I fucking keep yelling at them and I don't

1382
01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:40.510
know what to do.
I just can't.
I can't,
he,
he lets me bullying.

1383
01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.140
So I start fucking bullying him and she goes and I don't,

1384
01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:44.610
I can't even stop myself,

1385
01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:48.110
<v 2>you know,
if you grow up with that.
Yeah.</v>

1386
01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:50.070
Yelling and it's really funny like this is,

1387
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:52.860
my mom is awesome but like I grew up with a lot of yelling.

1388
01:21:52.861 --> 01:21:57.270
My mom yelled a lot and I was bad.
So,
but this is kind of hysterical.

1389
01:21:57.271 --> 01:22:00.540
We had a family bird.
Um,
it was a boy,

1390
01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:04.380
but his name was Abby and he was an African grey and they're really smart.

1391
01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:08.280
They're really fucking smart animals and they repeat a lot of things and

1392
01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:12.330
literally the Bar,
my sisters,
I grew up with Carla and Jody,

1393
01:22:12.331 --> 01:22:14.010
like the bird would go Carla,

1394
01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:19.490
Jodi and then we'll go see to have is like total like this like fleur of like

1395
01:22:21.571 --> 01:22:23.850
screaming words that you couldn't understand.

1396
01:22:23.851 --> 01:22:25.490
But it was pretty accurate cause my,

1397
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.730
I got yelled at a lot and my mom would yell at me and so it was always this

1398
01:22:29.731 --> 01:22:33.600
reminder,
like when I would walk in the room that sometimes the Burj next day,

1399
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:40.080
God,
my mom never called me and kind.
That'd be horrible.
Really bad thing.

1400
01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:43.990
Well we fucking noise she made,
it's the same thing as calling your car.

1401
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:48.720
But it's funny,
like we love each other so much,
but we fought a lot.
Oh Lord.

1402
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:51.720
Oh,
that's rough.
But yeah,
yelling,
yelling is a,

1403
01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:55.950
is a difficult thing too as an adult now.
It's like,
um,

1404
01:22:56.730 --> 01:23:00.330
it's really funny,
but Ben,
you know,
we the other way my mom did,

1405
01:23:00.331 --> 01:23:03.000
she would just freeze me out.
Yeah.
To like

1406
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.170
<v 0>deep silence.
Oh,
that's worse.
Yeah.</v>

1407
01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.950
Sometimes it's better if someone has enough caring for you that the yell at you

1408
01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:10.540
and fight with you.
Like you work it out.

1409
01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.550
Everybody gets tired of it and working it out.
Yeah.
You know,
but this girl,
um,

1410
01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:20.110
you know,
she wasn't a bad person and growing up later and becoming a dad,

1411
01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:24.190
I kind of really feel for her because I think that what happened with this,

1412
01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:25.240
this girl was just,

1413
01:23:25.241 --> 01:23:30.241
she was just programmed in a really shitty way by dummies and she grew up in

1414
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:33.570
Florida and there are a bunch of dummies around her and she said,
yes,

1415
01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:37.440
<v 5>Capitol of the United States,
zero killer caverns,
not cereal.</v>

1416
01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:42.980
A lot of cocoa puffs crunched by fucking delicious.

1417
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:46.090
You know,
I think that's a lot of it

1418
01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:46.901
<v 0>who we are.</v>

1419
01:23:46.901 --> 01:23:50.840
It's like how we were programmed when we were young and this girl was,

1420
01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.120
she wasn't a bad person.

1421
01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:56.320
She was just battling with a programming as she was trying to be an actress.

1422
01:23:56.321 --> 01:23:58.180
Which fucking good luck with all that.

1423
01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:00.740
<v 5>It's really funny.
Sorry Ben,
go ahead.
I was just going to say,</v>

1424
01:24:00.741 --> 01:24:05.120
isn't that what the neuroplasticity concept has those you can change that stuff.

1425
01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.100
You can,
but

1426
01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:08.740
<v 0>you know,
neuroplasticity is all nice and good,
but if you were,</v>

1427
01:24:08.741 --> 01:24:09.670
if you're that fucked up,

1428
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:14.671
I recommend MTMA neural plasticity is really going to fucking get you to the

1429
01:24:15.191 --> 01:24:18.880
dance.
But what does that do?
Just kind of blast it all makes you feel,

1430
01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:23.320
it makes you understand love in a weird,
pure form.
You know?
I mean,

1431
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:24.640
and people could say it's a drug,

1432
01:24:24.641 --> 01:24:29.440
but that drug by the way exists in everyone's brain right now as we speak.

1433
01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:33.100
What you,
what you're dealing with with dopamine and you know,

1434
01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.650
and Mtma is elevated dopamine levels,

1435
01:24:35.651 --> 01:24:39.790
elevated feelings of love and passion and connection to each other.
It's just,

1436
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.340
you know,
somebody sent me this video,
it's really kind of interesting.

1437
01:24:42.341 --> 01:24:43.420
You'd probably find it Brian.

1438
01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.590
It's a Joe Rogan talks indirectly about rave culture.

1439
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:52.830
And it was me talking about [inaudible] about setting up some sort of

1440
01:24:52.961 --> 01:24:56.650
psychedelic community and that it would be incredibly beneficial to people to

1441
01:24:56.651 --> 01:25:01.210
set up communities where we could figure out how to meet and everybody takes

1442
01:25:01.211 --> 01:25:05.200
something that would tune this all into this sort of frequency of,
of love.

1443
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:09.520
And so someone took me talking about that and connected it to raves where if you

1444
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:12.880
look up at that screen,
like anytime you've seen a rave like this,

1445
01:25:13.930 --> 01:25:18.930
99.9% of those people are on ecstasy.

1446
01:25:19.330 --> 01:25:24.330
You're looking at 15,000 people that are in this huge football arena and

1447
01:25:25.061 --> 01:25:25.390
they're,

1448
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:28.990
they're dancing around and touching each other and having a great fucking time.

1449
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:30.610
Why are they having such a great time?

1450
01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.880
How come they can get together and smush up like that?
And no one's a Dick?

1451
01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:38.860
I'll tell you why.
Because they're on ecstasy.
And when I say 99.9,
nine,
nine,

1452
01:25:38.861 --> 01:25:42.550
nine point whatever,
those people are,
assholes

1453
01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:47.190
<v 5>shouldn't be a day.
Not necessarily.
Can I be honest with you?
I think that also,</v>

1454
01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:50.280
um,
I read this book on collective joy.
Um,

1455
01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:54.870
it's really interesting because like back to our primitive tribal selves,
like,

1456
01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:55.441
you know,

1457
01:25:55.441 --> 01:25:58.950
when there would be like rain dances and the tribes would dance and they would

1458
01:25:58.951 --> 01:26:00.690
all move together,
you know,

1459
01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.310
there would be this collective sort of that people

1460
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:09.230
<v 2>would have coalescing between them.
And I,
like,</v>

1461
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:14.300
I recently have reconnected with dancing.
Like I went to,

1462
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:18.620
I went to a party and there was a Dj and you know,
I have like a couple drinks,

1463
01:26:18.621 --> 01:26:23.510
whatever,
but like I wasn't on drugs at the time.
And um,
you know,
rarely,

1464
01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:28.430
but let's get into that later.
But,
um,
the,
the dancing that the movement with,

1465
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:31.970
with the sound is a powerful thing.
Drugs or no drugs.

1466
01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:35.420
And I think there's something really interesting about it as far as a
collective,

1467
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:39.290
you know,
group of people.
Well that's in harmony,
you know,

1468
01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:44.170
<v 0>as a comedian,
that's what I essentially do for a living.
As a comedian,</v>

1469
01:26:44.171 --> 01:26:49.171
what you're doing is connecting all these minds together in some sort of a

1470
01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.480
harmonious,
harmonious tribal function.

1471
01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:56.860
That's why the smaller the tribe usually,
generally the better it works,

1472
01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:57.881
you know.

1473
01:26:57.881 --> 01:27:01.370
But one of the weird things about this connection with the Internet is that

1474
01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:03.670
people are getting used to larger and larger numbers.

1475
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:08.770
We've had shows was 3000 plus people and it feels like it's intimate.
You know,

1476
01:27:08.771 --> 01:27:13.030
it feels intimate.
Like everyone's tuned in 3000 people and they're all tuned in.

1477
01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:15.970
And May,
I mean directly tuned in responsible.

1478
01:27:15.971 --> 01:27:19.270
Like they feel like they're a part of what's going on.
But when,

1479
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:23.650
when you really feel it more is when you could see everybody,

1480
01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:28.690
it's like 300 people.
So I think the number,
like when you get above 300 people,

1481
01:27:28.691 --> 01:27:32.830
things get squirrely.
Like you can handle it if the people the right people,

1482
01:27:33.010 --> 01:27:35.890
but most,
most of the time you better off with 300 people.

1483
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:39.970
But what you're essentially doing is you're conducting like a tribal sort of a

1484
01:27:39.971 --> 01:27:44.140
bonding moment.
Like everybody's experiencing the same vibe.
Everybody.
So

1485
01:27:44.170 --> 01:27:47.110
<v 3>well,
you know what Saint Paul,
yeah,
we were playing,</v>

1486
01:27:47.111 --> 01:27:50.800
we had a show last week in St Paul and every once in a while we just get to play

1487
01:27:50.801 --> 01:27:54.220
to a group of about 300 people who is,
you know,

1488
01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:59.050
being seated with our music helps because when,
when we're a duo,

1489
01:27:59.051 --> 01:28:00.940
it's not really rhythmically heavy.

1490
01:28:00.941 --> 01:28:04.600
So you have a seat of group of people and they're just so willing and kind of

1491
01:28:04.601 --> 01:28:09.460
vulnerable to us taking charge and there's this energy that goes way beyond what

1492
01:28:09.461 --> 01:28:12.100
we can do.
And all of a sudden,
you know,
it's a,
it's a,

1493
01:28:12.101 --> 01:28:14.980
it's a show between us and them and they're,
they're putting in more than we are,

1494
01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:18.280
you know?
And,
and those experiences,
they,
I don't know,

1495
01:28:18.281 --> 01:28:22.240
they haven't happened as,
as,
as often as we'd like,

1496
01:28:22.241 --> 01:28:25.290
but they seem to be happening more.
And it's an amazing feeling.
It's like it,

1497
01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:27.310
it's kind of a weightlessness when you're performing,

1498
01:28:27.311 --> 01:28:28.630
you don't have to think about it anymore.

1499
01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:31.260
<v 0>Well,
we all need the audience.
You know,</v>

1500
01:28:31.261 --> 01:28:36.160
the audience is for you and for comedians.
I think you,

1501
01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:40.590
we need it in a,
in a different way,
but it's similarly important.
You know,

1502
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:43.350
what an audience is there to like,

1503
01:28:43.351 --> 01:28:47.130
let you know that they're tuning in to all this work that you've done.

1504
01:28:47.131 --> 01:28:49.050
They get all the things that you've said.
They,

1505
01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:54.330
they understand all the stuff that you've labored on and,
and,
and,
and,

1506
01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:58.040
and formed into these rhythmic sort of,
uh,

1507
01:28:59.370 --> 01:29:02.160
these pieces,
you know,
which is the song really is.

1508
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:05.970
<v 1>Yeah.
And W for Comedians,
it's not just like we,</v>

1509
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:10.110
it's fucking a hundred percent mandatory.
You can't even write it without them.

1510
01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.810
Like the writing changes when you're around them.

1511
01:29:13.050 --> 01:29:15.330
When they become a part of it and their laughter,

1512
01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:19.120
each crowd you perform in front of help shape the material,

1513
01:29:19.121 --> 01:29:23.700
it changes in material from week to week,
you know,
without,

1514
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:25.650
without those other people,
without the other,

1515
01:29:25.651 --> 01:29:30.420
the involvement of the other people.
It really doesn't even exist.
It's weird.

1516
01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.280
I never think about this show,

1517
01:29:32.281 --> 01:29:35.150
but I was just thinking about American idol when we're talking about this.

1518
01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:37.860
The culture mattered every day.
You fucking liar.

1519
01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:44.520
You were saying about this show.
It's to never,
I'm,
I'm over the hill man.

1520
01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:44.821
No,

1521
01:29:44.821 --> 01:29:48.210
but I think that it's like a competition culture and I think that fucks it up.

1522
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.910
Yeah.
It fucks it up a lot.
It helps the people that make it,

1523
01:29:50.911 --> 01:29:54.510
but it doesn't because then the fucking money just lines up.

1524
01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.870
What's that dude's names?
Pockets.
What's his name?
Simon.
Simon.

1525
01:29:58.090 --> 01:30:02.830
Simon is in the fucking,
but he's in a giant mansion top of the hill

1526
01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:07.700
<v 2>about this before on the podcast.
But it's,
it's important to bring up again.</v>

1527
01:30:07.701 --> 01:30:11.600
And I think,
um,
uh,
things like the American idol,

1528
01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:15.650
a microwave mentality is really toxic to people to,

1529
01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:19.130
to have like this.
Um,
you know,

1530
01:30:20.010 --> 01:30:24.860
in Instagram,
you know,
all of this stuff happening,
you know,
you won this thing.

1531
01:30:24.861 --> 01:30:27.530
It's like you won the lottery.
The lottery is,
you know,

1532
01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:32.240
more often than not a really terrible thing.
And,
you know,

1533
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:36.530
it's,
um,
it's tough,
you know,
being,

1534
01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.900
being a musician and then seeing that we know we've had several,

1535
01:30:38.901 --> 01:30:39.441
it's really funny,

1536
01:30:39.441 --> 01:30:43.230
we've had several invitations to be on these like competitive shows like,

1537
01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.710
and people were like,
we really want you to be a part of it.

1538
01:30:45.711 --> 01:30:50.610
And it always just feels so wrong.
To me.
It always feels like,
um,
you know,
you,

1539
01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:52.730
you lose,
you lose a lot to begin with.

1540
01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:56.900
Like the people that are involved when it take all of your,
you know,

1541
01:30:56.970 --> 01:30:59.660
publishing and stuff like that,
own you in a way.
And that,

1542
01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:02.180
and that does kind of come back to what you were talking about before is like,

1543
01:31:02.181 --> 01:31:05.570
we want you to sound like this and do this.
And saying this and fuck that,

1544
01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:09.260
you know,
but,
but at the same time,
not to talk about us,

1545
01:31:09.261 --> 01:31:13.100
but just the mentality of,
of the princess.

1546
01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:18.380
Like the fairy tale is,
is rough on people.
You know,
I don't,
I don't like it.

1547
01:31:18.650 --> 01:31:19.290
Sorry.

1548
01:31:19.290 --> 01:31:22.410
<v 1>I agree with you 1000%,
but that's not a real number.</v>

1549
01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:28.200
I really do.
I think that a,
I entered a contest once,
uh,

1550
01:31:28.201 --> 01:31:31.500
in Boston,
the WBCN comedy riot.

1551
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:37.150
Those are the only contest to ever entered.
I lost in the finals.
I was like,

1552
01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:42.450
dammit,
no nice guy.
One can't be grudged to the gentleman who won,

1553
01:31:42.451 --> 01:31:47.280
who was a very nice guy.
Um,
but it was just like,
it's the idea of,

1554
01:31:47.281 --> 01:31:50.460
it was so silly.
It's like,
how can he,
I mean,

1555
01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:54.720
I guess you can judge based on what's best for you.
Like what do you,

1556
01:31:54.721 --> 01:31:56.310
what do you find the best?

1557
01:31:56.580 --> 01:32:01.030
But you can't have a music contest where you have a rap band and a country band

1558
01:32:01.031 --> 01:32:05.980
and a rock band and a folk band.
You can't because there's no best,

1559
01:32:06.130 --> 01:32:08.830
there's the best for you.
All right.
If it's me,

1560
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:11.890
it's very likely a rap band is never going to win.
There's a,

1561
01:32:11.891 --> 01:32:15.580
there's a few rappers unless it's like nod or something like that.

1562
01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:20.560
There's a few rappers who really,
who really connect with me,

1563
01:32:20.561 --> 01:32:20.861
you know,

1564
01:32:20.861 --> 01:32:24.520
where I really feel like I appreciate what they're doing as an art form.

1565
01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:29.440
Too much of it is just braggadocious nonsense.
You know hip hop stuff too.

1566
01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:33.100
Cause it's just hard to hear what it's saying.
You

1567
01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:38.770
look at our new record is going to sound like,
I like it.
Go with it.

1568
01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:44.890
But it could be like some DMT word songs.
Well you know a fucking perfect.

1569
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:48.190
Yeah,
exactly.
Love that.

1570
01:32:49.930 --> 01:32:54.540
I love their crazy bitch.
Oh,
I think you're free keys.

1571
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:58.450
Interviews with her because apparently she just rims out everyone in interviews

1572
01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:02.500
here.
Yeah.
That bitch is crazy.
I'll have her on the podcast,
you know,

1573
01:33:02.501 --> 01:33:07.180
tough exterior.
I'll tie that bitch up.
David chose friends with her.
Perfect.

1574
01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:10.150
Let's do it and just make it happen.
Those guys trying to shirt for me.

1575
01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:14.910
I got a shirt,
a t shirt from them.
They're bad ass.
I love that word.

1576
01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.900
Coachella.
Before we played.
Yeah,
they're,
they're gangster.

1577
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.140
They're pretty bad ass.
But I mean,

1578
01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:24.590
unless it's something like really unique like that,

1579
01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:27.970
it's hard for me to get into too much rap because it's just not my tune,

1580
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.830
you know,
whatever.
It is not my frequency.

1581
01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:33.850
I'm a like a big fan of the black keys.

1582
01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.110
I'm a big fan of a band.

1583
01:33:35.111 --> 01:33:38.440
I don't know if you guys heard of them to call honey honey and uh,

1584
01:33:38.630 --> 01:33:43.080
they're probably one of my favorites then.
No,
it's not lame.

1585
01:33:43.081 --> 01:33:46.810
But if a lot of your friends are around and they're like football players or

1586
01:33:46.811 --> 01:33:51.220
something like that,
like don't play it in front of all the wind up.
Fuck you.

1587
01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:55.300
Oh,
where are you guys at?
Uh,
in April.

1588
01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:59.650
I would like to offer you something right now.
And he cannot,
he cannot say no.

1589
01:33:59.651 --> 01:34:01.330
I would like to tweet all of your dates.

1590
01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:05.020
Let me know anytime you're on where I'd be more than happy.

1591
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:08.950
I do with everybody I do with everybody and no one gets annoyed.

1592
01:34:08.951 --> 01:34:12.850
Everybody is happy about it because they find out you here

1593
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:19.540
don't get annoyed.
I
barely drink.

1594
01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:22.840
I appreciate that.
You guys get feel weird,

1595
01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:25.660
but it's no work at all for me and uh,

1596
01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:29.470
I would probably feel weird if I was asking you so,
uh,

1597
01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:33.490
so don't feel weird.
How about we make a deal?

1598
01:34:33.970 --> 01:34:37.190
You fucking tweet from me too.
All right.
Done.
You.

1599
01:34:38.290 --> 01:34:41.260
Let's make it happen.
Okay.
We made an agreement.
So all of your dates,

1600
01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:45.070
anytime you're anywhere,
every time you are anywhere.

1601
01:34:45.071 --> 01:34:48.820
Unless I'm hunting in Alaska,
which I will be doing soon,

1602
01:34:48.821 --> 01:34:53.380
I'm going to the Brooks range to fuck up a moose day.
Oh my God,

1603
01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:56.830
I can't.
That is to butcher it.
What happens now?
The whole moment.

1604
01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:02.300
What are you doing man?
I'm doing these days is fucking everyday I do podcasts.

1605
01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:04.700
Then I get home from podcasts.
I shoot bows and arrows.

1606
01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.890
I shot 150 hours yesterday with a 90 pound bow.
I'm not fucking around.

1607
01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:14.000
Fuck yeah,
bitch.
Listen to both.
You guys can come.
You got to sing songs.

1608
01:35:14.001 --> 01:35:18.550
Don't scare away the bears.
They hate our shit.
Well,

1609
01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.220
Steven Rinella,
who's the host of this show that I do called the meat eater.

1610
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:25.940
I've done it show twice and I'm committing to doing it like four times a year.

1611
01:35:25.941 --> 01:35:28.580
We'd go out and hunt.
It's amazing shop.

1612
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:32.160
The guy's a brilliant author and he's incredibly well read and go read it.

1613
01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:37.230
Just a brilliant guy who also happens to be a really bad ass hunter who's really

1614
01:35:38.361 --> 01:35:40.370
into what they call fair chase hunting.

1615
01:35:40.371 --> 01:35:44.000
And the fair chase hunting is he won't hunt.
And if caged environment,

1616
01:35:44.001 --> 01:35:46.970
he's not going to hunt even if it's 10,000 acres.
If there's a fence up,

1617
01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:51.230
he's not hunting there,
you know,
he,
he will hunt wild land,
you know,

1618
01:35:51.231 --> 01:35:55.360
pup mostly public land some,
but it has to be a wild animal,
you know.

1619
01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:58.610
And um,
one of the things that uh,
we're trying to figure out,

1620
01:35:58.611 --> 01:35:59.810
it's something we could do together.

1621
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:03.230
My thought of what we can do together is take people who've never hunted before,

1622
01:36:03.231 --> 01:36:05.770
hunting like honey,
honey,
dude,

1623
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:08.683
we down.

1624
01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:12.890
Would you like to hunt something ugly and like a that people aren't really into

1625
01:36:12.891 --> 01:36:16.760
like pigs first?
Like it's a good one.
I heard that there's some crazy,

1626
01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:20.780
we have friends who live up in and I got a place and these dudes,

1627
01:36:20.781 --> 01:36:24.220
it's like a culture of dudes up there who go out knife hunting boards.

1628
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:27.050
I'm not going to force you guys to do that.
I'm not interested in that either.

1629
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.943
I'm not interested in it.

1630
01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:31.700
But there's a place called to hone ranch and we have a relationship with them

1631
01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:35.060
and they're only an hour and a half north of here is the biggest ranch in

1632
01:36:35.061 --> 01:36:35.894
California,

1633
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:40.790
270,000 acres and they have 50,000 pigs.

1634
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:46.250
It's insane.
They're infested with pigs.
What is our weapon of choice?

1635
01:36:46.251 --> 01:36:48.350
Are we bow and Arrow or no?
No,
no,
no,
no.

1636
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:50.930
It takes a long time to get good with a bow and Arrow,

1637
01:36:50.931 --> 01:36:52.540
like hundreds and hundreds of it.

1638
01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:58.160
I have a bone there all on scheduled for June.
One of the reasons,

1639
01:36:59.110 --> 01:37:02.090
Jude,
if you killed a few fucking wild pig for the shooting star,

1640
01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:04.580
you'd be my new hero.
I wouldn't suck a Dick,

1641
01:37:04.581 --> 01:37:06.770
but I'd let you lay it on my forehead.
Okay.
Tell your picture.

1642
01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:11.240
I'd probably get me there to be honest.
You must train,

1643
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.480
but it's really hard to fucking,

1644
01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:18.470
it's really hard to shoot a pig with a bow and arrow with a throwing knife.

1645
01:37:18.471 --> 01:37:22.460
It's virtually impossible with a star.
Goddammit,
you're talking to fantasy,

1646
01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:26.600
but with a rifle we can get the job done with a rifle.
It's not hard at all.

1647
01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:27.680
We've shot some rifles.

1648
01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:32.000
You need a really good hunting rifle and a good guide.

1649
01:37:32.001 --> 01:37:34.640
But this place to hone ranch is,
like I said,

1650
01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:38.120
an hour and a half north of La and it's enormous and it's all wild.

1651
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:39.500
There's no fences.

1652
01:37:39.501 --> 01:37:43.160
It's just a huge piece of property that these animals congregate on.
No,

1653
01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:47.270
during the day it's illegal to hunt at night and hard to see.
Awesome.

1654
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:52.580
Well you can use in Texas in Texas.
They do.
That's crazy.

1655
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:55.350
I've never actually hunted.
I've been thinking about it though,

1656
01:37:55.351 --> 01:37:59.550
honestly because I started eating meat again and I just realized like if I'm

1657
01:37:59.551 --> 01:38:03.270
willing to take this shit shrink wrapped from a freezer and a store,

1658
01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:06.450
I need to be okay with killing it.
Well,
why we speak my,

1659
01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:11.530
I have a ham that's brining that I shot a couple of months ago.
I shot a pig

1660
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:17.460
to hone ranch.
I shot that deer to that,
that head right in front of you.
This,

1661
01:38:17.461 --> 01:38:20.750
this beautiful.
It was,
it put that on my wall.

1662
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.920
It was slightly more beautiful when was wandering around.

1663
01:38:22.921 --> 01:38:27.860
But way more delicious efforts.
Boned out.
What does your bleach,
no,

1664
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:30.840
I brought it to a guy who does that professionally and uh,

1665
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:33.300
they take the brains out and bleach it down.

1666
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:37.710
You don't want to keep some stinky brains.
You know how they do it?

1667
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:42.940
They use a type of a bug that they use to clean off,
um,

1668
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:45.330
cadaver bones.
It's called a super warm,

1669
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:49.170
I know about this because we actually a fed it to people on fear factor,

1670
01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:54.330
know that it's fucked up.
It's pretty dope.
It takes a while to,

1671
01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:55.530
they leave the,
uh,

1672
01:38:55.531 --> 01:38:59.100
the skull with the super worms for quite a while and they just go to work and

1673
01:38:59.101 --> 01:39:03.690
they chew off every single ounce of flesh.
He take the,

1674
01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:07.980
the skull,
you put it into,
I don't know what you do.
It takes a few weeks.

1675
01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:11.760
The worms eat.
No,
but I mean,
so then they have this new move onto the next call.

1676
01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.430
Then the next guy got a fucking,

1677
01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:19.440
just goes from cadaver to cadaver.
Well,
there's this thing that they do,

1678
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:23.580
um,
where you can get a head mounted after you shoot a deer,

1679
01:39:23.610 --> 01:39:24.540
like a trophy.

1680
01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:29.430
You can get it mounted and they take it and they put like glass eyes in it and

1681
01:39:29.431 --> 01:39:34.200
they leave the skin on and they do a taxidermy thing,
which is a little odd.

1682
01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:39.450
You know,
he shot this guy,
this guy.
Which one?

1683
01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:41.910
The page.
Oh,
the Predator.

1684
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.440
That's a friend of mine's a buddy.
I got him tickets for the UFC.

1685
01:39:46.441 --> 01:39:50.010
I wish I could remember his name off the top of my head.
I want to say Steve.

1686
01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:53.730
He's a,
a special effects guy.
And the,
uh,
the guy,
uh,

1687
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:58.200
Pat Mcgee did the American Werewolf who's a,
that's out in the

1688
01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:05.010
front area.
You're going to be going up against those in Alaska.
No.

1689
01:40:05.130 --> 01:40:08.930
You know what?
Uh,
this,
this,
uh,
show mediator.

1690
01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:11.400
They know exactly what they're doing.
They know where to go.

1691
01:40:11.410 --> 01:40:13.140
You're always going to deal with bears,

1692
01:40:13.141 --> 01:40:17.010
but you just have to make sure that you scare him off and you keep an eye on
him.

1693
01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:19.920
And there's a lot of guys with guns and you don't want to hurt the bears,

1694
01:40:20.190 --> 01:40:23.520
but you know what the bear is stealing your Caribou.
You gotta be real careful.

1695
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:24.610
Well,

1696
01:40:24.610 --> 01:40:29.100
it's not even fucking what does that 20 worst pieces of terrible taxidermy.

1697
01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.330
There's like cross site

1698
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.400
that Puma came near me.
Hello?
Hey.
Hey Man.
You know where the bus stop is?

1699
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:46.230
Yeah,
that is weird.
That is weird.

1700
01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.640
I'll mix them together.
Suzanne,
when you get back,
we're going to sing some songs.

1701
01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:57.370
No,
that's a guy who,
who shot the front legs out of the fucking missile.

1702
01:41:00.130 --> 01:41:05.050
Weird.
You know,

1703
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:06.190
I mean,
it's a weird thing.

1704
01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:09.220
I would never shoot an animal just to make a trophy out of it and never in a

1705
01:41:09.221 --> 01:41:10.054
million years.

1706
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:15.270
But if I found an animal in my backyard and it was dangerous and I shot it and

1707
01:41:15.971 --> 01:41:18.970
they said,
do you want to make a trophy out of it and be like,
fuck yeah,

1708
01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:23.920
all about context.
That's a tone.
That wolf is ridiculous.

1709
01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:29.680
Do you know that there's a concern right now that wolves might eventually start

1710
01:41:29.681 --> 01:41:33.490
to,
uh,
reemerge in Paris?
I have not heard that.

1711
01:41:33.491 --> 01:41:36.340
They're starting to make their way closer and closer towards Paris and they're,

1712
01:41:36.341 --> 01:41:40.150
and they're really worried right now that there might be a moment in the

1713
01:41:40.151 --> 01:41:43.570
somewhat near future when wolves once again are in Paris.

1714
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:48.190
Well,
that's the crazy thing,
man.
They kill people.

1715
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:52.180
Wolves killed like 40 people in Paris in the 14 hundreds.

1716
01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:57.010
There's a,
yeah,
it's like a famous incident where I'll pull it up right now,

1717
01:41:57.011 --> 01:42:00.310
the wolves of Paris.
There's a few books about it.
Awesome.
Yeah,

1718
01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:02.560
it's fucking scary as shit.
The American,
I mean,

1719
01:42:02.561 --> 01:42:05.460
is that where American Werewolf from Paris comes from?
No,

1720
01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:10.530
that's because the American Werewolf in London needed to seek cover.
Hi God.

1721
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:16.240
That's a beautiful little cutie pie.
And I love wolves.
People are like,
Oh,

1722
01:42:16.241 --> 01:42:20.470
you're fucking,
you want to kill all the wolves?
I don't.
I love wolves.

1723
01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:23.980
Don't get me wrong.
I love wolves out there being all Wolfie.

1724
01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:28.870
My problem is when wolves come anywhere near people I care about,

1725
01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:32.290
I want them dead.
I want that family.

1726
01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.250
Dad was the shirtless dude.
Wolves in pairs.

1727
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:39.340
The other guys got a little tiny little coyote dick,

1728
01:42:39.341 --> 01:42:44.020
he's trying to pass off as a lone
wolves of Paris.

1729
01:42:44.021 --> 01:42:48.160
Is that as band or his book?
I think it's a,
it's a book.

1730
01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:52.060
It's a sequel to 50 shades of purple that comes out after 50 shades of grey.

1731
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:55.540
They run out of shit to talk about with color.
So they go with animals.

1732
01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:59.200
Woves a Paris.
When I was in Paris,
I had a,

1733
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:02.740
he had a wolf ambulate on he ball gag me.

1734
01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.670
Yeah,
so we,

1735
01:43:06.671 --> 01:43:11.671
you missed a lot in Paris in 1450 40 human beings were killed by wolves.

1736
01:43:13.570 --> 01:43:17.350
Yeah.
Well we were talking about on wolves.
No regular walls.

1737
01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:19.510
There's a,
an issue.

1738
01:43:19.511 --> 01:43:23.080
Right now we're wolves are getting closer and closer to Paris and they're

1739
01:43:23.081 --> 01:43:26.470
worried about wolves reemerging in Paris because they have very strict

1740
01:43:26.471 --> 01:43:29.920
environmental.
Yes,
they have.
Yeah.

1741
01:43:29.921 --> 01:43:33.040
They have very strict environmental rules.

1742
01:43:33.850 --> 01:43:38.780
As far as a animals you're allowed to kill and not kill.
And the wolves,
wolves,

1743
01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:42.130
like the regular car,
timber wolves are,
well,

1744
01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:45.240
there's really only one kind of wolf.
Um,

1745
01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:48.850
like I got explain that by,
uh,
this Guy Steve Rinella.

1746
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.240
I do this hunting show with like pigs.
There's only one kind of pig.

1747
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:57.470
Like when you talk about wild pigs,
there is literally only one type of pig.

1748
01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:00.460
Wild or domestic is the same thing.
It's called [inaudible].

1749
01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:05.450
That's the type of animal.
Okay.
I didn't know that.
But Wolves,

1750
01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:08.570
same thing.
There's just wolves,
gray wolf,
timber,
Wolf.

1751
01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:11.680
It's essentially like the difference between,
you know,

1752
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:14.330
human beings as human beings that live in Jamaica,

1753
01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:18.350
that human beings that live in Tennessee,
but they're just human beings.

1754
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:20.960
That's it.
Exactly.
They have bigger decks.

1755
01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:24.500
But wolves.
Uh,

1756
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:28.910
that was one of the issues with wolves that are brought in from Canada because

1757
01:44:28.911 --> 01:44:32.990
they brought in wolves to Canada and they repopulated a Yellowstone.

1758
01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:37.400
Really?
Yeah.
And a lot of other places.
Do we play that Jamie?
We did play that.

1759
01:44:37.401 --> 01:44:40.250
Wolves change rivers.
Do we play that?
Yeah,
we did.

1760
01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:43.580
There's a great documentary for those who have not seen it.

1761
01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:48.610
It's called a wolves changed the course of rivers in Yellowstone and it's,

1762
01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.560
it's amazing.
And uh,

1763
01:44:51.650 --> 01:44:56.650
it's fascinating how just the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone national

1764
01:44:57.771 --> 01:45:02.000
park has actually changed the way the rivers flow.
It's fucking incredible shit.

1765
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:06.740
I'm not anti,
well,
I'm not anti anything.
I am not anti.
I talked shit.

1766
01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:07.580
Okay.

1767
01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:11.030
I don't mean what I say and people need to understand that there's a lot of the

1768
01:45:11.031 --> 01:45:15.890
shit I'm not,
I,
I hope they die in a fire.
My spirit animal,

1769
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:19.040
conti,
Conti,
little shitty dogs that want to eat babies.

1770
01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:21.470
You say that unless you were alone with a wolf,

1771
01:45:23.370 --> 01:45:27.320
you're like Chuck Norris and Lone Wolf.
Mcquade

1772
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:33.500
an affinity for like birds of prey and wolves and things like that.

1773
01:45:33.501 --> 01:45:34.910
Have you ever met an eagle in the wild?

1774
01:45:35.010 --> 01:45:39.690
<v 5>No,
but I fucking like,
I would freak out.
I love you so much.</v>

1775
01:45:39.710 --> 01:45:43.960
What's so funny?
Have you ever met an eagle and go,
wow,
I can't wait.

1776
01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:47.940
[inaudible] you're going to dance with the devil in the Pale moonlight.

1777
01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:54.270
An Eagle in the wild is very different than an eagle that's in a zoo.

1778
01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:56.090
That's what I'm saying.
I've never seen a negro

1779
01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:04.000
growing up in Minnesota.
Eagles and Minnesota.

1780
01:46:04.110 --> 01:46:05.960
Are you kidding me?
They call themselves

1781
01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.080
gang members in fucking Irvine.

1782
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:19.280
I was in Alaska with Ari Shaffir.
We went,
we went salmon fishing.
Oh,
a bunch

1783
01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:22.740
<v 1>of eagles.
It was fucking freaky.
Yeah.</v>

1784
01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.830
Did you call any to your arm?
Your outstretched arm?
Oh,

1785
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:30.100
there's none of that going on,
dude.
They'll eat your face.
They don't.

1786
01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:34.970
One thing that looking at you is like,
can I carry this guy away?
Too Big?

1787
01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:38.900
If you were a baby,
her fucking eat your asshole

1788
01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:45.140
eagles are essentially dinosaurs that made it.
That's all they are.

1789
01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:49.010
What do you think about the act of this riff that purchased by Facebook?

1790
01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:52.410
That great,
amazing.
I'm very fucking excited about that actually.

1791
01:46:52.770 --> 01:46:56.850
I'm just excited if there's more financial resources behind the process of

1792
01:46:56.851 --> 01:47:01.730
Oculus rift or the,
uh,
the,
uh,
rather,
not the proxy Sassy,
um,
technology.
Yeah.

1793
01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:06.450
I just hope I that if Facebook seems cool,
it's like,
you know,

1794
01:47:06.451 --> 01:47:10.710
one of the things that we were talking about recently was about that I find very

1795
01:47:10.711 --> 01:47:15.330
encouraging about this new tech money is that these guys,

1796
01:47:15.331 --> 01:47:18.750
whether it's the Google people or the Facebook people,

1797
01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:22.080
they seem ethical.
You know,

1798
01:47:22.081 --> 01:47:25.500
they seem they're making a shitload of money,
but their,

1799
01:47:25.501 --> 01:47:28.610
their intentions seem fairly pure.
Yeah.

1800
01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:30.900
And it's gotten more serious just from this purchase,

1801
01:47:30.901 --> 01:47:33.390
where before it was still kind of like an,
you know,

1802
01:47:33.391 --> 01:47:37.620
not many people knew about it kind of mind.
Now it's,
you know,

1803
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:40.420
everyone's going to know about this and a couple of years.
So I think it's good.

1804
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:42.180
I couldn't agree more.
I couldn't agree more.

1805
01:47:42.181 --> 01:47:46.970
I love that fucking Zuckerberg fucking Weirdo.
Yeah.
I think he's beautiful.
Kim.

1806
01:47:47.010 --> 01:47:50.580
Him a kiss right in the mouth is in the room.
You have a Facebook page?
Yeah,
I do.

1807
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:54.340
I have a,
I'm a fan page.
I can't respond to emails,

1808
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:58.830
so please don't,
I can't get,
I just can't get into the hat to you.

1809
01:47:58.831 --> 01:48:02.350
I'm not saying that to you saying to the other vps.
Don't Ben Tardy.

1810
01:48:02.351 --> 01:48:05.620
You fucking email me dude.
Chill.
What are you doing?
No.
Shut up.
You're hunting.

1811
01:48:05.730 --> 01:48:10.290
No Way.
It's impossible.
Let me show you my knife.
Uh,
is that a euphemism

1812
01:48:13.530 --> 01:48:16.440
that was showing you my blades show you,
man.
You Metaphor.
Why?

1813
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:18.420
It's shaped like an elephant's trunk.

1814
01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:25.310
It's Dell,
but it's look,
cut your soul.
Effective.

1815
01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:30.060
Vaguely effective.
What are you guys gonna play?
Oh,
sorry.

1816
01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:33.000
We can play a song called big man.
My good friends.

1817
01:48:33.001 --> 01:48:35.490
The only band I've ever worked with ever.
In real life.

1818
01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:37.080
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1819
01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.700
<v 1>What are you gonna play?
Big Man.</v>

1820
01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:44.640
That's a song we're going to play real life.
Well,
the only with us,
Joe,

1821
01:48:44.641 --> 01:48:47.030
when you put some jobs,
I feel like you could get some drums.

1822
01:48:47.250 --> 01:48:51.780
I want to just watch.
Do too many things.
Play drums.

1823
01:48:51.850 --> 01:48:55.480
Supergroup
been skin flicks.

1824
01:48:58.230 --> 01:49:03.150
The penis obvious here.
This.

1825
01:49:03.151 --> 01:49:08.060
Okay guys hit it.
Let it go.
Hey,

1826
01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:09.293
how's that work?

1827
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:39.080
Oh Hey.

1828
01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:43.610
When the pig man,

1829
01:49:45.690 --> 01:49:48.080
they spill Bucky.

1830
01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:57.060
<v 11>Yay</v>

1831
01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:02.813
<v 10>Bell.</v>

1832
01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:07.430
<v 9>No</v>

1833
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:16.050
<v 10>Man,
baby,
Eh,</v>

1834
01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:18.050
low tech,

1835
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.980
<v 11>eh.</v>

1836
01:50:35.610 --> 01:50:36.820
<v 10>Oh Man.</v>

1837
01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:38.133
<v 11>Ooh.</v>

1838
01:50:39.130 --> 01:50:40.470
<v 10>And they came.</v>

1839
01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:44.293
<v 9>Wow.</v>

1840
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:55.630
<v 10>Hey Jane,
calm.</v>

1841
01:50:55.930 --> 01:50:58.460
<v 9>Hey</v>

1842
01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.770
<v 10>damn man.</v>

1843
01:51:55.730 --> 01:51:58.980
You can try head off.
They be

1844
01:52:01.630 --> 01:52:05.530
part of some Greek plan.

1845
01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:08.240
Maybe no one should ever,

1846
01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:13.640
ever down in La.

1847
01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:16.213
<v 11>Oh</v>

1848
01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:24.150
<v 10>bones.
Berry
bones.</v>

1849
01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:26.090
Barry Ede.

1850
01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:27.673
<v 11>Okay,</v>

1851
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:31.710
<v 9>Shay
too,</v>

1852
01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:35.260
<v 10>please.
And he</v>

1853
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:43.790
was
it.

1854
01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:57.430
Damn man.
Damn the check.

1855
01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.420
<v 5>Oh,
awesome.</v>

1856
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:29.570
<v 0>That's a beautiful song.
Shit.
Nice mine.</v>

1857
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:33.120
Is that one of the ones going to be in the new special?
That's the idea.

1858
01:53:33.121 --> 01:53:35.040
That's what you're shooting for.
You guys have a name

1859
01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:39.940
<v 5>for the record?
No,
no,
not yet.</v>

1860
01:53:39.941 --> 01:53:44.520
But we're open to ideas,
but you know,
can I be honest?
We're really,
um,

1861
01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:48.310
we're working with a new dude this weekend.
That's why we're here.

1862
01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:50.740
And a new producer.
Yeah.
I'm really,

1863
01:53:50.741 --> 01:53:54.930
really honored and excited that he really wants to work with us and it's kind of

1864
01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:00.190
sort of like a trial run,
so fingers crossed.
He's our guy.
Awesome.
Yeah,

1865
01:54:00.610 --> 01:54:02.290
but it's,
it's,
it's fucking hard.

1866
01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.620
<v 0>Listen,
I know.
It is.
Um,
you know,
it's,
it's easy for me to say,
I know it's hard,</v>

1867
01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:09.690
you know,
but I've watched you guys,
you know,
I know,

1868
01:54:10.110 --> 01:54:14.070
I at least know from observing your struggle and I have friends that are

1869
01:54:14.071 --> 01:54:17.250
musicians,
could have friends,
you know,

1870
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:21.540
like Everlast who's made it and,
and friends who are still struggling.

1871
01:54:21.570 --> 01:54:24.960
And I know it's a crazy business.
It ain't easy,
you know,

1872
01:54:24.961 --> 01:54:29.880
but you guys are talented as fuck.
Now,
buy your shit all day.
You know,

1873
01:54:29.881 --> 01:54:33.060
I'm honored to be friends with you guys,
but if I wasn't friends with the guys,

1874
01:54:33.061 --> 01:54:35.760
I would buy the fucking shit out of your music.
I love it.

1875
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:38.880
I became a fan when I saw that,
uh,

1876
01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:43.900
Angel of Death Acoustic version that you guys did on a roof somewhere here in

1877
01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:46.360
la.
Yeah,
back in the days.
Yeah.

1878
01:54:46.770 --> 01:54:51.450
It's so cool that you can find someone like that.
I can see you guys.

1879
01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:56.280
Yeah.
And then all of a sudden we're hanging.
We're friends.
It's awesome.

1880
01:54:56.281 --> 01:54:59.640
We live in awesome times,
man.
It's just beautiful.
It's beautiful there.

1881
01:54:59.850 --> 01:55:04.440
And there was no middleman.
We all made that happen together,
you know,
just great.

1882
01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:05.790
It's fucking incredible.

1883
01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:08.540
<v 5>That's what's been happening more and more too,</v>

1884
01:55:08.541 --> 01:55:12.110
is being able to just talk to the people who are supporting us.
Why?

1885
01:55:12.430 --> 01:55:16.610
<v 0>Oh honey,
honey podcast.
Why don't you guys start doing a podcast?
Fuck yeah.</v>

1886
01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:17.860
That's a year

1887
01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:22.750
<v 5>talking to the mic.
Yeah.
Especially when you guys are on the road.
You could just,</v>

1888
01:55:22.810 --> 01:55:27.190
yeah,
to Mike's and you know,
doing a hotel room or like Suzanne,

1889
01:55:27.191 --> 01:55:29.700
I saw that little thing you did.
We interview in the cap.

1890
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:36.320
I saw.
Yeah,
I saw you in the cat.

1891
01:55:36.690 --> 01:55:40.750
That was before we ever met some ridiculous shit.
We used to do some fun stuff.

1892
01:55:40.751 --> 01:55:44.130
We should fucking do that again before we ever met.
I saw that

1893
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:47.490
<v 0>and that was like,
these are like some really genuine people.
I'm like,</v>

1894
01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:51.360
you guys are cool because I think there's a weird thing that everyone does,

1895
01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:52.770
including me who's met,

1896
01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:55.710
I've met a lot of people that are on television or a lot of people that are

1897
01:55:56.730 --> 01:56:00.830
artists or musicians or actors or comedians or whatever.

1898
01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:02.880
It meant a lot of people with varied responses.

1899
01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:04.890
So it's like sometimes you meet him and know like you,

1900
01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:07.860
like you bummed out that he met him and then sometimes you meet him and you're

1901
01:56:07.861 --> 01:56:08.060
like,

1902
01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:10.600
<v 2>wow,
these people are that way too.
Pretty fucking bad ass.</v>

1903
01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:13.670
I get kind of squeamish when there's somebody,
I really,
really like it.

1904
01:56:13.671 --> 01:56:16.870
I know I'm going to meet them.
Like with Cheryl,
I was like,
Oh God,

1905
01:56:16.871 --> 01:56:21.500
like please drink.
Nice.
Fucking awesome.
Yeah.
And sometimes you just have to like,

1906
01:56:23.150 --> 01:56:26.010
yeah,
you have to sort of just accept like sometimes the,

1907
01:56:26.011 --> 01:56:27.710
the musicians or actors or whatever,

1908
01:56:27.711 --> 01:56:30.230
you love their work and then they turn out to be a Douche.

1909
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:33.830
You could still love their work.
It's just,
you know,
you have to separate it,

1910
01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:34.700
you know?

1911
01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:38.270
<v 0>Yeah.
And it's not saying that they have to be that way either.
It's just,</v>

1912
01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:39.350
it's also saying that

1913
01:56:40.970 --> 01:56:43.850
if you meet a guy and they're just extra or a girl and they're just

1914
01:56:43.851 --> 01:56:46.730
extraordinarily talented but incredibly troubled,

1915
01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:50.240
you've got to realize that this is like a balance going on with human beings.

1916
01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:54.020
Yeah.
There's this weird balance and it doesn't always work

1917
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:57.780
<v 2>gout.
Right.
You know what's interesting though,
I think it's shifting a lot more.</v>

1918
01:56:57.781 --> 01:56:57.991
You know,

1919
01:56:57.991 --> 01:57:01.650
you get people like Jimmy Fallon who are these like I love Jimmy Fallon.

1920
01:57:01.651 --> 01:57:06.480
I think he's a sweetie.
He's creating this realm of like joy,
comedy.

1921
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:10.110
Um,
Bro,
like brilliant shit.
Yeah.
You know,
and,

1922
01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:13.620
and like he's got this like great childhood.
Like this is great family.

1923
01:57:13.621 --> 01:57:18.420
He loves like,
he seems like a sweet guy too.
Yeah.
There's room for that.

1924
01:57:18.421 --> 01:57:21.750
You don't,
you don't have to be fucked up to,
to be an artist anymore,
you know?

1925
01:57:22.050 --> 01:57:22.830
And you never really do.

1926
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:26.050
<v 0>Yeah.
He called Jimmy Fallon and artists.
You got to slow the fucking board style.</v>

1927
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:31.920
Of course.
He's an artist,
a better Neil young impression.
Jimmy Fallon.

1928
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:34.230
He also thinks that he's probably,

1929
01:57:34.290 --> 01:57:38.250
I mean it's probably one of the best talk show hosts ever.
He really cares.

1930
01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:42.330
You can just tell he's a genuine guy.
Like there's the,
this coming off of him.

1931
01:57:42.331 --> 01:57:46.350
Like he seems like a genuinely nice guy.
And so as Jimmy Kimmel,
by the way,

1932
01:57:46.590 --> 01:57:51.150
Jimmy Kimmel's a genuinely nice guy.
He's a sweetheart.
Like,
you know,
hurt.

1933
01:57:51.151 --> 01:57:54.840
Somebody said something about Jimmy Kimmel was a,
he was a Dick to rob Ford.

1934
01:57:55.290 --> 01:57:57.030
You know,
like,
okay,
come on man.

1935
01:57:57.031 --> 01:58:00.510
The guy's fucking the Toronto mayor and he smokes crack.

1936
01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:04.980
Like if you only have seven minutes with that guy.
I'm sorry,

1937
01:58:04.981 --> 01:58:06.810
but we got to get down to pistis.
Yeah.

1938
01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:10.080
I can't allow you to fucking talk about your favorite football team for six

1939
01:58:10.081 --> 01:58:13.210
minutes and then,
Hey,
what about that crack?
You know,

1940
01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:16.440
we gotta get busy right away and if it looks like I'm being a Dick,

1941
01:58:16.441 --> 01:58:21.380
I'm so sorry but you smoked crack.
He'll fucking mayor of Toronto Sun.

1942
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.931
Oh,
come on.

1943
01:58:21.931 --> 01:58:26.190
You got to give up a certain amount of decorum when you're addressing such

1944
01:58:26.191 --> 01:58:29.310
issues.
Jimmy Kimmel where he interviewed Jay Leno after the,

1945
01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:35.610
well,
you know what man?
Jimmy Kimmel let Jay Leno know what the fuck is up.

1946
01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:36.473
That's what he did.
Yes.

1947
01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:39.230
<v 2>Setting to hand it to somebody who's going to like have the balls to go to real</v>

1948
01:58:39.231 --> 01:58:40.064
town.
You know

1949
01:58:40.190 --> 01:58:41.740
<v 1>my only problem that is it.</v>

1950
01:58:41.741 --> 01:58:46.741
Jay Leno was also being sort of in in a sense enabled or thrust into that

1951
01:58:48.191 --> 01:58:50.770
situation by the network because the network,

1952
01:58:50.771 --> 01:58:55.030
why would the network change everything around if they didn't want to?

1953
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:58.480
I mean like why are you getting upset?
Like if,
if the cone,

1954
01:58:58.481 --> 01:59:01.960
if Conan O'brien went into that position and then all sudden the fucking show

1955
01:59:01.961 --> 01:59:06.310
exploded and became this monster mega hit that everybody thought it would be,

1956
01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:10.000
then there would be no discussion with Jay Leno to go back and take over the

1957
01:59:10.001 --> 01:59:10.481
tonight show.

1958
01:59:10.481 --> 01:59:14.300
So then there'd be no discussion about falling back on his word or like,

1959
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:16.660
you know,
what did you say it?
So it was all weird.

1960
01:59:16.661 --> 01:59:20.510
It was a in a little bit of a way.
It's weird that's,
it's,

1961
01:59:21.410 --> 01:59:21.980
it's the,

1962
01:59:21.980 --> 01:59:26.740
when you're dealing with those fucking weird sort of talk show hosts situations,

1963
01:59:26.741 --> 01:59:30.520
you know,
you're dealing with those weird,
like the battle between,
you know,

1964
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:33.700
this guy and that guy and they're going to,
who's the best?

1965
01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:38.170
And like that these sat talkshow war though the talk show war show with

1966
01:59:38.171 --> 01:59:41.890
Letterman and Jay Leno where it shows how Letterman and Jay Leno were like

1967
01:59:41.891 --> 01:59:46.210
battling with each other and let them and always wanted to do tonight show late

1968
01:59:46.210 --> 01:59:47.170
night.
What was it called?
Late night,

1969
01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:52.220
it was called late night and Jay Jay Leno hid in the closet and heard these NBC

1970
01:59:52.331 --> 01:59:56.230
executives plotting against him while he was in the closet.
Gay.
Yeah.

1971
01:59:56.231 --> 02:00:00.280
So like he knew like what to say to them.
He knew how to fuck with them.

1972
02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:03.390
Like to let them know.
So they did like a bug sweep of the room,

1973
02:00:03.410 --> 02:00:07.780
try to find the bug.
He was hiding in the closet.
Closets.
Hilarious.
Really.

1974
02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:12.800
But it just didn't seem like that's the right way to do it.
You know?
And I,

1975
02:00:12.810 --> 02:00:17.230
I liked that what Jimmy Kimmel did was like stand up for another talk show host.

1976
02:00:17.590 --> 02:00:19.610
He like,
he say this.
Yeah.

1977
02:00:19.950 --> 02:00:22.480
Thinking so I just like it when that happens with public.

1978
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:25.690
I just loved that he decided that it was just something that he wanted to do.

1979
02:00:25.691 --> 02:00:27.610
I love that.
You know,
he's so,

1980
02:00:27.630 --> 02:00:32.630
it's so strongly like in support of Conan that he decided to like show

1981
02:00:32.981 --> 02:00:37.780
solidarity and in his interview with Jay Leno do the word genuine a bunch of

1982
02:00:37.781 --> 02:00:40.640
times fucking nucleus of,

1983
02:00:40.641 --> 02:00:43.660
of all of this stuff like of the podcasts of your genuine conversations and

1984
02:00:43.661 --> 02:00:47.410
you're genuine,
you know,
messages and stuff like that.

1985
02:00:47.411 --> 02:00:51.010
Like there's a lot of interesting things happening like Jimmy Fallon,

1986
02:00:51.011 --> 02:00:55.060
Jimmy Kimmel.
Yeah.
You get somebody who's not afraid to speak the truth.
That's,

1987
02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:59.170
that's really powerful shit.
Well,
Jimmy,
yeah,
Jimmy,
you know Jimmy cow,

1988
02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:02.730
both of them.
Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel Bolt.
I think they get the,

1989
02:01:02.731 --> 02:01:04.690
you have the sense that they like it themselves.

1990
02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:09.220
Like they're happy with who they are.
They're not,
they're not dissatisfied.

1991
02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:13.660
Fuck yeah.
Everybody should for sure.
But like Jimmy Kimmel,

1992
02:01:13.661 --> 02:01:15.580
like when I took over the man show with Doug,

1993
02:01:15.581 --> 02:01:19.120
Stan hope like he could have been a total dick about that easily.

1994
02:01:19.121 --> 02:01:22.840
He could have been rude to get made fun of us and it didn't turn out well.

1995
02:01:22.841 --> 02:01:24.130
It turned out to be a disaster.

1996
02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:28.270
I didn't know that he had like a bad relationship with the people that were

1997
02:01:28.271 --> 02:01:32.140
producing it.
They had like real issues,
legal issues,

1998
02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:36.390
like issues over content issues over ownership.
It was like,
oh,

1999
02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:39.510
there was a lot of bullshit that went down.
Apparently.
I don't know the,
the,

2000
02:01:39.511 --> 02:01:40.010
the real

2001
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.630
<v 0>roots behind it,
but I didn't know that.</v>

2002
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:44.870
I thought these guys just didn't want to do it anymore and now we could do it.

2003
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:48.240
And I didn't talk to them about it,
but he was never a dick about it.

2004
02:01:48.270 --> 02:01:51.710
Not even a little bit like,
he's like,
he sent me an email.

2005
02:01:51.711 --> 02:01:55.030
It was very friendly about it.
Like the,
the,
the,

2006
02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:59.000
the possibility to be a Douche bag was there and he would have been right.

2007
02:01:59.450 --> 02:02:02.540
And he chose not to do it.
He would have been right,
but it wasn't,

2008
02:02:02.541 --> 02:02:04.150
he wouldn't even been of Douche bag.

2009
02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:08.500
It was just make it something that it wasn't,
you know,
and I just,
I,

2010
02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:12.380
I've always respected that guy,
but I respected him even more because of that,

2011
02:02:12.381 --> 02:02:15.800
because if I was in his position,
I might make fun of me,
you know,

2012
02:02:15.801 --> 02:02:20.120
I might be shitted on me.
And when I did his show,
he was like super cool,

2013
02:02:20.121 --> 02:02:24.920
like after the fact.
And I like apologize to him for doing a shitty person,

2014
02:02:24.921 --> 02:02:29.240
the man show.
And,
but it was,
there was no animosity.
He's just a good guy.

2015
02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:33.020
And like you can tell that,
that that's somehow or another,

2016
02:02:33.021 --> 02:02:37.340
it gets through the TV,
it gets through the wires,
it reaches you.
You know,

2017
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:39.200
somehow or another,
it gets in there.

2018
02:02:39.590 --> 02:02:42.380
And I don't know how much of that you can fake,
you know,

2019
02:02:42.381 --> 02:02:46.550
you can fake something.
You can fake a Smidgen,

2020
02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:48.470
a smidge here or there,

2021
02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:52.940
but a genuine niceness like the Jimmy Fallon exudes,
damn.

2022
02:02:52.941 --> 02:02:55.550
I don't know if an asshole knows how to do that,
you know,

2023
02:02:55.730 --> 02:02:58.370
I dunno if an asshole knows how to hit that frequency.

2024
02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:01.940
Did you guys see the video of them,
uh,
with,
uh,

2025
02:03:02.170 --> 02:03:05.630
of youtue and Jimmy Fallon on the opening night?
No.

2026
02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:07.341
Oh my God.

2027
02:03:07.341 --> 02:03:12.341
Listen is one of the most transformative moments of my life over the last year

2028
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:16.700
was falling asleep on the couch.
Um,
you know,

2029
02:03:16.701 --> 02:03:18.230
whatever I worked out,

2030
02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:21.860
it had something to eat and I was sitting on the couch and a lot of times I

2031
02:03:21.861 --> 02:03:24.480
watched like a watch,

2032
02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:28.340
like bow hunting shows or watch MMA fights.

2033
02:03:28.370 --> 02:03:32.060
I'm a fucking caveman.
If you came over and looked at my DVR,
you feel like,

2034
02:03:32.061 --> 02:03:35.720
what the fuck is going on here?
I just like what I like.
Okay.

2035
02:03:35.721 --> 02:03:36.830
I'm not judging myself,

2036
02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:42.040
but I fell asleep and I woke up and it was the premiere of the Jimmy Fallon,

2037
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:45.740
a first season,
first episode of the tonight show.

2038
02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:48.650
And as I woke up,

2039
02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:53.780
youtue was singing the acapella version of ordinary love or acoustic version

2040
02:03:54.801 --> 02:03:58.370
rather of ordinary love.
And uh,
Jamie pull it,
pull it up.

2041
02:03:58.670 --> 02:04:03.620
Is that from the frozen sense to you too on,
ha ha.
No,

2042
02:04:04.610 --> 02:04:09.320
listen,
it's a brilliant new song from you too,
but it's not just that.

2043
02:04:09.321 --> 02:04:12.630
It's brilliant.
It's one of those moments where,
um,

2044
02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:17.430
you're watching in Bano,
you're watching like a,

2045
02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:22.190
just a fucking brilliant artists say what you want about that guy,
you know,

2046
02:04:22.191 --> 02:04:27.140
say what you want about his political ties and his charitable causes and his

2047
02:04:27.141 --> 02:04:30.260
sunglasses indoors at night set.
Which one about that guy,

2048
02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:35.800
that guy is a bad motherfucker and whatever it is out there that makes things

2049
02:04:36.231 --> 02:04:37.830
great.
Whatever it is.

2050
02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:42.750
Where are you watching pink singing while she's spiraling around over an

2051
02:04:42.751 --> 02:04:47.460
audience and never losing tune and knowing that it's completely live or whether

2052
02:04:47.461 --> 02:04:52.461
it's bano sitting on that fucking couch and youtube behind him playing and Jimmy

2053
02:04:54.570 --> 02:04:59.570
Fallon is sitting there and will Smith is sitting there and it's so undeniably

2054
02:05:02.251 --> 02:05:03.380
brilliant that I,

2055
02:05:03.381 --> 02:05:08.381
I woke up from a nap sitting on the couch to woke up just in time for them to be

2056
02:05:09.511 --> 02:05:14.511
joking around and then go into that song like the universe wanted me to see

2057
02:05:16.201 --> 02:05:19.410
this.
It's fucking perfect.

2058
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:22.110
It's a perfect moment of entertainment.

2059
02:05:22.111 --> 02:05:25.020
It has perfect music.

2060
02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:29.310
It has a perfect response.
It has a perfect moment.

2061
02:05:29.311 --> 02:05:33.450
Being the premiere of Jimmy Fallon's version of the tonight show.

2062
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:38.780
It has perfect being one of the greatest actors ever will Smith is sitting

2063
02:05:39.091 --> 02:05:41.970
there.
I mean a huge fucking movie star.

2064
02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:44.550
I mean people don't think he's a bad ass mother fucker.

2065
02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:47.230
I've never seen him play Muhammad Ali pay.

2066
02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:50.410
The audience is standing up and they're all on their feet screen is,

2067
02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:54.120
there's not a guy with a sign stand up,
stand up,
clap,
applaud.

2068
02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.270
Like if you go to those,
uh,

2069
02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:58.260
like if you go to tonight shows shaping at least the old ones they used to have.

2070
02:05:58.261 --> 02:05:59.670
A guy would tell you when to applaud.

2071
02:05:59.970 --> 02:06:03.000
There's like signs would light up or a guy we're like,
hold up a sign.

2072
02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:07.840
That was some beautiful shit.
Right?
That was amazing.
And I love the roots.

2073
02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:11.970
You got God damn.
I loved them.
I loved,
I loved the band.
I love Jimmy found,

2074
02:06:11.971 --> 02:06:13.230
but I loved that moment.

2075
02:06:13.231 --> 02:06:17.160
That moment is that I'll never forget that the sit in them by myself.

2076
02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:20.880
Gym Shorts,
still sweaty,

2077
02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:24.960
like staring at the TV and it comes on and I'm just like,

2078
02:06:24.961 --> 02:06:28.950
God damn.
I just saw something.
I saw fucking shooting star.

2079
02:06:29.250 --> 02:06:32.340
I saw an asteroid hit,
I saw some freaky shit.
You know?

2080
02:06:32.341 --> 02:06:33.690
I mean that's crazy that an asteroid,

2081
02:06:33.691 --> 02:06:37.920
that's only happened once asteroids hit many times.
You know what I mean?

2082
02:06:37.921 --> 02:06:40.560
How many fucking,
how many times has there been a,

2083
02:06:40.561 --> 02:06:45.561
a big hole slammed into in the earth cause a rock fell from the sky a lot.

2084
02:06:45.811 --> 02:06:47.850
How many times is youtube and on the Jimmy Fallon shy?

2085
02:06:48.210 --> 02:06:52.680
Once you two was on the Jimmy Fallon show,
one time ever.

2086
02:06:53.070 --> 02:06:54.300
And it was the first time.

2087
02:06:54.301 --> 02:06:58.110
There's only one first time ever in the whole universe that youtube is going to

2088
02:06:58.111 --> 02:07:02.820
be on the Jimmy Fallon show.
That's crazy.
Unless you believe in true infinity.

2089
02:07:03.130 --> 02:07:04.680
And then that's the monkey wrench.

2090
02:07:05.130 --> 02:07:09.330
Because true infinity means if there is a you,

2091
02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:13.860
that the world is what you see.

2092
02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:17.010
Everything exists in the exact same form.

2093
02:07:17.970 --> 02:07:20.280
Not only once,
but infinitely.

2094
02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:25.640
So not only are there so many possibilities in the concept of infinity,

2095
02:07:26.130 --> 02:07:29.700
infinity,
meaning infinite possibilities,
we can't even imagine what that means.

2096
02:07:29.970 --> 02:07:33.240
What that means is that everything that you've ever experienced,

2097
02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:37.330
everything that I've ever experienced you looking exactly like you,

2098
02:07:37.331 --> 02:07:39.070
you looking exactly like you,

2099
02:07:39.250 --> 02:07:43.830
you with the same creepy do to try to sneak you into the woods.

2100
02:07:43.890 --> 02:07:45.580
See fucking large mouth bass,

2101
02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:50.940
all that exists in the exact same order and the exact same form in an infinite

2102
02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:55.510
number of times.
So that's how crazy infinity is.

2103
02:07:56.860 --> 02:08:00.400
Wrap your fucking head around that.
Like wait a second.

2104
02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:05.170
So somewhere out there there isn't.
It's not just one right now,
right there.

2105
02:08:05.530 --> 02:08:10.130
Not only that,
youtube is playing,
you're not supposed to you.
It's like you too.

2106
02:08:10.610 --> 02:08:13.090
I say it like Youtube shouldn't say it that way,

2107
02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:18.600
but you right now is probably playing an infinite amount of times all over the

2108
02:08:18.641 --> 02:08:22.360
universe and at the exact same moment how the exact same moment,

2109
02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:25.210
the exact same words are coming out of the exact same mouth.

2110
02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:28.000
That experience everything that has ever happened,

2111
02:08:28.001 --> 02:08:31.930
the idea of that never happening again on the other side of the world for sure.

2112
02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:34.300
Not In the other side of the world,
but the universe,

2113
02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:37.330
the idea of everything that has ever happened,

2114
02:08:37.331 --> 02:08:42.331
being unique in comparison to the creation of the world is so preposterous.

2115
02:08:42.970 --> 02:08:47.970
The idea that we're so fucking important because we are able to saying capable

2116
02:08:48.521 --> 02:08:51.250
of talking,
capable of explaining how important we are,

2117
02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:55.120
but the idea that we are any weirder than a black hole or a son.

2118
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:56.680
I mean that's ridiculous.

2119
02:08:56.830 --> 02:09:01.450
So the idea of human civilization happening in the exact same order everywhere.

2120
02:09:01.451 --> 02:09:04.810
We'd be like,
how is that possible?
But how would it be possible for that?

2121
02:09:04.811 --> 02:09:08.650
It'd be other planets that's way crazier and there's a fucking shit ton of
those,

2122
02:09:08.651 --> 02:09:09.190
dude.

2123
02:09:09.190 --> 02:09:12.610
How would it be possible that there's water in space and there's a lot of it.

2124
02:09:12.730 --> 02:09:15.130
In fact,
that's what you seen when you see a comment stupid.

2125
02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:18.010
You seen water flying off the back of that thing.
That's water.

2126
02:09:18.190 --> 02:09:22.810
That's a fucking earth sized chunk of water flying through space.
Holy Shit.

2127
02:09:23.110 --> 02:09:26.530
You know?
Yeah.
The whole thing is nuts.
It's not nuts that you don't exist.

2128
02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:28.870
Not just once,
but an infinite amount of times.

2129
02:09:28.930 --> 02:09:31.780
That's more likely than a star.

2130
02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:37.450
That's more likely then a black hole that's more likely than just the idea of

2131
02:09:37.451 --> 02:09:42.451
people breathing air and staying alive and fish sucking air out of water and

2132
02:09:42.641 --> 02:09:46.750
some fucking weird contraption called Gills.
That's nuts.

2133
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:47.980
All of it's nuts.

2134
02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:53.250
The fact that it exists the same place in the same form all over the universe

2135
02:09:53.351 --> 02:09:56.740
and an infinite amount of times and exactly the same order that seems like

2136
02:09:56.741 --> 02:09:59.620
likely you think are nuts.
It is.

2137
02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:05.760
That's why when you see a moment like you to on the Jimmy Fallon show singing

2138
02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:06.550
that song,

2139
02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:11.550
like you're witnessing a universal unique moment universal through everything.

2140
02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:16.690
Cause the whole thing like that.
That feeling you get when you get goosebumps,

2141
02:10:16.691 --> 02:10:18.430
the whole universe got goosebumps for that.

2142
02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:20.230
It's interesting that you woke up for it.

2143
02:10:20.231 --> 02:10:23.230
It's like you're in tune with that kind of thing.
No,
I got lucky.

2144
02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:29.990
I drag a lot of coconut water,
drag it,

2145
02:10:29.991 --> 02:10:32.350
some of that delicious sea two oh coconut water.

2146
02:10:32.351 --> 02:10:36.450
I probably had a most likely but maybe not.
I mean I'm,

2147
02:10:36.451 --> 02:10:39.330
I'm not convinced that reality is real.
I'm not convinced you guys review

2148
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:43.490
<v 3>in here.
I don't know.
We're not,
what does youtube,</v>

2149
02:10:43.491 --> 02:10:47.270
Internet stuff is kind of a approximation of it,
isn't it?
Cause now we can,

2150
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:49.760
we just watched it again and we were experiencing it in a different way.

2151
02:10:49.761 --> 02:10:51.470
But that moment has been captured.

2152
02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:55.670
That moment can now repeat itself in our liquor controlled medium.
Right?

2153
02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:59.420
So it's maybe this is us piecing together all these things that you're talking

2154
02:10:59.421 --> 02:11:00.240
about.

2155
02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:04.860
<v 0>I hope if you see it the first time you see it before I said anything about it</v>

2156
02:11:04.861 --> 02:11:09.730
to you,
the last thing I want us to flavor that moment with some my own,
uh,

2157
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:12.570
you know,
that's,
I think that was a,
just a tremendous performance.

2158
02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:14.390
If somebody sees it and you hear me talking about it,

2159
02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:18.150
shut it off and go watch the real thing.
Don't,
you know,

2160
02:11:18.151 --> 02:11:23.100
if somebody puts it on youtube,
they might as well be flavors by Joe.
Oh please.

2161
02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:28.020
Maybe salt would be better salt and a little Kumon.
It's really good for you.

2162
02:11:28.021 --> 02:11:29.250
It's an anti inflammatory.

2163
02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:34.261
But you know,

2164
02:11:34.261 --> 02:11:38.490
do you guys feel those moments on stage and realize that you're tapping into

2165
02:11:38.491 --> 02:11:42.600
something unique when,
when that happens,
when you hit that that,
you know,

2166
02:11:42.601 --> 02:11:44.190
we were talking about and we were playing pool.

2167
02:11:44.370 --> 02:11:47.790
Like sometimes you just hit this weird stride where everything's just fallen

2168
02:11:47.791 --> 02:11:51.390
into place and it feels like automatic and you know that there's that moment.

2169
02:11:51.391 --> 02:11:52.260
I'm sure it's,

2170
02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:57.680
it's gotta be very similar to the moment like that in comedy with,

2171
02:11:58.770 --> 02:12:01.980
with your music.
There's gotta be moments when you guys are just flowing.

2172
02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:06.240
You know,
there was a Disney moment,
I don't want to make me feel uncomfortable,

2173
02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:11.160
but there was a moment where you were on stage and you were saying in and it was

2174
02:12:11.161 --> 02:12:12.600
at the December 21st show,

2175
02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:17.840
the 2012 end of the world show and both Joey Diaz and Eddie Bravo came off stage

2176
02:12:19.590 --> 02:12:24.100
and they both at the same time go,
that's a bad ass bitch.
That's how bad ass.

2177
02:12:24.101 --> 02:12:28.140
But that's a bad ass bitch.
Hey Bravo.
That's a bad ass bitch.
Goddamn.

2178
02:12:28.141 --> 02:12:32.430
Those motherfuckers are talented in it.
He's like,
that's a bad ass bitch.
Got,

2179
02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:36.630
damn,
those guys are talented.
But it was that moment where,
you know,
you,
it was,

2180
02:12:36.690 --> 02:12:40.020
we had never done a show with a musical act before and a lot of my friends were

2181
02:12:40.021 --> 02:12:41.820
skeptical.
They were like,
what are you guys gonna do?

2182
02:12:41.821 --> 02:12:44.730
Like how's that work together?
How's it work?
So I go,

2183
02:12:44.731 --> 02:12:47.610
I think the music probably shouldn't be in the middle cause it would be like,

2184
02:12:47.611 --> 02:12:49.560
it would like interrupt the flow of the comedy.

2185
02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:52.920
But I think it would enhance the beginning of the comedy.
And I think,
you know,

2186
02:12:52.921 --> 02:12:55.140
so we do it this way.
And so when we,

2187
02:12:55.170 --> 02:12:58.110
when we did it and you guys got on stage,

2188
02:12:58.140 --> 02:13:02.040
it was the first time that Eddie had ever seen you guys live.
And uh,
you know,

2189
02:13:02.070 --> 02:13:05.970
he was like,
Holy Shit,
they're good.
Who's like the lyrics,
the fucking,

2190
02:13:05.971 --> 02:13:10.110
the music that,
the choices they made.
He just was just like shaking his head.

2191
02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:14.430
But I'll never forget that moment where they both walked off stage because they

2192
02:13:14.431 --> 02:13:16.980
were both shaking there cause they didn't,
you know,

2193
02:13:16.981 --> 02:13:19.650
Joey was going to go on stage next and do some standup.

2194
02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:24.210
We got so lucky to be involved with this.
Well,
we're lucky too.
We're all lucky.

2195
02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:27.700
We're lucky as shit.
I wouldn't be,
you know,
this,
this,

2196
02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:30.990
the show would be completely uninteresting.
It was just me talking every week.

2197
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:34.820
<v 1>I think you have a lot to say and it's very interesting people,
I heard it,</v>

2198
02:13:34.821 --> 02:13:37.680
they've heard it already by now.
I've run out of Shit to say I repeat myself.

2199
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:43.510
I don't even like listening to me anymore,
but we're,

2200
02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:46.470
we're all lucky for rails,
you know,
including people listening.

2201
02:13:46.471 --> 02:13:48.780
We're all in on this in some fucking weird way.

2202
02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:54.120
We're all in on this thing together.
It's just that,
uh,
folks like you and I,

2203
02:13:54.121 --> 02:13:56.970
and red van and whoever's on the mic out there,
you're,
you're,

2204
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:58.560
you're a part of the lightning rod.

2205
02:13:59.130 --> 02:14:01.500
You're part of the lightening Rod that distributes all this shit.

2206
02:14:01.530 --> 02:14:03.780
But we're all in it together.
We don't even know what we're doing.

2207
02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:06.480
We don't even know why we're doing it.
We just start doing it.

2208
02:14:06.481 --> 02:14:08.760
And then somewhere along the line we realized we love it.

2209
02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:11.270
And the next thing you know,
he sang songs.

2210
02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:15.210
Are you telling jokes or you're fucking making guitars,
whatever it is.
You know,

2211
02:14:15.211 --> 02:14:18.430
you find that thing.
Yeah.
CP,

2212
02:14:18.930 --> 02:14:23.880
you find that weird weird thing out there in the world.
You know,
whatever it is.

2213
02:14:24.090 --> 02:14:27.870
And if you don't,
God damn,
keep looking.
Keep looking.

2214
02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:32.940
Rousing kind like go do some browsing myself up.

2215
02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:36.840
I don't even know if I'm honest
though.
Questions.

2216
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:41.180
All literature.
It's all fiction.
It's coming from the universe.
Um,

2217
02:14:41.650 --> 02:14:42.483
playing on the song.

2218
02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:48.160
<v 3>Yeah,
sure.
I got to like reacclimate myself.
You want to play this on him?</v>

2219
02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:51.600
[inaudible] like recently an uplifting one.
But yeah,

2220
02:14:52.070 --> 02:14:54.560
<v 1>no,
you don't have to clean up questions.
If you want to make the folks cry,</v>

2221
02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:59.720
maybe we'll have a little yin and Yang peaking the high and low whenever you

2222
02:14:59.721 --> 02:15:02.660
want.
I'm going to put some Yang.
Can I make a request?

2223
02:15:03.770 --> 02:15:06.650
We may not be able to fulfill it,
but she can put dare you.
How's that?

2224
02:15:06.651 --> 02:15:10.550
Not Possible.
Um,
will you put you guys play La River?

2225
02:15:13.110 --> 02:15:13.880
<v 3>I mean,

2226
02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:16.160
<v 1>Yeah,

Okay,

Here we go.
Here we go.</v>

2228
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.770
I'm going to try something.

2229
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:23.210
<v 1>That's one of the cool things about music.</v>

2230
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:26.450
You guys can take requests of comedians.
Take requests.

2231
02:15:27.530 --> 02:15:29.850
We can play this in a while.
I really try not to mess it up.

2232
02:15:29.860 --> 02:15:33.590
Let's just Thunderpussy that.
That kind of request is great.
You don't,

2233
02:15:33.630 --> 02:15:34.463
maybe you just play,

2234
02:15:36.710 --> 02:15:39.050
<v 3>okay.
Okay.
What can we do it in?</v>

2235
02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:42.470
All right,

2240
02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:13.920
<v 9>Concrete walls on the ELA.</v>

2241
02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:23.420
Oh,

2242
02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:27.870

2243
02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:30.153

2246
02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:46.553

02:17:01.610 --> 02:17:03.560

2251
02:17:42.890 --> 02:17:44.120

2254
02:18:06.330 --> 02:18:07.740
<v 13>Ah.</v>

2255
02:18:22.330 --> 02:18:23.163
<v 5>Oh Shit.</v>

2256
02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:30.730
We got through that one.
Yeah,
that was great.
I love that fucking song.

2257
02:18:31.690 --> 02:18:35.590
That was bad.
A house.
Holy Shit.
Is that a tune?
That was really cool.

2258
02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:44.050
I liked the banjos making a comeback.
I'd like that.
Huh?
You know,

2259
02:18:44.051 --> 02:18:46.780
what about the bands?
What gets thrown under the bus a lot?
What happened?

2260
02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:50.040
I have the Banjo.
Gatorade,
you know,
the hillbillies and they,
oh,

2261
02:18:50.050 --> 02:18:52.810
those motherfuckers,
you know what?
It's okay.

2262
02:18:54.250 --> 02:18:57.730
I like being the underdog.
I'm from Cleveland.
You know,
it's like you're,

2263
02:18:57.840 --> 02:18:59.860
you gotta just,
you gotta come back up.

2264
02:19:00.670 --> 02:19:05.290
I can banjo respect for drew Carey.
Oh Man.
I met drew Carey.

2265
02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:10.190
I met him at,
um,
I met him at swingers,
the diner.
Oh,
okay.

2266
02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:13.220
Yeah,
he's there like every day almost.
And great guy.

2267
02:19:13.221 --> 02:19:16.240
And I walked up to my house and you know,
I don't normally do this kind of thing,

2268
02:19:16.241 --> 02:19:21.100
but I'm a hometown hero lover,
you know?
And I was like true.
My name's Suzanne.

2269
02:19:21.101 --> 02:19:23.380
I'm,
I'm from Parma,
Ohio,
which is what the show,

2270
02:19:23.381 --> 02:19:27.710
we talked about this on the podcast and she was so fucking nice and he actually

2271
02:19:27.711 --> 02:19:28.130
tweeted

2272
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:32.450
<v 6>out,
I was like,
I threw a tweet at him and he was super cool.
Really Nice Guy.</v>

2273
02:19:32.710 --> 02:19:36.500
<v 0>He's a sweetheart.
He's a genuine nice guy.
Yeah,
it was nice.
Nice.</v>

2274
02:19:36.501 --> 02:19:38.540
When you run into people that are genuinely nice,

2275
02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:41.780
<v 6>it's cool,
you know,
and,
and when they're not a fucking,</v>

2276
02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:45.590
maybe you caught him on a bad day too.
You can't really do it.

2277
02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:49.650
<v 0>Could be.
We've all been there.
Yeah.
Vol been there.</v>

2278
02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:53.750
You guys going to move back to la?
Come on.
I want to,
we just,

2279
02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:57.010
we need to make this record and then Nashville Shit.
Dope.

2280
02:19:57.930 --> 02:19:59.040
Makes them all cash.

2281
02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:02.440
<v 3>You know what I was thinking though when you were talking about the Banjo,</v>

2282
02:20:02.441 --> 02:20:03.340
I remembered about Nashville.

2283
02:20:03.341 --> 02:20:07.750
Something that's amazing about Nashville is it has this real wellspring of
music,

2284
02:20:07.751 --> 02:20:12.580
which is what'd you just do?
Yeah,
there's a lot of music in Nashville,

2285
02:20:12.581 --> 02:20:15.340
right?
But there's a lot of traditional music and like call,
you know,

2286
02:20:15.341 --> 02:20:20.130
stuff that's like,
hey,
who do you know?
And not in a bad way like bluegrass music.

2287
02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:22.930
I mean it didn't,
it didn't come out of Nashville specifically,

2288
02:20:22.931 --> 02:20:27.070
but that region you have traditional music and you're not really in touch with

2289
02:20:27.071 --> 02:20:29.440
that many other places.
Like here,
this is a great music scene,

2290
02:20:29.770 --> 02:20:32.440
but there aren't people who are like keeping a flame alive

2291
02:20:32.510 --> 02:20:36.650
<v 0>as far as I,
that's interesting.
So they're keeping like a blue grass flame alive.</v>

2292
02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:40.020
<v 3>They really are.
Like American roots music is,
is huge.</v>

2293
02:20:40.050 --> 02:20:43.650
And there's people that are dedicated to just like spreading this shit and

2294
02:20:43.651 --> 02:20:47.220
making sure people know about it.
Huh.
And that's,
I mean,
that's,

2295
02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:49.920
that's why the Banjo is still around.
Do you know,
because someone,

2296
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:51.470
<v 0>yeah,
I mean there's like,</v>

2297
02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:56.500
there's always been a respect that a rock and roll guys pay to things like blue

2298
02:20:57.281 --> 02:21:01.880
grass or the blues or did you ever,
you know,
I'm sure you guys know the song.

2299
02:21:01.881 --> 02:21:05.540
One of my all time favorite Skinner at songs,
the ballot of Curtis Lowe.

2300
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:09.600
Do you know that song?
It's about,
uh,
him,
uh,

2301
02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:12.890
picking up bottles and returning,
um,

2302
02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:14.930
so you can give money to this Guy Curtis Lowe.

2303
02:21:14.931 --> 02:21:19.430
So you sing them a song because this guy would sit out and they'd give them

2304
02:21:19.431 --> 02:21:20.690
money,
buy wine with it,

2305
02:21:20.691 --> 02:21:25.220
and he would sing songs for people and it's just a fucking beautiful song.

2306
02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:26.750
But it's not just a beautiful song.

2307
02:21:26.751 --> 02:21:30.830
It's a beautiful song that Skinner did as like,
uh,

2308
02:21:31.250 --> 02:21:32.370
just in,
in uh,

2309
02:21:32.430 --> 02:21:36.520
in honor of these like unknown blues guys instead of respect for

2310
02:21:36.610 --> 02:21:39.540
<v 3>that are responsible for all of this shit and know it's like you look Jimi</v>

2311
02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:43.090
Hendrix,
he did exist without these guys.
I was reading about some guy,
you know,

2312
02:21:43.091 --> 02:21:47.050
this is like the recording error in the forties and 50s.
You'd have Wii.

2313
02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:50.380
They just zone in on these blues guys.
They find him on the street,

2314
02:21:50.381 --> 02:21:53.260
this Guy Blind Willie McTell he was in need and they bring them up to New York

2315
02:21:53.530 --> 02:21:57.700
and they cut songs and then give them like 25 bucks it seriously and send it

2316
02:21:57.701 --> 02:22:00.310
back and make millions,

2317
02:22:00.310 --> 02:22:03.700
millions of dollars and 20 years after it was put out on his records,
this guy,

2318
02:22:03.770 --> 02:22:05.790
uh,
like Atlantic records,
this guy amateur it again,

2319
02:22:05.791 --> 02:22:09.100
find some on the streets still and he's just doing his thing.
Wow.

2320
02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:12.930
<v 0>Still doing this thing and there's a whole community of these guys,
man.</v>

2321
02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:16.200
And whether it was quite a few,
that definitely got taken advantage of for sure.

2322
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:21.120
You know,
and there's all this weird lore behind it all too.
Like I always,
it was,

2323
02:22:21.121 --> 02:22:25.640
uh,
fascinated by a Robert Johnson,
you know,
on the whole students.
Yeah.

2324
02:22:25.650 --> 02:22:27.960
The crossroads.
He sold his soul to the devil.

2325
02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:30.780
The devil would give him better songs.

2326
02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:37.010
<v 5>I mean,
it sounds like they're really good,
but they're really good for the time.</v>

2327
02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:40.330
I would think the devil would have like mad at universal magic.

2328
02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:44.380
<v 0>Yeah.
Like there's songs that for whatever reason,</v>

2329
02:22:44.590 --> 02:22:47.740
they just don't quite hell hang in there.

2330
02:22:47.770 --> 02:22:51.790
They don't quite hold up.
There's some old songs,
so you listened to them.
They're,

2331
02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:56.680
they're fascinating but they don't quite touch you,
you know,

2332
02:22:56.681 --> 02:22:59.710
and then you get to a certain point where they're like,
okay,

2333
02:22:59.711 --> 02:23:03.010
this song will exist forever.
And My,

2334
02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:07.990
my register is like songs like whole lot of love,
like Zeppelin,
whole Lotta love.

2335
02:23:08.170 --> 02:23:12.520
Like I don't give a fuck what happens.
I don't care if they invent time travel.

2336
02:23:12.670 --> 02:23:17.670
I don't care if you've got like robots on Pluto that put your body in suspended

2337
02:23:19.091 --> 02:23:22.420
animation and print a three d copy of it.

2338
02:23:22.421 --> 02:23:27.010
That breeds carbon dioxide and it wanders around the surface.
When I don't care.

2339
02:23:27.130 --> 02:23:29.230
You're not going to make a better song than whole lot of luck.

2340
02:23:29.530 --> 02:23:32.200
You might make a different songs.
It might be different,

2341
02:23:32.201 --> 02:23:34.750
but it's not going to be better.
It's not possible to be better.

2342
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:39.480
There's something about that.
No,
don't,
don't,
don't,
don't,
don't,

2343
02:23:39.690 --> 02:23:41.900
don't,
don't,
don't know.
Down.

2344
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:47.590
There's something about the beauty of palmers voice and the sounds of the guitar

2345
02:23:49.421 --> 02:23:53.830
and Jimmy Page is hitting it.
Perfect.
And then the time,

2346
02:23:54.010 --> 02:23:58.900
it's the time is marijuana smoke in the air and everyone's on Lsd.

2347
02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:03.790
It's just the alone alone don't,
it's just a different time.

2348
02:24:03.930 --> 02:24:08.590
Yeah.
They captured this rare moment where the universe gave birth to flowers.

2349
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.000
The universe gave birth.

2350
02:24:10.001 --> 02:24:13.240
You liked these artistic flowers in the form of human expression.

2351
02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:16.660
They were birthed out of the human consciousness and imagination.

2352
02:24:16.750 --> 02:24:20.800
<v 2>Yeah.
They're the pioneers.
You know,
they're the,
they kind of started this thing,</v>

2353
02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:26.160
but it's interesting now juxtaposed to like music made today where there's so

2354
02:24:26.561 --> 02:24:29.710
many manufactured sounds and stuff.
It's not like,
hey,

2355
02:24:29.711 --> 02:24:33.010
this is what the drum sound and my like in my friend's basement,
you know,

2356
02:24:33.011 --> 02:24:33.880
fucking awesome.

2357
02:24:34.630 --> 02:24:38.680
<v 0>Seem like the things that are,
I hate the word organic,</v>

2358
02:24:38.681 --> 02:24:41.920
but it seems like the right words you use to describe people like the black keys

2359
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:43.710
like that they,
yeah,
yeah,

2360
02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:46.710
<v 5>they're,
they're awesome.
But they're also still like,</v>

2361
02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:49.070
they didn't come up with that sound well,
but you know,

2362
02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:51.570
they didn't come up with the blues but he just executed really well.

2363
02:24:51.890 --> 02:24:54.120
But Zeplin that's the key.
It's like the Robert Johnson thing.

2364
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:56.610
Pioneers all like that's a great word.

2365
02:24:56.611 --> 02:24:58.740
And I also think not a fitting one necessarily.

2366
02:24:58.741 --> 02:25:01.610
Maybe ever cause somebody always did it.
Yeah.
Four.

2367
02:25:01.620 --> 02:25:05.580
And there was always sensing true.
True.
Yeah.
Isn't that so true?

2368
02:25:05.581 --> 02:25:08.550
Isn't that what's unique about the whole thing is it's someone else's.

2369
02:25:08.551 --> 02:25:11.040
Oh it will.
There's no real prying ears.
It just,

2370
02:25:11.041 --> 02:25:14.940
everyone is sorta handing a torch off and there's this moment where someone

2371
02:25:14.941 --> 02:25:18.300
comes up with a whole lot of love and you're like,
wow,
what the fuck is,

2372
02:25:18.301 --> 02:25:21.120
you made a pull a black diamond that weighs a thousand pounds.
Yeah.

2373
02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:24.280
You figured out a way to make some like universal really

2374
02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:27.370
<v 0>weird and unusual and and,
and,</v>

2375
02:25:27.371 --> 02:25:30.340
and important object and they probably weren't even trying to just kind of

2376
02:25:30.341 --> 02:25:34.170
filtering this stuff.
It's like a set of circumstances and experiences.
Yeah.

2377
02:25:34.171 --> 02:25:35.980
Look it.
These British dudes here,
this music,

2378
02:25:35.981 --> 02:25:40.890
they from this weird working class town and when they play,
yeah,
yeah,
blah,
blah,

2379
02:25:40.891 --> 02:25:43.690
blah.
Days in there.
Some of them that,
you know,

2380
02:25:43.691 --> 02:25:47.170
sometimes you have to step back away from them to realize how great they really

2381
02:25:47.171 --> 02:25:47.770
were.

2382
02:25:47.770 --> 02:25:51.310
Like if you don't listen to sweet home Alabama for six months and then that's

2383
02:25:51.311 --> 02:25:52.190
what you do.

2384
02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:57.220
It's like if you don't have sex for like six weeks,
when you,

2385
02:25:57.340 --> 02:26:02.110
when you do have sex,
it'll be so amazing because every touch will be like,

2386
02:26:02.170 --> 02:26:06.790
the power of the touch will be inflated beyond belief.
Every,
all of it.

2387
02:26:06.791 --> 02:26:08.350
The sparks,
the energy,

2388
02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:12.790
but the only way for that to build up as you got to take some time off and sweet

2389
02:26:12.791 --> 02:26:15.190
home,
Alabama was overplayed to death.

2390
02:26:15.191 --> 02:26:18.610
They beat the fuck out of that song because it's so good.

2391
02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:23.320
But sometimes you could forget.
You forget how good it is,
what you're saying.

2392
02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:26.170
All you need is a little time off.

2393
02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:29.770
You need a little time off and you realize that's God trying to speak through

2394
02:26:29.771 --> 02:26:33.610
some fat long haired Florida Boys.

2395
02:26:34.450 --> 02:26:37.630
That's God speaking to them in between sex,

2396
02:26:37.690 --> 02:26:40.600
not having sex for six weeks and then listening and see how,
because

2397
02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:44.110
familiarity breeds contempt.

2398
02:26:47.530 --> 02:26:52.240
Familiarity breeds contempt.
I,
you know,
sweet Alabama inside and out.

2399
02:26:52.241 --> 02:26:53.920
You can't appreciate what it really is.

2400
02:26:54.190 --> 02:26:58.750
What it really is is these guys found a lightening rod to the universal
constant.

2401
02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:01.060
They just hit that fucking button,

2402
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:02.740
<v 15>sweet home</v>

2403
02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:04.093
<v 0>Bama</v>

2404
02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:10.220
and this is 19 whatever 70 who the fuck knows the cars were all dog shit.

2405
02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:15.640
Fucking oil oil crisis is and fucking Nixon and Jimmy Carter.

2406
02:27:16.611 --> 02:27:20.450
Everybody's a mess and then all of a sudden he's fat guys out of Florida.

2407
02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:23.300
Ugly white trash,
fat guys,

2408
02:27:23.490 --> 02:27:24.960
<v 15>sweet home,</v>

2409
02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:29.110
<v 0>not even fat all the time.
Like in the beginning actually kind of spam.</v>

2410
02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:32.720
That's like a joyful song.
He had moments,
right?
They were amazing.

2411
02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:36.130
Whatever the fuck they were for that brief moment of time.
You know,

2412
02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:40.070
before that plane crash,
they were amazing.
Leonard Skinner.

2413
02:27:40.071 --> 02:27:41.480
And to this day,

2414
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:45.440
if I have a like a list of shit on my iPod and I'm like in an airport or

2415
02:27:45.441 --> 02:27:48.620
something like that and I'm scrolling through and I see my little Skinner folder

2416
02:27:48.621 --> 02:27:53.500
and I'm like,
fuck you gotta go scattered.
Got to go to scattered man.
Fuck in DC.

2417
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:58.100
I feel the same way.
Yeah.
Even if the every song sounds like an ACDC song,

2418
02:27:58.370 --> 02:28:01.270
like they don't vary at all.
It doesn't matter.
It's like,
dude,

2419
02:28:01.470 --> 02:28:04.370
that's like a chemical rush when you put that stuff.
Yeah.

2420
02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:09.790
They're so unique in that it's like,
you know,
dot.
Dot.
You know,

2421
02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:14.360
you hear that,
like they have that such a marching sort of style,

2422
02:28:14.660 --> 02:28:16.520
you know,
browsing shit.

2423
02:28:16.670 --> 02:28:21.230
So many guys come like a into the cage and to mixed martial arts fights.
Yeah.

2424
02:28:21.290 --> 02:28:22.370
And even in boxing fight,

2425
02:28:22.410 --> 02:28:27.150
<v 2>it's weightless and ACDC.
Fuck yeah.
Thunder strikes a big one.
We had a really,
uh,</v>

2426
02:28:27.430 --> 02:28:31.980
uh,
kind of defining moment of our,
of our lifetime,
I would say not lifetime,

2427
02:28:31.981 --> 02:28:35.850
but we saw black sabbath.
We were overseas,

2428
02:28:35.851 --> 02:28:37.780
we were in Amsterdam and it was a,

2429
02:28:37.781 --> 02:28:41.340
ed actually happened to Ben Thanksgiving as well.
Um,

2430
02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:46.290
and a friend of ours got us tickets to see black sabbath and you know,

2431
02:28:46.291 --> 02:28:49.760
you got to think like,
how much longer does Ozzy?
Yeah.
You know,
you,

2432
02:28:49.790 --> 02:28:53.670
you don't want to miss it if you have an opportunity.
And it was amazing.

2433
02:28:53.671 --> 02:28:57.570
Like it was really,
you really saw his energy was,

2434
02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:01.320
was so genuine.
It really was.
You could tell he was having a blast.

2435
02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:03.300
He couldn't sing for shit.
I mean,

2436
02:29:03.301 --> 02:29:05.790
he was so off key that he was almost back in key.

2437
02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:08.820
Like it was so far off an octave that it was almost back in,

2438
02:29:08.821 --> 02:29:12.300
but it was so entertaining to see him because he really felt like,

2439
02:29:12.301 --> 02:29:15.810
you felt his energy was like across the whole,
like it was like a,

2440
02:29:15.811 --> 02:29:19.890
it was called the zig o dome.
Right.
Was it this huge,
you know,
place.

2441
02:29:19.891 --> 02:29:24.450
And it was a,
it was a really crazy experience to see Ozzy Osborne,

2442
02:29:24.750 --> 02:29:28.620
you know,
up on stage doing his thing.
He's got his signature moves.

2443
02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:31.470
Like between each song it'd be like,
I can't fucking

2444
02:29:34.380 --> 02:29:38.700
screaming,
you know.
And it was crazy,
but it was really,
really great to see like,

2445
02:29:38.730 --> 02:29:39.840
you know,
he's legendary.

2446
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:44.110
<v 0>Brian,
you remember when you were with me when one see steel panthers,
right?
Yeah.</v>

2447
02:29:44.540 --> 02:29:45.090
Vegas.

2448
02:29:45.090 --> 02:29:50.090
We went to see steel panthers in Vegas and the dude who's lead singer does the

2449
02:29:50.681 --> 02:29:55.210
most insane
impression of Ozzy Osborne.

2450
02:29:55.211 --> 02:29:59.620
I mean pitch movement,
like the way he shuffles on stage.

2451
02:29:59.770 --> 02:30:03.910
He does crazy train and it's like,
Holy Shit,
it's so good.

2452
02:30:03.911 --> 02:30:07.170
It makes you want to go see Ozzy Osborne.
He really is so good.

2453
02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:11.470
Our place that they have right.
Bands like Steel Panther.
Yeah,
it's amazing.

2454
02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:14.830
But it makes you want to see somebody else.
Well they have,
um,

2455
02:30:14.890 --> 02:30:17.770
they're not just a band.
They were like a show,
you know,

2456
02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:21.010
those guys are like a review,
right?
Well it's,
it's,
yeah,

2457
02:30:21.011 --> 02:30:22.510
it's almost like a little bit of that,

2458
02:30:30.620 --> 02:30:32.370
<v 8>is this the I'm doing it,</v>

2459
02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:35.733
it's hard to tell.

2460
02:30:35.770 --> 02:30:38.750
<v 0>Well,
this audio is hard to hear.
You got when we see it live though,</v>

2461
02:30:38.751 --> 02:30:43.190
it's fucking insane.
I mean,
he sounds like Ozzy Osborne in his prime.

2462
02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:48.290
I mean,
exactly.
It's brilliant,
you know?
Wow.
Yeah.

2463
02:30:48.310 --> 02:30:50.360
Made you want to go see Ozzy before it's too late.

2464
02:30:50.410 --> 02:30:53.800
<v 2>Yeah.
Who knows how the keys and that Guy Alive,</v>

2465
02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:58.660
20 to 30 minute drum solo that went on.
He was being transported.

2466
02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:03.250
You were in the 70s you know where they went back and this is what we very
often,

2467
02:31:03.251 --> 02:31:06.850
but I did at an Amsterdam and it was,
it was crazy.
It was crazy.
I mean,

2468
02:31:06.851 --> 02:31:10.400
you're just like,
fuck yeah,
I'm going to get hired.
Black Sabbath.
Uh Huh.

2469
02:31:10.620 --> 02:31:14.360
<v 0>I remember one time I was right at it.
I was coming home on a plane,</v>

2470
02:31:14.390 --> 02:31:16.290
those writing and a lot of times when I write,

2471
02:31:16.291 --> 02:31:20.040
I'll eat like a pot edible before I get on the plane.
And this was particularly

2472
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:25.040
<v 1>strong and for whatever reason I decided to play crazy train over and over and</v>

2473
02:31:25.111 --> 02:31:25.561
over again.

2474
02:31:25.561 --> 02:31:30.270
I put it on repeat and I played that song for fucking five hours while I was

2475
02:31:30.271 --> 02:31:34.320
writing all the way from all the way from New York back to La.

2476
02:31:34.321 --> 02:31:37.410
It was five hours of crazy training.
Yeah.

2477
02:31:38.250 --> 02:31:42.210
He's just one of those things.
It's like he catch a great,
great groove.

2478
02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:43.553
Just fries.

2479
02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:47.040
<v 2>Never thought about writing to other music because we're usually,</v>

2480
02:31:47.041 --> 02:31:50.380
I'm writing music,
but that'd be,
you know,
like,

2481
02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:54.030
like what does it sound exactly like,
like when I was like,
I could never,
um,

2482
02:31:54.060 --> 02:31:55.290
like study when I was in school,

2483
02:31:55.291 --> 02:31:57.600
I could never really study if there's music in the background cause I'd be

2484
02:31:57.601 --> 02:31:58.740
really distracted by it.
Yeah.

2485
02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:01.740
<v 1>Most of the time I feel the same way,
but I needed comfort.
Yeah.</v>

2486
02:32:01.770 --> 02:32:06.140
That's really cool.
It's five hours.
I was too high.
I need it.
That's dedication,

2487
02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:08.760
comfort.
But it's also when you get,

2488
02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:11.820
when you get super high patterns start to,

2489
02:32:11.821 --> 02:32:15.030
once they become like very recognizable by the mind,

2490
02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:18.740
the mind settles into this idea that there's not going to be any interruptions

2491
02:32:18.741 --> 02:32:19.574
in those patterns.

2492
02:32:19.650 --> 02:32:24.650
So like crazy train essentially becomes like a three minute and 35 second ohm

2493
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:31.520
<v 2>like me because I'm really bad at being hi,
I'm so bad.
I,
I'm not,
it's not,</v>

2494
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:35.720
I lose my sparkle,
you know,
I really can't.
I can't.
Um,

2495
02:32:36.470 --> 02:32:37.580
I'm not present.
You know,

2496
02:32:37.581 --> 02:32:41.180
I can't really focus on a conversation and I feel very self aware and I want to

2497
02:32:41.181 --> 02:32:43.320
take a fucking nap.
I hear her.

2498
02:32:43.770 --> 02:32:47.240
<v 1>I totally understand those things.
They're very,
very logical.</v>

2499
02:32:48.140 --> 02:32:49.460
But I think that,
um,

2500
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:54.530
what I like about it is that terrible feeling of everything going completely off

2501
02:32:54.531 --> 02:32:58.280
the rails and then you get back to reality.
You take a deep breath and go,

2502
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:03.380
we're okay.
Everything's okay because it gives you,

2503
02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:08.680
it gives you such a bizarre Lee introspective perspective and such an intensely

2504
02:33:11.210 --> 02:33:14.390
sensitive view of the world that when the ride is over,

2505
02:33:14.420 --> 02:33:18.350
like you get off and you go,
okay,
we're fine now.
Okay,
this is helpful.

2506
02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:22.130
Like going on a really shitty vacation.
Civil work feels you appreciate your job.

2507
02:33:22.430 --> 02:33:24.650
Yeah.
Okay.
Well,
it's not even that it's shitty.

2508
02:33:24.890 --> 02:33:28.460
It's just that it's uniquely terrifying moments.

2509
02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:33.700
It reveals to you the beauty of just placid reality when everything's just

2510
02:33:34.600 --> 02:33:36.470
relaxed.
It's,
see I just get,

2511
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:41.510
I used to smoke all the time and I hit this Rut of massive anxiety and just

2512
02:33:42.171 --> 02:33:46.010
sick.
Like I don't really remember like was it like your 23rd and 24th year?

2513
02:33:46.011 --> 02:33:50.300
Is that what you said?
Hi for two years.
Pretty crazy.

2514
02:33:50.301 --> 02:33:52.940
He was really tough to work with you guys.
I love you.
That was,

2515
02:33:52.941 --> 02:33:56.160
those were some times shaped you as a man.
Yeah.
All those journeys,

2516
02:33:57.330 --> 02:34:00.780
those cosmic voyages to despair.
Yeah.

2517
02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:05.320
Twisty turny roads into the night.
We hear cars start to split it.

2518
02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:10.140
You're like,
really?
Yeah.
That's interesting.
Yeah.

2519
02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:13.640
It's really the drive for a long time.
I'm going to come to bureau.
What is it?

2520
02:34:13.641 --> 02:34:18.220
You know,
it's interesting how the uh,
will prescribe certain,
like Kinda uppers to

2521
02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:22.600
<v 5>people that are hyperactive and it sort of balances that are really fun.</v>

2522
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:26.830
Let me tell you,
I've heard that from several people this week.
It feels like

2523
02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:33.490
Adderall recreationally.
Sorry.
I felt like I was on mushrooms.

2524
02:34:33.491 --> 02:34:35.380
It was the best thing ever.
Actually.
We were in Paris,

2525
02:34:36.130 --> 02:34:39.180
we were in Paris and I,

2526
02:34:39.410 --> 02:34:44.410
I took an Adderall and we went to the Eiffel Tower and I had the best time ever.

2527
02:34:45.611 --> 02:34:50.110
I felt amazing.
Wow.
You have a super fun and we had a really fun show.

2528
02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:55.030
I mean,
do they have consulted a show?
No,
no,
no.

2529
02:34:55.031 --> 02:34:59.310
It was way earlier in the day.
I was ready to warn off.
Yeah,
I don't,

2530
02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:03.790
I don't like to be Collins.
Is it to wear off?
I don't know,
six hours.

2531
02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:08.380
It was fucking awesome.
Second person,

2532
02:35:08.381 --> 02:35:11.190
Hannibal Burress said the other day.
It was really fun.
But you know,

2533
02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:15.430
I'd say his name wrong all the time.
We've chosen stuff like that.

2534
02:35:15.431 --> 02:35:17.740
You definitely like,
you gotta be present,
you know,

2535
02:35:17.741 --> 02:35:21.880
you don't want to have to be in control of all of my faculties as much as

2536
02:35:21.881 --> 02:35:25.500
possible.
No,
I totally understand.
But something that lasts for six hours,

2537
02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:30.370
it seems like fuck boners that lasts for six hours.
What?

2538
02:35:30.900 --> 02:35:35.370
We've talked about that too.
All of this problem.

2539
02:35:36.610 --> 02:35:37.450
It's crazy.

2540
02:35:37.810 --> 02:35:41.110
Did you wear a fanny pack or something to like actually just took one last
night.

2541
02:35:41.111 --> 02:35:42.220
So I'm on it right now.

2542
02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:51.620
I feel uncomfortable.
I'm amazed that you can feel comfortable ever hear

2543
02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:53.993
his breathing.

2544
02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:57.400
So you're saying you went out last night or did you just stay home alone

2545
02:35:57.401 --> 02:36:02.080
sometimes.
Just to let everybody know what's up.
I got a massage last night,

2546
02:36:02.081 --> 02:36:06.760
so I just did it before that.
A massage in quotes,

2547
02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:10.650
air quotes,
creeper better.
Listen,
we,

2548
02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:15.100
we live in trying times.
[inaudible] just wanted to fuck with the massage.

2549
02:36:15.101 --> 02:36:20.101
[inaudible] asshole fucking snake.

2550
02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:25.253
Turtle head.

2551
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:33.950
What we need to talk about everything.

2552
02:36:34.580 --> 02:36:36.310
That's the problem.
You can't just talk.

2553
02:36:36.311 --> 02:36:39.040
Only about passionate people get bored of the same Goddamn for peaches over and

2554
02:36:39.041 --> 02:36:41.950
over again.
You brought up the boner anyway.

2555
02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.250
Listen to [inaudible].

2556
02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:50.900
You're welcome
to me.

2557
02:36:50.901 --> 02:36:55.600
Boners do you know in the comments,
is it like,
does it give you like a whisper?

2558
02:36:55.601 --> 02:36:56.434
You hear like whistling

2559
02:36:58.180 --> 02:37:03.180
the demon boners on its way between the worlds opens up just to creek

2560
02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:09.820
or spirits come flying through your fucking nervous system.
He feel them.

2561
02:37:11.410 --> 02:37:16.310
Yeah.
I had an interesting conversation with this girl

2562
02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:19.290
<v 0>wants to choose talking about like,
uh,
um,</v>

2563
02:37:19.370 --> 02:37:24.170
like the difference between a woman getting excited and a man getting excited is

2564
02:37:24.171 --> 02:37:26.330
that it's pretty obvious if a man's excited,

2565
02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:31.640
but like a woman can be a prostitute and she could totally pretend to be excited

2566
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:33.470
and not give a fuck.

2567
02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:37.600
But a man has like this one thing that he has to show that.

2568
02:37:37.970 --> 02:37:41.990
So if he's like acting excited,
but he doesn't have an erection though,
like,
Hey,

2569
02:37:43.090 --> 02:37:46.280
<v 5>what do you do?
You being deceptive flyer.
What's going on here?</v>

2570
02:37:46.300 --> 02:37:50.000
Who are full of Shit?
It's like,
it's interesting how nature said that up.

2571
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:52.130
It's way easier to lie the dudes.

2572
02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:56.000
It's also way easier to lie to dudes,
right?

2573
02:37:57.530 --> 02:38:01.700
I mean,
God,
we're totally getting down.
But like if you're,
if you're not wet,

2574
02:38:01.701 --> 02:38:06.590
you're not wet.
And that's,
that's gotta be disappointing for a dude.
But that's,

2575
02:38:06.591 --> 02:38:09.350
I mean,
come on a little bit.
Turn fingers.
We don't know any better.

2576
02:38:09.351 --> 02:38:13.400
We're retarded.
Apparently not.
I could convince myself otherwise.

2577
02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:18.520
Men are retarded.
We,
it's easy for us to care.
You know,
she's not June,

2578
02:38:18.521 --> 02:38:22.940
but she wasn't wet,
but it was,
she's so horny
pill.

2579
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:26.540
This doesn't,
you know,
she's probably going to get off and go organic.

2580
02:38:27.610 --> 02:38:30.760
Probably gluten free.
Make a difference.
I'm sure it does.

2581
02:38:30.770 --> 02:38:33.950
Birth control and not on birth control.
What I'm saying is you fuck,
um,

2582
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:38.180
I bet it does.
Zane,
you have better orgasms.

2583
02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:42.830
Like the whole thing.
It's like you off of it come out from this.
Yeah,
yeah,

2584
02:38:42.860 --> 02:38:47.840
yeah.
I'm sure it's,
it's like a muted sexual side to yourself.

2585
02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:50.150
I'm sure.
I mean it to get bigger and that's fun.

2586
02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:52.910
It's letting your body thinks that it's pregnant.
Yeah.

2587
02:38:52.911 --> 02:38:56.570
It's really weird is it's letting your body thinks it's pregnant.
I um,

2588
02:38:57.110 --> 02:39:00.320
I don't think I would ever go back on anything like that.
It's crazy.

2589
02:39:00.350 --> 02:39:02.690
Probably not the smartest thing for your body.
Right.

2590
02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:05.780
But it helps people in some things like girls who have acne,

2591
02:39:05.810 --> 02:39:08.810
a lot of times we'll get on and actually gave me acne.
Whoa.
Yeah.

2592
02:39:08.811 --> 02:39:11.030
It was a real bummer.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2593
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:15.020
It's interesting still also that they've never figured out a solution like that

2594
02:39:15.021 --> 02:39:17.300
for men,
like a pill solution.

2595
02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:22.010
And I wonder if it has drive that same sort of compromising aspects like,
well,

2596
02:39:22.011 --> 02:39:23.810
there's accutane if you want the hard stuff,

2597
02:39:23.811 --> 02:39:26.010
but that's pretty we we're talking about is this

2598
02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:33.170
something that keeps me then north can make cement sterile sterilize.
Yeah.

2599
02:39:33.490 --> 02:39:35.910
That's a horrible thought.
Isn't it?

2600
02:39:36.010 --> 02:39:38.600
Like a temporary sterile listened to what you just said.

2601
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:40.340
That's a horrible thought.

2602
02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:44.930
But the pill is reversible,
is it not?

2603
02:39:45.020 --> 02:39:49.880
And apparently it's like a walk in procedure.
It's 100% reversible.

2604
02:39:49.930 --> 02:39:52.070
<v 0>Oh.
I think sometimes they can.
You know what I mean?</v>

2605
02:39:52.071 --> 02:39:53.930
You have to go to a really good doctor that knows what they're doing,

2606
02:39:53.931 --> 02:39:57.980
but I think there are definitely can be complications whenever you start cutting

2607
02:39:57.981 --> 02:39:58.710
and stitching.

2608
02:39:58.710 --> 02:40:03.020
<v 5>It is unfortunate that all of the pressure lies on the woman.
It is.
It is.</v>

2609
02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:06.360
And you read it.
You just kind of reveal it like that.
Now the think about it,

2610
02:40:06.690 --> 02:40:09.930
it is,
it's horrifying to me to think of fucking with the testicles,

2611
02:40:09.931 --> 02:40:12.180
but at the same time it's totally routine to be honest.
Yeah.

2612
02:40:12.900 --> 02:40:17.700
Notice that you get an Iud,
that shit is fucked up.
Going into shock.
Yeah.

2613
02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:22.740
<v 2>Yeah.
I went into shock.
Like I literally,
um,
you know,
had like,</v>

2614
02:40:23.230 --> 02:40:27.720
it's,
it's called [inaudible] are vague.
I don't know how to describe,

2615
02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:32.670
I can't remember the actual African dilation.
You,
you,
um,
your body doesn't reject

2616
02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:35.860
<v 5>this repeating words I've heard online.
It's closed.</v>

2617
02:40:37.220 --> 02:40:39.890
There's a word for it.
I mean,
I know I rode

2618
02:40:41.780 --> 02:40:45.620
purchase.
Great.
That's really funny.
I'm sorry.
I'm talking about

2619
02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:50.220
because you've got a robot fucking inserted into your vagina.

2620
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:53.960
Come you up with Liddy words.
Sorry.

2621
02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:57.830
I feel better.
It's okay.
I can,
you know,
hang with the boys.

2622
02:40:58.100 --> 02:41:02.000
It certainly is like rude not just of us,

2623
02:41:02.030 --> 02:41:04.850
but of culture to sort of make that distinction.

2624
02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:08.840
Like it would be disgusting for a guy to take a pill that makes you sterile,

2625
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:11.970
like kills your sperm.
You'd be like turned off by that.

2626
02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:14.770
They didn't just didn't put it on the market.
I think there's a certain,

2627
02:41:15.290 --> 02:41:20.290
<v 0>a valuable asset sort of mindset that goes along with the idea of fertility.</v>

2628
02:41:22.650 --> 02:41:27.650
And I think that virility and fertility are very important to men.

2629
02:41:28.140 --> 02:41:32.790
And the idea of killing all your sperm ease with a pill seems scary.

2630
02:41:33.270 --> 02:41:35.430
Yeah.
You know,
if you're really going to totally commend,

2631
02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:36.780
you would get an operation.

2632
02:41:36.810 --> 02:41:41.220
If you weren't going to totally commit the idea of cooking them with some sort

2633
02:41:41.221 --> 02:41:42.720
of an evil compound,

2634
02:41:43.090 --> 02:41:46.360
<v 5>you just freeze that fine.
Yeah,</v>

2635
02:41:46.361 --> 02:41:50.140
but I can't come out the same way.
It's like vegetables probably.

2636
02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:52.410
Would you cook with frozen bins?
It's like drinking VA.

2637
02:41:52.690 --> 02:41:56.110
Would you rather cook with frozen vegetables?
Not necessarily.
Yeah.

2638
02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:59.020
<v 0>Something's wrong.
They're just wrong.
We don't know what it is.</v>

2639
02:41:59.530 --> 02:42:02.770
I totally get it.
If I was a check,

2640
02:42:02.771 --> 02:42:06.100
I'd be really bummed out if somebody wanted me to take a pill that made my body

2641
02:42:06.101 --> 02:42:10.210
thinks that it's pregnant.
Yeah.
And then also kills your libido,

2642
02:42:10.900 --> 02:42:14.920
which is probably a little of nature would do like almost automatically if

2643
02:42:14.921 --> 02:42:16.180
you're pregnant,
probably like chuck.

2644
02:42:16.260 --> 02:42:20.730
<v 5>Okay.
Slow down hooker,
slow down.
You don't need any more deck.</v>

2645
02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:23.990
You got a baby on the way and take it down a notch.

2646
02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:28.290
<v 2>Some.
It's an interesting,
like when you go through your relationships,</v>

2647
02:42:28.291 --> 02:42:31.200
like obviously if you're dating,
it's not as much of a problem,
you know,

2648
02:42:31.201 --> 02:42:34.740
because he used condoms and that's fine.
Honestly like,
but,

2649
02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:38.040
but if you're really serious with somebody and then you get to that point where

2650
02:42:38.041 --> 02:42:41.020
you're like,
you know,
I love you.
I don't want to use this anymore.
Let's look,

2651
02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:44.220
let's kick it up a notch.
Right.
You know,
it is a,

2652
02:42:44.221 --> 02:42:49.020
then you get to that point where like you,
you have to figure out,
well shit,

2653
02:42:49.021 --> 02:42:54.021
how do I want to manipulate my body to have more pleasurable sex or,

2654
02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:59.490
or more intimate connection if you will?
And,
or,
you know,
um,

2655
02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:02.550
let's just,
uh,
let's have a,
you know,

2656
02:43:03.570 --> 02:43:07.110
risk that we're going to take and it may or may not make a baby.

2657
02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:08.490
That's fucking terrifying.

2658
02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:12.130
<v 0>Yeah.
The idea may or may make a person</v>

2659
02:43:12.130 --> 02:43:13.600
<v 1>as a fucking tricky thing,</v>

2660
02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:18.450
especially when you're young musicians trying to travel the road and yeah.

2661
02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:20.040
I don't want to get anybody pregnant on the road though.

2662
02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:24.550
Be What would happen if you had a bit visit your baby daddy and Tennessee got

2663
02:43:24.551 --> 02:43:28.260
some guy pregnant Tennessee magic chicks could get guys pregnant.

2664
02:43:28.450 --> 02:43:32.260
Boy dudes would be such prudes it'd be hilarious.
Have girls,

2665
02:43:32.261 --> 02:43:36.640
he'd get us pregnant like fucking me over guys who built it would be a total

2666
02:43:36.641 --> 02:43:41.410
role reversal of jerk off.
I'll just fucking jerk off.
Okay,
fine over here.

2667
02:43:41.411 --> 02:43:44.020
Just jerking off.
I don't need anybody to get me pregnant.

2668
02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:47.100
We we'd just get tons of abortions would be like the,
like I,

2669
02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:48.910
everyone would be getting a board every day.

2670
02:43:49.330 --> 02:43:53.410
But what if you were a dude who had this like weird sort of genetic desire to

2671
02:43:53.411 --> 02:43:56.440
breed?
You know what if you were like,

2672
02:43:56.441 --> 02:44:01.060
you had all these male aggressive qualities that we associate with being male

2673
02:44:01.270 --> 02:44:03.880
but also the need to get pregnant,

2674
02:44:04.310 --> 02:44:06.640
like the universe hit a switch on.

2675
02:44:06.641 --> 02:44:10.600
You nurture this weirder shit when it comes to like fucking frogs.

2676
02:44:10.601 --> 02:44:13.990
I can switch sex and we weird fucking bugs.

2677
02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:17.550
<v 2>Some people love to get pregnant just to say that they're pregnant.</v>

2678
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:21.000
I'm not kidding.
It's really fucking weird.
You meet a lot of people out there,

2679
02:44:21.001 --> 02:44:22.020
you know?
And it's just like

2680
02:44:23.850 --> 02:44:26.960
<v 1>really me getting pregnant just to say they're pregnant.
What do you think they,</v>

2681
02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:30.060
<v 2>maybe they're not getting pregnant,
but,
but sometimes the,</v>

2682
02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:33.110
I enjoy the most,
like in a cup,

2683
02:44:33.210 --> 02:44:36.510
<v 1>the Smith portion,
right?
Well,
it definitely gets you.
Okay.</v>

2684
02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:37.930
Installations almost immediate.

2685
02:44:37.980 --> 02:44:41.790
<v 2>Well,
I definitely feel like it can be,
let me rephrase that because God,
you know,</v>

2686
02:44:41.820 --> 02:44:45.540
go for it everybody,
if you want to get down,
procreate,

2687
02:44:45.541 --> 02:44:50.490
like more power to you,
but you have to admit you've seen people exploit it.

2688
02:44:50.690 --> 02:44:54.090
Yes.
In a way that it's like,
like,
do you really want to have this,

2689
02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:55.710
this life that you're creating?

2690
02:44:55.711 --> 02:45:00.270
Or do you just love like your Facebook updates?
And you know what I mean?

2691
02:45:00.271 --> 02:45:04.770
Like there's,
there's an interesting aspect.
Like I think it's,
it's,
um,

2692
02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:07.680
someone in,

2693
02:45:07.681 --> 02:45:12.681
in someone I know posted a photo of the pregnancy test right on the Facebook.

2694
02:45:15.150 --> 02:45:18.960
It was like,
you peed on that
fucked up.

2695
02:45:20.140 --> 02:45:20.973
You know,

2696
02:45:21.860 --> 02:45:25.220
<v 1>I think,
um,
as a person who's never given birth,</v>

2697
02:45:25.250 --> 02:45:29.300
your perspective would radically change.
If you,
that's true,

2698
02:45:29.301 --> 02:45:31.040
and I've never been pregnant side of you,

2699
02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:35.950
but it's also like what people choose to and not to share on Facebook.
Right.

2700
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:37.760
You know that gets real squirrely.

2701
02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:41.550
Like you're like sometimes like you go on someone's Facebook and like,

2702
02:45:41.610 --> 02:45:44.840
especially if it's someone they know and they write like a bunch of like really

2703
02:45:44.841 --> 02:45:49.480
personal shit about a relationship or something and you're like,
yeah,
I'm a,

2704
02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:50.720
I'm going to walk away from it.

2705
02:45:50.721 --> 02:45:54.050
It's like I don't want to certainly not going to comment.
Yeah,
you go girl.

2706
02:45:54.390 --> 02:45:58.220
You know,
good things come to those who wait or some fucking Maxwell house,

2707
02:45:58.221 --> 02:46:02.990
coffee,
commercial,
whatever,
you know,
Blah Blah Blah.

2708
02:46:02.991 --> 02:46:06.950
Sorry to hear you're fucking,
you're in the dumps.
Like,
like why is,

2709
02:46:06.951 --> 02:46:09.980
why are people like Brian and stuff like Ben,
the

2710
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:14.570
<v 2>guy who was like,
he was like,
like,
that's it.
I'm done.
Like I'm on.</v>

2711
02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:18.830
You reach out to him because you're a good man.
Ben had somebody,

2712
02:46:29.230 --> 02:46:30.100
<v 0>you captured it.</v>

2713
02:46:30.850 --> 02:46:35.850
<v 3>I think people are fucking lonely and that is an outlet that everyone has access</v>

2714
02:46:37.061 --> 02:46:37.600
to,
you know?

2715
02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:41.080
So nobody's going to listen to them in real life so they can put it out there

2716
02:46:41.110 --> 02:46:43.390
and maybe someone will listen to them digitally.

2717
02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:47.900
<v 2>It's a powerful and yet terrifying thing sometimes because then you get people</v>

2718
02:46:47.901 --> 02:46:52.340
that are fucking annoying and then people that are really serious in a dark way

2719
02:46:52.341 --> 02:46:54.620
or you know,
it's,
it's such a weird balance.

2720
02:46:55.640 --> 02:47:00.440
I can never tell how I feel about it because social media is great for a band

2721
02:47:00.441 --> 02:47:05.330
like us because that's how you stay afloat,
you know?
That's how you stay present.

2722
02:47:06.210 --> 02:47:08.360
Cause we're not assigned van,
we're not on the radio,

2723
02:47:09.020 --> 02:47:12.560
but at the same time then there's like then your personal circle,

2724
02:47:12.561 --> 02:47:15.410
your personal friends and that's some crazy shit.
You know,

2725
02:47:15.411 --> 02:47:18.970
sometimes you just get these people that like they,

2726
02:47:19.130 --> 02:47:23.750
they want to reveal these really personal things and I never know what to do.
I,

2727
02:47:23.751 --> 02:47:26.150
you know,
I just block that shit.

2728
02:47:26.260 --> 02:47:29.480
<v 3>I who gets,
it can be off putting,
but it's also important to,</v>

2729
02:47:29.481 --> 02:47:32.470
for people to be able to get shit out,
right?
Yeah.

2730
02:47:33.150 --> 02:47:36.620
I was listening to something and they're talking to journal,
these mental health

2731
02:47:39.890 --> 02:47:44.270
people,
man talk in people's,
definitely the best

2732
02:47:46.970 --> 02:47:49.330
mental health workers in Africa.
Right.
And they were,

2733
02:47:49.550 --> 02:47:52.640
they were over there and all these African tribes,
people are more native.

2734
02:47:52.641 --> 02:47:55.910
People were kind of rejecting these mental health workers cause they'd come in

2735
02:47:56.980 --> 02:48:01.940
and uh,
the,
these people,
the more,
uh,
these African people would say,

2736
02:48:01.941 --> 02:48:04.070
well they come in here and they don't say anything about dancing.

2737
02:48:04.220 --> 02:48:07.550
They don't say anything about putting it out for the community and say anything

2738
02:48:07.551 --> 02:48:10.310
about turning these feelings.
Uh,
you know,
uh,

2739
02:48:10.850 --> 02:48:12.620
depersonalizing them as evil spirits.

2740
02:48:12.770 --> 02:48:16.220
They just tell us to come into a room with a stranger,

2741
02:48:16.221 --> 02:48:19.670
a dark room with a stranger,
talk about their problems,
you know,

2742
02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:23.720
Tech Talk Therapy,
Huh.
Instead of,
and they'd say,

2743
02:48:23.721 --> 02:48:25.940
we don't want this kind of western feel.

2744
02:48:25.941 --> 02:48:30.320
We want to just get it out and do it together and dance and hang.
You know,

2745
02:48:30.410 --> 02:48:32.960
and I'm not saying Facebook is really doing that,

2746
02:48:32.961 --> 02:48:36.440
but there's a certain similarity there between like mid shared.
It's all right.

2747
02:48:37.350 --> 02:48:41.100
<v 0>Well it is eventually I think right sharing though.
Well,</v>

2748
02:48:41.101 --> 02:48:44.100
this is excessive sharing and it's also like,

2749
02:48:45.210 --> 02:48:47.780
it's all about like the,
the,
the,

2750
02:48:48.060 --> 02:48:53.060
the comfort that people have in discussing like very personal relationship stuff

2751
02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:57.360
with or very personal,
uh,
you know,

2752
02:48:58.180 --> 02:49:03.180
more bid thoughts or worries about your own finite life or whatever it is that

2753
02:49:04.621 --> 02:49:04.951
you like.

2754
02:49:04.951 --> 02:49:08.100
Sometimes you read someone's Facebook page and want to know whether or not

2755
02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:09.060
<v 1>you should reach out to them.</v>

2756
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:12.510
Read some like weird moody thing that they wrote and you go,
Whoa,

2757
02:49:12.511 --> 02:49:14.040
like what the fuck is he saying here?

2758
02:49:14.310 --> 02:49:18.150
Like what is this some shit that I'm going to read and then wish that I called

2759
02:49:18.151 --> 02:49:21.010
him when I hear that something went wrong.
You know,

2760
02:49:21.690 --> 02:49:24.720
we all worry about that kind of stuff.
But I think that

2761
02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:31.230
what we're doing by connecting with each other on like things like Twitter and

2762
02:49:31.231 --> 02:49:34.680
then things like Facebook and then ultimately whatever the new ones are that

2763
02:49:34.681 --> 02:49:37.650
keep coming,
cause it seems like their network and it's never going to stop.

2764
02:49:37.651 --> 02:49:40.560
They're going to get deep.
This oculus rift,
Facebook connection,

2765
02:49:40.561 --> 02:49:42.900
who knows where the hell that's going to lead with that.

2766
02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:46.350
That could lead to some insane place.
I mean,
Oculus Rift,

2767
02:49:46.351 --> 02:49:48.810
if you've never put it on before,
Dunkin has one of these things.

2768
02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:52.650
He slapped the helmet on,
maybe he'll let you use it.
It's amazing.

2769
02:49:52.651 --> 02:49:55.890
And right now it's,
it's an instance.
I don't,
I don't know anything about it.
Oh,

2770
02:49:55.891 --> 02:49:57.750
how dare you teach.

2771
02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:03.360
Oculus rift is a new version of virtual reality that they're developing games

2772
02:50:03.361 --> 02:50:06.780
for and they have a few demos right now and they're making some new games.

2773
02:50:06.781 --> 02:50:11.370
But most of what you're getting when you look at the tech these days is

2774
02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:16.510
essentially samples of what's potentially possible a door into whatever this is.

2775
02:50:16.831 --> 02:50:19.230
That's so intoxicating that Facebook,

2776
02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:23.640
how much they paid for it or thinking it was $300 300 bucks.

2777
02:50:23.710 --> 02:50:26.430
If it's just hard.
It's just a Dev kit right now.

2778
02:50:26.431 --> 02:50:30.210
So like right now it's running on,
I mean how much it Facebook 2 billion.

2779
02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:35.310
I thought you'd being silly,
like $300 I'm like,
damn,
I wish I'd known.

2780
02:50:35.311 --> 02:50:39.990
I would give him for shit.
But what?
2 billion?
Hello?

2781
02:50:40.050 --> 02:50:40.681
That's how crazy.

2782
02:50:40.681 --> 02:50:44.880
This technology as you put this headset on and you like look around and you see

2783
02:50:44.881 --> 02:50:47.070
the sky,
you see leaves falling from the trees.

2784
02:50:47.071 --> 02:50:50.940
You see birds flying around three dimensional environment.
Yeah,

2785
02:50:50.941 --> 02:50:53.520
and they have this a one you interact with it.

2786
02:50:53.970 --> 02:50:57.750
You can walk around in it right now you can't interact with it,

2787
02:50:57.751 --> 02:51:02.570
but unquestionably it's calming.
I want to wear your helmet.
Yeah,
no,
won't.

2788
02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:03.840
He'll let you do both.

2789
02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:10.800
You should shouldn't be specify which one you liked first or whether or not

2790
02:51:10.801 --> 02:51:14.070
together because that would be fucking crazy.
With the helmet on,
you'd be like,

2791
02:51:14.071 --> 02:51:15.540
what am I feeling?
But what am I saying?

2792
02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:17.820
They really leaves falling when someone's fucking me in the ass.

2793
02:51:17.850 --> 02:51:21.750
They really got to figure it out though because it's still makes a lot of people

2794
02:51:21.751 --> 02:51:24.760
sick and you know,
every time I let people use it,
they were like,

2795
02:51:25.350 --> 02:51:28.950
most of them are like,
no,
this is,
I can't,
I have to sit down.
I tried it.

2796
02:51:28.951 --> 02:51:30.000
It didn't make me sick.

2797
02:51:30.210 --> 02:51:32.670
I think it's the universe trying to weed out weak bitches.

2798
02:51:33.910 --> 02:51:37.080
I just get you to do the roller coaster one.
No,
I'm just kidding.
I did.

2799
02:51:37.081 --> 02:51:39.480
The one I did was so mild.
I'm completely kidding,

2800
02:51:39.481 --> 02:51:42.420
because all I did was walk around in the backyard.
It didn't make me sick,

2801
02:51:42.750 --> 02:51:47.310
but I have her,
I get sick when I read my laptop in the back of a car,

2802
02:51:47.490 --> 02:51:50.680
like if I'm in the backseat and someone else's driving,
I try to read my laptop,

2803
02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:55.140
like call of duty,
like three,
like three 60 video games.
I can't do that yet.

2804
02:51:55.530 --> 02:51:57.450
It's like watching the Blair witch project.
I don't,

2805
02:51:57.480 --> 02:52:02.160
I don't play them because I get addicted to games.
I have a issue.
Seriously.

2806
02:52:02.161 --> 02:52:06.370
Peeky peeky I got a little bit of nothing,
a little crazy

2807
02:52:06.570 --> 02:52:11.460
<v 5>call of duty.
He'll just makes you pukey.
He's Super Geeky.
Oh,</v>

2808
02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:17.820
I hear myself slurring and I want to stop talking now.
So goodbye.
Listen,
I'm,

2809
02:52:17.890 --> 02:52:20.840
I think we're out of time.
We're going to turn into a it any second now,

2810
02:52:21.130 --> 02:52:23.800
but it was always awesome hanging out with you guys.

2811
02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:29.140
I love you guys.
You're the shit.
You're such positive.
Awesome,

2812
02:52:29.141 --> 02:52:32.860
fun people to be around at where I can speak for Brian.
We're honored.

2813
02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:36.500
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm speaking for you,
Brian.
Speak for yourself,
bitch.</v>

2814
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:41.720
I love you guys.
You said it.
He means it to,

2815
02:52:41.721 --> 02:52:46.340
he tells me when you're not around.
Uh,
thanks to our podcast sponsors.

2816
02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:50.930
Thanks to a Goddamn it,
why don't I have a mini study?
I know what it is.

2817
02:52:50.931 --> 02:52:55.760
I just don't know what their code is.
Ooh,
Masa t give them all the same,

2818
02:52:55.790 --> 02:52:59.930
hold on,
I'll find out Lumosity.
I won't leave you hanging you freaks.

2819
02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:03.520
Cause I love your,
I think you just say the website Joe sent you.
There's,

2820
02:53:03.530 --> 02:53:04.370
when you're signing up,

2821
02:53:04.371 --> 02:53:08.840
there's a place to actually choose how it's actually wrong.
Again,
Brian,

2822
02:53:09.200 --> 02:53:14.200
it's lumosity.com/joe so go to Lou masi.com/joe and click the start training

2823
02:53:16.911 --> 02:53:19.670
button and start playing your first game Lumosity.

2824
02:53:19.671 --> 02:53:24.671
It's a bunch of cool games designed to increase your brain's ability to function

2825
02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:28.220
faster because of exercise.

2826
02:53:28.220 --> 02:53:31.790
The idea is it's a gym for your mind and what I said there,

2827
02:53:31.791 --> 02:53:33.980
your brain's ability to function factor faster.

2828
02:53:34.700 --> 02:53:38.300
Take into account that I am certainly not a scientist by any stretch of the

2829
02:53:38.301 --> 02:53:41.750
imagination,
nor do I know if those games really,
truly,

2830
02:53:41.751 --> 02:53:44.150
I've read studies that they say that games,

2831
02:53:44.300 --> 02:53:48.230
video games especially enhance cognitive function in some strange way.

2832
02:53:48.410 --> 02:53:50.300
What the fuck do I know though,
folks?
Huh?

2833
02:53:50.450 --> 02:53:53.060
I might there while they're doing these tests,
huh?

2834
02:53:53.660 --> 02:53:58.660
What I'm saying is Lumosity is fun and accomplishes a lot of the things that

2835
02:54:01.251 --> 02:54:03.710
they've attributed to a video games.

2836
02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:07.850
And you can even design games specifically for the shit that you're interested

2837
02:54:07.851 --> 02:54:08.360
in.

2838
02:54:08.360 --> 02:54:11.150
And I'm giving Lumosity a full commercial because I'm not sure if we did it the

2839
02:54:11.151 --> 02:54:15.950
first time to go sort of eliminated by accidental Mack explosion.

2840
02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:21.080
Anyway,
lumosity.com forward slash Joe,

2841
02:54:21.320 --> 02:54:24.590
I will see you guys on Friday with the Great Dennis Mckenna.

2842
02:54:24.850 --> 02:54:28.340
Dennis's bringing in a,
a good friend of his and a,

2843
02:54:28.341 --> 02:54:31.370
we're going to have a crazy podcast that it's most likely going to blow your

2844
02:54:31.371 --> 02:54:35.810
fucking mind.
So tune in Ben as well.
And uh,

2845
02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:37.700
I will see you guys,
uh,

2846
02:54:37.730 --> 02:54:42.730
April 3rd in Miami at the Fillmore theater with the Great Tony Hinchcliffe.

2847
02:54:44.420 --> 02:54:46.490
And,

uh,

2848
02:54:46.610 --> 02:54:50.900
Baltimore on April 25th in Orlando on April 18 fault.

2849
02:54:50.901 --> 02:54:54.410
Those dates are almost sold out,
so hop on it freaks.
All right,

2850
02:54:54.411 --> 02:54:58.970
See you soon.

Holla.
