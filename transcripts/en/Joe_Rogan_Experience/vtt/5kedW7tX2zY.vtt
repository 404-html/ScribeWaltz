1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Do do</v>
<v Speaker 1>hello world.</v>

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.950
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

3
00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Rather than my man back from fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada back from Canada.</v>

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that experience like for you?</v>

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that experience was,</v>

6
00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>besides doing mushrooms and running</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the woods by yourself.</v>

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exclude that or you can exclude that</v>

8
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like taking away of fighters.</v>

9
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Ability to talk about fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're up in Canada,</v>

10
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.610
<v Speaker 1>bear hunting and are we decided to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms?</v>

11
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Go run off into the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to check in.</v>

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Know I understand it's on the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

13
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>That was fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was powerful,</v>

15
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super powerful because bears,</v>

16
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.870
<v Speaker 1>as I was telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears have come to me and my visions.</v>

17
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Do An eyewash Osca and everything since</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drop from the very first time I was</v>

18
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was Osca bears were coming to me and</v>

19
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>teaching me lessons and I was talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

20
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

21
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>The first time it came was the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time I did it and I saw this bear and it</v>

22
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>was wrapped up in all these chains and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was struggling against these gold</v>

23
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>chains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Mr. t dot bear had like</v>

24
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking crown and these heavy gold</v>
<v Speaker 1>chains and he was stuck and I couldn't</v>

25
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>move and the bear like stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like kind of frantic trying to</v>

26
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>get out of these chains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stops and looks at me and he goes,</v>

27
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was just a bear and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to worry about all this shit</v>

28
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>and it was less than about the wealth</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have can become like a prison</v>

29
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>that holds us back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It prevents us from being our true</v>

30
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:27.230
<v Speaker 1>nature with the bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True natures.</v>

31
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>You'd be in a bear chasing after shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating shit,</v>

32
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:30.504
<v Speaker 1>climbing trees.</v>

33
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>But the wealth that had accumulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevented it from doing that.</v>

34
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.920
<v Speaker 1>What a bizarre weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

35
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Is that like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's teaching you that?</v>

36
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that your imagination?</v>

37
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with that?</v>

38
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I know I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

39
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>it just appeared to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the funny thing.</v>

41
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels real.</v>

42
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a spirit guide teaching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it very well could be your</v>

43
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

44
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that creative to think about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear and gold chains telling me a lesson</v>

45
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 1>about wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a thought on that,</v>

46
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>that we look at the imagination and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

47
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just imagining things.</v>

48
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>But everything in the world is from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

49
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Every building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every airplane,</v>

50
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>every car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every piece of clothing,</v>

51
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>every computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything came out of the imagination.</v>

52
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.333
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

53
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I think the imagination is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking weird.</v>

54
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>And it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've somehow or another,</v>

55
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>we've almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

56
00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say underestimated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be underrated.</v>

57
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>We put it into this weird little</v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

58
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a silly thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

59
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:34.191
<v Speaker 1>you're just imagining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that allows it to operate and by,</v>

60
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>by underrating it or by undervaluing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it allows it to sort of roam free and do</v>

61
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>all of it's work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's responsible for creating</v>

62
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 1>everything that we see the humans have</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever done in the world.</v>

63
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets interesting for me too,</v>

64
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>and you think about these mythical</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures like bigfoot and dragons and</v>

65
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we create them,</v>

66
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>we actually create the light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neurons in our brain that form</v>

67
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>around that memory and that</v>

68
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if we draw a monster,</v>

69
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 2>we've actually created that monster on</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike a micro scale inside our brain</v>

70
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 2>and it's just we value this macro scale</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world where it actually breeds</v>

71
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 2>and lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're actually assembling light in</v>

72
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 2>our brains to create that thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're imagining.</v>

73
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just on a very,</v>

74
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 2>very small level and it doesn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom and flexibility,</v>

75
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 2>but we are really truly creating</v>
<v Speaker 2>entities all the time.</v>

76
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

77
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I've really wondered about that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens.</v>

78
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Would that archetypical alien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the iconic gray with the large black</v>

79
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 2>eyes and the like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing is real now.</v>

80
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a real thing whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever meet one or whether or not one</v>

81
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 2>exists in the physical state where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could drag it in front of the national</v>

82
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 2>enquirer photographers and get some good</v>
<v Speaker 2>shots of it.</v>

83
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 2>It's a real thing and what I mean by</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real thing is if you do</v>

84
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll fucking see them.</v>

85
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 2>You'll you will see them and do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you seeing them because you did</v>

86
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and you're hallucinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or are you seeing them because we've</v>

87
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:07.861
<v Speaker 2>created this archetype that plugs into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the imagination easily and connects you</v>

88
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:10.740
<v Speaker 2>to this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

89
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 2>this imaginary world or this world that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

90
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like the word imaginary</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like every time I've done a</v>

91
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

92
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that word imaginary because</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it seems like it's some sort of a</v>

93
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 2>frequency that you're tuning into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a real world exists that you can't</v>

94
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 2>bring back anything physical from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

95
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.733
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

96
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.790
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like it's entirely possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what we think of as these,</v>

97
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 2>these like gray aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like a,</v>

98
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 2>almost like a frequency of the universe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can tune into whether you're on</v>

99
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics or whether you're dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is of course your brain producing</v>

100
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:50.860
<v Speaker 2>its own psychedelics.</v>

101
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Your brain produces dimethyltryptamine</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're sleeping.</v>

102
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things that we think of as being</v>

103
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:03.031
<v Speaker 2>like all these imaginary things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens or bears that talk to you or</v>

104
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Hagens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

105
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what the fuck that really is</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about.</v>

106
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I think you're really onto something</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

107
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like there's this archetype</v>
<v Speaker 2>of frequency,</v>

108
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 2>like a dragon is a being of unlimited</v>
<v Speaker 2>power and we've imagined what that would</v>

109
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 2>look like visually if that were an</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>

110
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 2>what does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a dragon just fits that so fucking</v>

111
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:27.751
<v Speaker 2>perfect with the wings and the Scales</v>
<v Speaker 2>and smaug from token.</v>

112
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're looking at that and like,</v>

113
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fits that thing.</v>

114
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think about a cold,</v>

115
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 2>dispassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calculating machine that is dissecting</v>

116
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 2>you like than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

117
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Alien with the big eyes and the no nuts</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fits that</v>

118
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 2>so that no vagina either.</v>

119
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 2>They don't need that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just dispatched of it so that just</v>

120
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 2>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we create this visual representation of</v>

121
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:52.420
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this archetype.</v>

122
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Even Zeus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zeus should look,</v>

123
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like Zeus looks like we're good at</v>

124
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>like the physical look of something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this concept that is kind of very real.</v>

125
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't trust Zeus if he had like a</v>

126
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 2>dark goatee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to have a fucking white beard</v>

127
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 2>and white hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He always says white hair.</v>

128
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen Zeus without white</v>

129
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 2>hair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

130
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he turned into all kinds of shit.</v>

131
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 2>He would turn into like a swan and rape</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody and like golden missed and</v>

132
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:22.120
<v Speaker 2>rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody was like a mass rapist was</v>

133
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 2>constantly right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody.</v>

134
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 2>It was the bill cosby of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ancient gods go in as a goal is</v>

135
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 2>golden rain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He raped somebody.</v>

136
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Got Pregnant as golden ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

137
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.220
<v Speaker 2>That's rude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

138
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the defendant?</v>

139
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Somebody as rain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least give them a heads up who</v>

140
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:40.320
<v Speaker 2>expects to go outside and just get raped</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the rain.</v>

141
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

142
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 2>It was also a convenient excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you got pregnant.</v>

143
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 2>There was a sprinkle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was golden.</v>

144
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I think Zeus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's raping a dude there.</v>

145
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 2>What's he doing that cutting off his</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad's Dick.</v>

146
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good lawyers was the.</v>

147
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Was the titan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were always cutting off each</v>

148
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.250
<v Speaker 2>other's Dick and then they would throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

149
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 2>think he threw one into the ocean and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>created some other tighten and cut his</v>

150
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 2>own dad's Dick off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life was hard back then,</v>

151
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a hard world.</v>

152
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Those people live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

153
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.250
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of Dick cut and assholes.</v>

154
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do wonder like what I mean,</v>

155
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:23.280
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

156
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.111
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

157
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ent in empty wonder.</v>

158
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no end to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you'll ever going to</v>

159
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 2>solve like no one's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

160
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.350
<v Speaker 2>we figured out exactly what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you tripping on mushrooms and here</v>

161
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 2>is what it is and this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 2>you see these things and this is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things actually are.</v>

163
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 2>And this is the part of your brain that</v>
<v Speaker 2>creates them and they're absolutely not</v>

164
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

165
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the materialist reductionist</v>

166
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 2>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something that Sam Harris could</v>

167
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 2>explain very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

168
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 2>When you take psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the default mode network and your brain</v>

169
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 2>gets starved of blood which starves at</v>
<v Speaker 2>of oxygen,</v>

170
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 2>which downregulates it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing the other parts of your brain</v>

171
00:07:58.910 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 2>to come forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

172
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 2>got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then take some</v>

173
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 2>and then see how that feels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that,</v>

174
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 2>what comes through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

175
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a chemical process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

176
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 2>But then there's the experience and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing itself.</v>

177
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:14.510
<v Speaker 2>This is if you've heard me say this</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

178
00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>but this is kind of important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The experience is exactly the same</v>

179
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's in a physical form</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whether or not it's something that</v>

180
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 2>happens to you while you're tripping the</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences the same like if you have a</v>

181
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:30.401
<v Speaker 2>trip and during that trip you meet a</v>
<v Speaker 2>golden serpent that explains the</v>

182
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:31.670
<v Speaker 2>universe to you and it.</v>

183
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:36.670
<v Speaker 2>It explains that every single person is</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact a representation of what we</v>

184
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:43.721
<v Speaker 2>think of as love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love or or a God or creativity or some</v>

185
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:48.941
<v Speaker 2>divine force that is pushing forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>improvement and innovation and that that</v>

186
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 2>is the reason why life today is so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>different than it was 30 years ago or 30</v>

187
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 2>before that or 300 years before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will constantly keep improving and it</v>

188
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:02.150
<v Speaker 2>is the way of the universe and that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

189
00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 2>If you have that in a psychedelic trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly the same as if it happens</v>

190
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go to a field and a dragon</v>

191
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:16.341
<v Speaker 2>rises out of a marsh and confronts you</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all of the problems of your</v>

192
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 2>personality and all the mysteries of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past and gives you an understanding and</v>

193
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:25.530
<v Speaker 2>a blueprint for how to move forward with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life and then goes back in a swamp.</v>

194
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.330
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same as if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>tripping.</v>

195
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Like the experience is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like whether like,</v>

196
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:34.530
<v Speaker 2>well we found the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've located him on gps and I look on</v>

197
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Google Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see the dragon moving through</v>

198
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 2>the marsh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real dragon.</v>

199
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter like physically if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real dragon,</v>

200
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 2>the experience is the same and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>impact that it has and that's the thing</v>

201
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:49.830
<v Speaker 2>that we're seeing now in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific inquiries is that it's not</v>

202
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 2>just you have this experience like go</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a movie and you come back out and</v>

203
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 2>you're relatively the same afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are having the lasting impacts and</v>

204
00:09:57.121 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 2>the significant changes throughout a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime that you would expect from a</v>

205
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:05.220
<v Speaker 2>huge event like you just described</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in the real world because it</v>

206
00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Speaker 2>does feel real to you and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information you're getting and the</v>

207
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 2>experiences you have.</v>

208
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.040
<v Speaker 2>It changes you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you put it in this dream</v>

209
00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:12.631
<v Speaker 2>world like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

210
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:16.100
<v Speaker 2>that was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this person naked in my dream,</v>

211
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:17.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

212
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 2>that feels like kind of like random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just shaken up some dice and</v>

213
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:23.340
<v Speaker 2>throwing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This stuff comes to you in a way that</v>

214
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.340
<v Speaker 2>just leaves a significant impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

215
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 2>and the scientific reductionist point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>view is really important because we</v>

216
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 2>really do need to understand what's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical process that's going on in the</v>

217
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:37.650
<v Speaker 2>brain when you consume whatever pod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

218
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.940
<v Speaker 2>we need to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's fascinating and it's</v>

219
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 2>important for research and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>important that science keeps moving</v>

220
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:46.170
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The greater and greater understanding of</v>

221
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 2>the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can't discount what is happening</v>

222
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 2>as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a person,</v>

223
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:52.284
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

224
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an entity with consciousness.</v>

225
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.720
<v Speaker 2>What's happening during that experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you really you can really talk to</v>

226
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 2>God really can meet him for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you and I've met them together</v>

227
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 2>yet or met whatever the fuck we met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>

228
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 2>When you're in the DMT realm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is,</v>

229
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:16.950
<v Speaker 2>but if there's a god that's cooler than</v>
<v Speaker 2>that holy shit,</v>

230
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Speaker 2>and that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes like the stories are not.</v>

231
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 2>They're not inconsistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll go to these IOWASCA retreats.</v>

232
00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:26.130
<v Speaker 2>You have 20 people and seven of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>will talk to God.</v>

233
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 2>That's the same dude they're describing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what religion</v>

234
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 2>background they come from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hadn't like pre discussed what this</v>

235
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:35.070
<v Speaker 2>notion is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the wisdom that comes through</v>

236
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:38.400
<v Speaker 2>from that element source or whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to call it God.</v>

237
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Or have you talked to mother earth that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wisdom is all consistent and it's</v>

238
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:43.050
<v Speaker 2>weird that way.</v>

239
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.620
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you never hear something like,</v>

240
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.200
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's strange.</v>

241
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:49.320
<v Speaker 2>It's really contradictory to what I what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told me,</v>

242
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 2>like to see some people given dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like preferably the way strassman does</v>

243
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 2>it cause strassman minus the anal plug</v>
<v Speaker 2>that made them think that aliens were</v>

244
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 2>sodomized him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an anal plug.</v>

245
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 2>There was like an anal thermometer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

246
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.160
<v Speaker 2>check your core temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

247
00:12:05.161 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

248
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.190
<v Speaker 2>It had everybody thinking that aliens</v>
<v Speaker 2>were raping them.</v>

249
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Zeus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zeus stuff.</v>

250
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Not the best idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

251
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:11.681
<v Speaker 2>Well is he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

252
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>

253
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we thinking that aliens are</v>

254
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:16.420
<v Speaker 2>raping us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's something in your</v>

255
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:17.920
<v Speaker 2>breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously thermometer.</v>

256
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.090
<v Speaker 2>You're are you given knowledge of with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mometer in your.</v>

257
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 2>But before you go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are right.</v>

258
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Do they whisper in your ear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

259
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:26.554
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

260
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 2>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world itself is so fucking slippery.</v>

261
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just the world itself.</v>

262
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 2>The idea that I'm looking at you through</v>
<v Speaker 2>my eyes were making noises with our</v>

263
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 2>faces and somehow or another we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>translating this back and forth to each</v>

264
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 2>other through this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a microphone which works in a</v>

265
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:45.490
<v Speaker 2>way that neither new nor I can describe</v>
<v Speaker 2>to anybody.</v>

266
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

267
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.430
<v Speaker 2>it goes through these wires and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going wirelessly out into people's</v>

268
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:52.001
<v Speaker 2>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

269
00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:56.440
<v Speaker 2>these people that are streaming it right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now live with their phone in their car,</v>

270
00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 2>driving around four g lte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking world is slippery as shit it</v>

271
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:01.414
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

272
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:06.420
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how fast we adapt though</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are really good at adapting to</v>

273
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 2>this new shit that comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We almost adapt so fast that we take it</v>

274
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:11.890
<v Speaker 2>for granted way earlier than we should.</v>

275
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:12.791
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

276
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:13.510
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

277
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

278
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Speaker 2>There was an article about that recently</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how primate brains are sort of</v>

279
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:23.461
<v Speaker 2>predisposed to being able to adapt</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly quickly and that sort of</v>

280
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:26.830
<v Speaker 2>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the wide variety of</v>

281
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 2>cultures throughout the world and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think is normal,</v>

282
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.370
<v Speaker 2>what they accept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like um,</v>

283
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 2>those women in Africa that have those</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant plates in their lips.</v>

284
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Like how was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did that get going?</v>

285
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Well the next that they will judge that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stretched their necks out so far</v>

286
00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:46.990
<v Speaker 2>and they have those things that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't support themselves.</v>

287
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

288
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 2>The primary brain is pre adapted to face</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially any situation.</v>

289
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a really interesting article and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do a good job of it</v>

290
00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:56.950
<v Speaker 2>without someone reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

291
00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.940
<v Speaker 2>that's the title of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unfair.</v>

292
00:13:58.941 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] dot org,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a p,</v>

293
00:14:00.851 --> 00:14:04.300
<v Speaker 2>h,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a y s.org and it's the prime.</v>

294
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.780
<v Speaker 2>The title is the primate brain is pre</v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted to face potentially any</v>

295
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:12.010
<v Speaker 2>situation and it just talks about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain sort of calculates potential</v>

296
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 2>outcomes and all these different</v>
<v Speaker 2>variables that could possibly take</v>

297
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:17.460
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it moves into that direction of</v>

298
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.790
<v Speaker 2>sorts of set the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at how we developed and</v>

299
00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:24.100
<v Speaker 2>you look at something like the genetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottleneck theory,</v>

300
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:26.440
<v Speaker 2>where these big cataclysms would happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically,</v>

301
00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:29.830
<v Speaker 2>reduce the human population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with these macro changes</v>

302
00:14:29.831 --> 00:14:31.240
<v Speaker 2>on a global level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

303
00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:34.840
<v Speaker 2>the most flexible and adaptive are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to survive the stubborn acids that are</v>

304
00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:35.261
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

305
00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not leaving my forte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Forte is my home.</v>

306
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.790
<v Speaker 2>This is a model and land like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that forest was burning in.</v>

307
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.290
<v Speaker 2>You got to go to the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to figure out how to fish quick.</v>

308
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.980
<v Speaker 2>There's food in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to get that food on land</v>

309
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 2>into your belly or you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it.</v>

310
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are the humans that have</v>

311
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:55.730
<v Speaker 2>survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that trait will continue to be one of</v>

312
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:59.930
<v Speaker 2>the most important traits and obviously</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to the surface in these large</v>

313
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:01.280
<v Speaker 2>scale events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

314
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:04.010
<v Speaker 2>that's why I've always laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I told you a,</v>

315
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.530
<v Speaker 2>and I know you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You rented a place there recently too.</v>

316
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I've rented a place in Malibu for awhile</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the beach and I'm like,</v>

317
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.060
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck kind of place is this like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just banking.</v>

318
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 2>That's something that's constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing and moving and growing is going</v>

319
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 2>to stick around long enough for your</v>
<v Speaker 2>investment to pan out,</v>

320
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you made an investment.</v>

321
00:15:22.971 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Like these houses are worth fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars and there's no yard</v>

322
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.560
<v Speaker 2>in the back because it's just the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 2>and without a doubt that ocean is going</v>

323
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 2>to keep moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's without a doubt.</v>

324
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.380
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time do you have?</v>

325
00:15:37.381 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like a long real estate game of</v>
<v Speaker 2>musical chairs.</v>

326
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

327
00:15:41.721 --> 00:15:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was at the house and the waves</v>
<v Speaker 2>would hit underneath the house so hard</v>

328
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 2>that the house would shake it around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was like it was like a plan for am</v>

329
00:15:50.601 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 2>high tide earthquake of the waves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like you're counting on the fact</v>

330
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 2>that there isn't that rogue 15 footer</v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes in and just wipes out your</v>

331
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:01.550
<v Speaker 2>whole window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up because the first day,</v>

332
00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:05.600
<v Speaker 2>literally the first day we stayed there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got barbecued,</v>

333
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 2>like barbecued on edibles and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were downstairs.</v>

334
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.970
<v Speaker 2>There's three floors to this house we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were renting in.</v>

335
00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>The first floor was literally the water</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>

336
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you could open the window and jump into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water and it's a four foot drop and</v>

337
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exaggerating.</v>

338
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.680
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the daytime it looks so amazing.</v>

339
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 2>It's so beautiful and Baloo and lovely</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sea,</v>

340
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:35.960
<v Speaker 2>the birds and the waves are so gentle</v>
<v Speaker 2>and inviting.</v>

341
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.040
<v Speaker 2>But at nighttime in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a monster,</v>

342
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 2>like giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>

343
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.800
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncaring beast that will swallow you</v>

344
00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:50.600
<v Speaker 2>whole and not give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absorbed a billion people before</v>

345
00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:53.600
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll absorb you just as easy and you</v>

346
00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:56.060
<v Speaker 2>realize the true nature of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it's dark,</v>

347
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 2>when it's dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

348
00:16:57.321 --> 00:17:00.030
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like another world like you're,</v>

349
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.490
<v Speaker 2>it's like as if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could get a high rise and that</v>

350
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.030
<v Speaker 2>high rise could like hit the edge of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative galaxy.</v>

351
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could like climb on top of your</v>

352
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:15.110
<v Speaker 2>roof and throw rocks into the event</v>
<v Speaker 2>horizon of a black hole and they would</v>

353
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 2>disappear into another galaxy and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost what it's like.</v>

354
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's another world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

355
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 2>and the farther you get out into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

356
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.680
<v Speaker 2>crazier it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

357
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Because there's no limit on the depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going over one of those chasms</v>

358
00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 2>that are miles deep and had no fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea what animals are in there.</v>

359
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's where these ideas of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>crackings,</v>

360
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 2>these beasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deep would come because he plays</v>

361
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:39.320
<v Speaker 2>with our subconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's outer space,</v>

362
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:41.900
<v Speaker 2>but in our planet and underneath us in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water,</v>

363
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're just looking at this like,</v>

364
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:46.190
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something could definitely come up there</v>

365
00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.030
<v Speaker 2>and eat me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially,</v>

366
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have enough vitamin C,</v>

367
00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.120
<v Speaker 2>you're getting too much sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a little delirious.</v>

368
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden you'd fucking seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>mermaids and sea monsters and shit.</v>

369
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

370
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

371
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 2>they found cracking suction cups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they call those things?</v>

372
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 2>What do they call the suction cups?</v>

373
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Tentacles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just suckers.</v>

374
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:11.700
<v Speaker 2>They found them in a fossilized form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that would indicate something that's</v>

375
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 2>well over 100 foot octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was a real animal at one point</v>

376
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:18.560
<v Speaker 2>in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this idea of the crack.</v>

377
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.940
<v Speaker 2>The problem with those things is when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they die,</v>

378
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:23.730
<v Speaker 2>they just die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there are soft tissue animal.</v>

379
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 2>All they have is a beak and that gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>absorbed by the ocean too.</v>

380
00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:31.710
<v Speaker 2>So there's virtually no evidence other</v>
<v Speaker 2>than these fossilized suction cups they</v>

381
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:33.040
<v Speaker 2>found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when they found him,</v>

382
00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:34.110
<v Speaker 2>they went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

383
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're talking about,</v>

384
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking garbage can lids that are</v>

385
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:44.460
<v Speaker 2>suction cups and you just think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how big is the fucking technical</v>

386
00:18:44.461 --> 00:18:46.440
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

387
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:48.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like an aggressive garbage disposal</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

388
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.110
<v Speaker 2>That is all the tentacles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grab everything that is soft enough to</v>

389
00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 2>get chomped by that beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grab it,</v>

390
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.360
<v Speaker 2>push it in and smart as fuck and fast.</v>

391
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was another article recently where</v>

392
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:03.930
<v Speaker 2>the scientists were saying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially octopuses are aliens.</v>

393
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.800
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have more chromosomes and any other</v>

394
00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 2>observed animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're different than any observed</v>

395
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:15.201
<v Speaker 2>animal be besides cuddle fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their ability to rapidly adapt and</v>

396
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:19.440
<v Speaker 2>camouflage themselves to their</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment is unprecedented.</v>

397
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 2>They change their texture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they changed what they look like.</v>

398
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.890
<v Speaker 2>I had a Ramey warrant on who's a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and he has a television show called</v>

399
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Apex Predator and one of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of his a apex Predator episodes and</v>

400
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.840
<v Speaker 2>in his show he's a hunter and he used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be on the show called Solo hunter where</v>

401
00:19:36.841 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 2>he would go by himself with like a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cameras and just go deep deep into</v>

402
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:46.461
<v Speaker 2>the woods and hunt and sort of ics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>capture this experience in this really</v>

403
00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:50.940
<v Speaker 2>remote forest is in a really cool way</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was literally just him like</v>

404
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Speaker 2>survivor man style with a few cameras</v>
<v Speaker 2>setup and hunting and then cooking the</v>

405
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:58.890
<v Speaker 2>food and eating it and heading back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>running into some weird difficulties and</v>

406
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:01.080
<v Speaker 2>dangers and strange animals while he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there too,</v>

407
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 2>but he did an episode on octopus and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>came in and was talking to us about it</v>

408
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 2>and it fucking blew my mind.</v>

409
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Add no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean I was 47,</v>

410
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:12.180
<v Speaker 2>48 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea that a fucking octopus</v>

411
00:20:12.181 --> 00:20:15.840
<v Speaker 2>could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can change like that instantaneous.</v>

412
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I think I've told this story on here</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

413
00:20:17.521 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 2>but I got to see one in Fiji and watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

414
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Virgin man hunt it and it was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>craziest experiences ever.</v>

415
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.880
<v Speaker 2>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was flowing over the coral and just</v>

416
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.310
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of his body would be one color,</v>

417
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.990
<v Speaker 2>half the other color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fast.</v>

418
00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like it weighted because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a noise and chameleons in Texas.</v>

419
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.150
<v Speaker 2>They plant somewhere and there's some</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird color that they're not supposed to</v>

420
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:43.050
<v Speaker 2>be and then eventually they turn into</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown for tree bark or green for the</v>

421
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 2>leaves or whatever they're at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not an octopus man.</v>

422
00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 2>That shit is instant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instantaneous.</v>

423
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.040
<v Speaker 1>And when he was fighting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he eventually goes down,</v>

424
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 1>their jams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hand in there and the octopus bites</v>

425
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:55.840
<v Speaker 1>and there's blood in the water was this</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy struggle.</v>

426
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:57.880
<v Speaker 1>But eventually he jams his hand back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

427
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.150
<v Speaker 1>pulls the octopus out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when he was fighting with the</v>

428
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:05.350
<v Speaker 1>octopus on the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the octopus knew to go for his airway.</v>

429
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Like it was wrapping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept wrapping its tentacles around his</v>

430
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 1>mouth and his nose as he was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get this thing off his head.</v>

431
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.180
<v Speaker 1>He knew exactly what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pulling off so eventually</v>

432
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 1>wrestles is snorkel free and starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>beating it to get it to calm down.</v>

433
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 1>And he brought it to the shore and</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbecued it.</v>

434
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Now everybody else was just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrified at this show because it was</v>

435
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.820
<v Speaker 1>completely savage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was the octopus trying to</v>

436
00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:32.821
<v Speaker 1>choke the airway of this primate in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>primate being stronger and more</v>

437
00:21:32.921 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 1>determined and using a snorkel is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bludgeoned to,</v>

438
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.070
<v Speaker 1>to kill it so he could eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I want to.</v>

439
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I like octopus is delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think on my backend off that there</v>

440
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.830
<v Speaker 1>might be a little too fucking smart for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to be eating them.</v>

441
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

442
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:50.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's again that bias that have of all</v>

443
00:21:50.161 --> 00:21:51.900
<v Speaker 2>of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if people say,</v>

444
00:21:51.901 --> 00:21:53.670
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this animals too intelligent to eat,</v>

445
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.690
<v Speaker 2>but there are a pescatarian when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably eating the fuck out of some</v>

446
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.070
<v Speaker 2>octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are way smarter than deer.</v>

447
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.150
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

448
00:22:00.151 --> 00:22:02.010
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's just a weird.</v>

449
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole weird dynamic that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what we decide we should or couldn't</v>

450
00:22:05.341 --> 00:22:07.710
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's a good point for people that</v>

451
00:22:07.711 --> 00:22:10.980
<v Speaker 2>are vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are a Vegan and you think you</v>

452
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:16.070
<v Speaker 2>need some form of protein other than I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a look at this thing,</v>

453
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.030
<v Speaker 2>killing a shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

454
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.590
<v Speaker 2>if you need some sort of protein other</v>
<v Speaker 2>than I'm a ethically raised chickens,</v>

455
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:25.650
<v Speaker 2>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is harmless and doesn't hurt</v>

456
00:22:25.651 --> 00:22:27.120
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

457
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:32.150
<v Speaker 2>mollusks apparently there's a real good</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument that they are incapable of</v>

458
00:22:32.311 --> 00:22:33.660
<v Speaker 2>feeling any pain at all.</v>

459
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.880
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have zero emotions,</v>

460
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.580
<v Speaker 2>zero reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have one instinctive reaction to</v>

461
00:22:38.581 --> 00:22:40.710
<v Speaker 2>close their shell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

462
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Like they're barely an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get you some cashew milk.</v>

463
00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Clam Chowder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clam chowder is got milk in it.</v>

464
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

465
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:50.920
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

466
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Cashew milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you had this?</v>

467
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just made it up with somebody to do it</v>

468
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.950
<v Speaker 2>in Austin right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's opening up cash register,</v>

469
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.880
<v Speaker 2>clam chowder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking food truck.</v>

470
00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.450
<v Speaker 2>But like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like scallops,</v>

471
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.480
<v Speaker 2>scallops are probably the most delicious</v>
<v Speaker 2>food on the planet.</v>

472
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Like pound for pound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

473
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:09.600
<v Speaker 2>they're right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they're,</v>

474
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.610
<v Speaker 2>if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're just like a meat thing,</v>

475
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like essentially what I'm saying is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

476
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.250
<v Speaker 2>there are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.920
<v Speaker 2>how they have the scientists that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing meet in laboratory and dishes</v>

478
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.930
<v Speaker 2>there that with a hard shell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can eat them convenient</v>

479
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:29.130
<v Speaker 2>packaging because I know a lot of vegans</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are absolutely nutritionally</v>

480
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.053
<v Speaker 2>deficient.</v>

481
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.870
<v Speaker 2>They're not getting enough vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not getting enough d three,</v>

482
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:36.600
<v Speaker 2>they're not getting enough [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're definitely not getting enough</v>

483
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.740
<v Speaker 2>essential fatty acids unless they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>scooping coconut oil and almond butter</v>

484
00:23:40.741 --> 00:23:44.610
<v Speaker 2>into their mouth everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cla different things and you know,</v>

485
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.580
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're committed to the cause and so</v>

486
00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:49.790
<v Speaker 2>they're just physically not doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best because of it.</v>

487
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

488
00:23:50.551 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 2>do you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start,</v>

489
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.830
<v Speaker 2>as you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've talked about the intelligence and</v>

490
00:23:53.831 --> 00:23:56.120
<v Speaker 2>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start looking at that and then</v>

491
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:59.630
<v Speaker 2>versus a mollusk they're way smarter</v>
<v Speaker 2>than a mollusk yeah.</v>

492
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Are Mollusks and plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're possibly fairly equivalent,</v>

493
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like the whole cause of,</v>

494
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.600
<v Speaker 2>of why you're not eating them gets a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little blurry when you start reading.</v>

495
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.750
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well plants are smart as shit and</v>

496
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.470
<v Speaker 2>mollusks are mollusks and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably equivalent.</v>

497
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Just one has the ability to move</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly more than the other one.</v>

498
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The movement thing is something that we</v>

499
00:24:21.441 --> 00:24:24.050
<v Speaker 2>cling to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we essentially cleaned too is</v>

500
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 2>things that are closest to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we really don't give a fuck about</v>

501
00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:29.960
<v Speaker 2>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're worried about people killing</v>

502
00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:32.660
<v Speaker 2>all the fish in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're worried about the police in the</v>

503
00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when a little kid catching the fish,</v>

504
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go and look at the instagram page,</v>

505
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.490
<v Speaker 2>there's no hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

506
00:24:40.491 --> 00:24:43.250
<v Speaker 2>a little kid shoots a bear back the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

507
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.050
<v Speaker 2>You don't even want to read those</v>
<v Speaker 2>comments.</v>

508
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something,</v>

509
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 2>if someone eats a bear like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's too close to a dog dogs.</v>

510
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:53.660
<v Speaker 2>My friend dogs are just like people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sally's my baby.</v>

511
00:24:53.661 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 2>She's a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bears just like sally and I</v>

512
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:57.020
<v Speaker 2>can't eat a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

513
00:24:57.021 --> 00:24:58.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just anthropomorphization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

514
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Like just putting human traits on</v>
<v Speaker 2>different animals,</v>

515
00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:03.500
<v Speaker 2>which I can totally see.</v>

516
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some animals that seem more</v>

517
00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we recognize more attributes than</v>

518
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.480
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

519
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I have a thing with wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

520
00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely have some sort of a weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthropomorphization thing with wolves</v>

521
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.900
<v Speaker 2>were um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

522
00:25:17.901 --> 00:25:21.380
<v Speaker 2>I think there were like probably my</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite animals ever.</v>

523
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:23.030
<v Speaker 2>There's the fucking coolest things of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>

524
00:25:23.031 --> 00:25:23.864
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

525
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.960
<v Speaker 2>they have these packs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They mate for life,</v>

526
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.590
<v Speaker 2>they get together and fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this social group,</v>

527
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.910
<v Speaker 2>they have this really complex method of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting where they communicate with each</v>

528
00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:37.310
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They howl out to each other and they</v>

529
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 2>have like a roll call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

530
00:25:39.291 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 2>there are complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really intense society.</v>

531
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't hold it against him that they</v>

532
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:46.940
<v Speaker 2>mate for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll excuse them.</v>

533
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:50.060
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty amazing because their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is hard as fuck.</v>

534
00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:52.040
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't last long because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be a pimp.</v>

535
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:57.260
<v Speaker 2>But apparently there's a documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a wolf and ironically enough to</v>

536
00:25:57.261 --> 00:26:00.440
<v Speaker 2>call it the black wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a black wolf that</v>

537
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.470
<v Speaker 2>apparently wasn't following any of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and this wolf would go across the</v>

538
00:26:05.841 --> 00:26:08.810
<v Speaker 2>highway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the rest of the pack and lure</v>

539
00:26:08.811 --> 00:26:12.500
<v Speaker 2>the women over to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was banging these women and</v>

540
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.420
<v Speaker 2>female wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously not women,</v>

541
00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really anthropomorphizing now.</v>

542
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

543
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 2>and then protecting actual bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

544
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.090
<v Speaker 2>And wouldn't the right way of saying it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wouldn't mate in,</v>

545
00:26:26.091 --> 00:26:29.570
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't like find a mate for life until</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was old.</v>

546
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.480
<v Speaker 2>And then when he's old as are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come back and start running shit.</v>

547
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 2>And then when he's old he came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a mate,</v>

548
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.030
<v Speaker 2>started running things and just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>settled down.</v>

549
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.360
<v Speaker 2>But it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this wolf had chosen a</v>

550
00:26:41.361 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 2>different way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a documentary</v>

551
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.900
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because,</v>

552
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

553
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.860
<v Speaker 1>in all of these Iowasca trips and all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

554
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to animals of all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>variety.</v>

555
00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could be just pure imagination,</v>

556
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:55.820
<v Speaker 1>but in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

557
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.800
<v Speaker 1>they always have lessons or things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we discussed.</v>

558
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:03.310
<v Speaker 1>And one of the common themes is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of freewill that the animal hat.</v>

559
00:27:03.311 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 1>So when I talked to the insects and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really talk,</v>

560
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.920
<v Speaker 1>you don't talk to one insect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked to the insect over mine.</v>

561
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could all just be my imagination,</v>

562
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:13.650
<v Speaker 1>but it helps me understand things a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talked to the insect over mine and</v>

563
00:27:13.651 --> 00:27:17.310
<v Speaker 1>the insects say basically we are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trash keepers of the,</v>

564
00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we have no flexibility for</v>

565
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:21.630
<v Speaker 1>freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we all decided to go on strike,</v>

566
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:22.740
<v Speaker 1>the world's fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

567
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.910
<v Speaker 1>nothing gets decomposed.</v>

568
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 1>There's no spare parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We run out of spare parts for the world.</v>

569
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing else gets built.</v>

570
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:30.810
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing goes to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The food source at the very bottom,</v>

571
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.000
<v Speaker 1>so we have no freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were perfect,</v>

572
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.500
<v Speaker 1>perfect creatures acting in perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>accordance with the laws of nature to</v>

573
00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 1>allow it to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where you get these things like the</v>

574
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:41.820
<v Speaker 1>atomic automatons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the digger wasps.</v>

575
00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 1>But no matter how much you fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

576
00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:45.120
<v Speaker 1>they'll try to do the same thing over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

577
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Well really that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's perfect because it's doing</v>

578
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.750
<v Speaker 1>absolutely what it must and then you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on up the up the chain towards the</v>

579
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:55.200
<v Speaker 1>mammals and there's gets to be greater</v>
<v Speaker 1>and greater access to free will.</v>

580
00:27:55.201 --> 00:27:58.200
<v Speaker 1>So you talked to like I've talked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins and dolphins.</v>

581
00:27:58.201 --> 00:28:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Spirit was like super happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playful and they said,</v>

582
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins,</v>

583
00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:06.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the best existence of all because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have greater access to free will,</v>

584
00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 1>we can choose to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can choose the fuck,</v>

585
00:28:08.281 --> 00:28:10.440
<v Speaker 1>we can choose these different elements.</v>

586
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Getting food is easy and it's also how</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy it is to get food.</v>

587
00:28:13.141 --> 00:28:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Like getting food is easy for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

588
00:28:15.211 --> 00:28:18.540
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of natural predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have kind of the ultimate</v>

589
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.940
<v Speaker 1>existence and we don't have the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

590
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:23.150
<v Speaker 1>which is the ultimate Sabbath tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

591
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.850
<v Speaker 1>it's our own minds that lock us in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These depressions and anxieties and</v>

592
00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:30.960
<v Speaker 1>hell's and dolphins don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of self awareness that they've</v>

593
00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:33.330
<v Speaker 1>created all the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like they're in this</v>

594
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.590
<v Speaker 1>perfect sweet spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that you feel</v>

595
00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:40.890
<v Speaker 1>when you encounter in both in real life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and envision is that they're just happy</v>

596
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 1>as fuck because they have the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>flexibility with the least amount of</v>

597
00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:45.390
<v Speaker 1>troubles that come from it.</v>

598
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about this on the,</v>

599
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.250
<v Speaker 3>on the ride when we were in Edmonton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alberta Rather.</v>

600
00:28:52.251 --> 00:28:55.250
<v Speaker 3>And it was really interesting because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about,</v>

601
00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:00.080
<v Speaker 3>was it Ben O'brian that was telling us</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a queen that got stuck in</v>

602
00:29:00.081 --> 00:29:02.570
<v Speaker 3>someone's car queen bee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got in a car,</v>

603
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:07.160
<v Speaker 3>a queen bee got stuck in someone's car</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the colony followed them for like 20</v>

604
00:29:07.161 --> 00:29:11.850
<v Speaker 3>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some insane amount of distance and you</v>

605
00:29:11.851 --> 00:29:13.190
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy was just getting fucking</v>

606
00:29:13.191 --> 00:29:15.560
<v Speaker 3>followed by bees and couldn't figure out</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell was going on.</v>

607
00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a mandate.</v>

608
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.600
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no freewill.</v>

609
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:24.020
<v Speaker 3>There was no discussion whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of fine.</v>

610
00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Like they were just going to fly to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end and they flew and found this guy's</v>

611
00:29:29.091 --> 00:29:33.410
<v Speaker 3>car with the fucking queen in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know how it got resolved but</v>

612
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:34.280
<v Speaker 3>how they knew</v>

613
00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.180
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

614
00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.910
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it follows that that would be the,</v>

615
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.950
<v Speaker 1>that would be the behavior because</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

616
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.360
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the flexibility to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because everything would fall</v>

617
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:44.051
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

618
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 1>they're like the perfect robots of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

619
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.551
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 1>you start talking about these</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctions between life and,</v>

621
00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence life.</v>

622
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I think really consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill are inexorably linked.</v>

623
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Like that is kind of the key component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

624
00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.660
<v Speaker 1>like yes these insects are alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are they fully conscious?</v>

625
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I think it really depends on their</v>

626
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 1>access to free will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to make a choice.</v>

627
00:30:09.431 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that is the defining</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of consciousness is</v>

628
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:13.804
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

629
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Well that's another weird thing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are really into animals.</v>

630
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:22.110
<v Speaker 3>Like we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll make a distinction between animals</v>

631
00:30:22.111 --> 00:30:24.630
<v Speaker 3>and insects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have friends that just fucking</v>

632
00:30:24.631 --> 00:30:27.450
<v Speaker 3>love animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They adopt dogs and cats and.</v>

633
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.570
<v Speaker 3>But they'll fucking kill any bug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on their counter.</v>

634
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.380
<v Speaker 3>Know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll see a bug or other counter.</v>

635
00:30:34.381 --> 00:30:35.370
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you bitch,</v>

636
00:30:35.371 --> 00:30:36.720
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be random.</v>

637
00:30:36.721 --> 00:30:40.470
<v Speaker 3>Harmless beetle over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a mosquito lands on them.</v>

638
00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Slap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

639
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.340
<v Speaker 3>there's no negotiating with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With insects.</v>

640
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.970
<v Speaker 3>We find an insect but they won't eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

641
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.380
<v Speaker 3>which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

642
00:30:49.381 --> 00:30:51.750
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cricket protein bars.</v>

643
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

644
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just.</v>

645
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Vegans don't eat bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't need animal protein.</v>

646
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.250
<v Speaker 3>They're responsible for the death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

647
00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:02.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to put this on you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a Vegan,</v>

648
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you buy grain from a store,</v>

649
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:11.010
<v Speaker 3>you are directly responsible for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>death of countless bugs.</v>

650
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Countless rodents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how many rabbits.</v>

651
00:31:14.011 --> 00:31:17.550
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how many deer fonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you buy anything that is</v>

652
00:31:17.551 --> 00:31:21.870
<v Speaker 3>indiscriminately collected with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>combine and that's how they get grain.</v>

653
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.750
<v Speaker 3>They have these huge machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've never seen it before,</v>

654
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull up a grain combine inaction because</v>

655
00:31:28.681 --> 00:31:29.850
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

656
00:31:29.851 --> 00:31:34.680
<v Speaker 3>That is some alien machine sent down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheer the earth.</v>

657
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.840
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of fucking.</v>

658
00:31:36.841 --> 00:31:38.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird way we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

659
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:41.190
<v Speaker 3>we used to do it with like the grim</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaper sickle,</v>

660
00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how they used to do at that cool</v>

661
00:31:42.961 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 3>thing with the two handles on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is aside?</v>

662
00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.360
<v Speaker 3>What's the definition of sickle and</v>
<v Speaker 3>aside sickles?</v>

663
00:31:48.361 --> 00:31:49.320
<v Speaker 3>The Russian thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

664
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what does that one smaller one.</v>

665
00:31:51.241 --> 00:31:55.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a handheld jammy</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

666
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.510
<v Speaker 3>When they use those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

667
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.250
<v Speaker 3>it's that that's only one aspect of one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that's problematic about</v>

668
00:32:02.251 --> 00:32:06.720
<v Speaker 3>large scale collecting of food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at this fucking thing.</v>

669
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.410
<v Speaker 3>This enormous machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not even a big one.</v>

670
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:14.220
<v Speaker 3>That's a fairly small one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have ones that are like a football</v>

671
00:32:14.221 --> 00:32:14.941
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

672
00:32:14.941 --> 00:32:15.980
<v Speaker 3>At the mega farms?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

673
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.500
<v Speaker 3>This is like something like if you had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>small farm you would do,</v>

674
00:32:19.501 --> 00:32:22.710
<v Speaker 3>but anything that's in there is getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>chewed up.</v>

675
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.220
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things about fonts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really unfortunate,</v>

676
00:32:26.221 --> 00:32:31.080
<v Speaker 3>but fonds when they're young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will lie down in these fields and</v>

677
00:32:31.081 --> 00:32:34.470
<v Speaker 3>they don't move because they can't run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't run any predators.</v>

678
00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.100
<v Speaker 3>So their strategy is to just not move</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hope something doesn't find them.</v>

679
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why</v>

680
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.470
<v Speaker 1>they have those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

681
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.340
<v Speaker 1>the coloration on their bodies very</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

682
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 1>They have the white spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of a nature's version of</v>

683
00:32:46.971 --> 00:32:49.130
<v Speaker 1>some sort of form of camouflage to blend</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

684
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.960
<v Speaker 1>But those poor fonds get chewed up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things all the time.</v>

685
00:32:53.961 --> 00:32:58.961
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is a large scale corn farm in</v>

686
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Illinois and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

687
00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:05.630
<v Speaker 1>they make a corn for mostly for</v>
<v Speaker 1>livestock.</v>

688
00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 1>They grow corn for livestock and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have those giant,</v>

689
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 1>huge ones and they just chew fonds up</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

690
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem that a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>make is they attribute morality to the</v>

691
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:18.830
<v Speaker 1>actions you're taking rather than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention behind it.</v>

692
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.520
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think people make that mistake a</v>

693
00:33:22.521 --> 00:33:25.280
<v Speaker 1>lot really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's hunting good or bad.</v>

694
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a ridiculous question to ask.</v>

695
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:31.010
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the intention of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter while he's doing it.</v>

696
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's why a lot of people</v>

697
00:33:33.231 --> 00:33:37.610
<v Speaker 1>reserve this kind of native American</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea because we feel and we understand</v>

698
00:33:37.611 --> 00:33:42.611
<v Speaker 1>that the intentions of that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hunter was in a way that was</v>

699
00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:45.420
<v Speaker 1>different than the guy just looking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a trophy on as well,</v>

700
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those automatic guns that are on</v>

701
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:53.351
<v Speaker 1>a camera that shooting animals that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the act that's either good nor</v>

702
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:56.030
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor is it Vegan good nor bad.</v>

703
00:33:56.031 --> 00:34:00.050
<v Speaker 1>It's about the intentions behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think people tend to lose that</v>

704
00:34:00.051 --> 00:34:00.890
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

705
00:34:00.891 --> 00:34:02.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in bear camp,</v>

706
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 1>that's what I needed to get straight is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what my intentions were.</v>

707
00:34:06.681 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 1>If I was going after the hunt a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would be cool and cam would think I</v>

708
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:13.370
<v Speaker 1>was cool and everybody in the hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>party would be like,</v>

709
00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:15.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was the wrong intention for</v>

710
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:15.470
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

711
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's what a lot of the work was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the part of what the taking</v>

712
00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:22.220
<v Speaker 1>the mushrooms was for was to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that my intention in doing it was the</v>

713
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:25.310
<v Speaker 1>right intention and that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what was that intention?</v>

714
00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it was some part meet acquisition.</v>

715
00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to have that experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking my own meat from the field,</v>

716
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:35.150
<v Speaker 1>which was incredibly powerful for me the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time I wanted and then I wanted to</v>

717
00:34:35.151 --> 00:34:38.060
<v Speaker 1>have to be able to use the code and use</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

718
00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:41.450
<v Speaker 1>the clause for jewelry and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect with that.</v>

719
00:34:41.451 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that if that intention was leading,</v>

720
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:48.050
<v Speaker 1>then it was a correct action for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that intention was not leading and I</v>

721
00:34:48.051 --> 00:34:50.150
<v Speaker 1>was doing it to be cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it because I was nervous</v>

722
00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:53.750
<v Speaker 1>or any other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it wasn't immoral act for me and</v>

723
00:34:53.751 --> 00:34:55.670
<v Speaker 1>that's to me how I just kind of sorted</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

724
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.950
<v Speaker 1>So I was able to get to that comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>place where I knew that I.</v>

725
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 1>If the bear came the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right bore came,</v>

726
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I was going to do it for the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention because I'd worked through all</v>

727
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:09.740
<v Speaker 1>of the other forces and pressures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to be cool or the desire for</v>

728
00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:11.600
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are all these other reasons that</v>

729
00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:13.160
<v Speaker 1>would have made that act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Cool.</v>

730
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked through those as best I</v>

731
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:17.390
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I knew if the bear came,</v>

732
00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:21.590
<v Speaker 1>I was comfortable killing and I had no</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea in my head that this was the wrong</v>

733
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:25.340
<v Speaker 1>thing because my intentions were right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well also your intentions.</v>

734
00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had many opportunities to kill a</v>

735
00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:32.141
<v Speaker 1>bear as it I totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we go for is very big mature</v>

736
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:35.450
<v Speaker 1>bears for a couple reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

737
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 1>because very big mature bears kill cubs.</v>

738
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the favorite things to eat</v>

739
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:43.050
<v Speaker 2>when they come out of hibernation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really fucked up.</v>

740
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.920
<v Speaker 2>They actively hunt cubs that go for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

741
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:49.140
<v Speaker 2>They even go into dance and pulled them</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of Dan's and kill them.</v>

742
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of debate as to why they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

743
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 2>The initial thought was that it brings</v>
<v Speaker 2>the female back into estrous and that</v>

744
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:01.590
<v Speaker 2>the bear can breed with the female and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way that bears passing on his</v>

745
00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:04.520
<v Speaker 2>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some scientists and</v>

746
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:09.090
<v Speaker 2>biologists and wildlife biologists that</v>
<v Speaker 2>believed that just doing it for meat and</v>

747
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:12.450
<v Speaker 2>it's just there's a lot of competition</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and it's hard to get meat and</v>

748
00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 2>this is meat and they've gotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>accustomed to it and whether they're</v>

749
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:20.361
<v Speaker 2>doing it because they're hungry or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're doing it because they</v>

750
00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:25.110
<v Speaker 2>want the female to survive a and or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back into heat and breed again.</v>

751
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Either way they're they're killing cubs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're limiting the DNA.</v>

752
00:36:28.651 --> 00:36:33.651
<v Speaker 2>They're limiting the genetics and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not good for the overall population of</v>

753
00:36:33.811 --> 00:36:37.890
<v Speaker 2>the bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is when you kill the large</v>

754
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:42.660
<v Speaker 2>male bores that what you're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually enhancing the genetics</v>

755
00:36:42.661 --> 00:36:45.900
<v Speaker 2>of the area and you're saving the cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

756
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems counterintuitive.</v>

757
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:50.880
<v Speaker 2>When you kill bores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually increasing the</v>

758
00:36:50.881 --> 00:36:52.410
<v Speaker 2>population of bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

759
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.330
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

760
00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at it outside of the world</v>

761
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:58.650
<v Speaker 2>of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't have all the information</v>

762
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.750
<v Speaker 2>at your fingerprints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

763
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.860
<v Speaker 2>you have this idea that like hunters are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those bad guys in that wolverine</v>

764
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:07.080
<v Speaker 2>movie that we're poisoning the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that?</v>

765
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.810
<v Speaker 2>They're always in the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always the assholes that are</v>

766
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:11.000
<v Speaker 2>killing bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

767
00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.140
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile wolverine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll sit down and eat a steak and he's</v>

768
00:37:13.141 --> 00:37:13.974
<v Speaker 2>a good guy.</v>

769
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Very were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were so fucking torture.</v>

770
00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Didn't and twisted when it comes to our</v>
<v Speaker 2>morality.</v>

771
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.650
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

772
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:25.170
<v Speaker 2>also the big one is the population of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the traditional game.</v>

773
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Animals like the Moose and the deer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elk.</v>

774
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.830
<v Speaker 2>They get decimated by bears and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fonz.</v>

775
00:37:31.831 --> 00:37:34.980
<v Speaker 2>They kill all the fonts and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the calves.</v>

776
00:37:34.981 --> 00:37:39.981
<v Speaker 2>And that's a huge problem in those</v>
<v Speaker 2>regions like Alberta where we were,</v>

777
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:42.510
<v Speaker 2>which is just overrun with bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

778
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:46.080
<v Speaker 2>have you ever imagined you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see that many bears in the first night</v>

779
00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 2>we were out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was eight,</v>

780
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.590
<v Speaker 2>nine different barriers just cruising</v>
<v Speaker 2>around crazy all within five to 15,</v>

781
00:37:52.591 --> 00:37:54.240
<v Speaker 2>20 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

782
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.320
<v Speaker 2>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

783
00:37:55.321 --> 00:37:59.220
<v Speaker 2>one of the stories that Cam told I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave me one of the biggest lessons and</v>

784
00:37:59.221 --> 00:38:04.110
<v Speaker 2>takeaways of the trip for me was the one</v>
<v Speaker 2>who told about there was a mother with</v>

785
00:38:04.111 --> 00:38:07.250
<v Speaker 2>her cubs and the cubs were kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cruising around and then a,</v>

786
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:12.090
<v Speaker 2>a big male bear came in and then killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the cubs and I think the mother</v>

787
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:15.630
<v Speaker 2>like scared her off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scared off the bore and it was just a</v>

788
00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:17.190
<v Speaker 2>dead cub that she had there.</v>

789
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:22.550
<v Speaker 2>And so for a moment the mother kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanders around and looked like she was</v>

790
00:38:22.921 --> 00:38:24.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mourning the death of this cup,</v>

791
00:38:24.391 --> 00:38:26.910
<v Speaker 2>but just for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then within minutes,</v>

792
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds it was eating.</v>

793
00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:32.520
<v Speaker 2>The cub was eating her own cup and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like a really,</v>

794
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we humans have this idea of this trauma</v>

795
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>we carry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

796
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 1>if our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if our kid got got killed,</v>

797
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would carry that trauma for the rest</v>

798
00:38:40.391 --> 00:38:41.500
<v Speaker 1>of our life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the bear,</v>

799
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a moment of recognition,</v>

800
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.030
<v Speaker 1>but bears are constantly living in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present moment.</v>

801
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.480
<v Speaker 1>They're like the embodiment of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present moment and in the present moment</v>

802
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.940
<v Speaker 1>that death happened in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that death was over.</v>

803
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:57.060
<v Speaker 1>What's there now is there's meat on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground that'll feed her and provide an</v>

804
00:38:57.341 --> 00:39:00.210
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for her to live longer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide for the rest of her cubs.</v>

805
00:39:00.211 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's a simple decision at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we don't carry the traumas of our</v>

806
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 1>past with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's meat on the ground.</v>

807
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.050
<v Speaker 1>You eat the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that simple,</v>

808
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.460
<v Speaker 1>that simple thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's in that way it's wide.</v>

809
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Like nature is really perfect because</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature is always in the present moment.</v>

810
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:17.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was blasted on the mushrooms and</v>

811
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I went to that bear carcass near where a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cam and killed his bear.</v>

812
00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:23.260
<v Speaker 1>They had this just decomposing bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>carcass,</v>

813
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:25.150
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking mushrooms and seeing a</v>

814
00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:26.640
<v Speaker 1>decomposing bear carcass with.</v>

815
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't really that decomposing like</v>

816
00:39:29.521 --> 00:39:32.130
<v Speaker 3>was it one night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was one from a week before.</v>

817
00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like there was another one that</v>

818
00:39:34.521 --> 00:39:37.460
<v Speaker 1>they've already taken all the skin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the meat off of,</v>

819
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:42.200
<v Speaker 1>so it's just the bones in the organs</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were there and cam had his.</v>

820
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.420
<v Speaker 1>His bear is still nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even smelling or anything.</v>

821
00:39:44.421 --> 00:39:48.080
<v Speaker 1>It looked great fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this other bear which was right in</v>

822
00:39:48.081 --> 00:39:51.870
<v Speaker 1>the same area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting because I was</v>

823
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:57.020
<v Speaker 1>very aware of the forest around it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just looked at the forest around it and</v>

824
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.080
<v Speaker 1>the forest was not mourning the death of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bear,</v>

825
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.030
<v Speaker 1>the foresters in the present moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just going about the business of</v>

826
00:40:02.031 --> 00:40:06.590
<v Speaker 1>returning that bear to spare parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had no traumatic memory of that</v>

827
00:40:06.591 --> 00:40:10.580
<v Speaker 1>incident and it's really how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how nature works perfectly because it's</v>

828
00:40:10.581 --> 00:40:14.630
<v Speaker 1>always in the present moment like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The body doesn't weep for the death of a</v>

829
00:40:14.631 --> 00:40:15.464
<v Speaker 1>cell.</v>

830
00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Cells die all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bodies in the presence so it</v>

831
00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:21.110
<v Speaker 1>just carries on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't carry that trauma with it,</v>

832
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:23.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately the forest doesn't.</v>

833
00:40:23.451 --> 00:40:27.500
<v Speaker 1>We've for the death of the bear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately the cosmos won't weep for the</v>

834
00:40:27.501 --> 00:40:29.480
<v Speaker 1>death of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the sun explodes.</v>

835
00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

836
00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:33.550
<v Speaker 1>like everything will just be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present and that's,</v>

837
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:37.670
<v Speaker 1>that's where you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ease of all the suffering is so much</v>

838
00:40:37.671 --> 00:40:41.300
<v Speaker 1>of our own suffering is we're carrying</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these dead bodies of the past with</v>

839
00:40:41.301 --> 00:40:45.440
<v Speaker 1>us all the time and these expectations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the future and that's where we get so</v>

840
00:40:45.441 --> 00:40:47.750
<v Speaker 1>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we really look to nature,</v>

841
00:40:47.751 --> 00:40:52.070
<v Speaker 1>nature has this allure and this beauty</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just constant presence and</v>

842
00:40:52.071 --> 00:40:54.290
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just looking on the bleeding edge</v>

843
00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:58.400
<v Speaker 1>of now and making decisions based upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rather than these mental</v>

844
00:40:58.401 --> 00:40:59.234
<v Speaker 1>constructs.</v>

845
00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this beautifully intense system</v>

846
00:41:01.681 --> 00:41:05.610
<v Speaker 3>that's just constantly moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just constantly moving forward.</v>

847
00:41:05.611 --> 00:41:09.450
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that I find so</v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive about wolves and I think many</v>

848
00:41:09.451 --> 00:41:12.380
<v Speaker 3>people do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so romantic in that their,</v>

849
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:17.160
<v Speaker 3>their existence is so vibrant and</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful and so brief.</v>

850
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a wolf is super lucky,</v>

851
00:41:19.181 --> 00:41:21.070
<v Speaker 3>they get to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

852
00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.250
<v Speaker 3>I think getting managed imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

853
00:41:23.251 --> 00:41:25.890
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my middle daughter's eight years old,</v>

854
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.850
<v Speaker 3>like wrap your head around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A wolf is like almost dead.</v>

855
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Like I have a dog that's 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's almost done.</v>

856
00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:32.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

857
00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.040
<v Speaker 3>he's got gray all over his face and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>limps when he walks now and he likes to</v>

858
00:41:37.041 --> 00:41:39.040
<v Speaker 3>lay down mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

859
00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a wolf man.</v>

860
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 3>Ten years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all they get.</v>

861
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 3>But during that 10 year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck they live.</v>

862
00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just run in howland together and</v>

863
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:49.130
<v Speaker 3>grabbing the back.</v>

864
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the crazy things about</v>

865
00:41:50.721 --> 00:41:55.721
<v Speaker 3>wolves to that I admire in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real fucked up way that they kill for</v>

866
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:58.940
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they sport kill,</v>

867
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.480
<v Speaker 3>you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's people that love animals.</v>

868
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 3>When you bring that up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they defended to the death.</v>

869
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go off about it and know whether</v>

870
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.830
<v Speaker 3>the animals were probably sick and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking them off.</v>

871
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're having a fucking blast.</v>

872
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 3>They're running around and tearing these</v>
<v Speaker 3>elka part.</v>

873
00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Like we were talking about it a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of weeks ago.</v>

874
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 3>They found 19 dead elk that these wolves</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even eat.</v>

875
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:25.490
<v Speaker 3>They call them surplus kills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just go on rampages,</v>

876
00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

877
00:42:26.781 --> 00:42:30.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine who lives up in BC and</v>

878
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 3>he said they'll get into like sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they'll find like a pen of sheep</v>

879
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:36.320
<v Speaker 3>and they'll kill 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 of them.</v>

880
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.810
<v Speaker 3>They just rip them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck.</v>

881
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.910
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just having fun.</v>

882
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:45.770
<v Speaker 3>It's part of what they are that like we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have this like intense romantic</v>

883
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:48.920
<v Speaker 3>connection to wolves is like they have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of us and um,</v>

884
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.470
<v Speaker 3>they have a little bit of party in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

885
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:56.800
<v Speaker 3>they're the towel in and shit and having</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good old time and they have battles</v>

886
00:42:57.081 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 3>with each other to see who becomes the</v>
<v Speaker 3>king,</v>

887
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.960
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So did you see that video recently of</v>

888
00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:07.790
<v Speaker 3>these folks were in Canada and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving down the highway and as they</v>

889
00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:12.791
<v Speaker 3>were driving they saw these mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>goats running or sheep running away from</v>

890
00:43:14.211 --> 00:43:18.590
<v Speaker 3>a wolf and the wolves chasing them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wolf tackles the fucking sheep and</v>

891
00:43:18.591 --> 00:43:21.050
<v Speaker 3>kills it instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right in front of them.</v>

892
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 3>It's always fucking Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that Martin that killed the bear.</v>

893
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:27.770
<v Speaker 3>See if you could find it though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's pretty cool and it's pretty</v>

894
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:31.220
<v Speaker 3>cool to see wolf takes out a sheep</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain,</v>

895
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.620
<v Speaker 3>rocky mountain sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

896
00:43:33.621 --> 00:43:37.460
<v Speaker 3>when the wolf took out the sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he carries this thing up the side of the</v>

897
00:43:37.461 --> 00:43:40.520
<v Speaker 3>hill like you would carry like a five</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old.</v>

898
00:43:40.521 --> 00:43:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like things like basically his</v>

899
00:43:43.131 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 3>size and he just grabs it with his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

900
00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.560
<v Speaker 3>See these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

901
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.570
<v Speaker 3>see he breaks away well back up a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

902
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:53.150
<v Speaker 3>So you could see and give us some</v>
<v Speaker 3>volume.</v>

903
00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It breaks off and watch this Bam bitch.</v>

904
00:44:01.401 --> 00:44:03.680
<v Speaker 3>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rips it apart.</v>

905
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.870
<v Speaker 3>Instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that instant death.</v>

906
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:09.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no quicker kill in a wolf and a</v>

907
00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:11.280
<v Speaker 3>sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

908

<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

909
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:15.170
<v Speaker 3>it's still breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but its neck had snapped and it's done.</v>

910
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Fucking beautiful animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That wolf is now watch when he grabs it,</v>

911

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

914
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:29.900

<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

915
00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 3>he probably wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got that right there.</v>

916
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:36.210
<v Speaker 2>People probably tastes like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tastes like cheetos and cigarettes.</v>

917
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.720
<v Speaker 2>The fucking animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just.</v>

918
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:45.330
<v Speaker 2>It's such a fucking majestic animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why we have such an</v>

919
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.500
<v Speaker 2>allure to it and people love animals so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much is because they're not carrying</v>

920
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:53.310
<v Speaker 2>around all the bullshit that we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just living full and presently,</v>

921
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:57.000
<v Speaker 2>and they're not straddled with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>concepts of morality in these</v>

922
00:44:57.001 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just living to the most of their</v>

923
00:44:59.131 --> 00:45:01.110
<v Speaker 2>directive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in the present.</v>

924
00:45:01.111 --> 00:45:04.170
<v Speaker 2>You have the idea of eternity with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's.</v>

925
00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.180
<v Speaker 2>You're not worried about this other</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

926
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:11.181
<v Speaker 2>so they you just go and you just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>live to the very fullest and we can</v>

927
00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 2>count those moments that we have is our</v>
<v Speaker 2>best moments in life,</v>

928
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can recall maybe dozens of times</v>

929
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.860
<v Speaker 2>if we're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll be hundreds of times in those,</v>

930
00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.430
<v Speaker 2>in a normal person's life where they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just totally present,</v>

931
00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.670
<v Speaker 2>embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free doing exactly what they fucking</v>

932
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:27.360
<v Speaker 2>want to do.</v>

933
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a lot of ways,</v>

934
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:32.370
<v Speaker 2>the world that we've constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the modern world with social media and</v>

935
00:45:32.371 --> 00:45:37.371
<v Speaker 2>with constantly being inundated with new</v>
<v Speaker 2>new stories that have almost nothing to</v>

936
00:45:38.941 --> 00:45:41.280
<v Speaker 2>do with you there on the other side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

937
00:45:41.281 --> 00:45:42.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone got shot on the other side of</v>

938
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:45.390
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone fell off of a mountain.</v>

939
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:47.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy who died in a fiery car</v>

940
00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:51.420
<v Speaker 2>accident a thousand miles from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all this stuff is like constantly</v>

941
00:45:51.421 --> 00:45:54.480
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's constantly coming at you and it</v>

942
00:45:54.481 --> 00:45:57.630
<v Speaker 2>makes it really difficult to focus on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual life that you're living.</v>

943
00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we almost get,</v>

944
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.860
<v Speaker 2>are getting too much data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

945
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.770
<v Speaker 2>that's one element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the more toxic element is</v>

946
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:06.690
<v Speaker 2>the look at me element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the,</v>

947
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:10.920
<v Speaker 2>here's what I'm doing at this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's me snapchatting this because it</v>

948
00:46:10.921 --> 00:46:11.820
<v Speaker 2>puts above.</v>

949
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Take a picture of you and put it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram saying that it puts,</v>

950
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:20.570
<v Speaker 2>it puts the awareness of other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching you into the forefront of your</v>

951
00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:21.960
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

952
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:24.360
<v Speaker 2>so like right now that was a fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>smile.</v>

953
00:46:24.361 --> 00:46:28.080
<v Speaker 2>I just gave her that because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about you taking a picture of</v>

954
00:46:28.081 --> 00:46:29.770
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I changed my behavior.</v>

955
00:46:29.771 --> 00:46:32.070
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't handed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't normal and that's what we're</v>

956
00:46:32.071 --> 00:46:33.370
<v Speaker 2>doing constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>

957
00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.850
<v Speaker 2>we have this idea that everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at us and we're,</v>

958
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.000
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're really are the stage actors.</v>

959
00:46:39.001 --> 00:46:42.690
<v Speaker 2>And that was that famous line from</v>
<v Speaker 2>William Shakespeare.</v>

960
00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.700
<v Speaker 2>We all but actors in the world is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

961
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Well with social media it becomes that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're always just acting and playing</v>

962
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:52.050
<v Speaker 2>this role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not our authentic self.</v>

963
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Like bear down asked on the grass like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this thing?</v>

964
00:46:56.071 --> 00:46:59.480
<v Speaker 2>Let me get back in touch with the monkey</v>
<v Speaker 2>and figuring out what feels good for</v>

965
00:46:59.481 --> 00:47:00.360
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I want to do,</v>

966
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:03.510
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes your world like it might</v>
<v Speaker 2>not be your world,</v>

967
00:47:03.511 --> 00:47:05.790
<v Speaker 2>but it becomes your world when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're one of those,</v>

968
00:47:05.791 --> 00:47:07.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga booty girls that just sticks her</v>

969
00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:09.870
<v Speaker 2>ass up in the air for all our instagram</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>

970
00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Now God bless him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless him.</v>

971
00:47:11.521 --> 00:47:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God they're out there.</v>

972
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.340
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's a gal like that that has 5</v>

973
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.040
<v Speaker 2>million instagram followers and her</v>
<v Speaker 2>notifications are constantly coming in</v>

974
00:47:21.041 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 2>and she's checking her likes and damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

975
00:47:23.131 --> 00:47:24.570
<v Speaker 2>you hot damn girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find,</v>

976
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:25.980
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I get with you?</v>

977
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:29.040
<v Speaker 2>And they're looking at all their</v>
<v Speaker 2>comments and getting all that love,</v>

978
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:33.100
<v Speaker 2>all that attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that becomes them and then mean.</v>

979
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hope that they're well rounded</v>

980
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 2>and they also read books and they also</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a lot of other things and they</v>

981
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:40.810
<v Speaker 2>meditate and take yoga and really get</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

982
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's highly likely they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's highly likely that they just stare</v>

983
00:47:44.401 --> 00:47:49.180
<v Speaker 2>at the pictures of their own ass and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the gym for the second time in a</v>

984
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:52.870
<v Speaker 2>day and do dead lifts and just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat that ass up and thinking about</v>

985
00:47:52.871 --> 00:47:55.500
<v Speaker 2>getting fat injected into it and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh right.</v>

986
00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What people fail to realize is that that</v>

987
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.560
<v Speaker 2>in itself is a pressure and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure needs a response of equal</v>

988
00:48:02.561 --> 00:48:05.840
<v Speaker 2>magnitude in order to balance here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all of these people with,</v>

989
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 2>with fame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

990
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:10.390
<v Speaker 2>especially fame that you really didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>work that hard for,</v>

991
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I think where we're athletes and</v>

992
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.980
<v Speaker 2>just kinda just celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop culture,</v>

993
00:48:14.981 --> 00:48:18.770
<v Speaker 2>celebrities are instagram celebrities</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a little bit of a different feel</v>

994
00:48:18.771 --> 00:48:22.770
<v Speaker 2>because that athlete knows all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking quiet moments like steph curry</v>

995
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 2>knows all of those hundreds of thousands</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shots he took when nobody was</v>

996
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:30.610
<v Speaker 2>watching and dribbling around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>practicing and practicing.</v>

997
00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:33.790
<v Speaker 2>So when he gets out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his what he's doing and what he's known</v>

998
00:48:33.791 --> 00:48:35.980
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense and it's solid.</v>

999
00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:39.190
<v Speaker 2>It's grounded in something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden you have a great ass</v>

1000
00:48:39.191 --> 00:48:41.850
<v Speaker 2>and the ability to take a decent photo</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

1001
00:48:41.851 --> 00:48:43.870
<v Speaker 2>you've got the reach of 5 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1002
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that amount of pressure really</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucks with you and you have to take</v>

1003
00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.700
<v Speaker 2>extreme measures to counteract that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get yourself back grounded again.</v>

1004
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:53.710
<v Speaker 2>More time in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation,</v>

1005
00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 2>float tank eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd whatever you want to do,</v>

1006
00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:00.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find that other thing to counteract</v>

1007
00:49:00.221 --> 00:49:02.710
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Recognize it for what it is and,</v>

1008
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.930
<v Speaker 2>and don't just look at the positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of it.</v>

1009
00:49:04.931 --> 00:49:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Look at the negative that it's having</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think if you don't,</v>

1010
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.540
<v Speaker 2>we see the effects of that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see the Robin Williams,</v>

1011
00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:11.500
<v Speaker 2>we see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1012
00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:15.070
<v Speaker 2>the people who are dying of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>overdoses that ostensibly should be</v>

1013
00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:16.420
<v Speaker 2>happy as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>

1014
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:21.250
<v Speaker 2>They haven't dealt with the pressure of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fame in a way that's as aggressive as</v>

1015
00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:23.080
<v Speaker 2>the pressure that it's caused on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1016
00:49:23.081 --> 00:49:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Robin Williams might not be the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>example because we had a bobcat in the</v>

1017
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:29.440
<v Speaker 2>other day and bobcat was a really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of Robin's and Robin was</v>

1018
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.480
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed with several illnesses.</v>

1019
00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.580
<v Speaker 2>One of them was Parkinson's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was another one.</v>

1020
00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:37.060
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a brain illness that he was diagnosed</v>

1021
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:39.070
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the name of a Jamie Lewy</v>

1022
00:49:39.071 --> 00:49:40.540
<v Speaker 2>body disease?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

1023
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:42.041
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1024
00:49:42.041 --> 00:49:45.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it directly affects the way he perceived</v>

1025
00:49:45.311 --> 00:49:47.740
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he had a real issue.</v>

1026
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Batman in Batman or whatever the joker</v>

1027
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.140
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heath Ledger.</v>

1028
00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Pillow guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the pressure,</v>

1030
00:49:59.981 --> 00:50:04.090
<v Speaker 2>but they're responding to the pressure</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that's deleterious for their</v>

1031
00:50:04.091 --> 00:50:06.280
<v Speaker 2>life rather than responding to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure being like,</v>

1032
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.660
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucked up.</v>

1033
00:50:07.661 --> 00:50:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I got all of these people looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to do some other work in society</v>

1034
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.770
<v Speaker 2>is not pushing them in that way either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just saying more and more and</v>

1035
00:50:14.771 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get another roll,</v>

1036
00:50:15.911 --> 00:50:17.520
<v Speaker 2>get more followers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1037
00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:17.951
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1038
00:50:17.951 --> 00:50:20.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like the demon voice that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>from your act,</v>

1039
00:50:20.701 --> 00:50:24.820
<v Speaker 2>like exactly that they have that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in their head.</v>

1040
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:26.800
<v Speaker 2>And the other guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1041
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 2>go fucking on a vision</v>

1042
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.590
<v Speaker 3>quest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like find some mountains by yourself</v>

1043
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:33.020
<v Speaker 3>where nobody's watching it and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to act at all.</v>

1044
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.340
<v Speaker 3>You can just be you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1045
00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:37.070
<v Speaker 3>this is what I wrote a note earlier</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we were talking about depression</v>

1046
00:50:37.071 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 3>and I've always wondered if the</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression that people see in mass</v>

1047
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:43.520
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much depression that people</v>

1048
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:46.580
<v Speaker 3>mean there's a ca.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a common trait.</v>

1049
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.150
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a common condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1050
00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.520
<v Speaker 3>he suffers from depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1051
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.160
<v Speaker 3>she suffers from depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1052
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:56.210
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got herpes.</v>

1053
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1054
00:50:57.171 --> 00:50:57.701
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1055
00:50:57.701 --> 00:51:00.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered or I've been</v>

1056
00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:03.400
<v Speaker 3>wondering more and more recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1057
00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:07.550
<v Speaker 3>it really hit me when have you ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Heimos Arctic adventure?</v>

1058
00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:10.470
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the first vice pieces that</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

1059
00:51:10.471 --> 00:51:12.560
<v Speaker 3>So I think the first vice piece I ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw,</v>

1060
00:51:12.561 --> 00:51:13.640
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1061
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:18.850
<v Speaker 3>the first one was David Choe looking for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dinosaur in the Amazon or was he in</v>

1062
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:20.240
<v Speaker 3>the Congo?</v>

1063
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Choe.</v>

1064
00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 3>So fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy.</v>

1065
00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:28.900
<v Speaker 3>But he went to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy's worth $100,000,000.</v>

1066
00:51:29.501 --> 00:51:31.400
<v Speaker 3>We went to Africa looking for a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>dinosaur.</v>

1067
00:51:31.401 --> 00:51:33.330
<v Speaker 3>That definitely doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1068
00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vice has done some awesome stuff.</v>

1069
00:51:36.921 --> 00:51:40.160
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things they did that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting was this guy,</v>

1070
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.850
<v Speaker 3>his name is Huynh Mo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's how you say it.</v>

1071
00:51:44.851 --> 00:51:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>

1072
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.060
<v Speaker 3>Here it is heimos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi mo.</v>

1073
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:55.150
<v Speaker 3>I had an n in there I think heimos</v>
<v Speaker 3>arctic refuge and this guy lives in this</v>

1074
00:51:55.881 --> 00:52:00.881
<v Speaker 3>incredibly remote area of the arctic</v>
<v Speaker 3>national wildlife refuge in the alaskan</v>

1075
00:52:02.691 --> 00:52:04.850
<v Speaker 3>interior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

1076
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:10.510
<v Speaker 3>he lives in this really small log cabin</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he hunts and gathers and that's all</v>

1077
00:52:12.231 --> 00:52:13.700
<v Speaker 3>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's very smart.</v>

1078
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 3>I think he's not a dummy at all and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>been up there.</v>

1079
00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:17.750
<v Speaker 3>He lives with his wife and his.</v>

1080
00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:19.940
<v Speaker 3>He raised children up there and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1081
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:22.400
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some dark moments in there</v>

1082
00:52:22.401 --> 00:52:24.440
<v Speaker 3>because they lived like this from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1083
00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:29.120
<v Speaker 3>like when they had children up there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they lost their two year old baby in a</v>

1084
00:52:29.121 --> 00:52:32.420
<v Speaker 3>fucking canoe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they tipped over in A,</v>

1085
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 3>in a canoe and lost their kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like it's a really intense when</v>

1086
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:40.760
<v Speaker 3>they revisit the site and leave flowers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was like 30 years ago and they</v>

1087
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:44.090
<v Speaker 3>had several children since then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this moment is still like this</v>

1088
00:52:44.091 --> 00:52:46.700
<v Speaker 3>intense moment of loss for them where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they lost their baby,</v>

1089
00:52:46.701 --> 00:52:51.530
<v Speaker 3>but this fucking guy is very happy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1090
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:56.560
<v Speaker 3>very smart and very connected and very</v>
<v Speaker 3>articulate and he firmly believes that</v>

1091
00:52:58.611 --> 00:53:03.611
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we evolved and developed and were</v>

1092
00:53:04.491 --> 00:53:07.370
<v Speaker 3>hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a set of rewards.</v>

1093
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.400
<v Speaker 3>There's reward systems that are set up</v>
<v Speaker 3>Inside the human body,</v>

1094
00:53:10.401 --> 00:53:10.930
<v Speaker 3>inside the.</v>

1095
00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the very being that we embody that don't</v>

1096
00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:17.000
<v Speaker 3>get met in today's society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And tHat's one of the things that's</v>

1097
00:53:17.001 --> 00:53:19.640
<v Speaker 3>causing depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that's causing this</v>

1098
00:53:19.641 --> 00:53:23.000
<v Speaker 3>funk that people are in is that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>living our lives.</v>

1099
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 3>many of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in these very unfulfilling ways</v>

1100
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:29.880
<v Speaker 3>where you're going to this office with</v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial light and you're doing</v>

1101
00:53:29.881 --> 00:53:33.180
<v Speaker 3>something you don't want to do all day</v>
<v Speaker 3>long and then you get home and you're</v>

1102
00:53:33.181 --> 00:53:35.790
<v Speaker 3>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on top of tHat you're eating shit.</v>

1103
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.630
<v Speaker 3>You're eating potato chips and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking soda and your body is just</v>

1104
00:53:39.631 --> 00:53:41.490
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck is this?</v>

1105
00:53:41.491 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to be out in the fields</v>
<v Speaker 3>were supposed to be walking up hills.</v>

1106
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:49.470
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to be looking for aniMals</v>
<v Speaker 3>or gathering vegetables were supposed to</v>

1107
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:52.110
<v Speaker 3>be doing all these things that our body</v>
<v Speaker 3>is designed to do.</v>

1108
00:53:52.111 --> 00:53:56.370
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to be in nature and</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature is like a medicine.</v>

1109
00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.670
<v Speaker 3>LIke it literally is a medicine to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people.</v>

1110
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:02.190
<v Speaker 3>People that go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to go hunting,</v>

1111
00:54:02.191 --> 00:54:04.650
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to go fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go fucking hike man.</v>

1112
00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 3>Just go hike up to the top of a mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look out.</v>

1113
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:13.220
<v Speaker 3>You know there's a reward that you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that that Is intensely like soul</v>

1114
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:15.510
<v Speaker 3>filling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like something about like wHen I</v>

1115
00:54:15.511 --> 00:54:20.190
<v Speaker 3>was in Colorado and there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this area of boulder where you drive up</v>

1116
00:54:20.191 --> 00:54:23.460
<v Speaker 3>one of these roads and there's this area</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you could park and it was this</v>

1117
00:54:23.461 --> 00:54:25.260
<v Speaker 3>incredible view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1118
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.870
<v Speaker 3>These people just pArk and just go out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and just look,</v>

1119
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.520
<v Speaker 3>but you get there and you park and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1120
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:33.510
<v Speaker 3>fuck [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would see you,</v>

1121
00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:37.560
<v Speaker 3>you literally seeing the continental</v>
<v Speaker 3>divide and these snow capped mountains</v>

1122
00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:39.240
<v Speaker 3>in july,</v>
<v Speaker 3>july.</v>

1123
00:54:39.241 --> 00:54:40.980
<v Speaker 3>It's covered with snow because those</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains,</v>

1124
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:41.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't</v>

1125
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.890
<v Speaker 1>give a perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1126
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:46.380
<v Speaker 1>just this whole new perspective on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think nature,</v>

1127
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I think the ease of suffering is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>in present in this.</v>

1128
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.440
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're in president is</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly locked in and presidents,</v>

1129
00:54:52.441 --> 00:54:53.970
<v Speaker 1>there is no suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There can be pain,</v>

1130
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:57.390
<v Speaker 1>but no suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suffering is something created by our</v>

1131
00:54:57.391 --> 00:55:00.780
<v Speaker 1>own minds and I think nature is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great ways to do this because</v>

1132
00:55:00.781 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learn,</v>

1133
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.340
<v Speaker 1>we take cues from our environment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

1134
00:55:05.341 --> 00:55:07.590
<v Speaker 1>As I was saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is always in the present.</v>

1135
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:10.320
<v Speaker 1>You know there's this natural presidents</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the animals,</v>

1136
00:55:10.321 --> 00:55:12.570
<v Speaker 1>everything around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you get around a bunch of</v>

1137
00:55:12.571 --> 00:55:15.570
<v Speaker 1>people watching housewives and stressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and pop them pills,</v>

1138
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:18.960
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take on that energy too</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're gonna lose your present in</v>

1139
00:55:18.961 --> 00:55:23.160
<v Speaker 1>this because of your surrounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like this ultimate regrounding</v>

1140
00:55:23.161 --> 00:55:26.070
<v Speaker 1>tool where we get back to a present</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

1141
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such a fucking key element to</v>

1142
00:55:29.611 --> 00:55:33.270
<v Speaker 1>human happiness and I think the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>key element is having something where</v>

1143
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:34.830
<v Speaker 1>we're fighting for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know,</v>

1144
00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:38.490
<v Speaker 1>having a mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're all forces and that forest</v>

1145
00:55:38.491 --> 00:55:41.670
<v Speaker 1>needs to have an effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to have A reason that it's moving</v>

1146
00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:45.540
<v Speaker 1>in a certain directioN and I think with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our meats and all of our needs</v>

1147
00:55:45.541 --> 00:55:46.460
<v Speaker 1>met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knoW,</v>

1148
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.630
<v Speaker 1>where we don't have to hunt for food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to acquire everything.</v>

1149
00:55:48.631 --> 00:55:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Everything's relatively easy and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all about advancement and all this.</v>

1150
00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:55.410
<v Speaker 1>We've lost a lot of the basic mission</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the mission to suRvive and</v>

1151
00:55:55.411 --> 00:55:56.640
<v Speaker 1>procreate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1152
00:55:56.641 --> 00:55:58.410
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we haven't replaced it with any</v>

1153
00:55:58.411 --> 00:56:02.280
<v Speaker 1>other universal mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I think one of the big allures</v>

1154
00:56:02.281 --> 00:56:05.370
<v Speaker 1>of these things like wars and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like creating an enemy.</v>

1155
00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Well at least then you hAve a mission</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you have a mission,</v>

1156
00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.290
<v Speaker 1>human beings are happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1157
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:14.310
<v Speaker 1>like a birch and russell talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did book conquest of happIness and he</v>

1158
00:56:14.311 --> 00:56:16.470
<v Speaker 1>had his own fucked up attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I bring them up,</v>

1159
00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.800
<v Speaker 1>people talk about is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as he was into phonology and he</v>

1160
00:56:19.801 --> 00:56:21.150
<v Speaker 1>might've been racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1161
00:56:21.151 --> 00:56:22.710
<v Speaker 1>but he was a good philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke.</v>

1162
00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1163
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.170
<v Speaker 2>but Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked about the happiest person he</v>

1164
00:56:26.171 --> 00:56:28.750
<v Speaker 2>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the happiest person he could find was a</v>

1165
00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:33.751
<v Speaker 2>groundskeeper on a manner who every day</v>
<v Speaker 2>woke up and was at war with the rabbits,</v>

1166
00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:37.930
<v Speaker 2>have the guy he just declared that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbits were the fucking enemy.</v>

1167
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 2>And he would go out with his gun and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would hunt as many as possible and he'd</v>

1168
00:56:41.351 --> 00:56:43.150
<v Speaker 2>go morning till,</v>
<v Speaker 2>till night,</v>

1169
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:46.450
<v Speaker 2>and he would kill as many rabbits as he</v>
<v Speaker 2>could because it was the rabbits were</v>

1170
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:48.490
<v Speaker 2>the ones eating the hedges and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>flowers and whatever.</v>

1171
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:52.300
<v Speaker 2>So he basically made the rabbits his</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy and struck out every single day to</v>

1172
00:56:52.301 --> 00:56:54.610
<v Speaker 2>kill as many rabbits as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that dude,</v>

1173
00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:57.160
<v Speaker 2>according to bertrand russell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was happy as fuck.</v>

1174
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.750
<v Speaker 2>He had a task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a task,</v>

1175
00:56:58.751 --> 00:57:00.180
<v Speaker 2>he had a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1176
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:03.310
<v Speaker 2>he had a mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mission is to destroy the rabbits.</v>

1177
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.510
<v Speaker 2>I just have a dog like that.</v>

1178
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the happiest dog over,</v>

1179
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.220
<v Speaker 2>his name was frank sinatra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1180
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:14.170
<v Speaker 2>he was a pit bull that all he lived for</v>
<v Speaker 2>was killing lizards and my house,</v>

1181
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:16.240
<v Speaker 2>my old house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the house now,</v>

1182
00:57:16.241 --> 00:57:18.650
<v Speaker 2>but my old house had this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1183
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:20.020
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1184
00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:24.460
<v Speaker 2>it's like a on a hill and there's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>one wall where these lizards would run</v>

1185
00:57:24.461 --> 00:57:26.470
<v Speaker 2>up the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so frank,</v>

1186
00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I would literally let them out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and he fucking bolt out that</v>

1187
00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like time to go to war,</v>

1188
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.850
<v Speaker 2>like any would run and go look for these</v>
<v Speaker 2>lizards.</v>

1189
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.680
<v Speaker 2>And he would stand there like eddie</v>
<v Speaker 2>bravo.</v>

1190
00:57:35.681 --> 00:57:37.270
<v Speaker 2>We'll just watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And marvel.</v>

1191
00:57:37.271 --> 00:57:38.320
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

1192
00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:40.990
<v Speaker 2>this dog does this every day there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doc does this every day I go,</v>

1193
00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:43.720
<v Speaker 2>this is what he loves to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would go there and he would have</v>

1194
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:48.721
<v Speaker 2>his paws on the wall and</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy and he would jump up and try to</v>

1195
00:57:49.241 --> 00:57:51.850
<v Speaker 2>grab a lizard and occasionally he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>get one and he'd be like,</v>

1196
00:57:51.851 --> 00:57:52.960
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah.</v>

1197
00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.870
<v Speaker 2>And he would get one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would go looking for another one.</v>

1198
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:56.440
<v Speaker 2>He would go and he was a pretty big</v>
<v Speaker 2>yard.</v>

1199
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.800
<v Speaker 2>So he would go wandering around the yard</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for anything else that fucked</v>

1200
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:01.510
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything else that was slipping and it</v>

1201
00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:04.060
<v Speaker 2>was constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately twice.</v>

1202
00:58:04.061 --> 00:58:06.690
<v Speaker 2>I had to take him to the hospital</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he got bit by rattlesnakes</v>

1203
00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.800
<v Speaker 2>because rattlesnakes are slipping to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he killed the rattlesnakes,</v>

1204
00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:14.230
<v Speaker 2>but the rattlesnakes fucked him up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a water balloon grown out of the</v>

1205
00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:16.280
<v Speaker 2>side of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of my dogs.</v>

1206
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.980
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1207
00:58:17.981 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 2>that's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have the money to pay for</v>

1208
00:58:21.701 --> 00:58:23.980
<v Speaker 2>the serum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's super expensive.</v>

1209
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:28.420
<v Speaker 2>It was several thousand dollars to treat</v>
<v Speaker 2>them for this rattlesnake venom.</v>

1210
00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Antivenom shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like.</v>

1211
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:30.281
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1212
00:58:30.281 --> 00:58:33.650
<v Speaker 2>what if I was poor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if a whole fucked up system like</v>

1213
00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:36.940
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They inject horses with the venom and</v>

1214
00:58:36.941 --> 00:58:40.480
<v Speaker 2>they like get the antibodies from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>horses except this archaic system.</v>

1215
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I think my friend Donald Schultz is</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on.</v>

1216
00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:46.420
<v Speaker 2>He's a big snake handler guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's working on ways to innovate around</v>

1217
00:58:46.421 --> 00:58:49.630
<v Speaker 2>that because it's kind of like a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>backwards system that they have.</v>

1218
00:58:49.631 --> 00:58:51.040
<v Speaker 2>How you get antivenom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1219
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:54.160
<v Speaker 2>a horse will survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's just fucking sorta put the</v>

1220
00:58:54.161 --> 00:58:56.860
<v Speaker 2>venom in there and then we'll get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>antibodies from the horse and then,</v>

1221
00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:57.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1222
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:59.530
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing how they do it.</v>

1223
00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a real problem with people</v>

1224
00:59:01.451 --> 00:59:03.100
<v Speaker 2>that are vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a vegan,</v>

1225
00:59:03.101 --> 00:59:05.620
<v Speaker 2>you don't use any animal products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get bit by a rattlesnake,</v>

1226
00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.100
<v Speaker 2>you got two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Compromise your morals.</v>

1227
00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:11.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1229
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:15.790
<v Speaker 2>but this dog was so goddamn happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had missions,</v>

1230
00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would go out of that yard and he</v>

1231
00:59:17.951 --> 00:59:20.410
<v Speaker 2>wasn't bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was really pleased to see me for a</v>

1232
00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:20.830
<v Speaker 2>walk.</v>

1233
00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1234
00:59:22.251 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 2>see it dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't opened that door.</v>

1235
00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:26.660
<v Speaker 2>He was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just had his little mission.</v>

1236
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 2>And I think you can see that in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are the most unhappy.</v>

1237
00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:31.770
<v Speaker 2>THey seem aimless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1238
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 2>what am I here for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I doing this?</v>

1239
00:59:33.921 --> 00:59:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Nothing makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1240
00:59:35.601 --> 00:59:37.670
<v Speaker 2>And I've even felt it in my own life</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1241
00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:40.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what my mission here.</v>

1242
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.650
<v Speaker 2>My mission is to expand human</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

1243
00:59:42.651 --> 00:59:46.400
<v Speaker 2>to help people be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's really what I find my</v>

1244
00:59:46.401 --> 00:59:48.920
<v Speaker 2>greatest purpose in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But every once in a while I'll get this</v>

1245
00:59:48.921 --> 00:59:51.980
<v Speaker 2>kind of like fuck people attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe someone said some fucked up shit</v>

1246
00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:52.491
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1247
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:55.400
<v Speaker 2>people fucking suck for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at that poem,</v>

1248
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.490
<v Speaker 2>that's when I'm actually depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1249
00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:59.930
<v Speaker 2>because I've lost my mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of having a mission,</v>

1250
00:59:59.931 --> 01:00:00.381
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1251
01:00:00.381 --> 01:00:01.970
<v Speaker 2>my mission is human consciousness.</v>

1252
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.160
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden it's like fuck people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that mission.</v>

1253
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:07.460
<v Speaker 2>THey'll figure it out and then I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed because I've lost my purpose.</v>

1254
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.060
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to rise above like</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally when something like that</v>

1255
01:00:11.061 --> 01:00:12.440
<v Speaker 2>happens and realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1256
01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:13.261
<v Speaker 2>you've just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1257
01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:15.860
<v Speaker 2>you're encountering one diseased</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

1258
01:00:15.861 --> 01:00:18.230
<v Speaker 2>You've got to look at the mass of</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>

1259
01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Like when you encounter one diseased</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

1260
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:25.700
<v Speaker 2>it's so like this guy who shot up that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nightclub in orlando,</v>

1261
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.460
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at one diseased</v>

1262
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:29.150
<v Speaker 2>individual and if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1263
01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:30.770
<v Speaker 2>people fucking suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at what they did.</v>

1264
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Speaker 2>We'll look into how many people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>responding with rainbows on their</v>

1265
01:00:34.701 --> 01:00:36.890
<v Speaker 2>twitter pages and love and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1266
01:00:36.891 --> 01:00:39.770
<v Speaker 2>and all the best wishes to those folks</v>
<v Speaker 2>that got killed that other.</v>

1267
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:42.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was looking at this guy's page</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a,</v>

1268
01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:47.510
<v Speaker 2>an animal lover who was organizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to go to the homes of the victims</v>

1269
01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:49.130
<v Speaker 2>and see if they have pets that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped.</v>

1270
01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this beautiful people out there.</v>

1271
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more beautiful pete.</v>

1272
01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.600
<v Speaker 2>This is without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just the safest,</v>

1273
01:00:56.601 --> 01:00:59.490
<v Speaker 2>the easiest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the happiest time in terms of</v>

1274
01:00:59.491 --> 01:01:02.530
<v Speaker 2>like being able to like reach out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1275
01:01:02.531 --> 01:01:06.500
<v Speaker 2>and send love to people and have people</v>
<v Speaker 2>send love to you,</v>

1276
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:08.800
<v Speaker 2>but just occasionally you run into conc</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1277
01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:09.570
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1278
01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:12.410
<v Speaker 2>and the constant self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>BuT the beauty is out there too.</v>

1279
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:15.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just not as dramatic and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>impose upon us as forcefully,</v>

1280
01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:17.240
<v Speaker 2>but we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just look.</v>

1281
01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.330
<v Speaker 2>It's around all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We run into good people all the time,</v>

1282
01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:24.110
<v Speaker 2>but you just make eye contact with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>good person or that kid.</v>

1283
01:01:24.111 --> 01:01:26.930
<v Speaker 2>He's just looking at you and just that</v>
<v Speaker 2>little smile and you're like,</v>

1284
01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.760
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good of humanity.</v>

1285
01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:29.680
<v Speaker 2>The fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1286
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:31.370
<v Speaker 2>we really are love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1287
01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:36.380
<v Speaker 2>being expressed outwardly all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just these other delusions that</v>

1288
01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:37.214
<v Speaker 2>get in the way of that.</v>

1289
01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're oddly attracted to negativity to.</v>

1290
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.680
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we look at negativity</v>
<v Speaker 2>online or that you run into is a</v>

1291
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:48.050
<v Speaker 2>possibility of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to look at this fucking</v>

1292
01:01:48.051 --> 01:01:49.700
<v Speaker 2>drums beating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddammit.</v>

1293
01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:51.530
<v Speaker 2>There's an army on the background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're coming,</v>

1294
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.550
<v Speaker 2>they're coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1295
01:01:52.551 --> 01:01:56.510
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's this real impulse to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of batten down the hatches when</v>

1296
01:01:56.511 --> 01:02:00.800
<v Speaker 2>really it's just some fucking 36 year</v>
<v Speaker 2>old losers sit in his parents basement,</v>

1297
01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:03.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>farting and smelling his own farts and</v>

1298
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:04.670
<v Speaker 2>angry online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1299
01:02:04.671 --> 01:02:06.800
<v Speaker 2>that's really what a lot of you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with.</v>

1300
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.770
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with like really sick</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1301
01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:12.920
<v Speaker 2>like people that have just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

1302
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.070
<v Speaker 2>they've not found their path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've not found any happiness.</v>

1303
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 2>They have found any fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

1304
01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:20.520
<v Speaker 2>They haven't found any growth there just</v>
<v Speaker 2>stifled</v>

1305
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>or rotten and some sort of a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just hasn't really worked for them</v>

1306
01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>and so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're lashing out,</v>

1307
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>the lashing out at the world and you run</v>
<v Speaker 1>into one of those people suck and that's</v>

1308
01:02:32.161 --> 01:02:36.230
<v Speaker 1>the initial response and then the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious response is to look at and be</v>

1309
01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>and have compassion for that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is hard to do and our system isn't</v>

1310
01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>based upon that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you look at the u s penal</v>

1311
01:02:43.531 --> 01:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very much about punishment.</v>

1312
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you watched that documentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Michael Moore did,</v>

1313
01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>who to invade nest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they go to Norway,</v>

1314
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>they have a whole different idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the penal system is for.</v>

1315
01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>It's about restoring human dignity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultivating a change.</v>

1316
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Really making change in the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about punishment,</v>

1317
01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:03.570
<v Speaker 1>it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about actually changing that</v>

1318
01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:06.630
<v Speaker 1>individual so he doesn't do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at the recidivism</v>

1319
01:03:06.631 --> 01:03:10.590
<v Speaker 1>rates between our prisons and norway's</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisons and they're just dramatically</v>

1320
01:03:10.591 --> 01:03:11.160
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1321
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>That impulse to punish immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1322
01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.670
<v Speaker 1>is not the healthiest impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just gonna create more issues</v>

1323
01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:20.220
<v Speaker 1>down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not rehabilitating anybody.</v>

1324
01:03:20.221 --> 01:03:23.760
<v Speaker 1>You're just taking even more broken</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and putting them out in the world</v>

1325
01:03:23.761 --> 01:03:25.440
<v Speaker 1>and hoping they're not going to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken things.</v>

1326
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to fucking work.</v>

1327
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:29.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right impulse is always that</v>

1328
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.060
<v Speaker 1>compassion and looking to see as if that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was you,</v>

1329
01:03:33.061 --> 01:03:35.790
<v Speaker 1>how all of these fucked up elements of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and choices.</v>

1330
01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not overriding the fact that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had choices and all this.</v>

1331
01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 1>They're not free of guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at,</v>

1332
01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.260
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the person that just made</v>

1333
01:03:43.261 --> 01:03:47.070
<v Speaker 1>some bad choices and had some tough shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with and couldn't overcome it.</v>

1334
01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>The resistance in the video game was</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than his skillset and he wasn't</v>

1335
01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:54.780
<v Speaker 1>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to choose to work and choose to the</v>

1336
01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:57.030
<v Speaker 1>positive elements that would allow them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to overcome it.</v>

1337
01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:58.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1338
01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:01.760
<v Speaker 1>it's also norway's dealing with far</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer people,</v>

1339
01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1340
01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also they,</v>

1341
01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:09.330
<v Speaker 1>they don't have that conquers mentality</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have.</v>

1342
01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:15.020
<v Speaker 1>So when we were so wrapped up in success</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also in punishment,</v>

1343
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a big aspect of our culture.</v>

1344
01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Like punishment and I mean like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone does anything wrong online,</v>

1345
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:28.020
<v Speaker 1>the amount of people that feel like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>their job to shame that person and</v>

1346
01:04:28.021 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>embarrass that person and insult that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1347
01:04:30.811 --> 01:04:33.600
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty crazy to watch when</v>
<v Speaker 1>something goes down.</v>

1348
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.900
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also counterproductive and I see</v>

1349
01:04:36.901 --> 01:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>that in the people shaming people for</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriation,</v>

1350
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:41.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say for example,</v>

1351
01:04:41.761 --> 01:04:44.580
<v Speaker 1>someone wears a head dress at a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>festival,</v>

1352
01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:45.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably mildly.</v>

1353
01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>They're not doing it to mock the native</v>
<v Speaker 1>americans,</v>

1354
01:04:47.941 --> 01:04:49.240
<v Speaker 1>most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like a,</v>

1355
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.360
<v Speaker 1>a mild appreciation and interest.</v>

1356
01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I think this looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a place and you know,</v>

1357
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:59.490
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden they get all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this intense hate and shame and putting</v>

1358
01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these intentions on them that</v>

1359
01:05:02.341 --> 01:05:03.270
<v Speaker 1>weren't true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1360
01:05:03.271 --> 01:05:05.640
<v Speaker 1>going back to my point about morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about the act,</v>

1361
01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:09.150
<v Speaker 1>it's about the intentions of the act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now we make it all about the</v>

1362
01:05:09.151 --> 01:05:09.511
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1363
01:05:09.511 --> 01:05:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you wore this headdress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you're insulting thousands of</v>

1364
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:13.510
<v Speaker 1>years of native americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're oppressing,</v>

1365
01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.240
<v Speaker 1>you're appropriating Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1366
01:05:15.241 --> 01:05:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I fucking wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing a fucking harris'</v>

1367
01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>headdress.</v>

1368
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 2>But then all of a sudden that imprint</v>
<v Speaker 2>will create trauma and that trauma will</v>

1369
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:26.230
<v Speaker 2>have a poisonous impact that will make</v>
<v Speaker 2>them feel weird and make them want to do</v>

1370
01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 2>that to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you're in injecting someone</v>

1371
01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hate virus,</v>

1372
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to then pass on to</v>

1373
01:05:34.001 --> 01:05:36.100
<v Speaker 2>other people rather than doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite,</v>

1374
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:38.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading the love herpes where this</v>

1375
01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:42.700
<v Speaker 2>contagious positivity that goes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other way and we have those choices with</v>

1376
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:45.070
<v Speaker 2>how to deal with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more often than not,</v>

1377
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:49.090
<v Speaker 2>we come with this thing to punish and</v>
<v Speaker 2>create more trauma which triggers their</v>

1378
01:05:49.091 --> 01:05:52.570
<v Speaker 2>own self judge and their own self hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lowers their own self love.</v>

1379
01:05:52.571 --> 01:05:54.790
<v Speaker 2>And then they're going to pass that off</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kids,</v>

1380
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:56.200
<v Speaker 2>family members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people around them.</v>

1381
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:58.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just two sets of dominoes that</v>

1382
01:05:58.541 --> 01:06:02.760
<v Speaker 2>we can choose to take to take either pat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the concept of copd.</v>

1383
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Cultural appropriation is so stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>because culture itself is bullshit.</v>

1384
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Culture itself is just a bunch of shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people have done over and over</v>

1385
01:06:10.781 --> 01:06:11.900
<v Speaker 2>again as a habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1386
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.490
<v Speaker 2>So your idea that no one should</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate someone's other bullshit</v>

1387
01:06:15.491 --> 01:06:19.600
<v Speaker 2>habits is so fucking ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you shouldn't wear your hair like</v>

1388
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:22.630
<v Speaker 2>that because other dummies women wearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>their hair like that for 100 years.</v>

1389
01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Now they've decided thAt this is theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They own the dreadlock yeah.</v>

1390
01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they own the braids.</v>

1391
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1392
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.440
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nonsense.</v>

1393
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:36.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's just one of those things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>michael shermer likes to call virtue</v>

1394
01:06:36.101 --> 01:06:41.101
<v Speaker 2>signaling where you see someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something and in chastising them</v>

1395
01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:45.250
<v Speaker 2>you're not just trying to stop them from</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

1396
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:48.910
<v Speaker 2>You're also letting the world know how</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical and how moral you are.</v>

1397
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.080
<v Speaker 2>And so you get a lot of like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>goofy fucking white people who get mad</v>

1398
01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:56.560
<v Speaker 2>at other white people for doing things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they deem to be cultural</v>

1399
01:06:56.561 --> 01:06:57.394
<v Speaker 2>appropriation.</v>

1400
01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's one thing if you're deeply</v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded and rooted in that culture,</v>

1401
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:04.330
<v Speaker 2>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that thing that a hindu people</v>

1402
01:07:04.331 --> 01:07:07.690
<v Speaker 2>put on their forehead when they're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>love in love?</v>

1403
01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.670
<v Speaker 2>They put the third eye symbol on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1404
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it has something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>

1405
01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.750
<v Speaker 2>or is it a bindi?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is you can be?</v>

1406
01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1407
01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:17.710
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people get upset at people</v>

1408
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:22.150
<v Speaker 2>appropriating that and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is that?</v>

1409
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:23.680
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a sticker on your head,</v>

1410
01:07:23.681 --> 01:07:24.700
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for real.</v>

1411
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about us?</v>

1412
01:07:25.721 --> 01:07:29.080
<v Speaker 2>We're wearing tattoos clearly yet</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's culture.</v>

1413
01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean the kind that we have is fairly</v>
<v Speaker 2>american I guess,</v>

1414
01:07:33.401 --> 01:07:37.690
<v Speaker 2>but my inner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like aaron dellavedova did mine and sort</v>

1415
01:07:37.691 --> 01:07:40.360
<v Speaker 2>of a japanese style japanese tattoo on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ribs.</v>

1416
01:07:40.361 --> 01:07:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this sort of cultural appropriate</v>

1417
01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.820
<v Speaker 2>in a time where we need all the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas ever.</v>

1418
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:48.730
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we need to bring everything that's</v>

1419
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:52.240
<v Speaker 2>good and everything that made sense and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that can tap people back into</v>

1420
01:07:52.241 --> 01:07:54.820
<v Speaker 2>something positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need all of that stuff.</v>

1421
01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.880
<v Speaker 2>We don't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need,</v>

1422
01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:58.810
<v Speaker 2>so we need to gather all of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>practices of the culture.</v>

1423
01:07:58.811 --> 01:08:00.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the fucking beautiful part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time we're in.</v>

1424
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.360
<v Speaker 2>We can go eat moroccan food or chinese</v>
<v Speaker 2>food or japanese food.</v>

1425
01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:08.680
<v Speaker 2>We can go enjoy all of these things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need all of this enjoyment because</v>

1426
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 2>there's all kinds of other fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's going on as well that we</v>

1427
01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:14.590
<v Speaker 2>have to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1428
01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have such the opposite</v>

1429
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:18.260
<v Speaker 1>idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1430
01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:21.350
<v Speaker 1>like tesla is doing with his patents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of protect and hold.</v>

1431
01:08:21.351 --> 01:08:23.330
<v Speaker 1>This is our own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else get it.</v>

1432
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>That's to the detriment of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody should want to share all</v>

1433
01:08:27.591 --> 01:08:32.591
<v Speaker 1>the ideas and best practices that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be like me secretly doing</v>

1434
01:08:32.781 --> 01:08:34.980
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1435
01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Happy or not motherfuckers fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1436
01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.840
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you want to talk about it and say</v>

1437
01:08:39.841 --> 01:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what worked for me.</v>

1438
01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1439
01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>how can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you improve yourself to,</v>

1440
01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:46.101
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically,</v>

1441
01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>that's what people believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biblical scholars who have studied</v>

1442
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:53.650
<v Speaker 1>the connection between psychedelics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient religions that say believe where</v>

1443
01:08:53.651 --> 01:08:58.130
<v Speaker 1>it all went wrong and so they tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold back the psychedelic rituals and</v>

1444
01:08:58.131 --> 01:09:02.810
<v Speaker 1>hide them from conquering armies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what john marco allegro</v>

1445
01:09:02.811 --> 01:09:05.750
<v Speaker 1>believed that christianity was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially all about.</v>

1446
01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:09.020
<v Speaker 1>It was about writing down these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bible,</v>

1447
01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:13.960
<v Speaker 1>in parables and hiding them in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and that these stories were to</v>

1448
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:17.480
<v Speaker 1>mask it from the conquerors from being</v>
<v Speaker 1>conquered by the roman army.</v>

1449
01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then really the opposite is what</v>

1450
01:09:19.521 --> 01:09:22.060
<v Speaker 1>they needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They needed to share this open sources</v>

1451
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:24.800
<v Speaker 1>as widely as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you look at that period.</v>

1452
01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:29.030
<v Speaker 1>It's riddled with war and atrocities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this fucked up stuff that's</v>

1453
01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:31.010
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the human rights record and in</v>

1454
01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:32.660
<v Speaker 1>the archaeological record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1455
01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:34.000
<v Speaker 1>cities built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed,</v>

1456
01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:34.940
<v Speaker 1>destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbarian,</v>

1457
01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:35.241
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1458
01:09:35.241 --> 01:09:37.220
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you go take the counterpoint of</v>

1459
01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:39.800
<v Speaker 1>that to a culture ancient shoving in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru,</v>

1460
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 1>which archaeologically has been shown</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for 700 years there was no records</v>

1461
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:49.601
<v Speaker 1>of war in this region around shoving and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoving where the curators of the plant</v>

1462
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:51.290
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which enhances serotonin,</v>

1463
01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:53.960
<v Speaker 1>very hard opening medicine I've talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about here on this podcast,</v>

1464
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:56.720
<v Speaker 1>but they would give it to everybody.</v>

1465
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.120
<v Speaker 1>You just showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you brought a seashell as a gift.</v>

1466
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't matter.</v>

1467
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.650
<v Speaker 1>They would hold these open ceremonies</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everybody who came.</v>

1468
01:10:03.651 --> 01:10:05.960
<v Speaker 1>kings peasants doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't differ,</v>

1469
01:10:05.961 --> 01:10:09.230
<v Speaker 1>differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were offering this to everybody and</v>

1470
01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:13.860
<v Speaker 1>everybody was just more open and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>records of war and the destructions</v>

1471
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.600
<v Speaker 1>destruction that it's just not there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archaeological record and it has a</v>

1472
01:10:17.601 --> 01:10:20.660
<v Speaker 1>lot to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you can't prove causation,</v>

1473
01:10:20.661 --> 01:10:24.410
<v Speaker 1>but the correlation between them open</v>
<v Speaker 1>sourcing these psychedelic rituals to</v>

1474
01:10:24.411 --> 01:10:28.640
<v Speaker 1>everybody and they're not being war for</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and hundreds of years is</v>

1475
01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:32.210
<v Speaker 1>absolutely there and that's should it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people went wrong because they</v>

1476
01:10:32.211 --> 01:10:36.800
<v Speaker 1>tried to hoard information for power</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that knowledge of course yields</v>

1477
01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:38.870
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have the knowledge and only you</v>

1478
01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:41.270
<v Speaker 1>have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have power over people who don't.</v>

1479
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Whereas real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1480
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:45.500
<v Speaker 1>heart based power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading with your heart forward,</v>

1481
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:47.150
<v Speaker 1>just open source all that.</v>

1482
01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Let it all sorted itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1483
01:10:49.611 --> 01:10:53.780
<v Speaker 1>it only makes sense that if you want the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that you live in,</v>

1484
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 1>to be a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to tell the things that have</v>

1485
01:10:57.621 --> 01:10:59.240
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell people the things that have made</v>

1486
01:10:59.241 --> 01:11:02.960
<v Speaker 1>your life better and things that made</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life fucked up.</v>

1487
01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Don't hide that shit either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't pretend like you're perfect and</v>

1488
01:11:06.021 --> 01:11:08.090
<v Speaker 1>things don't fuck you up and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>is good.</v>

1489
01:11:08.091 --> 01:11:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Like people need to hear all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1490
01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.660
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried this thing.</v>

1491
01:11:11.661 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to do that again,</v>

1492
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1493
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.200
<v Speaker 2>how could they possibly have known that</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years ago?</v>

1494
01:11:16.201 --> 01:11:17.510
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1495
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I would love to have gone back in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to go back in time like</v>

1496
01:11:21.991 --> 01:11:25.700
<v Speaker 2>several thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just be invisible being some sort of</v>

1497
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.900
<v Speaker 2>invisible cone of protection and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit down in a village,</v>

1498
01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:32.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in ancient days,</v>

1499
01:11:32.881 --> 01:11:35.220
<v Speaker 2>in somewhere really populated area of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

1500
01:11:35.221 --> 01:11:39.780
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Greece or rome or wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just try to try to take in what</v>

1501
01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:43.150
<v Speaker 2>these fucking people are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they were living and look at what</v>

1502
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:47.280
<v Speaker 2>they're essentially like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not just our ancestors.</v>

1503
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:50.580
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can look at ancient cultures</v>

1504
01:11:50.581 --> 01:11:55.581
<v Speaker 2>in ancient societies and see if we look</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and see all of their weird crazy</v>

1505
01:11:57.721 --> 01:12:02.160
<v Speaker 2>stories and traditions and the way they</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of established the government and</v>

1506
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:06.960
<v Speaker 2>would look at what we're doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you sort of extrapolate deep into</v>

1507
01:12:06.961 --> 01:12:07.960
<v Speaker 2>the future like where were.</v>

1508
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:11.580
<v Speaker 2>These are all the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just not that long ago,</v>

1509
01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:15.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a small little blip in time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's obviously some sort of a process</v>

1510
01:12:15.421 --> 01:12:18.420
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a process of improvement</v>

1511
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:23.070
<v Speaker 2>and have a of innovation and some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a weird way innovation of culture and</v>

1512
01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 2>society and communication and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that we're</v>

1513
01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:30.930
<v Speaker 2>dealing with now with this age of</v>
<v Speaker 2>information and all the data that we</v>

1514
01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:33.900
<v Speaker 2>have to sift through and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>communication that we have to sift</v>

1515
01:12:33.901 --> 01:12:37.260
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're becoming some new thing and it's</v>

1516
01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:40.770
<v Speaker 2>happening in our lifetime and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in a really fucking confusing</v>

1517
01:12:40.771 --> 01:12:45.240
<v Speaker 2>way and it's one of the things that make</v>
<v Speaker 2>people yearn for the past.</v>

1518
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:47.880
<v Speaker 2>It makes people yearn for the good old</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

1519
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:50.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes a slogan like donald trump's</v>

1520
01:12:50.881 --> 01:12:53.280
<v Speaker 2>keep America or make America great</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1521
01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.400
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never been better.</v>

1522
01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:59.610
<v Speaker 2>It's never been better than right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would make America great again.</v>

1523
01:12:59.611 --> 01:13:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Like how could it be greater?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when has it ever been better than</v>

1524
01:13:02.281 --> 01:13:04.320
<v Speaker 2>right now for anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the safest time.</v>

1525
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.530
<v Speaker 2>This is the most communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the most information available,</v>

1526
01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:12.210
<v Speaker 2>there's the most medicine available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You medical science can save people.</v>

1527
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:15.390
<v Speaker 2>you can live healthier lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know more about nutrition,</v>

1528
01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:17.880
<v Speaker 2>we understand more about the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when was it better?</v>

1529
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and still we're in this weird</v>

1530
01:13:20.551 --> 01:13:23.010
<v Speaker 2>transitional period that I think we all</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1531
01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:28.530
<v Speaker 2>can notice because truth hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>percolated down to the rest of the rest</v>

1532
01:13:28.531 --> 01:13:31.380
<v Speaker 2>of society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's and it's a frustrating point.</v>

1533
01:13:31.381 --> 01:13:34.710
<v Speaker 2>Like we know that people should not be</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting thrown in jail for marijuana.</v>

1534
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:38.430
<v Speaker 2>That's not a debatable facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the act of throwing them in jail is</v>

1535
01:13:38.431 --> 01:13:39.270
<v Speaker 2>bad for the person.</v>

1536
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:41.880
<v Speaker 2>The act of taking the marijuana is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad for society.</v>

1537
01:13:41.881 --> 01:13:45.210
<v Speaker 2>There's the truth is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still we're in this lag.</v>

1538
01:13:45.650 --> 01:13:48.720
<v Speaker 2>The lag is really frustrated people</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1539
01:13:48.721 --> 01:13:50.550
<v Speaker 2>but that's just the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just the nature of it.</v>

1540
01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:54.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you go from switching</v>
<v Speaker 2>from mcdonald's to starting to eat</v>

1541
01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:57.990
<v Speaker 2>healthy and drinking kale shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body doesn't respond instantly.</v>

1542
01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be patient with the body</v>

1543
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.650
<v Speaker 2>like it's not just because you change</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

1544
01:14:01.651 --> 01:14:04.290
<v Speaker 2>The mind is instant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can change your mind and instantly</v>

1545
01:14:04.291 --> 01:14:06.540
<v Speaker 2>it's changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the body is different and so a</v>

1546
01:14:06.541 --> 01:14:10.350
<v Speaker 2>society like it's going to take awhile</v>
<v Speaker 2>for truth to percolate all the way</v>

1547
01:14:10.351 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>through and in the process</v>

1548
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.860
<v Speaker 3>like if you switch from mcdonald's to</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on a juice fast,</v>

1549
01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:17.860
<v Speaker 3>you're going to feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know all the toxins are going to</v>

1550
01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:20.110
<v Speaker 3>come up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is going to bubble up through</v>

1551
01:14:20.111 --> 01:14:23.800
<v Speaker 3>the body and you're going to have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive detoxification period where you</v>

1552
01:14:23.801 --> 01:14:27.670
<v Speaker 3>actually feel worse than if you had just</v>
<v Speaker 3>continued to eat mcdonald's all the time</v>

1553
01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:31.750
<v Speaker 3>because the body's going to go through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the process of at reacclimating to a new</v>

1554
01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:35.710
<v Speaker 3>way and I think we're in a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stage now where a truth is come out</v>

1555
01:14:35.711 --> 01:14:38.440
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of different aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1556
01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:40.450
<v Speaker 3>but it hasn't percolated all the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

1557
01:14:40.451 --> 01:14:44.500
<v Speaker 3>So we're going through this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>societal detox where we have an applied</v>

1558
01:14:44.501 --> 01:14:46.930
<v Speaker 3>the knowledge that is that is there</v>
<v Speaker 3>readily available.</v>

1559
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:51.430
<v Speaker 3>I have feelings on the tour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that a lot of this resistance to</v>

1560
01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:53.260
<v Speaker 3>new knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new information,</v>

1561
01:14:53.261 --> 01:14:57.670
<v Speaker 3>and even the resistance to freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the marijuana laws and a lot of the</v>

1562
01:14:57.671 --> 01:14:59.620
<v Speaker 3>things that we deeply deeply disagree</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1563
01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:04.980
<v Speaker 3>that this is all in some sort of a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>fueling change that the resistance</v>

1564
01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:10.210
<v Speaker 3>actually fires people up and makes them</v>
<v Speaker 3>more motivated to move forward and</v>

1565
01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:14.260
<v Speaker 3>actually it actually strengthens the</v>
<v Speaker 3>resolve of the resistance.</v>

1566
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.690
<v Speaker 3>To know that there's so much ignorance</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there in the world.</v>

1567
01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Like when some slob like chris christie</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts going on about nonsense saying</v>

1568
01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.450
<v Speaker 3>how dangerous marijuana is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and meanwhile he's kalille abusing the</v>

1569
01:15:25.451 --> 01:15:28.720
<v Speaker 3>fuck out of his meat vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy.</v>

1570
01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:33.780
<v Speaker 3>If anybody should not talk about health</v>
<v Speaker 3>and consequences of negative actions.</v>

1571
01:15:34.871 --> 01:15:39.130
<v Speaker 3>It's someone who's morbidly obese who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>already gone through fucking stomach</v>

1572
01:15:39.131 --> 01:15:42.670
<v Speaker 3>surgery and still morbidly obese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that guy,</v>

1573
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:45.310
<v Speaker 3>whether he knows it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as ignorant statements,</v>

1574
01:15:45.311 --> 01:15:48.550
<v Speaker 3>has fueled a massive amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>resistance.</v>

1575
01:15:48.551 --> 01:15:52.120
<v Speaker 3>There's people that have like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>doubled down on their resolve because of</v>

1576
01:15:52.121 --> 01:15:55.550
<v Speaker 3>the stupid shit that he said and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually fuels things in a,</v>

1577
01:15:55.750 --> 01:16:00.750
<v Speaker 3>in a positive way and in a horrible way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even a mass killing of gay people like</v>

1578
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 3>what happened to orlando,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>

1579
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:07.780
<v Speaker 3>terrible tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately that's not going to stop</v>

1580
01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:09.010
<v Speaker 3>people from being gay.</v>

1581
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:13.510
<v Speaker 3>What it's gonna do is it's going to fuel</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people like you and me who have</v>

1582
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:17.680
<v Speaker 3>nothing but love and acceptance for</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody regardless of your sexual</v>

1583
01:16:17.681 --> 01:16:21.310
<v Speaker 3>persuasion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To double down on that and to get that</v>

1584
01:16:21.311 --> 01:16:25.630
<v Speaker 3>out more and that's where all the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>on twitter and instagram and facebook</v>

1585
01:16:25.631 --> 01:16:30.340
<v Speaker 3>and all the social media posts about</v>
<v Speaker 3>love and respect and and not giving a</v>

1586
01:16:30.341 --> 01:16:31.600
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen,</v>

1587
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:36.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many fucking memes from</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bit that I did about this.</v>

1588
01:16:36.581 --> 01:16:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Two reasons to hate gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1589
01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:41.410
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're either dumb or you're secretly</v>

1590
01:16:41.411 --> 01:16:42.460
<v Speaker 3>worried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That dixit delicious.</v>

1591
01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.880
<v Speaker 3>That is fucking all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After one of these things happen and</v>

1592
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:50.590
<v Speaker 3>that and then a million other ones like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and a million other rainbows and</v>

1593
01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:55.570
<v Speaker 3>hearts in the shape of a rainbow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's people doubled down on their</v>

1594
01:16:55.571 --> 01:16:57.150
<v Speaker 3>acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>double down the result.</v>

1595
01:16:57.150 --> 01:17:00.040
<v Speaker 3>And there might be some people that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the fence that might've had some</v>

1596
01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:02.500
<v Speaker 3>negative ideas about gay people and see</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this and go,</v>

1597
01:17:02.501 --> 01:17:04.780
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't fucking kill people in a</v>

1598
01:17:04.781 --> 01:17:06.970
<v Speaker 3>nightclub just because they're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1599
01:17:06.971 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 3>And then they might open their mind a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit and then they might read a</v>

1600
01:17:10.101 --> 01:17:13.640
<v Speaker 3>little bit more and then they might see</v>
<v Speaker 3>an interview with some gay people that</v>

1601
01:17:13.641 --> 01:17:15.050
<v Speaker 3>are holding hands and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1602
01:17:15.051 --> 01:17:16.270
<v Speaker 3>why do I give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1603
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.320
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What religion?</v>

1604
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.280
<v Speaker 3>What some ancient stupid tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it cultural appropriation?</v>

1605
01:17:22.281 --> 01:17:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

1606
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1607
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.480
<v Speaker 3>what is it about this idea that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>should or shouldn't love people of one</v>

1608
01:17:29.391 --> 01:17:31.850
<v Speaker 3>sex or another sex?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they do love them,</v>

1609
01:17:31.851 --> 01:17:33.680
<v Speaker 3>they definitely shouldn't fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1610
01:17:33.681 --> 01:17:34.920
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're,</v>

1611
01:17:34.921 --> 01:17:36.470
<v Speaker 3>we're really good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've never fucked.</v>

1612
01:17:36.471 --> 01:17:38.840
<v Speaker 3>I hope we never do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

1613
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Like what it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would anybody care if you love</v>

1614
01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:45.410
<v Speaker 3>somebody and then you wind up touching</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body with them and pleasuring each</v>

1615
01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:48.200
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like to some people that becomes this</v>

1616
01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:53.201
<v Speaker 3>taboo worthy of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a nonsense point of view that is</v>

1617
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:57.260
<v Speaker 3>highlighted by horrific acts and these</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific acts,</v>

1618
01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:01.370
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despicable as they are in fact fuel</v>

1619
01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:04.640
<v Speaker 3>people to be more open and more</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding.</v>

1620
01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:08.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like the more you push back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more the resistance grove.</v>

1621
01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a point that you always fall</v>

1622
01:18:10.581 --> 01:18:13.580
<v Speaker 1>back on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely a hundred percent right.</v>

1623
01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean the obstacle is the way these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that in any video game you need</v>

1624
01:18:18.231 --> 01:18:21.080
<v Speaker 1>resistance in order to test your skills</v>
<v Speaker 1>and improve,</v>

1625
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:23.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a weight room you need gravity and</v>

1626
01:18:23.271 --> 01:18:26.570
<v Speaker 1>the additional weights to stress your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body so that you respond.</v>

1627
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:29.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same case with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of these elements.</v>

1628
01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:32.540
<v Speaker 1>We underestimate the value of</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance.</v>

1629
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's a great constant reminder</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1630
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of fucked up things that</v>

1631
01:18:36.441 --> 01:18:39.230
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that resistance will allow us to</v>

1632
01:18:39.231 --> 01:18:44.231
<v Speaker 1>cultivate our own consciousness and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own love and a much greater way than,</v>

1633
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 1>than if it wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1634
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And so in a loT of ways to really grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to seek out,</v>

1635
01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.510
<v Speaker 1>you have to seek out resistance in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own life and society.</v>

1636
01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll come naturally in society,</v>

1637
01:18:54.411 --> 01:18:58.400
<v Speaker 1>but put yourself up against your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>fears to grow and put yourself up</v>

1638
01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:00.560
<v Speaker 1>against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when these things do happen,</v>

1639
01:19:00.561 --> 01:19:05.330
<v Speaker 1>they are a great natural things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can rally behind and then bring forth</v>

1640
01:19:05.331 --> 01:19:09.350
<v Speaker 1>your best asset attributes and best</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects because that's what.</v>

1641
01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what allows us to grow its</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance.</v>

1642
01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what working out is.</v>

1643
01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1644
01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:18.810
<v Speaker 3>pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you don't train hard,</v>

1645
01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.720
<v Speaker 3>your body does not grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't put forth effort,</v>

1646
01:19:21.721 --> 01:19:24.690
<v Speaker 3>your body does not get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get more endurance unless you</v>

1647
01:19:24.691 --> 01:19:27.870
<v Speaker 3>push yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only one way and it's you got to</v>

1648
01:19:27.871 --> 01:19:31.440
<v Speaker 3>go through something hard in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get something good out of it.</v>

1649
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:35.040
<v Speaker 3>There's no other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the weirder things</v>

1650
01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:35.874
<v Speaker 3>about being a person.</v>

1651
01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really it comes down to people also.</v>

1652
01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.140
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've been ranting</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a lot lately is choice.</v>

1653
01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people this,</v>

1654
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:48.150
<v Speaker 1>we live in a society that loves to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice from us and say,</v>

1655
01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:49.770
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is a disease.</v>

1656
01:19:49.771 --> 01:19:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Everything is privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is this thing.</v>

1657
01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really didn't have a choice because</v>

1658
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:58.050
<v Speaker 1>there were these preconceived conditions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and it really,</v>

1659
01:19:58.051 --> 01:20:02.180
<v Speaker 1>it's robbing us of choice because with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we accept our inherent superpower,</v>

1660
01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:04.590
<v Speaker 1>which is choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we have responsibility for who we</v>

1661
01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:07.110
<v Speaker 1>are and if we have responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we are,</v>

1662
01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:11.580
<v Speaker 1>all of us have such a harsh self judge</v>
<v Speaker 1>that every failing we have,</v>

1663
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.481
<v Speaker 1>if we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1664
01:20:12.481 --> 01:20:15.570
<v Speaker 1>it was up to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the judge just beats us to death about</v>

1665
01:20:15.571 --> 01:20:18.030
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd rather shrug our responsibility</v>

1666
01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.770
<v Speaker 1>and go with our hands up to the judge.</v>

1667
01:20:19.770 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't my fault,</v>

1668
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:25.790
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't my fault because we have such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a harsh self judge in our own head that,</v>

1669
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.690
<v Speaker 1>that we intend to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

1670
01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:31.800
<v Speaker 1>we give up our inherent superpower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is choice because we don't want to</v>

1671
01:20:31.801 --> 01:20:35.220
<v Speaker 1>take the responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at any point we can take that back</v>

1672
01:20:35.221 --> 01:20:38.780
<v Speaker 1>and you have to deal with the judge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you deal with the judge by making a pact</v>

1673
01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:41.760
<v Speaker 1>to always forgive yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgive yourself for any of the fucked</v>

1674
01:20:41.761 --> 01:20:45.660
<v Speaker 1>up things that have happened and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept that we're all imperfect.</v>

1675
01:20:45.661 --> 01:20:49.350
<v Speaker 1>This idea of perfection is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all gonna fuck up.</v>

1676
01:20:49.351 --> 01:20:52.040
<v Speaker 1>We're all gonna make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the judge is,</v>

1677
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:53.720
<v Speaker 1>this is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1678
01:20:53.721 --> 01:20:56.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're all gonna have come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place we are,</v>

1679
01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:58.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through any variety of channels and</v>

1680
01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.660
<v Speaker 1>where it's going to be an imperfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>path,</v>

1681
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:01.553
<v Speaker 1>no matter what.</v>

1682
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:06.680
<v Speaker 1>So continued to pound that own message</v>
<v Speaker 1>of self love and forgiveness and then re</v>

1683
01:21:07.141 --> 01:21:11.850
<v Speaker 1>harness that element of choice so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can then decide what we want to be,</v>

1684
01:21:11.851 --> 01:21:14.940
<v Speaker 1>who we want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we want to go and put our intent.</v>

1685
01:21:14.941 --> 01:21:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Fourth and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe not everything is possible,</v>

1686
01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:22.611
<v Speaker 1>but what better thing to do then tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail in the cause of your greatest wish</v>

1687
01:21:23.221 --> 01:21:25.170
<v Speaker 1>and your greatest intention in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest desire.</v>

1688
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the ultimate warriors death.</v>

1689
01:21:27.241 --> 01:21:31.380
<v Speaker 1>That's what they would talk about with</v>
<v Speaker 1>vala to find an enemy worthy enough to</v>

1690
01:21:31.381 --> 01:21:34.050
<v Speaker 1>kill me in battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the the ultimate idea,</v>

1691
01:21:34.051 --> 01:21:37.620
<v Speaker 1>and we can all choose those battles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose that thing that we're fighting</v>

1692
01:21:37.621 --> 01:21:38.970
<v Speaker 1>for and fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we fail,</v>

1693
01:21:38.971 --> 01:21:41.490
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at least if we're going out on that</v>

1694
01:21:41.491 --> 01:21:42.300
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1695
01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.490
<v Speaker 1>we'll go out with a smile 100 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

1696
01:21:44.491 --> 01:21:47.160
<v Speaker 1>but it starts with really harnessing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that choice</v>

1697
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:51.710
<v Speaker 2>and the worst people that you know are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that don't have a good self</v>

1698
01:21:51.711 --> 01:21:54.050
<v Speaker 2>judge that everything they do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

1699
01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those motherfuckers never grow anywhere,</v>

1700
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:57.011
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1701
01:21:57.011 --> 01:21:59.400
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge issue with comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1702
01:21:59.510 --> 01:22:03.590
<v Speaker 2>when you run into people thAt have</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible comedy sets but think they did</v>

1703
01:22:03.591 --> 01:22:05.330
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we would always,</v>

1704
01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.600
<v Speaker 2>greg fitzsimmons and I would always talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that with like open miker.</v>

1705
01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:11.240
<v Speaker 2>So there's people that hear phantom</v>
<v Speaker 2>labs,</v>

1706
01:22:11.241 --> 01:22:15.140
<v Speaker 2>like they think they're doing great and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this delusional self opinion</v>

1707
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:17.990
<v Speaker 2>where everything they do is awesome and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know why they're not</v>

1708
01:22:17.991 --> 01:22:20.510
<v Speaker 2>successful already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know why they're not famous.</v>

1709
01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.740
<v Speaker 2>And those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in some sort of a weird</v>

1710
01:22:24.741 --> 01:22:26.660
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could look at it this way,</v>

1711
01:22:26.661 --> 01:22:28.610
<v Speaker 2>that those people are there to teach</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1712
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.170
<v Speaker 2>This is the consequences of not feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>that awful feeling when you fail.</v>

1713
01:22:33.230 --> 01:22:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes from the ego being so fragile</v>

1714
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:41.090
<v Speaker 2>that their ego is so fragile that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't accept the fact that they may have</v>

1715
01:22:41.091 --> 01:22:44.720
<v Speaker 2>not done a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they will manufacture ideas in their</v>

1716
01:22:44.721 --> 01:22:47.210
<v Speaker 2>heads so that they did a good job no</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what,</v>

1717
01:22:47.211 --> 01:22:49.730
<v Speaker 2>because their ego can't take the truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the blow.</v>

1718
01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:50.541
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1719
01:22:50.541 --> 01:22:51.730
<v Speaker 2>you fucking bombed out</v>

1720
01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:54.820
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it comes from insecurity and</v>

1721
01:22:54.821 --> 01:22:59.380
<v Speaker 1>fragility and then they create this</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous story in their head about</v>

1722
01:22:59.381 --> 01:23:03.910
<v Speaker 1>what it is because they can't withstand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that truth because ultimately I think it</v>

1723
01:23:03.911 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 1>all comes from the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lack of self love.</v>

1724
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.350
<v Speaker 3>That lack of ability to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1725
01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:11.980
<v Speaker 3>I fucking shit the bed and I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's okay.</v>

1726
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:13.290
<v Speaker 3>I'll be all right with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1727
01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:15.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the good ones can,</v>

1728
01:23:15.071 --> 01:23:16.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to bur,</v>

1729
01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:19.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks ago he did a set at the</v>

1730
01:23:19.031 --> 01:23:21.760
<v Speaker 3>comedy store and I saw part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

1731
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:25.500
<v Speaker 3>he was killing and then I ran into him</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the hallway and uh,</v>

1732
01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:26.381
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

1733
01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:27.670
<v Speaker 3>main room show was great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1734
01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up.</v>

1735
01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:31.770
<v Speaker 3>At the end thOugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to hang in there too long.</v>

1736
01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.850
<v Speaker 3>The last pit bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he was just,</v>

1737
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.360
<v Speaker 3>it was a rotten adam that the last bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he goes,</v>

1738
01:23:37.361 --> 01:23:40.450
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hung in there too long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should have got off of the bit before</v>

1739
01:23:40.451 --> 01:23:41.770
<v Speaker 3>that puck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1740
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:42.760
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1741
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:45.850
<v Speaker 3>when I was in there he was fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing you know.</v>

1742
01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:49.300
<v Speaker 3>But that wasn't in his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The success was not in his mind.</v>

1743
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:50.800
<v Speaker 3>This was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1744
01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.950
<v Speaker 3>whatever that happened at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fucking do that again.</v>

1745
01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:57.250
<v Speaker 3>But that's why he's bill burr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he's really good.</v>

1746
01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.353
<v Speaker 3>And because he's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1747
01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.780
<v Speaker 3>he's able to take that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at a certain point he'll be able to</v>

1748
01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.200
<v Speaker 3>have a beer or drink or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1749
01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:06.940
<v Speaker 3>dinner and just laugh about it and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to carry that.</v>

1750
01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Trauma exists forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like feel it,</v>

1751
01:24:09.521 --> 01:24:11.680
<v Speaker 3>like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could almost had it and that's</v>

1752
01:24:11.681 --> 01:24:14.140
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then it ultimately you have to have</v>

1753
01:24:14.141 --> 01:24:15.550
<v Speaker 3>that moment of forgiveness really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1754
01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:16.300
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

1755
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the beauty of being a comic</v>
<v Speaker 3>as opposed to being a fighter.</v>

1756
01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Because the comic can have that moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just the next night go on stage and</v>

1757
01:24:23.471 --> 01:24:25.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he killed were my.</v>

1758
01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:28.360
<v Speaker 3>He was killing like he's a super self</v>
<v Speaker 3>critical guy,</v>

1759
01:24:28.361 --> 01:24:33.361
<v Speaker 3>so whatever the bad moment at the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>end it was probably just fairly,</v>

1760
01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:39.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like less funny than normal.</v>

1761
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:40.330
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it was funny,</v>

1762
01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.820
<v Speaker 3>but like for a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1763
01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.320
<v Speaker 3>like here's a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone like luke rockhold who just got</v>

1764
01:24:48.401 --> 01:24:50.170
<v Speaker 3>knocked out one round by michael</v>
<v Speaker 3>bisping,</v>

1765
01:24:50.171 --> 01:24:54.460
<v Speaker 3>he's got a fucking rot with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of chew away at him.</v>

1766
01:24:54.461 --> 01:24:58.720
<v Speaker 3>That mistake that he made for months and</v>
<v Speaker 3>months and months until he gets back in</v>

1767
01:24:58.721 --> 01:25:01.150
<v Speaker 3>there again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even if he wins his next fight,</v>

1768
01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:04.390
<v Speaker 3>he didn't win that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fight is still there.</v>

1769
01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:08.800
<v Speaker 3>The fight still gonna be chewing away at</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and if he's smart he'll keep that.</v>

1770
01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.950
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a little engine that when he's</v>

1771
01:25:11.951 --> 01:25:14.980
<v Speaker 3>thinking about like when he's at the top</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the hill and he's like,</v>

1772
01:25:14.981 --> 01:25:16.060
<v Speaker 3>has got to be the last sprint.</v>

1773
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:19.300
<v Speaker 3>That engine with like wrong bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael bisping knocked you out and he</v>

1774
01:25:19.301 --> 01:25:22.810
<v Speaker 3>mocked you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it'll get right back to the bottom</v>

1775
01:25:22.811 --> 01:25:26.890
<v Speaker 3>of that hill and hopefully he won't blow</v>
<v Speaker 3>his joints out and break his body with</v>

1776
01:25:26.891 --> 01:25:29.860
<v Speaker 3>that kind of motivation because that</v>
<v Speaker 3>also can happen to people where they.</v>

1777
01:25:30.190 --> 01:25:34.960
<v Speaker 3>Their Motivation sort of it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushes the physical capacity of their</v>

1778
01:25:34.961 --> 01:25:37.210
<v Speaker 3>meat vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a possibility too.</v>

1779
01:25:37.211 --> 01:25:38.770
<v Speaker 3>You got to be real careful with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1780
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:43.990
<v Speaker 3>But that even though it seems like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible thing that happened to him is</v>

1781
01:25:43.991 --> 01:25:47.230
<v Speaker 3>not just a good thing for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a good thing for all martial</v>

1782
01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:49.120
<v Speaker 3>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good thing to understand.</v>

1783
01:25:49.121 --> 01:25:51.850
<v Speaker 3>You are a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your jaws made out of bone.</v>

1784
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Your skin is made out of flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The nerves are just like anybody else's</v>

1785
01:25:56.561 --> 01:25:59.140
<v Speaker 3>nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get cracked by a left hook,</v>

1786
01:25:59.141 --> 01:26:01.210
<v Speaker 3>the way michael bisping cracked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>luke rockhold,</v>

1787
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.410
<v Speaker 3>you're going night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

1788
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>everybody goes night and unless</v>

1789
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:06.890
<v Speaker 2>your market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just seems to be pretty fucking</v>

1790
01:26:06.891 --> 01:26:09.500
<v Speaker 2>tremendous shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

1791
01:26:10.050 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to that idea that the act</v>
<v Speaker 2>is neither good nor bad.</v>

1792
01:26:13.161 --> 01:26:16.000
<v Speaker 2>It's how you respond to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like another coop.</v>

1793
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Carlos castaneda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a great quote that for the</v>

1794
01:26:18.501 --> 01:26:20.960
<v Speaker 2>ordinary person in everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his blessing or curse,</v>

1795
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:24.440
<v Speaker 2>but for the warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're only challenges and and that's</v>

1796
01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.080
<v Speaker 2>really applies the fighting at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1797
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.560
<v Speaker 2>That was neither a blessing nor curse</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he got knocked out by michael</v>

1798
01:26:30.561 --> 01:26:34.310
<v Speaker 2>bisping and his response to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he going to respond like gsp did when</v>

1799
01:26:34.311 --> 01:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>he got knocked out by matt serra and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ringing.</v>

1800
01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionized his fighting style and</v>

1801
01:26:38.631 --> 01:26:41.060
<v Speaker 2>become the legend that we know them</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1802
01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:41.751
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1803
01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the old gsp was more exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it carried way more risks.</v>

1804
01:26:44.721 --> 01:26:47.140
<v Speaker 2>So we adapted any became better and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1805
01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:49.070
<v Speaker 2>he became this indomitable force.</v>

1806
01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.810
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think the regular gsp was</v>

1807
01:26:50.811 --> 01:26:52.420
<v Speaker 2>more exciting that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1808
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:54.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting to me is a weird term.</v>

1809
01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Like when I look at the gsp that</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed bj penn or john fitch,</v>

1810
01:26:58.821 --> 01:27:01.710
<v Speaker 2>that motherfucker was pretty god damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting and that's post matt.</v>

1811
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Matt serra I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the matt serra a analogy is a</v>

1812
01:27:05.841 --> 01:27:08.180
<v Speaker 2>perfect one because it's the same sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>

1813
01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:10.430
<v Speaker 2>who's fighting a dangerous guy that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>underestimated.</v>

1814
01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.950
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them won the ultimate fighter,</v>

1815
01:27:13.130 --> 01:27:15.320
<v Speaker 2>so it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect analogy.</v>

1816
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:20.830
<v Speaker 2>And both of them were huge underdogs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them went on to win with</v>

1817
01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:25.670
<v Speaker 2>spectacular first round knockouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta respect everybody and human</v>

1818
01:27:25.671 --> 01:27:29.210
<v Speaker 2>beings that are professional fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you think you're better than</v>

1819
01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:30.950
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have weapons,</v>

1820
01:27:30.951 --> 01:27:32.330
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take people out,</v>

1821
01:27:32.331 --> 01:27:34.010
<v Speaker 2>they all have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're a person,</v>

1822
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:37.400
<v Speaker 2>but you think that because you beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>chris weidman,</v>

1823
01:27:37.401 --> 01:27:40.130
<v Speaker 2>you destroyed leo machida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you beat the fuck out of all these</v>

1824
01:27:40.131 --> 01:27:41.570
<v Speaker 2>people and you strangled bisping.</v>

1825
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:42.740
<v Speaker 2>The first time you met him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me like,</v>

1826
01:27:42.741 --> 01:27:44.150
<v Speaker 2>there's no way this guy's going to beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1827
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:45.590
<v Speaker 2>No way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>

1828
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:49.340
<v Speaker 2>And so you go in there super relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember when I was competing in</v>

1829
01:27:49.341 --> 01:27:52.220
<v Speaker 2>the taekwondo dates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was relaxed and I didn't feel</v>

1830
01:27:52.221 --> 01:27:53.510
<v Speaker 2>nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like shit.</v>

1831
01:27:53.670 --> 01:27:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible feeling like I,</v>

1832
01:27:55.441 --> 01:27:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I only fought well when I was scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a,</v>

1833
01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.390
<v Speaker 2>that's a really important point for</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost anybody you know,</v>

1834
01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.820
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have to have some element of</v>

1835
01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:08.000
<v Speaker 2>danger involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the contest,</v>

1836
01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:10.410
<v Speaker 2>if that's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just like,</v>

1837
01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:13.160
<v Speaker 2>you can't do shit to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do shit to me,</v>

1838
01:28:13.161 --> 01:28:14.210
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1839
01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:18.790
<v Speaker 2>that left hook lands and your legs go</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1840
01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.260
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a key characteristic of being in</v>

1841
01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:23.310
<v Speaker 2>flow state that the stakes have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

1842
01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody uses surfing as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>analogy.</v>

1843
01:28:25.491 --> 01:28:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Well you can serve some baby ass waves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some two foot waves and a sand bottom</v>

1844
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:30.980
<v Speaker 2>and you're not going to get in flow</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

1845
01:28:30.981 --> 01:28:32.900
<v Speaker 2>You're just going to be kind of paddling</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cruising around,</v>

1846
01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:37.070
<v Speaker 2>but you surf that gnarly fucking double</v>
<v Speaker 2>overhead on a reef,</v>

1847
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:40.220
<v Speaker 2>on a coral reef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom fuck out of here and in flow</v>

1848
01:28:40.221 --> 01:28:42.200
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone what like laird hamilton is</v>

1849
01:28:42.201 --> 01:28:45.140
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surfing those monsters when the stakes</v>

1850
01:28:45.141 --> 01:28:48.860
<v Speaker 2>are high and you're really feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what drives you to your highest</v>

1851
01:28:48.861 --> 01:28:51.620
<v Speaker 2>performance level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So shane dorian coming in next week,</v>

1852
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:53.900
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't wait.</v>

1853
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Talk to that guy about sharks and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>

1854
01:28:58.410 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm an admin and he's a bow hunter to it</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be a lot of fun,</v>

1855
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.090
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that are,</v>

1856
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 1>that are doing really exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really dangerous things,</v>

1857
01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:10.350
<v Speaker 1>they carry with them the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those really exciting,</v>

1858
01:29:10.351 --> 01:29:13.650
<v Speaker 1>really dangerous things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally you're gonna fail and when</v>

1859
01:29:13.651 --> 01:29:16.590
<v Speaker 1>you fail this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an important to know that you can fail.</v>

1860
01:29:16.591 --> 01:29:19.590
<v Speaker 1>It's importAnt to know that no matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you have mastered whatever</v>

1861
01:29:19.591 --> 01:29:22.530
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are consequences to every zig and</v>

1862
01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:23.550
<v Speaker 1>zag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1863
01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:26.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just really about mastering the</v>

1864
01:29:26.191 --> 01:29:29.400
<v Speaker 1>ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ego is the main thing that thwarts</v>

1865
01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you on either side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you this false sense of</v>

1866
01:29:32.041 --> 01:29:35.580
<v Speaker 1>confidence and importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was recently reading a ryan</v>

1867
01:29:35.581 --> 01:29:38.700
<v Speaker 1>holiday's new book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ego is the enemy and he has the story of</v>

1868
01:29:38.701 --> 01:29:40.110
<v Speaker 1>the persian king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>xerxes,</v>

1869
01:29:40.290 --> 01:29:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a mortalized in 300 and whatnot,</v>

1870
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:47.460
<v Speaker 1>and this guy was such an egomaniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense that he got his ass</v>

1871
01:29:47.461 --> 01:29:48.210
<v Speaker 1>kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1872
01:29:48.210 --> 01:29:49.043
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly.</v>

1873
01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:51.310
<v Speaker 1>So they were building bridges over this</v>
<v Speaker 1>canal.</v>

1874
01:29:51.311 --> 01:29:56.280
<v Speaker 1>It's as the story that historians wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the water came up there.</v>

1875
01:29:56.281 --> 01:29:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Storm came in storm surge and it wiped</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the bridges.</v>

1876
01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Well then he ordered his men to take his</v>
<v Speaker 1>chains and lash the water 30 times as</v>

1877
01:30:04.261 --> 01:30:05.480
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1878
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:07.260
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for knocking down the bridge.</v>

1879
01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.300
<v Speaker 1>And he cut off the people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who made the bridge?</v>

1880
01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1881
01:30:10.050 --> 01:30:13.040
<v Speaker 1>so this fucking ego maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another storY where he,</v>

1882
01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:17.250
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to build this tunnel under a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain and he sends a letter to the</v>

1883
01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:18.960
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has his emissaries go out to announce</v>

1884
01:30:18.961 --> 01:30:22.050
<v Speaker 1>this letter to the mountain saying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountain mountain,</v>

1885
01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:25.560
<v Speaker 1>if you give us any trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will move you piece by piece into the</v>

1886
01:30:25.561 --> 01:30:28.590
<v Speaker 1>sea</v>
<v Speaker 1>king xerxes.</v>

1887
01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.830
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1888
01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:33.980
<v Speaker 1>so no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just no acknowledgment.</v>

1889
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:37.080
<v Speaker 1>He's been fed his own bullshit so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's just,</v>

1890
01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:41.550
<v Speaker 1>he thinks he's god and he plays that</v>
<v Speaker 1>role and then he runs into 300 bad</v>

1891
01:30:41.551 --> 01:30:45.780
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers at the hot gates that</v>
<v Speaker 1>their marbly and they just wipe out half</v>

1892
01:30:45.781 --> 01:30:47.250
<v Speaker 1>of his forces because he's just.</v>

1893
01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:51.270
<v Speaker 1>He can't fucking see beyond it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many ways that ego does</v>

1894
01:30:51.271 --> 01:30:54.630
<v Speaker 1>that either inflates you or it makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>too fragile or you know,</v>

1895
01:30:54.631 --> 01:30:56.760
<v Speaker 1>and that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be good at anything,</v>

1896
01:30:56.761 --> 01:30:58.500
<v Speaker 1>you got to have to come and confront</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1897
01:30:58.530 --> 01:30:59.680
<v Speaker 1>confront that beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1898
01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:01.500
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with royalty to is that it's</v>

1899
01:31:01.501 --> 01:31:03.810
<v Speaker 1>just sort of bestowed upon you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not earned.</v>

1900
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.020
<v Speaker 1>And so you have this distorted</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of your own greatness,</v>

1901
01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:08.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of,</v>

1902
01:31:08.670 --> 01:31:10.470
<v Speaker 1>you could say that about a lot of hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicks.</v>

1903
01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Royalty or like reality tv stars.</v>

1904
01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:18.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have all of this bestowed upon you</v>

1905
01:31:18.001 --> 01:31:23.001
<v Speaker 1>for some mysterious combination of luck</v>
<v Speaker 1>and timing and whatever.</v>

1906
01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.170
<v Speaker 1>But royalties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weirdest example of it,</v>

1907
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:28.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at disneyland a few weeks back</v>

1908
01:31:28.261 --> 01:31:31.410
<v Speaker 1>with my family and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to this guy that works</v>

1909
01:31:31.411 --> 01:31:36.411
<v Speaker 1>there and he was talking about this five</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old boy who was a prince from some</v>

1910
01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:41.760
<v Speaker 1>middle eastern country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he came here with this huge group of</v>

1911
01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:44.460
<v Speaker 1>guardians and watchers or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1912
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:49.650
<v Speaker 1>but they were all at his beck and call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this five-year-old was telling</v>

1913
01:31:49.651 --> 01:31:52.770
<v Speaker 1>all these adults what he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he wanted,</v>

1914
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:55.770
<v Speaker 1>what he wanted done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they all just scrambled and randall</v>

1915
01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.530
<v Speaker 1>and he was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so bizarre watching all these</v>

1916
01:31:58.531 --> 01:31:59.364
<v Speaker 1>people</v>

1917
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:05.010
<v Speaker 3>at the wrath terrifying of the wrath of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a five year old boy and that this five</v>

1918
01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:10.111
<v Speaker 3>year old boy wielded just fucking like</v>
<v Speaker 3>supernatural power house.</v>

1919
01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:12.150
<v Speaker 3>And he never earned any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1920
01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:17.220
<v Speaker 3>he was just born a five year old boy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's born this little child and now</v>

1921
01:32:17.411 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 3>he's lived for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just a boy.</v>

1922
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:22.480
<v Speaker 3>That's all he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't that never done shit?</v>

1923
01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're all like,</v>

1924
01:32:24.041 --> 01:32:26.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually have a really unique</v>

1925
01:32:26.691 --> 01:32:31.280
<v Speaker 1>perspective on that because my parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>split when I was two and very quickly to</v>

1926
01:32:31.281 --> 01:32:33.980
<v Speaker 1>worlds develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My dad was wealthy commodities trader</v>

1927
01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:38.981
<v Speaker 1>and I was his only child on that side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom remarried to a swat team,</v>

1928
01:32:39.891 --> 01:32:42.640
<v Speaker 1>squad leader who had three older boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1929
01:32:42.650 --> 01:32:46.220
<v Speaker 1>So those were my older stepbrother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at my dad's house I was the little</v>

1930
01:32:46.221 --> 01:32:48.500
<v Speaker 1>prince.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My dad was busy trading and doing his</v>

1931
01:32:48.501 --> 01:32:53.501
<v Speaker 1>thing and I had either body guards or</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people around and I could feel I</v>

1932
01:32:53.961 --> 01:32:57.230
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would develop these punk tendencies that</v>

1933
01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:00.140
<v Speaker 1>come from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from having basically servants taking</v>

1934
01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:03.530
<v Speaker 1>care of me at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'd go back to my mother's</v>

1935
01:33:03.531 --> 01:33:07.430
<v Speaker 1>house and I split time half the week I</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to my mother's house and my</v>

1936
01:33:07.431 --> 01:33:10.640
<v Speaker 1>three older stepbrothers would just beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>the punk out of me.</v>

1937
01:33:11.230 --> 01:33:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1938
01:33:13.490 --> 01:33:15.680
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being ridiculous here.</v>

1939
01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:20.690
<v Speaker 1>And so it allowed me this perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I didn't get to go and follow down</v>

1940
01:33:20.691 --> 01:33:23.540
<v Speaker 1>that path too long because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so alluring.</v>

1941
01:33:23.541 --> 01:33:24.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have power,</v>

1942
01:33:24.741 --> 01:33:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1943
01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:28.010
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1944
01:33:28.011 --> 01:33:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I got all this power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1945
01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a five year old,</v>

1946
01:33:31.251 --> 01:33:33.140
<v Speaker 1>but I know what's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know,</v>

1947
01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:35.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can do that and you can push</v>

1948
01:33:35.151 --> 01:33:37.430
<v Speaker 1>those buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're for sure going to push those</v>

1949
01:33:37.431 --> 01:33:39.860
<v Speaker 1>buttons as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's important to,</v>

1950
01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:41.960
<v Speaker 1>to have that balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately for me,</v>

1951
01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I had the other side to keep me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep me in check because I serve,</v>

1952
01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I surely would have been a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>menace if I had just gone down that</v>

1953
01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.400
<v Speaker 1>perfect older stepbrothers two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not brothers stepbrothers.</v>

1954
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have no problem beating the shit</v>

1955
01:33:56.571 --> 01:34:00.020
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time I came,</v>

1956
01:34:00.090 --> 01:34:03.320
<v Speaker 1>they bought us all paintball guns and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember my,</v>

1957
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:08.180
<v Speaker 1>one of my older stepbrothers just laid</v>
<v Speaker 1>in wait behind a wall like this.</v>

1958
01:34:08.181 --> 01:34:12.380
<v Speaker 1>We were on the property and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear me coming and just shot me point</v>

1959
01:34:12.381 --> 01:34:17.150
<v Speaker 1>blank in the fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paint ball gun just lit me up,</v>

1960
01:34:17.210 --> 01:34:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing,</v>

1961
01:34:18.501 --> 01:34:20.510
<v Speaker 1>like obviously at the time I was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy about it,</v>

1962
01:34:20.511 --> 01:34:23.300
<v Speaker 1>but this you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn things about the world and you</v>

1963
01:34:23.301 --> 01:34:27.590
<v Speaker 1>get like a different toughness that</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from that form of resistance that</v>

1964
01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:30.770
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't have that I wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly the balance person.</v>

1965
01:34:30.771 --> 01:34:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1966
01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fucking,</v>

1967
01:34:32.691 --> 01:34:36.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not perfect or balanced or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that certainly helped.</v>

1968
01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think competition is good for that to</v>

1969
01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:40.750
<v Speaker 3>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Losing,</v>

1970
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.823
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1971
01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:45.310
<v Speaker 3>especially individual one on one type</v>
<v Speaker 3>competition when you realize the</v>

1972
01:34:45.311 --> 01:34:49.120
<v Speaker 3>consequences of not working hard and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>run into someone who has worked hard,</v>

1973
01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember my competing days,</v>

1974
01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.370
<v Speaker 3>I had a chance to see some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1975
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.860
<v Speaker 3>when I was 19 I went to the olympic</v>
<v Speaker 3>training center</v>

1976
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:02.960
<v Speaker 2>and there was the world cup in Colorado</v>
<v Speaker 2>springs and I got to see like the best</v>

1977
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:07.820
<v Speaker 2>of the world compete and I remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing like this insanely high level and</v>

1978
01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:11.030
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the most important things</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as like my development as a</v>

1979
01:35:11.031 --> 01:35:13.790
<v Speaker 2>competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like seeing the top of the food chain,</v>

1980
01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:16.260
<v Speaker 2>seeing the best guys and realizing like</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1981
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:18.380
<v Speaker 2>look how hard they work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like jesus christ.</v>

1982
01:35:18.381 --> 01:35:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I was watching them train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching guys compete and I was</v>

1983
01:35:21.741 --> 01:35:24.770
<v Speaker 2>realizing like I'm not nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 2>dedicated as these people are.</v>

1984
01:35:24.771 --> 01:35:28.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not nearly as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to ramp it up like in a big,</v>

1985
01:35:28.551 --> 01:35:29.780
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big fucking way.</v>

1986
01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.940
<v Speaker 2>And seeing that and comparing yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>against other people's efforts and</v>

1987
01:35:34.941 --> 01:35:38.030
<v Speaker 2>realizing that your fall short so</v>
<v Speaker 2>critical for people.</v>

1988
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:41.240
<v Speaker 2>It's so critical to to realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1989
01:35:41.241 --> 01:35:43.280
<v Speaker 2>that guy would fuck me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like look,</v>

1990
01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:46.070
<v Speaker 2>because if you're that five-year-old</v>
<v Speaker 2>prints that five-year-old prints</v>

1991
01:35:46.071 --> 01:35:48.110
<v Speaker 2>probably has no idea that someone could</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat his ass,</v>

1992
01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably just thinks he just gets to</v>

1993
01:35:50.541 --> 01:35:54.950
<v Speaker 2>yell at you and you have to get on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>knees and start bowing and lowering your</v>

1994
01:35:54.951 --> 01:35:59.951
<v Speaker 2>head and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't experience other people's</v>

1995
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:04.040
<v Speaker 2>efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't experience like a real</v>

1996
01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:09.020
<v Speaker 2>competition where you see people pushing</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as far as they can to try to</v>

1997
01:36:09.021 --> 01:36:13.730
<v Speaker 2>win a race where you see the last few</v>
<v Speaker 2>meters of the race where guys,</v>

1998
01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:17.480
<v Speaker 2>you could see it in their face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking struggle.</v>

1999
01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:21.230
<v Speaker 2>If you never do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you never do that,</v>

2000
01:36:21.231 --> 01:36:26.231
<v Speaker 2>if you never push to that very edge of</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical capacity,</v>

2001
01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:29.900
<v Speaker 2>then you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't really understand what's out</v>

2002
01:36:29.901 --> 01:36:32.210
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the reasons why people</v>

2003
01:36:32.211 --> 01:36:35.660
<v Speaker 2>who have never had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any martial arts experience at all or</v>

2004
01:36:35.661 --> 01:36:39.830
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to fight at all gets so</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird around confrontation with men.</v>

2005
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times have you been around men</v>

2006
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:44.420
<v Speaker 2>who don't know how to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden they get a few</v>

2007
01:36:44.421 --> 01:36:48.140
<v Speaker 2>drinks in them and they start yelling at</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and talking crazy shit.</v>

2008
01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:50.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like they don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost,</v>

2009
01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:55.430
<v Speaker 2>they're like confused and so they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're almost inviting their own doom.</v>

2010
01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:59.390
<v Speaker 2>They're almost like sending out a bat</v>
<v Speaker 2>signal for someone to punch them in the</v>

2011
01:36:59.391 --> 01:37:01.430
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a subconscious thing</v>

2012
01:37:01.610 --> 01:37:05.240
<v Speaker 2>where they want someone to kick their</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass because they kind of know that</v>

2013
01:37:05.241 --> 01:37:07.330
<v Speaker 2>they're so unbalanced in their approach.</v>

2014
01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:11.100
<v Speaker 2>The fight club moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're running a light,</v>

2015
01:37:11.101 --> 01:37:14.260
<v Speaker 2>their own place on fire and beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves up just to get that attribute</v>

2016
01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:15.200
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you see that.</v>

2017
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:19.730
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is where people just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't take the idea that there may be</v>

2018
01:37:19.731 --> 01:37:23.180
<v Speaker 2>consequences to their actions to heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a perfect example of this.</v>

2019
01:37:23.181 --> 01:37:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I was after partying with an ex gamer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't mention anything farther than</v>

2020
01:37:26.751 --> 01:37:28.010
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an x game guy,</v>

2021
01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:33.220
<v Speaker 2>super successful like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 20 year old kid and he's been so</v>

2022
01:37:34.491 --> 01:37:37.250
<v Speaker 2>successful for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those child prodigies,</v>

2023

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And We go and he's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>austin and we were having fun and he</v>

2025
01:37:43.731 --> 01:37:45.800
<v Speaker 2>continues to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes in immediately puts on his</v>

2026
01:37:45.801 --> 01:37:47.900
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he cranks it all the way up to full</v>

2027
01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:48.411
<v Speaker 2>volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2028

2029

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2030
01:37:51.021 --> 01:37:52.190
<v Speaker 2>you can't crank it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2031
01:37:52.191 --> 01:37:54.260
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes and he does it again.</v>

2032
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:56.150
<v Speaker 2>And he goes and he does it again and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep warning.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I looked at him with a total</v>

2038
01:38:04.891 --> 01:38:07.440
<v Speaker 1>different tone and then he looked at me</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2039
01:38:07.770 --> 01:38:10.710
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that that consequences of</v>

2040
01:38:10.711 --> 01:38:13.620
<v Speaker 1>my actions was even a fucking feasible</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

2041
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Like that moment of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

2042
01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:19.980
<v Speaker 1>this other dude may punch me if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking do this again and be that</v>

2043
01:38:19.981 --> 01:38:23.190
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like for him,</v>

2044
01:38:23.191 --> 01:38:27.090
<v Speaker 1>he had surrounded himself with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in this environment where just</v>

2045
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:31.050
<v Speaker 1>having respect for somebody in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences for repeated disrespect</v>

2046
01:38:31.051 --> 01:38:33.010
<v Speaker 1>might actually be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like a,</v>

2047
01:38:33.011 --> 01:38:35.580
<v Speaker 1>a world changing moment for him or he</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked up like,</v>

2048
01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:37.530
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is weird.</v>

2049
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm royalty.</v>

2050
01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2051
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:41.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't punch me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2052
01:38:41.461 --> 01:38:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And then after that he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shook by it and he kept saying,</v>

2053
01:38:44.290 --> 01:38:44.971
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2054
01:38:44.971 --> 01:38:46.260
<v Speaker 1>no disrespect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah.</v>

2055
01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:49.380
<v Speaker 1>But he needed that moment of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look bro,</v>

2056
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:52.680
<v Speaker 1>fucking shit Will get real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are consequences,</v>

2057
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not some fucking fantasy land</v>

2058
01:38:55.081 --> 01:38:56.120
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2059
01:38:56.130 --> 01:38:59.400
<v Speaker 1>And then that moment totally changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally changed things,</v>

2060
01:38:59.401 --> 01:39:02.430
<v Speaker 1>but people don't get those when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have that resistance,</v>

2061
01:39:02.431 --> 01:39:05.580
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the older stepbrother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have that person that can</v>

2062
01:39:05.581 --> 01:39:08.340
<v Speaker 1>step in and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yo fucking knock,</v>

2063
01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.460
<v Speaker 1>knock that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attention to the other people to just do</v>

2064
01:39:11.461 --> 01:39:12.660
<v Speaker 1>what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2065
01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:14.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing about like,</v>

2066
01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.940
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily just x gamers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people that do these extreme sports.</v>

2067
01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:21.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of these guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2068
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:24.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say like pranksters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

2069
01:39:24.930 --> 01:39:29.920
<v Speaker 3>they revel in annoying people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>pissing people off and the attention</v>

2070
01:39:29.921 --> 01:39:33.490
<v Speaker 3>that they get from it is real strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange,</v>

2071
01:39:33.491 --> 01:39:38.170
<v Speaker 3>like sort of a vibe that comes with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of bmx jumpers and all these crazy</v>

2072
01:39:38.171 --> 01:39:42.040
<v Speaker 3>fucks that do a lot of risky shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have that sort of personality trait</v>

2073
01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:46.060
<v Speaker 3>where they're constantly pushing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>envelope and some sort of a strange way.</v>

2074
01:39:46.570 --> 01:39:47.101
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2075
01:39:47.101 --> 01:39:50.080
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like people pissed that I'm mad.</v>

2076
01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:52.020
<v Speaker 3>You mad a,</v>

2077
01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:55.440
<v Speaker 1>it may come from the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly skateboarders,</v>

2078
01:39:55.441 --> 01:39:59.070
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly getting persecuted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>lame ass authority figures telling them</v>

2079
01:39:59.071 --> 01:40:01.010
<v Speaker 1>not to skate on their fucking hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>rails.</v>

2080
01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Some banker comes that don't scare on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand rails kid you fucking punk,</v>

2081
01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of constantly being chased</v>

2082
01:40:07.711 --> 01:40:11.640
<v Speaker 1>around by people who are dummies and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it develops this kind of like</v>

2083
01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.100
<v Speaker 1>counter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2084
01:40:13.101 --> 01:40:14.130
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this reaction.</v>

2085
01:40:14.131 --> 01:40:17.340
<v Speaker 1>So that reaction of being persecuted for</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what they're enjoying to do</v>

2086
01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:19.500
<v Speaker 1>creates this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck the man.</v>

2087
01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe</v>

2088
01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:23.700
<v Speaker 3>maybe they should yell at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I was fucking walking down that</v>

2089
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:26.590
<v Speaker 3>some dude came flying down the rail and</v>
<v Speaker 3>broke my leg.</v>

2090
01:40:26.591 --> 01:40:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you piece of shit.</v>

2091
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of those guys are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuts,</v>

2092
01:40:30.611 --> 01:40:32.470
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll put people in danger,</v>

2093
01:40:32.710 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 3>like I've seen some crazy stunts on</v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube where these dudes jump on top of</v>

2094
01:40:37.811 --> 01:40:41.760
<v Speaker 3>these railings and slide them to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom and fuck up and plow into people.</v>

2095
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:46.510
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is not an x game.</v>

2096
01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just do that with a bunch of</v>

2097
01:40:49.811 --> 01:40:53.620
<v Speaker 3>other people around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But some of those folks care,</v>

2098
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:56.680
<v Speaker 2>certainly not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Tim kennedy choked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went completely unconscious and</v>

2114

<v Speaker 2>But then he has that switch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:37.780
<v Speaker 2>he can do whatever access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that place is.</v>

2154
01:43:37.781 --> 01:43:40.870

<v Speaker 2>not go to jail.</v>

2158
01:43:48.130 --> 01:43:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Hashtags still serving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag hard to kill.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's got his shirt off with an axe with</v>

2160
01:43:56.530 --> 01:44:00.590
<v Speaker 2>one of those ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are those things called guy fawkes.</v>

2161
01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Beard and mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2162
01:44:02.410 --> 01:44:03.760
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2163
01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.930
<v Speaker 2>like musketeers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three musketeers style.</v>

2164
01:44:05.931 --> 01:44:06.950
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an animal,</v>

2165
01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:08.810
<v Speaker 2>but we need people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

2166
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:09.730
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2167
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:12.240
<v Speaker 2>That's the extreme on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2168
01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:15.470
<v Speaker 2>on the warrior end of the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the extreme,</v>

2169
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:16.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2170
01:44:16.570 --> 01:44:19.090
<v Speaker 2>the flamboyant warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2171
01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:23.100
<v Speaker 1>The thing that you can really appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the truth of it.</v>

2172
01:44:23.130 --> 01:44:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Like it cuts all the way through to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>core.</v>

2173
01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the peopLe that are,</v>

2174
01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:30.210
<v Speaker 1>that you shake them a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other person emerges and you shake</v>

2175
01:44:30.211 --> 01:44:31.970
<v Speaker 1>them again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking magic eight ball.</v>

2176
01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:35.450
<v Speaker 2>That's gonna come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those are the people that are the</v>

2177
01:44:35.451 --> 01:44:36.570
<v Speaker 2>worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim,</v>

2178
01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.090
<v Speaker 2>it's tim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim,</v>

2179
01:44:38.091 --> 01:44:38.930
<v Speaker 2>it's tim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shake it again.</v>

2180
01:44:38.931 --> 01:44:40.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a little slightly angry or tim.</v>

2181
01:44:41.110 --> 01:44:42.540
<v Speaker 1>It's the same fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2182
01:44:42.730 --> 01:44:44.800
<v Speaker 1>that's always a beautiful thing when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>

2183
01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:47.050
<v Speaker 1>People have dealt with those deeper</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2184
01:44:47.051 --> 01:44:49.300
<v Speaker 1>they've reconciled all these forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2185
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to put them in a</v>

2186
01:44:51.011 --> 01:44:53.410
<v Speaker 1>situation where this other person</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges and you're like,</v>

2187
01:44:53.411 --> 01:44:55.570
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this selfish piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit</v>

2188
01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:56.360
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2189
01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is also something that we were</v>

2190
01:44:58.431 --> 01:45:02.570
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier when you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about people like the,</v>

2191
01:45:02.610 --> 01:45:05.630
<v Speaker 2>the camaraderie and the craziness of</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to war,</v>

2192
01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:10.940
<v Speaker 2>that they actually enjoy it and become</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy there and some sort of a weird way</v>

2193
01:45:10.941 --> 01:45:15.110
<v Speaker 2>because life becomes real because life</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes real in this chaotic moment.</v>

2194
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:18.770
<v Speaker 2>There was a ta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a ted radio hour.</v>

2195
01:45:18.771 --> 01:45:21.860
<v Speaker 2>It might have been a radiolab podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a ted radio hour,</v>

2196
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:26.420
<v Speaker 2>but they were talking to someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were talking to soldiers and they</v>

2197
01:45:26.421 --> 01:45:28.940
<v Speaker 2>were talking to people about happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what makes you.</v>

2198
01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:31.280
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't ted show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a ted talk and it was.</v>

2199
01:45:31.330 --> 01:45:33.440
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about happiness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

2200
01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:37.790
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they got into was</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that went over to Iraq and</v>

2201
01:45:37.791 --> 01:45:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and served and they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back and talk about it and they</v>

2202
01:45:41.631 --> 01:45:43.910
<v Speaker 2>said it was horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was chaotic.</v>

2203
01:45:43.911 --> 01:45:46.070
<v Speaker 2>It was scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was the happiest days of my life</v>

2204
01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:49.190
<v Speaker 2>and one of the reasons why I was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>happiest days of their life was this</v>

2205
01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:54.380
<v Speaker 2>intense bond and comradery that they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed with these other people that</v>

2206
01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:55.250
<v Speaker 2>they were serving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With.</v>

2207
01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:00.280
<v Speaker 2>That there was nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no sort of closeness and bond of</v>

2208
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:05.090
<v Speaker 2>brotherhood that even comes close to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bond of brotherhood when you need to</v>

2209
01:46:05.091 --> 01:46:09.800
<v Speaker 2>rely on these people and they rely on</v>
<v Speaker 2>you for your very life and you're taking</v>

2210
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:10.820
<v Speaker 2>other people's lives.</v>

2211
01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a huge missing piece in</v>

2212
01:46:13.551 --> 01:46:17.600
<v Speaker 1>our society and I think a few people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to access it on sports teams and,</v>

2213
01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:19.620
<v Speaker 1>and on different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2214
01:46:19.621 --> 01:46:23.690
<v Speaker 1>and obviously in war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that tribal element of going</v>

2215
01:46:23.691 --> 01:46:26.900
<v Speaker 1>through these shared rites of passages</v>
<v Speaker 1>and going through these things that</v>

2216
01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:32.140
<v Speaker 1>bonded a group together so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really had true altruistic love for more</v>

2217
01:46:32.901 --> 01:46:34.790
<v Speaker 1>of the more people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2218
01:46:34.791 --> 01:46:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a deep calling that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of ignored,</v>

2219
01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those soldiers would truly fight</v>

2220
01:46:39.921 --> 01:46:44.210
<v Speaker 1>and die for each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the epitome of altruism.</v>

2221
01:46:44.211 --> 01:46:47.900
<v Speaker 1>It's wanting the other person's good</v>
<v Speaker 1>even at the cost of your own,</v>

2222
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:48.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2223
01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:52.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's a feeling that I think feels</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently the best.</v>

2224
01:46:52.411 --> 01:46:55.920
<v Speaker 1>It's our natural state to be this like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the son of love,</v>

2225
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:56.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2226
01:46:56.401 --> 01:46:58.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Just pouring it out and not</v>

2227
01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:02.580
<v Speaker 1>deciding who gets a bit truly feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way about a group of people.</v>

2228
01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:04.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2229
01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:08.100
<v Speaker 1>as we develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the concepts that</v>

2230
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm always talking about is recreating</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of tribal element where you do</v>

2231
01:47:12.631 --> 01:47:15.660
<v Speaker 1>go through these rites of passage and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to involve war,</v>

2232
01:47:15.661 --> 01:47:19.620
<v Speaker 1>which is inherently an unsustainable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary practice,</v>

2233
01:47:19.621 --> 01:47:21.660
<v Speaker 1>but how do you create that same</v>
<v Speaker 1>closeness,</v>

2234
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:24.210
<v Speaker 1>but do it through ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it through,</v>

2235
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going and climbing this mountain and</v>

2236
01:47:26.641 --> 01:47:30.090
<v Speaker 1>taking the psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however you want to do it in a way that</v>

2237
01:47:30.091 --> 01:47:33.810
<v Speaker 1>can bond you together with the group so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have those feelings where there's</v>

2238
01:47:33.811 --> 01:47:34.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing.</v>

2239
01:47:34.711 --> 01:47:37.170
<v Speaker 1>You're holding back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your truth is completely exposed.</v>

2240
01:47:37.171 --> 01:47:40.720
<v Speaker 1>You're naked with all your intentions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thoughts and ideas and you just</v>

2241
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:44.460
<v Speaker 1>truly want the best for another</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and and that tribe,</v>

2242
01:47:44.461 --> 01:47:47.580
<v Speaker 1>that feeling of tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what tribe is and I think we're</v>

2243
01:47:47.581 --> 01:47:49.890
<v Speaker 1>missing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this ourselves in the small</v>

2244
01:47:49.891 --> 01:47:54.750
<v Speaker 1>nuclear unit and then we have this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide world which is too big to really</v>

2245
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:58.410
<v Speaker 1>care to that degree about and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing the intermediary,</v>

2246
01:47:58.411 --> 01:48:00.300
<v Speaker 1>which is Just this band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this group,</v>

2247
01:48:00.301 --> 01:48:03.030
<v Speaker 1>this family that were willing to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything for.</v>

2248
01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then obviously expanding that even</v>

2249
01:48:06.071 --> 01:48:08.680
<v Speaker 2>further from your media group to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the human race.</v>

2250
01:48:08.710 --> 01:48:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So difficult to even conceptualize when</v>

2251
01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:18.210
<v Speaker 2>tim kennedy fought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a fight for the troops and um,</v>

2252
01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that where it was?</v>

2253
01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:26.950
<v Speaker 2>He fought half natal and he knocked him</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and this was like,</v>

2254
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they even captured this on</v>
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>

2255
01:48:30.010 --> 01:48:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Tim hopped on top of the fence and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just calling out to all the troops.</v>

2256
01:48:36.701 --> 01:48:37.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think.</v>

2257
01:48:38.050 --> 01:48:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the camera's caught this</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>

2258
01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:44.350
<v Speaker 2>but he was pointing to everybody who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just telling them he loved them.</v>

2259
01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:46.270
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you guys.</v>

2260
01:48:46.271 --> 01:48:48.460
<v Speaker 2>I love all you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pointing at people,</v>

2261
01:48:48.461 --> 01:48:51.110
<v Speaker 2>I love you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like what,</v>

2262
01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:53.560
<v Speaker 2>what he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he served.</v>

2263
01:48:53.561 --> 01:48:54.790
<v Speaker 2>He's fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>

2264
01:48:54.791 --> 01:48:56.680
<v Speaker 2>he served in combat many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>

2265
01:48:56.681 --> 01:49:01.681
<v Speaker 2>He's still serving now that the reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like his expression and his love for</v>

2266
01:49:02.981 --> 01:49:04.660
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very,</v>

2267
01:49:04.661 --> 01:49:08.200
<v Speaker 2>very intensely moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the most intensely moving</v>

2268
01:49:08.230 --> 01:49:12.090
<v Speaker 2>post-fight speeches or post-fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrations I've ever expect.</v>

2269
01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Not not one of the most that I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced</v>

2270
01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:18.610
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were pushing so much energy back</v>

2271
01:49:18.611 --> 01:49:22.600
<v Speaker 1>them chanting and it was tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ReallY amazing moment.</v>

2272
01:49:22.601 --> 01:49:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine those,</v>

2273
01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you read about those moments in history</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the great leaders come in and have</v>

2274
01:49:28.571 --> 01:49:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that moment with their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their troops,</v>

2275
01:49:31.050 --> 01:49:33.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't see that now in today's</v>

2276
01:49:33.191 --> 01:49:34.001
<v Speaker 1>warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2277
01:49:34.001 --> 01:49:35.010
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no that,</v>

2278
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:39.370
<v Speaker 1>that independence day moment right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they give that rousing speech and</v>

2279
01:49:39.371 --> 01:49:42.020
<v Speaker 1>everybody's just pounding their chest</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2280
01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:45.070
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that's really deeply,</v>

2281
01:49:45.190 --> 01:49:47.800
<v Speaker 1>deeply moving and powerful and to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2282
01:49:47.801 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 1>you need</v>

2283
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.450
<v Speaker 2>to have that force of resistance that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all allied against,</v>

2284
01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:56.230
<v Speaker 2>your all banded together against that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that other thing,</v>

2285
01:49:56.530 --> 01:50:00.500
<v Speaker 2>and it's just choosing a thing that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly worthy of,</v>

2286
01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:03.640
<v Speaker 2>of your fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So choosing to fight against something</v>

2287
01:50:03.641 --> 01:50:07.420
<v Speaker 2>that's not just another people or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another race or all the stupid things</v>

2288
01:50:07.421 --> 01:50:10.360
<v Speaker 2>that we choose to fight against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but choosing to fight against something</v>

2289
01:50:10.361 --> 01:50:12.670
<v Speaker 2>truly worthy of that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2290
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:15.310
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing to them,</v>

2291
01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:20.340
<v Speaker 2>to these soldiers was this concept of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enemy being a truly evil force,</v>

2292
01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's isis or whether it's</v>

2293
01:50:24.521 --> 01:50:28.570
<v Speaker 2>anything else like these guys were all</v>
<v Speaker 2>united against it and to have tim</v>

2294
01:50:28.571 --> 01:50:33.100
<v Speaker 2>kennedy as this person who's like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>figurehead representing them and win by</v>

2295
01:50:33.101 --> 01:50:38.101
<v Speaker 2>knockout in a military base in such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular fashion on television and</v>

2296
01:50:38.201 --> 01:50:41.230
<v Speaker 2>understanding all the weight behind all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because there are cameras.</v>

2297
01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:44.080
<v Speaker 2>It is being televised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is being broadcast all throughout the</v>

2298
01:50:44.081 --> 01:50:48.530
<v Speaker 2>world that will be available for ever on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the internet and you know,</v>

2299
01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:51.880
<v Speaker 2>through the ufc fight pass archives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll always be able to watch that.</v>

2300
01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:54.220
<v Speaker 2>And when he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he connected with that left hook</v>

2301
01:50:54.221 --> 01:50:57.700
<v Speaker 2>and the crowd fucking roared and natal</v>
<v Speaker 2>went out.</v>

2302
01:50:57.970 --> 01:50:58.960
<v Speaker 2>It was nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2303
01:50:58.961 --> 01:51:00.330
<v Speaker 2>It was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2304
01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:03.490
<v Speaker 2>you like history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the history of rome,</v>

2305
01:51:03.491 --> 01:51:06.910
<v Speaker 2>which I'm most familiar with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was always these moments in time</v>

2306
01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:11.020
<v Speaker 2>where a leader would naturally emerge</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that for whatever reason,</v>

2307
01:51:11.021 --> 01:51:14.380
<v Speaker 2>and then it would always made the</v>
<v Speaker 2>emperor is really squirrely because at</v>

2308
01:51:14.381 --> 01:51:17.050
<v Speaker 2>any point in time that person could all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden be like,</v>

2311
01:51:22.601 --> 01:51:23.770
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if tim said,</v>

2312
01:51:23.970 --> 01:51:26.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if tim after that Jumped off the cage</v>

<v Speaker 2>We know that's what we need.</v>

2322
01:51:42.101 --> 01:51:46.480
<v Speaker 2>We need someone who understands the</v>
<v Speaker 2>realities and the consequences of what</v>

2323
01:51:46.481 --> 01:51:51.481
<v Speaker 2>these people in these hallowed halls of</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice are trying to pull off all</v>

2324
01:51:53.051 --> 01:51:55.800
<v Speaker 2>throughout the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of having these old chicken</v>

2325
01:51:55.801 --> 01:51:59.770
<v Speaker 2>hawks or sydney's has a hose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was.</v>

2326
01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:04.000
<v Speaker 2>It was from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one of the best quotes from</v>

2327
01:52:04.570 --> 01:52:07.600
<v Speaker 2>the documentary on hunter s thompson</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he was,</v>

2328
01:52:07.601 --> 01:52:09.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to.</v>

2329
01:52:09.110 --> 01:52:13.930
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't ed muskie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a mcgovern and mcgovern was</v>

2330
01:52:13.931 --> 01:52:18.340
<v Speaker 2>saying I'm sick of old venn in air</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioned buildings,</v>

2331
01:52:18.370 --> 01:52:21.400
<v Speaker 2>sending young men to go off and die in</v>
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

2332
01:52:22.810 --> 01:52:26.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really one of the most despIcable</v>

2333
01:52:26.201 --> 01:52:31.201
<v Speaker 2>aspects of the decision making process</v>
<v Speaker 2>by quote unquote leaders is that there</v>

2334
01:52:32.130 --> 01:52:33.790
<v Speaker 2>their consequences are so minimal.</v>

2335
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if every single politician and leader</v>

2336
01:52:37.781 --> 01:52:42.310
<v Speaker 2>had to be at the head of the army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to go to the fray,</v>

2337
01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:47.610
<v Speaker 2>had to be on the front lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many actual wars where we get into</v>

2338
01:52:48.750 --> 01:52:50.930
<v Speaker 2>or serve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say they weren't Capable of</v>

2339
01:52:50.931 --> 01:52:52.790
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least they'd have to serve at the</v>

2340
01:52:52.791 --> 01:52:56.480
<v Speaker 2>frontline hospital so that every person</v>
<v Speaker 2>with like for a week,</v>

2341
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:57.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at the front lines,</v>

2342
01:52:57.711 --> 01:52:59.830
<v Speaker 2>you're just a nurse assistant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2343
01:52:59.950 --> 01:53:03.140
<v Speaker 2>so everybody coming back blown up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shrapnel you know,</v>

2344
01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:05.420
<v Speaker 2>sent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you pass this message to my</v>

2345
01:53:05.421 --> 01:53:07.310
<v Speaker 2>sweetheart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell this to my mother.</v>

2346
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Like they're receiving that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at least they have to get in touch</v>

2347
01:53:10.491 --> 01:53:13.430
<v Speaker 2>with it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and understand the consequences of what</v>

2348
01:53:13.431 --> 01:53:16.670
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's easy to get this sociopathic</v>

2349
01:53:16.671 --> 01:53:17.780
<v Speaker 2>kind of mindset like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2350
01:53:17.781 --> 01:53:19.760
<v Speaker 2>these are just pieces of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2351
01:53:19.761 --> 01:53:23.900
<v Speaker 2>those like the conquest boards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looked like big chess boards you see</v>

2352
01:53:23.901 --> 01:53:26.930
<v Speaker 2>in all of game of thrones or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>know I moved my troops here,</v>

2353
01:53:26.931 --> 01:53:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I move.</v>

2354
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:30.410
<v Speaker 2>this becomes all strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you lose the humanity of it,</v>

2355
01:53:30.750 --> 01:53:33.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose that connection with really who</v>

2356
01:53:33.711 --> 01:53:36.440
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those moments are incredibly</v>

2357
01:53:36.441 --> 01:53:39.920
<v Speaker 2>important to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to really keep the thing going and keep.</v>

2358
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Keep you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep you in line.</v>

2359
01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people would say,</v>

2360
01:53:42.861 --> 01:53:44.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they did do that,</v>

2361
01:53:44.241 --> 01:53:46.850
<v Speaker 2>what would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impossible the way we need it and the</v>

2362
01:53:46.851 --> 01:53:47.780
<v Speaker 2>way we do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2363
01:53:47.781 --> 01:53:48.830
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2364
01:53:48.831 --> 01:53:50.140
<v Speaker 2>don't do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck.</v>

2365
01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:53.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to say it's one of the main</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems with,</v>

2366
01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:58.310
<v Speaker 2>with war and with leadership is that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are in charge at the very</v>

2367
01:53:58.311 --> 01:54:02.450
<v Speaker 2>top and a lot of ways are behaving like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that five year old boy at disneyland is</v>

2368
01:54:02.451 --> 01:54:05.330
<v Speaker 2>a prince.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have too much power with no</v>

2369
01:54:05.331 --> 01:54:07.610
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have too much power that</v>

2370
01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:10.040
<v Speaker 2>essentially they haven't really earned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2371
01:54:10.041 --> 01:54:12.590
<v Speaker 2>when you've got a guy like jocko willink</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

2372
01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:17.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a real military hero who is over</v>

2373
01:54:17.661 --> 01:54:22.070
<v Speaker 2>there commanding when that guy talks</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the military or talks about war or</v>

2374
01:54:22.071 --> 01:54:26.300
<v Speaker 2>talks about actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the respect is that you don't need to</v>

2375
01:54:26.301 --> 01:54:27.134
<v Speaker 2>respect him.</v>

2376
01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:30.230
<v Speaker 2>You're going to respect him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to understand that this is a guy</v>

2377
01:54:30.231 --> 01:54:32.810
<v Speaker 2>who's been there and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen because it's real.</v>

2378
01:54:33.230 --> 01:54:38.230
<v Speaker 2>When a guy like dick cheney started</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about military actions,</v>

2379
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:43.810
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with some fucking weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>detachment from the reality and</v>

2380
01:54:44.691 --> 01:54:49.691
<v Speaker 2>consequences of war from a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the Iraq invasion a lot of the</v>

2381
01:54:50.601 --> 01:54:53.540
<v Speaker 2>times was in a bunker member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that member,</v>

2382
01:54:53.541 --> 01:54:57.140
<v Speaker 2>they would talk about him being in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>underground bunker and I was always</v>

2383
01:54:57.141 --> 01:54:59.000
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is dick cheney in the bunker?</v>

2384
01:54:59.001 --> 01:55:02.930
<v Speaker 2>And george w dot bush is on tv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will fuck is running this country for</v>

2385
01:55:02.931 --> 01:55:06.080
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these guys that got multiple</v>

2386
01:55:06.081 --> 01:55:10.370
<v Speaker 2>deferments like dick cheney did to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually serving in the war.</v>

2387
01:55:10.610 --> 01:55:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he got several deferments to</v>

2388
01:55:13.521 --> 01:55:16.460
<v Speaker 2>avoid having to actual see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually see real combat.</v>

2389
01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:20.120
<v Speaker 2>Those are not the people that she'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to make those kinds of decisions</v>

2390
01:55:20.121 --> 01:55:21.740
<v Speaker 2>to put people in harm's way.</v>

2391
01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:24.710
<v Speaker 2>They just shouldn't be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a guy like jocko.</v>

2392
01:55:24.711 --> 01:55:28.070
<v Speaker 2>You need a guy like tim kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need someone who's actually been</v>

2393
01:55:28.071 --> 01:55:28.940
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2394
01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:29.841
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>

2395
01:55:29.841 --> 01:55:32.480
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting time and the nature</v>

2396
01:55:32.481 --> 01:55:35.090
<v Speaker 2>of war is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're obviously with</v>

2397
01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:38.840
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic stress being such an</v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemic that it is now.</v>

2398
01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:43.590
<v Speaker 2>We're not adequately dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that element of things.</v>

2399
01:55:43.591 --> 01:55:46.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an incredibly traumatic aspect of</v>

2400
01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:50.580
<v Speaker 2>we're not prepared for death can come at</v>
<v Speaker 2>any moment unseen,</v>

2401
01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like our bodies.</v>

2402
01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>

2403
01:55:53.011 --> 01:55:54.600
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the barbarian hoard.</v>

2404
01:55:54.601 --> 01:55:58.680
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna run with their pointy</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and I'm going to have time to run</v>

2405
01:55:58.681 --> 01:56:01.980
<v Speaker 2>at them with my pointy thing and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>when death might come,</v>

2406
01:56:02.130 --> 01:56:04.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does not gonna come from this random</v>

2407
01:56:04.951 --> 01:56:06.790
<v Speaker 2>explosion that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2408
01:56:06.970 --> 01:56:09.120
<v Speaker 2>every car could be a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this.</v>

2409
01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:13.200
<v Speaker 2>It's this crazy time that we're in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to really pay attention to what</v>

2410
01:56:13.201 --> 01:56:17.460
<v Speaker 2>that's doing to the humans and use the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best technology available to to fix</v>

2411
01:56:17.461 --> 01:56:19.290
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think obviously rick doblin has</v>

2412
01:56:19.291 --> 01:56:21.420
<v Speaker 2>been on here a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is on the forefront of that,</v>

2413
01:56:21.810 --> 01:56:24.420
<v Speaker 2>but we're just looking at the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing completely wrong.</v>

2414
01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:26.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have old ideas,</v>

2415
01:56:26.011 --> 01:56:27.540
<v Speaker 2>bad ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad leaders,</v>

2416
01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:29.850
<v Speaker 2>and it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing where truth is there.</v>

2417
01:56:30.090 --> 01:56:31.740
<v Speaker 2>We undersTand that there's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemic.</v>

2418
01:56:31.741 --> 01:56:34.470
<v Speaker 2>We understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's some possible ways to fix it,</v>

2419
01:56:34.471 --> 01:56:36.930
<v Speaker 2>but it hasn't percolated all the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

2420
01:56:36.931 --> 01:56:38.790
<v Speaker 2>So we're in this transition period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2421
01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:39.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2422
01:56:39.581 --> 01:56:42.840
<v Speaker 2>it's ugly right now and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can see the,</v>

2423
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:45.750
<v Speaker 2>you can see the horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that sun poking through the</v>

2424
01:56:45.751 --> 01:56:48.870
<v Speaker 2>clouds and you know that truth just has</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different resonance.</v>

2425
01:56:48.871 --> 01:56:52.020
<v Speaker 2>It has a different frequency and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopted eventually.</v>

2426
01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:52.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2427
01:56:52.490 --> 01:56:53.660
<v Speaker 2>it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2428
01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:56.700
<v Speaker 2>there'll be people who still think</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's flat earth and whatever.</v>

2429
01:56:56.850 --> 01:56:59.680
<v Speaker 2>There'll be some resistance to be some</v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance.</v>

2430
01:57:00.630 --> 01:57:03.630
<v Speaker 2>But for most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has that frequency in that resonance</v>

2431
01:57:03.631 --> 01:57:07.590
<v Speaker 2>where it's going to eventually win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what gives me a lot of</v>

2432
01:57:07.591 --> 01:57:08.520
<v Speaker 2>confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>

2433
01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm eddie said he doesn't believe he</v>
<v Speaker 2>does post a lot of pictures of the</v>

2434
01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:17.820
<v Speaker 2>whole video the other day about some</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude who's arguing against the flat</v>

2435
01:57:17.821 --> 01:57:20.040
<v Speaker 2>earth and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or for the flat earth in the weirdest</v>

2436
01:57:20.041 --> 01:57:23.460
<v Speaker 2>way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's what I was talking about before</v>

2437
01:57:23.461 --> 01:57:25.260
<v Speaker 2>that I don't know if I articulated it so</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2438
01:57:25.261 --> 01:57:30.261
<v Speaker 2>is that when you look at our culture and</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at society and then you think back</v>

2439
01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:35.480
<v Speaker 2>to the time of xerxes and all the crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that was going on thousand years</v>

2440
01:57:36.150 --> 01:57:37.350
<v Speaker 2>ago or 2000 years ago.</v>

2441
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:38.760
<v Speaker 2>That's not that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2442
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.811
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

2443
01:57:39.811 --> 01:57:41.700
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it is.</v>

2444
01:57:41.701 --> 01:57:43.420
<v Speaker 2>But like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2445
01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:46.860
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to a dan carlin's</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore history and he was talking</v>

2446
01:57:46.861 --> 01:57:51.861
<v Speaker 2>about world war world war one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he does this amazing.</v>

2447
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a five part series on world</v>

2448
01:57:54.061 --> 01:57:56.550
<v Speaker 2>war one and it sinks in like jesus</v>
<v Speaker 2>christ.</v>

2449
01:57:56.551 --> 01:57:59.730
<v Speaker 2>I was 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's nothing that is fucking,</v>

2450
01:57:59.731 --> 01:58:04.731
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that is so recent and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world is so different now than 100 years</v>

2451
01:58:05.701 --> 01:58:07.680
<v Speaker 2>ago in 100 years before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So different.</v>

2452
01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:08.693
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2453
01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:11.760
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had this piece on the mongols a</v>

2454
01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:12.301
<v Speaker 2>thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2455
01:58:12.301 --> 01:58:13.800
<v Speaker 2>not much different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2456
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:15.990
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2457
01:58:15.991 --> 01:58:19.170
<v Speaker 2>not much different in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between then and now.</v>

2458
01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:20.193
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

2459
01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:22.140
<v Speaker 2>so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So recent.</v>

2460
01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A thousand years is nothing in the scope</v>

2461
01:58:25.201 --> 01:58:26.070
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

2462
01:58:26.110 --> 01:58:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2463
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:30.090
<v Speaker 2>and then you take it back it out to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2464
01:58:30.091 --> 01:58:33.440
<v Speaker 2>some graham hancock's theories that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts out magicians which are seemingly</v>

2465
01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:37.550
<v Speaker 2>make a lot of sense that we'd reached</v>
<v Speaker 2>heightened states before and gotten kind</v>

2466
01:58:37.551 --> 01:58:40.290
<v Speaker 2>of wiped out and restarted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many times did that happen?</v>

2467
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times did we restart?</v>

2468
01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Hit the reset button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent with randall</v>

2469
01:58:45.041 --> 01:58:47.710
<v Speaker 2>carlson's evidence with the two of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2470
01:58:47.711 --> 01:58:50.890
<v Speaker 2>They really sort of both provided the</v>
<v Speaker 2>missing pieces that each other need.</v>

2471
01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:54.040
<v Speaker 2>And if you've never heard those</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>

2472
01:58:54.370 --> 01:58:56.260
<v Speaker 2>there's some of my all time favorite</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>

2473
01:58:56.261 --> 01:58:59.380
<v Speaker 2>the randall carlson ones and the graham</v>
<v Speaker 2>hancock ones and the one time that I had</v>

2474
01:58:59.381 --> 01:59:01.810
<v Speaker 2>the two of them on together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just a fucking epic meeting of</v>

2475
01:59:01.811 --> 01:59:04.780
<v Speaker 2>the minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is most likely experienced</v>

2476
01:59:04.781 --> 01:59:08.920
<v Speaker 2>some cataclysmic disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely due to asteroidal impacts</v>

2477
01:59:09.370 --> 01:59:13.600
<v Speaker 2>and it was most likely the cause of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the ice age.</v>

2478
01:59:13.930 --> 01:59:18.930
<v Speaker 2>And also the collapse of civilization</v>
<v Speaker 2>was available then and the rebirth of</v>

2479
01:59:19.781 --> 01:59:22.510
<v Speaker 2>what we're seeing now as ancient</v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

2480
01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:25.510
<v Speaker 2>So when we look back at things six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7,000 years ago,</v>

2481
01:59:25.511 --> 01:59:26.344
<v Speaker 2>we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2482
01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:29.230
<v Speaker 2>this is the dawn of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so fast.</v>

2483
01:59:29.710 --> 01:59:34.710
<v Speaker 2>This is the dawn of this current era of</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization before we get hit again.</v>

2484
01:59:35.530 --> 01:59:38.950
<v Speaker 2>And that is entirely possible and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crest of this wave.</v>

2485
01:59:38.951 --> 01:59:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they got hit in the 19 twenties</v>

2486
01:59:42.221 --> 01:59:44.260
<v Speaker 2>level of technology or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2487
01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:45.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2488
01:59:45.150 --> 01:59:48.040
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't reach 2016 level,</v>

2489
01:59:48.041 --> 01:59:51.370
<v Speaker 2>which is probably most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've probably advanced the</v>

2490
01:59:51.371 --> 01:59:54.850
<v Speaker 2>farthest that we've gone in the wave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But who knows how far they got,</v>

2491
01:59:54.851 --> 01:59:59.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was 1850 where they're shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking revolvers and fucking whores and</v>

2492
01:59:59.051 --> 02:00:02.500
<v Speaker 2>saloons and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe it was some amalgamation,</v>

2493
02:00:02.501 --> 02:00:04.060
<v Speaker 2>surely was different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be.</v>

2494
02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:07.240
<v Speaker 2>They'd had some things that may be</v>
<v Speaker 2>better and other things that we're still</v>

2495
02:00:07.241 --> 02:00:08.950
<v Speaker 2>kind of silly and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2496
02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:13.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's really interesting to explore</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and give yourself some perspective</v>

2497
02:00:13.570 --> 02:00:14.490
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2498
02:00:14.491 --> 02:00:18.970
<v Speaker 2>they have some sort of a parallel</v>
<v Speaker 2>development in terms of their</v>

2499
02:00:18.971 --> 02:00:21.130
<v Speaker 2>achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a different way.</v>

2500
02:00:21.190 --> 02:00:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Like Egypt to this day we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't build those fucking buildings</v>

2501
02:00:25.121 --> 02:00:26.890
<v Speaker 2>the way they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people could say,</v>

2502
02:00:26.891 --> 02:00:29.320
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we certainly could 2 million,</v>

2503
02:00:29.321 --> 02:00:33.460
<v Speaker 2>500,000 stones that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between two and 80 tons.</v>

2504
02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.760
<v Speaker 2>If you put 10 of those a day in place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would take you 600 plus years to make</v>

2505
02:00:39.251 --> 02:00:42.790
<v Speaker 2>the great pyramid of giza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how fucking crazy that building</v>

2506
02:00:42.791 --> 02:00:43.960
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you say,</v>

2507
02:00:43.961 --> 02:00:46.150
<v Speaker 2>we could build that today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck,</v>

2508
02:00:46.151 --> 02:00:47.850
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Need more faith in the unions.</v>

2509
02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you get it done,</v>

2510
02:00:49.930 --> 02:00:54.930
<v Speaker 2>if you're off by literally like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter of a centimeter with each block,</v>

2511
02:00:54.941 --> 02:00:56.710
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked by the time you get to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top.</v>

2512
02:00:56.950 --> 02:01:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think of that like if you're lopsided</v>

2513
02:01:00.221 --> 02:01:02.800
<v Speaker 2>one way or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time you get to the top you're</v>

2514
02:01:02.801 --> 02:01:05.410
<v Speaker 2>fucking doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This an interesting theories about how</v>

2515
02:01:05.411 --> 02:01:09.940
<v Speaker 2>they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but none of them really sink in.</v>

2516
02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:15.120
<v Speaker 2>All we definitely know is it took an</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible level of sophistication and</v>

2517
02:01:16.690 --> 02:01:20.440
<v Speaker 2>it was done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most recent it could have happened</v>

2518
02:01:20.441 --> 02:01:23.720
<v Speaker 2>was 2,500 bc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just nuts,</v>

2519
02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:27.250
<v Speaker 2>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so smart and it's not just</v>

2520
02:01:27.251 --> 02:01:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go to Peru.</v>

2521
02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I think I've shared that photo of me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one tombow the same one that crazy</v>

2522
02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:35.860
<v Speaker 2>sucralose shared as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go there and you look the way the</v>

2523
02:01:35.861 --> 02:01:39.440
<v Speaker 2>stones fit together and look at how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are carved out and it just make</v>

2524
02:01:39.441 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 2>any sense the size of the stones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what did you do?</v>

2525
02:01:43.521 --> 02:01:45.620
<v Speaker 2>How'd you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2526
02:01:45.621 --> 02:01:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I would give so much to see the</v>
<v Speaker 2>construction of the pyramids.</v>

2527
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:53.150
<v Speaker 2>If there was like one time in history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could take that sort of a time</v>

2528
02:01:53.151 --> 02:01:55.250
<v Speaker 2>capsule and go back and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

2529
02:01:55.251 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 2>it would be ancient Egypt for me for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2530
02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:01.550
<v Speaker 2>I would want to see how those crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuckers walking around with their wacky</v>

2531
02:02:01.551 --> 02:02:06.551
<v Speaker 2>goth makeup on and weird golden robes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and making those hieroglyphs and god</v>

2532
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:14.350
<v Speaker 2>what a fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird blip or weird era in the.</v>

2533
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:18.410
<v Speaker 2>The development of the human mind and of</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

2534
02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:22.670
<v Speaker 2>If you think of what they were capable</v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing and what they did accomplish</v>

2535
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:24.170
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how many.</v>

2536
02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:24.761
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>

2537
02:02:24.761 --> 02:02:27.470
<v Speaker 2>We're sort of going back trying to piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all together.</v>

2538
02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:30.500
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that graham</v>
<v Speaker 2>hancock and even more importantly,</v>

2539
02:02:30.501 --> 02:02:34.220
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West has a new series.</v>

2540
02:02:34.221 --> 02:02:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Apparently a magical Egypt too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it yet,</v>

2541
02:02:37.821 --> 02:02:42.770
<v Speaker 2>but magical Egypt one is just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind blowing when he goes into great</v>

2542
02:02:42.771 --> 02:02:47.240
<v Speaker 2>detail about the different construction</v>
<v Speaker 2>methods from the old kingdom to the new</v>

2543
02:02:47.241 --> 02:02:51.260
<v Speaker 2>kingdom and that he points out that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is most likely evidence of a different</v>

2544
02:02:51.261 --> 02:02:53.810
<v Speaker 2>era of construction and not.</v>

2545
02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Not as not just a different era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but different by 10,000 years maybe,</v>

2546
02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:03.700
<v Speaker 2>and that the hieroglyphs on the inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of some of the pyramids which dictate or</v>

2547
02:03:03.981 --> 02:03:05.020
<v Speaker 2>rather which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2548
02:03:05.130 --> 02:03:10.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go over and depict the various pharaohs</v>

2549
02:03:10.131 --> 02:03:12.080
<v Speaker 2>throughout the different stages of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt.</v>

2550
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Think go back 30,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what modern egyptologists choose to</v>

2551
02:03:18.141 --> 02:03:19.160
<v Speaker 2>do is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2552
02:03:19.161 --> 02:03:20.950
<v Speaker 2>all those guys that was all fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2553
02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:23.810
<v Speaker 2>like back when anything more than 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

2554
02:03:23.811 --> 02:03:24.561
<v Speaker 2>Just fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2555
02:03:24.561 --> 02:03:26.390
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's who bitch says,</v>

2556
02:03:26.391 --> 02:03:28.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2557
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:32.480
<v Speaker 2>how do you know like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy enough that they did this</v>

2558
02:03:32.690 --> 02:03:34.160
<v Speaker 2>4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 years ago.</v>

2559
02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:36.110
<v Speaker 2>That's just crazy enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2560
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:39.920
<v Speaker 2>But it's no more crazy to think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were doing it 30,000 years before</v>

2561
02:03:39.921 --> 02:03:44.780
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this whole thing is this majestic</v>

2562
02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:48.990
<v Speaker 2>sort of monument to human innovation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2563
02:03:48.991 --> 02:03:53.991
<v Speaker 2>in a weird way that's not like what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>do now with cement and steel and glass</v>

2564
02:03:56.421 --> 02:03:59.720
<v Speaker 2>and asphalt roadways and fiber optic</v>
<v Speaker 2>cables.</v>

2565
02:04:00.050 --> 02:04:03.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had some other thing going on and I</v>

2566
02:04:03.351 --> 02:04:05.480
<v Speaker 2>think graham mixed up kind of a cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

2567
02:04:05.481 --> 02:04:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Like they were building something</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically for permanence.</v>

2568
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why,</v>

2569
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:13.010
<v Speaker 2>why did they want it to extend through</v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

2570
02:04:13.011 --> 02:04:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Because all of our shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2571
02:04:14.481 --> 02:04:19.070
<v Speaker 2>another ice age hits and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the ice moves in and starts</v>

2572
02:04:19.071 --> 02:04:23.300
<v Speaker 2>grinding everything and basically grind</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of what we have to dust anyways,</v>

2573
02:04:23.301 --> 02:04:26.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were creating these big stone</v>

2574
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:28.820
<v Speaker 2>blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things that were harder,</v>

2575
02:04:28.821 --> 02:04:31.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would withstand the test of time</v>

2576
02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:32.840
<v Speaker 2>and why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2577
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:35.840
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>speculative part of graham's theory,</v>

2578
02:04:35.841 --> 02:04:37.680
<v Speaker 2>but what seems concrete is that</v>

2579
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:42.990
<v Speaker 1>there was these cultures advanced and</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to do it now why gets into the</v>

2580
02:04:42.991 --> 02:04:47.991
<v Speaker 1>speculation but go back tappy in gunung</v>
<v Speaker 1>padang and Indonesia and then Egypt and</v>

2581
02:04:48.331 --> 02:04:51.690
<v Speaker 1>all of these places really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really super interesting and interesting</v>

2582
02:04:51.691 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>to imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2583
02:04:53.191 --> 02:04:55.620
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the flood did kill off most of that</v>

2584
02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:59.670
<v Speaker 1>civilization and they kinda just settled</v>
<v Speaker 1>in different places and the accounts.</v>

2585
02:04:59.671 --> 02:05:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Just one of the best books I think ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>written was that magicians and just</v>

2586
02:05:03.691 --> 02:05:05.610
<v Speaker 1>going into the mindset of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2587
02:05:05.611 --> 02:05:09.360
<v Speaker 1>he talks about they call these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>watchers and then some of the watchers</v>

2588
02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>when I would get a bad reputation</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they like sleeping with local</v>

2589
02:05:12.511 --> 02:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>girls and so they would be like the bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>watchers than the good watch.</v>

2590
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe they were just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pimps have their time,</v>

2591
02:05:17.821 --> 02:05:18.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2592
02:05:18.490 --> 02:05:20.700
<v Speaker 1>they were eating more proteins that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bigger,</v>

2593
02:05:20.770 --> 02:05:23.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their little smarter as of</v>

2594
02:05:23.041 --> 02:05:24.390
<v Speaker 1>course the girls liked them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2595
02:05:24.391 --> 02:05:26.410
<v Speaker 1>like why you got to hate on the watches.</v>

2596
02:05:27.150 --> 02:05:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they burned the library of</v>

2597
02:05:28.741 --> 02:05:29.850
<v Speaker 1>alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2598
02:05:29.851 --> 02:05:34.290
<v Speaker 1>did they do the human race a massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>disservice we could have learned so much</v>

2599
02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:38.910
<v Speaker 1>could learn so much about why the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient greeks would go to Egypt to</v>

2600
02:05:38.911 --> 02:05:41.490
<v Speaker 1>learn shit and to engage in psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals.</v>

2601
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:46.770
<v Speaker 1>It's funny that the greatest minds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their time would go specifically to</v>

2602
02:05:46.771 --> 02:05:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Egypt to engage in these psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals and to learn from the egyptians.</v>

2603
02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:55.110
<v Speaker 1>The greatest minds of our time today</v>
<v Speaker 1>will mock psychedelics.</v>

2604
02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:56.790
<v Speaker 1>It's kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kinda fascinating.</v>

2605
02:05:56.840 --> 02:06:01.840
<v Speaker 1>There's so few in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream recognized scholars will even</v>

2606
02:06:02.161 --> 02:06:06.720
<v Speaker 1>entertain the possibility that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be some beneficial aspects to</v>

2607
02:06:06.721 --> 02:06:10.230
<v Speaker 1>engaging in ritualistic hallucinogenics</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2608
02:06:10.231 --> 02:06:13.530
<v Speaker 1>all of academia is about defending to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the death,</v>

2609
02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:17.760
<v Speaker 1>your own structure of information and</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics are inherently disruptive</v>

2610
02:06:17.761 --> 02:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>and I think people have that knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know like,</v>

2611
02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:22.830
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may totally rethink all my whole</v>

2612
02:06:22.831 --> 02:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>theories and you have to confront those</v>
<v Speaker 1>demons that you're hiding that that</v>

2613
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:30.870
<v Speaker 1>which is hidden will come to the surface</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's generally the beauty of this</v>

2614
02:06:30.871 --> 02:06:33.480
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're defending something,</v>

2615
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:36.840
<v Speaker 1>you know and you're attached to it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of your identity and because</v>

2616
02:06:36.841 --> 02:06:38.790
<v Speaker 1>it's part of your identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels real.</v>

2617
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the trick that the ego</v>
<v Speaker 1>plays.</v>

2618
02:06:40.590 --> 02:06:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Ego says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my identity is me and I will defend it</v>

2619
02:06:44.161 --> 02:06:46.860
<v Speaker 1>as if it was my flesh and blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2620
02:06:46.861 --> 02:06:48.600
<v Speaker 1>like all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my theories,</v>

2621
02:06:48.601 --> 02:06:52.200
<v Speaker 1>my position in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes real to the ego and so it</v>

2622
02:06:52.201 --> 02:06:56.070
<v Speaker 1>fights as if it's defending your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and bone body,</v>

2623
02:06:56.071 --> 02:06:57.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2624
02:06:57.570 --> 02:06:59.250
<v Speaker 1>it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your identity.</v>

2625
02:06:59.251 --> 02:07:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter shift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fluid.</v>

2626
02:07:01.291 --> 02:07:02.110
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2627
02:07:02.110 --> 02:07:04.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a manufacturing of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2628
02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:06.240
<v Speaker 1>of that ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that attachment,</v>

2629
02:07:06.241 --> 02:07:10.650
<v Speaker 1>and so psychedelics are threat to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've been defending something that</v>

2630
02:07:10.651 --> 02:07:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to get challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could threaten your position of</v>

2631
02:07:14.161 --> 02:07:16.900
<v Speaker 1>authority and power and people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to do it.</v>

2632
02:07:17.070 --> 02:07:21.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no real other reason to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fear widespread.</v>

2633
02:07:21.691 --> 02:07:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a time and a place and it's not</v>

2634
02:07:23.641 --> 02:07:26.970
<v Speaker 1>for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. But you know really it's such a</v>

2635
02:07:26.971 --> 02:07:31.260
<v Speaker 1>powerful tool to access truth and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be afraid of truth.</v>

2636
02:07:31.261 --> 02:07:33.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just a silly positioned to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2637
02:07:33.271 --> 02:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a really interesting documentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a</v>

2638
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:40.450
<v Speaker 2>funny enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a narrated by charlton heston about the</v>

2639
02:07:40.451 --> 02:07:43.420
<v Speaker 2>mystery of the sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on nbc at the time,</v>

2640
02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:48.130
<v Speaker 2>but one of the weirder moments in it</v>
<v Speaker 2>where was when robert schoch,</v>

2641
02:07:48.131 --> 02:07:52.240
<v Speaker 2>the geologist from boston university and</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West presented this</v>

2642
02:07:52.241 --> 02:07:57.241
<v Speaker 2>evidence that the sphinx most likely was</v>
<v Speaker 2>far older than 2,500 bc because of the</v>

2643
02:07:58.361 --> 02:08:02.530
<v Speaker 2>erosion in the sphinx compound that</v>
<v Speaker 2>could only be attributed to water.</v>

2644
02:08:02.770 --> 02:08:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I've heard arguments against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm against it being water and it being</v>

2645
02:08:06.791 --> 02:08:08.160
<v Speaker 2>wind and sand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just,</v>

2646
02:08:08.210 --> 02:08:09.910
<v Speaker 2>they don't fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like they're.</v>

2647
02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:14.410
<v Speaker 2>They're working to try to make that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wind and sand erosion.</v>

2648
02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Whereas it's pretty obvious the fishers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it's cut into the.</v>

2649
02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean it makes total sense that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

2650
02:08:21.070 --> 02:08:25.960
<v Speaker 2>but the only thing that could make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>water would be that it had to be before</v>

2651
02:08:25.961 --> 02:08:30.961
<v Speaker 2>9,000 bc because 9,000 or 7,000 bc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>9,000 years ago,</v>

2652
02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:36.440
<v Speaker 2>one of those somewhere a lot longer than</v>
<v Speaker 2>2,500 bc and the argument when it was</v>

2653
02:08:37.811 --> 02:08:40.540
<v Speaker 2>presented to this archeologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was laughing,</v>

2654
02:08:40.830 --> 02:08:41.411
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2655
02:08:41.411 --> 02:08:44.110
<v Speaker 2>what culture was around 10,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

2656
02:08:44.111 --> 02:08:44.890
<v Speaker 2>they could have done this.</v>

2657
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:48.400
<v Speaker 2>What culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile now we have those cultures.</v>

2658
02:08:48.401 --> 02:08:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Now we have real evidence of go beckley</v>
<v Speaker 2>tappy,</v>

2659
02:08:51.971 --> 02:08:55.810
<v Speaker 2>which is 12,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have real evidence of all sorts of</v>

2660
02:08:55.811 --> 02:08:59.950
<v Speaker 2>weird shit that they didn't know me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then now they're finding evidence of</v>

2661
02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:04.300
<v Speaker 2>human beings in north America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fourteen thousand years ago,</v>

2662
02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:09.540
<v Speaker 2>they're finding a woolly mammoth bones</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a clear indications that they were</v>

2663
02:09:09.581 --> 02:09:13.540
<v Speaker 2>slaughtered by human beings like cuts on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bones and then like,</v>

2664
02:09:13.541 --> 02:09:16.480
<v Speaker 2>oh jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people we don't know.</v>

2665
02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:20.080
<v Speaker 2>We just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what the fuck happened</v>

2666
02:09:20.081 --> 02:09:25.081
<v Speaker 2>between 10,000 years ago when the ice</v>
<v Speaker 2>age ended and today there's just so much</v>

2667
02:09:25.781 --> 02:09:29.110
<v Speaker 2>weirdness and we definitely don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck happened before that.</v>

2668
02:09:29.590 --> 02:09:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Before that there is a lot of unfilled</v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces in that puzzle.</v>

2669
02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2670
02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:38.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's really as the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery of all,</v>

2671
02:09:38.530 --> 02:09:40.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the greatest mystery novel that</v>

2672
02:09:40.871 --> 02:09:45.871
<v Speaker 2>I've ever read was graham hancock's book</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncovering something that was real and</v>

2673
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:49.480
<v Speaker 2>trying to piece together the puzzle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 20 years from fingerprints to</v>

2674
02:09:49.481 --> 02:09:51.640
<v Speaker 2>magicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the new evidence that have come</v>

2675
02:09:52.150 --> 02:09:56.050
<v Speaker 2>really supported his initial evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was pretty good and fingerprints.</v>

2676
02:09:56.050 --> 02:09:58.830
<v Speaker 2>But then by magicians it's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>whelming.</v>

2677
02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:01.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just so openly mocked by a lot of</v>

2678
02:10:01.571 --> 02:10:05.320
<v Speaker 2>people that didn't want him to be right</v>
<v Speaker 2>or didn't want anyone to achieve any</v>

2679
02:10:05.321 --> 02:10:09.280
<v Speaker 2>sort of notoriety by having some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an innovative idea.</v>

2680
02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:10.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

2681
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:12.400
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pushed back on him so hard,</v>

2682
02:10:12.850 --> 02:10:15.430
<v Speaker 2>but the stuff that randall carlson</v>
<v Speaker 2>presents,</v>

2683
02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:20.820
<v Speaker 2>like these various cradle craters that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've uncovered all throughout the</v>

2684
02:10:21.761 --> 02:10:26.761
<v Speaker 2>world that indicate asteroidal impacts</v>
<v Speaker 2>as recently as 5,000 years ago and deep</v>

2685
02:10:27.071 --> 02:10:29.410
<v Speaker 2>into 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,000 the,</v>

2686
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 2>the nuclear glass they found all</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout and europe</v>

2687
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:38.890
<v Speaker 3>that indicates massive meteor impacts</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the neighborhood of 11,</v>

2688
02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:40.340
<v Speaker 3>12,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2689
02:10:40.580 --> 02:10:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all makes sense at all for files or</v>

2690
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:46.460
<v Speaker 3>fills in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2691
02:10:46.461 --> 02:10:47.151
<v Speaker 3>what could have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2692
02:10:47.151 --> 02:10:48.140
<v Speaker 3>well that caused it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2693
02:10:48.141 --> 02:10:51.440
<v Speaker 3>that fucked a lot of shit up for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you look at that nuclear</v>

2694
02:10:51.441 --> 02:10:53.840
<v Speaker 3>glass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the same kind of shit that they</v>

2695
02:10:53.841 --> 02:10:58.310
<v Speaker 3>find when they do nuclear tests and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>find it all throughout europe,</v>

2696
02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:01.580
<v Speaker 3>all throughout asia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which indicates that they literally got</v>

2697
02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:02.840
<v Speaker 3>bombed on by the.</v>

2698
02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the circumstantial evidence.</v>

2699
02:11:05.161 --> 02:11:07.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just mounting and mounting and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2700
02:11:07.921 --> 02:11:09.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hear about these things that are like</v>

2701
02:11:09.721 --> 02:11:13.890
<v Speaker 1>myths and one of the ones that I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not sure if it's true or not,</v>

2702
02:11:13.891 --> 02:11:17.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interesting take on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happened to the cities of sodom</v>

2703
02:11:17.491 --> 02:11:19.310
<v Speaker 1>and gomorrah because in the bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2704
02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:21.280
<v Speaker 1>god rained fire upon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2705
02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>turned all these homosexuals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sodomists and people that sounded like</v>

2706
02:11:25.621 --> 02:11:28.000
<v Speaker 1>they're having a great party and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2707
02:11:28.170 --> 02:11:32.710
<v Speaker 1>what they were suggesting is that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a media that burned up in the,</v>

2708
02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:34.620
<v Speaker 1>in the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it raised,</v>

2709
02:11:34.621 --> 02:11:37.770
<v Speaker 1>it created this flashpoint effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they know can happen and created</v>

2710
02:11:37.771 --> 02:11:42.690
<v Speaker 1>this flashpoint effect where instantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground temperature reached several</v>

2711
02:11:42.690 --> 02:11:45.720
<v Speaker 1>hundred or thousand degrees or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like this instant,</v>

2712
02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:48.510
<v Speaker 1>everybody's just fucking crispy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2713
02:11:49.050 --> 02:11:53.430
<v Speaker 1>And how do you explain that other than</v>
<v Speaker 1>an angry god doesn't make sense,</v>

2714
02:11:53.431 --> 02:11:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea.</v>

2715
02:11:54.391 --> 02:11:57.330
<v Speaker 1>So these stories and myths get passed</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and they're like,</v>

2716
02:11:57.331 --> 02:11:58.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did that happen?</v>

2717
02:11:58.800 --> 02:11:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

2718
02:11:59.791 --> 02:12:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I went to sodom and there's some crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit going on.</v>

2719
02:12:01.930 --> 02:12:05.910
<v Speaker 1>But fucking so after the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make up these stories.</v>

2720
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've of course,</v>

2721
02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:08.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why it happened.</v>

2722
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:10.690
<v Speaker 1>It was just an unlucky party town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was.</v>

2723
02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:13.470
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was,</v>

2724
02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:15.780
<v Speaker 1>that was hard to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>

2725
02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:18.180
<v Speaker 3>So people went to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but today,</v>

2726
02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean this guy in orlando,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously he's fucking crazy,</v>

2727
02:12:22.681 --> 02:12:25.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's killing gay people because he</v>

2728
02:12:25.921 --> 02:12:29.250
<v Speaker 3>thinks the gay people are doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>something against god's will.</v>

2729
02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:34.280
<v Speaker 3>They're doing something bad and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like in his mind like his wrath is</v>

2730
02:12:35.011 --> 02:12:40.011
<v Speaker 3>like the wrath of god on these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>with in 2016 with the information that</v>

2731
02:12:41.761 --> 02:12:44.160
<v Speaker 3>we have with all the evidence that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

2732
02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:48.630
<v Speaker 3>there are still people that are inclined</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go towards some sort of a,</v>

2733
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:53.660
<v Speaker 3>of a biblical or in his case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the koran version of,</v>

2734
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:56.700
<v Speaker 3>of the reality in which we live in like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2735
02:12:57.210 --> 02:13:01.320
<v Speaker 3>This is today when you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>7,000,</v>

2736
02:13:01.321 --> 02:13:04.490
<v Speaker 3>8,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got only knows what it would've been.</v>

2737
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:06.480
<v Speaker 3>It was probably straight out of game of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thrones,</v>

2738
02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:09.690
<v Speaker 3>like the reaction that people had to any</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a natural disaster.</v>

2739
02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:13.260
<v Speaker 3>It had to be the will of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to definitely be something that</v>

2740
02:13:13.770 --> 02:13:18.770
<v Speaker 3>our own actions had caused and so when</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone would stand up,</v>

2741
02:13:19.110 --> 02:13:23.370
<v Speaker 3>like I'm the old dirty dude on game of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thrones was once everybody to repent.</v>

2742
02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:25.850
<v Speaker 3>High sector high sparrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2743
02:13:26.250 --> 02:13:31.250
<v Speaker 3>That when that type of person would</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up and tell the people of this is</v>

2744
02:13:31.591 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 3>because you have</v>

2745
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:35.760
<v Speaker 1>angered god and it will come again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you keep doing that and god forbid,</v>

2746
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:38.520
<v Speaker 1>god forbid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange use of words,</v>

2747
02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:41.310
<v Speaker 1>but another meteor shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean meteor showers.</v>

2748
02:13:41.311 --> 02:13:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes they come like one after</v>
<v Speaker 1>another after another and then he says</v>

2749
02:13:44.971 --> 02:13:46.860
<v Speaker 1>this and then it happens again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right.</v>

2750
02:13:46.861 --> 02:13:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I told you god is angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2751
02:13:49.590 --> 02:13:53.330
<v Speaker 1>and then that gets passed on projections</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is.</v>

2752
02:13:53.380 --> 02:13:57.990
<v Speaker 1>This is a really strange time and what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>found interesting is I think that</v>

2753
02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:03.080
<v Speaker 1>christianity will never go away and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>cath catholicism and these major</v>

2754
02:14:03.331 --> 02:14:05.070
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they will evolve.</v>

2755
02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at the trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2756
02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:10.560
<v Speaker 1>back in the middle ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing crazy thing torturing</v>

2757
02:14:10.561 --> 02:14:12.360
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a dungeon in the inquisition.</v>

2758
02:14:12.361 --> 02:14:15.920
<v Speaker 1>All of this crazy shit that was in Italy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were going,</v>

2759
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:18.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Italy this summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking horrifying.</v>

2760
02:14:18.631 --> 02:14:20.280
<v Speaker 1>It was in one of the mountain towns.</v>

2761
02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's several of them there and</v>

2762
02:14:24.361 --> 02:14:26.370
<v Speaker 1>all the different torture devices that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have.</v>

2763
02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:28.830
<v Speaker 1>So many of which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>involve the genitals.</v>

2764
02:14:29.010 --> 02:14:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I would say at least 40 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

2765
02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:34.140
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways towards falls and dick</v>

2766
02:14:34.141 --> 02:14:37.370
<v Speaker 1>and pussy and tits and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2767
02:14:37.371 --> 02:14:42.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just these ways that they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>channel their own perversions into this</v>

2768
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>unarguable point about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2769
02:14:45.450 --> 02:14:47.310
<v Speaker 1>this is god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what god wants,</v>

2770
02:14:47.311 --> 02:14:52.311
<v Speaker 1>but they're really just pure status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Accessing that sadistic demonic energy</v>

2771
02:14:52.650 --> 02:14:54.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing it under god's name.</v>

2772
02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happens when you create</v>

2773
02:14:56.701 --> 02:15:00.330
<v Speaker 1>these systems that only a select few can</v>
<v Speaker 1>access the knowledge.</v>

2774
02:15:00.331 --> 02:15:01.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody else can talk to god,</v>

2775
02:15:01.621 --> 02:15:04.370
<v Speaker 1>these few people that did it and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking and we're the descendants of</v>

2776
02:15:04.371 --> 02:15:05.970
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We guard the knowledge.</v>

2777
02:15:05.971 --> 02:15:06.804
<v Speaker 1>You can't reach it.</v>

2778
02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:09.750
<v Speaker 1>So it creates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of decentralizing in it and</v>

2779
02:15:09.751 --> 02:15:12.870
<v Speaker 1>opening up truth to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a select few that have it.</v>

2780
02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Only a few people know god's will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everybody can find it.</v>

2781
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:18.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's creates these massive power</v>
<v Speaker 1>and balances.</v>

2782
02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Whereas any good religion is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely decentralized and say,</v>

2783
02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:24.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not listened to me.</v>

2784
02:15:24.601 --> 02:15:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what god says is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how you go talk to god yourself.</v>

2785
02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's how you reliably go find your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>deepest truth.</v>

2786
02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:34.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't need me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with any good teacher,</v>

2787
02:15:34.351 --> 02:15:36.060
<v Speaker 1>any good healer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2788
02:15:36.061 --> 02:15:38.340
<v Speaker 1>like the very base level is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2789
02:15:38.341 --> 02:15:40.980
<v Speaker 1>is a teacher healer who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who fixes,</v>

2790
02:15:40.981 --> 02:15:42.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come to him and he fixes,</v>

2791
02:15:42.811 --> 02:15:45.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the next level is someone who</v>

2792
02:15:45.031 --> 02:15:47.340
<v Speaker 1>teaches you how to fix yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the,</v>

2793
02:15:47.490 --> 02:15:49.530
<v Speaker 1>that's a master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but give a man a fish.</v>

2794
02:15:49.590 --> 02:15:50.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2795
02:15:50.251 --> 02:15:51.084
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2796
02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And then the final level is just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really the great mystics.</v>

2797
02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:58.170
<v Speaker 1>And even if you go back to jesus and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to the really great mystics,</v>

2798
02:15:58.171 --> 02:16:00.270
<v Speaker 1>their message truly is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2799
02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:03.600
<v Speaker 1>you don't need us to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're already whole like just recognize</v>

2800
02:16:03.601 --> 02:16:05.520
<v Speaker 1>that you're already whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're already perfect,</v>

2801
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:08.370
<v Speaker 1>you know you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are the son of man.</v>

2802
02:16:08.371 --> 02:16:11.040
<v Speaker 1>You are god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was really the core message</v>

2803
02:16:11.310 --> 02:16:15.540
<v Speaker 1>that's got twisted in a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways and manipulated for</v>

2804
02:16:15.541 --> 02:16:18.210
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those was one of the other more</v>

2805
02:16:18.211 --> 02:16:23.211
<v Speaker 1>interesting podcasts from dan carlin was</v>
<v Speaker 1>on martin luther and lutheranism</v>

2806
02:16:24.180 --> 02:16:25.260
<v Speaker 1>lutheran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lutheran,</v>

2807
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:27.990
<v Speaker 1>lutheran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this discipline and that he was the</v>

2808
02:16:27.991 --> 02:16:30.580
<v Speaker 1>first one to translate</v>

2809
02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:36.000
<v Speaker 3>the bible from latin into german and</v>
<v Speaker 3>translate it in the phonetic way that</v>

2810
02:16:36.821 --> 02:16:40.090
<v Speaker 3>the people could actually understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the word of god was and not have to</v>

2811
02:16:40.091 --> 02:16:44.320
<v Speaker 3>be a priest because they were relying</v>
<v Speaker 3>upon these priests and not only that,</v>

2812
02:16:44.321 --> 02:16:49.321
<v Speaker 3>he was also the first one to say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>your interpretation of what god meant is</v>

2813
02:16:50.381 --> 02:16:54.700
<v Speaker 3>essentially up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was just a blast for me to these</v>

2814
02:16:54.701 --> 02:16:57.160
<v Speaker 3>people that had massive amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

2815
02:16:57.490 --> 02:17:00.880
<v Speaker 3>I think if you're looking for that one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called the prophets of doom</v>

2816
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:04.610
<v Speaker 3>or the prophet of doom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the name of the podcast</v>

2817
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:10.030
<v Speaker 3>from carlin on on that insane time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's amazing.</v>

2818
02:17:11.050 --> 02:17:12.690
<v Speaker 3>Amazing to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2819
02:17:12.850 --> 02:17:14.860
<v Speaker 3>in that sense you're talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it,</v>

2820
02:17:14.861 --> 02:17:19.450
<v Speaker 3>the $1,400 or something like that there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not that long ago at all.</v>

2821
02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:23.050
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing and people couldn't read</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bible.</v>

2822
02:17:23.250 --> 02:17:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were relying upon these.</v>

2823
02:17:26.510 --> 02:17:28.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean they weren't even pedophiles back</v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

2824
02:17:28.391 --> 02:17:30.460
<v Speaker 3>They were allowed to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really interesting.</v>

2825
02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.890
<v Speaker 3>Like that pedophile thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

2826
02:17:33.180 --> 02:17:36.670
<v Speaker 3>That only happened once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't let the priest fuck and</v>

2827
02:17:36.671 --> 02:17:39.040
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't let the priest because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>priests were fucking too many people</v>

2828
02:17:39.041 --> 02:17:42.610
<v Speaker 3>because the priests were the rock stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The priests were the celebrities totally</v>

2829
02:17:43.630 --> 02:17:45.210
<v Speaker 1>to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're terrible.</v>

2830
02:17:45.211 --> 02:17:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Always create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get you pussy.</v>

2831
02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:49.210
<v Speaker 3>They were getting mad pussy so someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>came along and said,</v>

2832
02:17:49.211 --> 02:17:50.890
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fuckers no sex.</v>

2833
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:54.700
<v Speaker 3>They just made that up along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2834
02:17:54.730 --> 02:17:58.570
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even like it came from god and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it came a lot with.</v>

2835
02:17:58.571 --> 02:18:00.610
<v Speaker 3>They had already established one way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

2836
02:18:00.611 --> 02:18:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Like even the pope pope's used to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>wives.</v>

2837
02:18:03.310 --> 02:18:08.310
<v Speaker 3>They had armies like pope's weren't like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird fiba old guy who sits on a</v>

2838
02:18:08.771 --> 02:18:11.560
<v Speaker 3>golden throne and it has little gay</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do.</v>

2839
02:18:11.561 --> 02:18:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Cirque du solei dances in front of him</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that last asshole,</v>

2840
02:18:15.370 --> 02:18:20.370
<v Speaker 3>but not the most recent pope is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of humble pope is humble hope the</v>

2841
02:18:20.770 --> 02:18:21.700
<v Speaker 3>cool pope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2842
02:18:21.701 --> 02:18:22.390
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2843
02:18:22.390 --> 02:18:25.510
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's evolved and changed throughout the</v>

2844
02:18:25.510 --> 02:18:26.343
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just,</v>

2845
02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:29.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>600 years ago or whatever it was you,</v>

2846
02:18:29.531 --> 02:18:32.410
<v Speaker 3>or 500 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't even fucking read that</v>

2847
02:18:32.411 --> 02:18:32.870
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2848
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2849
02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the control of power,</v>

2850
02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:39.760
<v Speaker 1>the control of information rather than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shamonic way,</v>

2851
02:18:39.761 --> 02:18:43.850
<v Speaker 1>which is always show you not tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to a two,</v>

2852
02:18:43.930 --> 02:18:47.740
<v Speaker 1>then that's another great way if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to find out who you should go</v>

2853
02:18:47.741 --> 02:18:49.480
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if someone's busy,</v>

2854
02:18:49.481 --> 02:18:52.810
<v Speaker 1>blabbing their mouth and trying to tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all of the things that you'll see</v>

2855
02:18:52.811 --> 02:18:54.850
<v Speaker 1>from an iowaska journey or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

2856
02:18:55.180 --> 02:18:57.310
<v Speaker 1>tell you all the lessons and give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you that way.</v>

2857
02:18:57.440 --> 02:18:59.040
<v Speaker 1>If I can go the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2858
02:18:59.050 --> 02:19:00.880
<v Speaker 1>like the true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the true path is,</v>

2859
02:19:01.210 --> 02:19:02.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you go.</v>

2860
02:19:02.411 --> 02:19:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to create the environment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go find truth for</v>

2861
02:19:04.961 --> 02:19:06.910
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find whatever the truth</v>

2862
02:19:06.911 --> 02:19:10.270
<v Speaker 1>that is and they have faith that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrive at the truth that's going to be</v>

2863
02:19:10.271 --> 02:19:12.880
<v Speaker 1>most beneficial for you and most often</v>
<v Speaker 1>than not,</v>

2864
02:19:12.881 --> 02:19:16.750
<v Speaker 1>it comes back congruence with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and that's that's the true path.</v>

2865
02:19:16.751 --> 02:19:18.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the path that any religion should</v>
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

2866
02:19:18.521 --> 02:19:21.850
<v Speaker 1>and I think one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddhism is so popular because it's</v>

2867
02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:25.920
<v Speaker 1>similar in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It teaches a practice or zen teaches a</v>

2868
02:19:25.930 --> 02:19:30.260
<v Speaker 1>practice that allows single person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>access that higher state of</v>

2869
02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:32.390
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody can reach nirvana.</v>

2870
02:19:32.391 --> 02:19:34.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preselected,</v>

2871
02:19:34.821 --> 02:19:37.670
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how you do it and go for it.</v>

2872
02:19:37.671 --> 02:19:40.730
<v Speaker 1>And I think any good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any good spirituality system is going to</v>

2873
02:19:40.731 --> 02:19:41.564
<v Speaker 1>have that in common.</v>

2874
02:19:41.630 --> 02:19:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it interesting though that that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of the exception to the rule to</v>

2875
02:19:45.021 --> 02:19:49.370
<v Speaker 3>find a system or finding an individual</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a martin luther or like someone who</v>

2876
02:19:49.371 --> 02:19:50.540
<v Speaker 3>steps up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2877
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:53.990
<v Speaker 3>the whole world should benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the people should learn this.</v>

2878
02:19:53.991 --> 02:19:56.390
<v Speaker 3>Everyone should get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be about centralized power,</v>

2879
02:19:56.410 --> 02:19:57.920
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be about controlling the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2880
02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:02.690
<v Speaker 3>like that's a rare thing and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought against like vehemently like it's</v>

2881
02:20:02.810 --> 02:20:03.160
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2882
02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:07.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they passionately resist this and in</v>

2883
02:20:07.521 --> 02:20:09.710
<v Speaker 3>many ways it's like what we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about before,</v>

2884
02:20:09.711 --> 02:20:14.711
<v Speaker 3>like it kinda takes almost negativity</v>
<v Speaker 3>and evil to bring out the best in people</v>

2885
02:20:16.491 --> 02:20:18.530
<v Speaker 3>in a response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it almost,</v>

2886
02:20:18.650 --> 02:20:23.650
<v Speaker 3>it sort of takes this horrible control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dictatorship of religion and</v>

2887
02:20:25.551 --> 02:20:30.551
<v Speaker 3>ideology to resist in such a powerful</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that you change everything around</v>

2888
02:20:32.301 --> 02:20:34.090
<v Speaker 3>you because of these people were just</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

2889
02:20:34.170 --> 02:20:34.641
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2890
02:20:34.641 --> 02:20:35.600
<v Speaker 3>this is the word of god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2891
02:20:35.610 --> 02:20:36.230
<v Speaker 3>and go with it.</v>

2892
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Don't go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't give a fuck.</v>

2893
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Everything's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2894
02:20:39.350 --> 02:20:40.280
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to give me any of your</v>

2895
02:20:40.281 --> 02:20:42.050
<v Speaker 3>money and I'm not trying to fuck her at</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>

2896
02:20:42.051 --> 02:20:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm just hanging out over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would probably be no resistance to that</v>

2897
02:20:46.191 --> 02:20:50.540
<v Speaker 3>religion and there would be no sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>rebound effect where people are trying</v>

2898
02:20:50.541 --> 02:20:54.170
<v Speaker 3>to find their own truth and</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding that the negative</v>

2899
02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:59.920
<v Speaker 3>attachments that they have to all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious cults or sex or whatever you</v>

2900
02:21:01.791 --> 02:21:05.060
<v Speaker 3>want to call them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the negative attachments that we have</v>

2901
02:21:05.061 --> 02:21:08.690
<v Speaker 3>them are completely unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't have to be there.</v>

2902
02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:12.350
<v Speaker 3>That through what everyone's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>find through religion.</v>

2903
02:21:12.351 --> 02:21:16.280
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to find the word of god</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find ultimate love and wisdom</v>

2904
02:21:16.281 --> 02:21:20.510
<v Speaker 3>and power and this one individual who</v>
<v Speaker 3>has created literally the entire</v>

2905
02:21:20.511 --> 02:21:22.940
<v Speaker 3>universe or this force has created</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally.</v>

2906
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:26.510
<v Speaker 3>So why is it this guy's trying to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife and why is that?</v>

2907
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:29.600
<v Speaker 3>I have to give everybody my goal that</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come I can't read the bible myself?</v>

2908
02:21:29.601 --> 02:21:33.020
<v Speaker 3>How do I have to trust this guy was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to fuck my wife and steal my</v>

2909
02:21:33.021 --> 02:21:35.240
<v Speaker 3>goats?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to trust that asshole.</v>

2910
02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2911
02:21:36.980 --> 02:21:40.070
<v Speaker 3>and so then as martin luther guy comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>along who actually can read it and</v>

2912
02:21:40.071 --> 02:21:44.570
<v Speaker 3>understand it and translates it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a massive blow back and</v>

2913
02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:48.260
<v Speaker 3>obviously just based in Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dan carlin's podcasts,</v>

2914
02:21:48.261 --> 02:21:53.261
<v Speaker 3>but apparently his influential position</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the community was the only thing that</v>

2915
02:21:53.421 --> 02:21:57.760
<v Speaker 3>kept him alive like anybody else doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the exact same thing he was doing would</v>

2916
02:21:57.761 --> 02:22:02.150
<v Speaker 3>have been killed by the church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The church would have killed people for</v>

2917
02:22:02.151 --> 02:22:05.660
<v Speaker 3>distributing the word of god in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that other people could understand and</v>

2918
02:22:05.661 --> 02:22:08.930
<v Speaker 3>it hadn't been done before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people had questioned the church</v>

2919
02:22:08.931 --> 02:22:11.360
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just fucking strung them up and cut</v>

2920
02:22:11.361 --> 02:22:14.570
<v Speaker 3>the dick off and shoved it in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth and lit them on fire and launched</v>

2921
02:22:14.571 --> 02:22:17.360
<v Speaker 3>them in a catapult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't give a fuck back then.</v>

2922
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:18.703
<v Speaker 3>Barbaric.</v>

2923
02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's in the.</v>

2924
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:21.470
<v Speaker 1>How does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does that,</v>

2925
02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:24.560
<v Speaker 1>how does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does a system like that take hold</v>

2926
02:22:24.561 --> 02:22:26.900
<v Speaker 1>and take fact and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2927
02:22:26.930 --> 02:22:30.750
<v Speaker 1>you've talked about the kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>toxoplasma that alters behavior,</v>

2928
02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:36.140
<v Speaker 1>this disease that will alter human</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior or altered mice behavior and we</v>

2929
02:22:36.181 --> 02:22:38.790
<v Speaker 1>have that disease too and it's called</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear and it's,</v>

2930
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:42.630
<v Speaker 1>it is the primary disease that once fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a hold of us,</v>

2931
02:22:42.631 --> 02:22:45.390
<v Speaker 1>once we fear that if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we do something wrong,</v>

2932
02:22:45.391 --> 02:22:48.030
<v Speaker 1>will be punished in the most obscene</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

2933
02:22:48.031 --> 02:22:49.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at like a bosch painting from,</v>

2934
02:22:50.210 --> 02:22:54.000
<v Speaker 1>from Italy during the time of all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these inventions of how you were going</v>

2935
02:22:54.001 --> 02:22:58.350
<v Speaker 1>to be tortured if you went against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>will of god and you'll be punished not</v>

2936
02:22:58.351 --> 02:23:02.370
<v Speaker 1>only for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eternally eternal torture and</v>

2937
02:23:02.371 --> 02:23:05.040
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's some kind of just punishment</v>

2938
02:23:05.041 --> 02:23:05.874
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2939
02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:07.230
<v Speaker 1>having lustful thoughts or whatever.</v>

2940
02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:10.410
<v Speaker 1>But that's what they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they inject people with this fear of</v>

2941
02:23:10.411 --> 02:23:13.880
<v Speaker 1>virus and then the fear virus robs them</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their own freewill,</v>

2942
02:23:13.890 --> 02:23:18.150
<v Speaker 1>robs them of their ability to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like this form of virus that</v>

2943
02:23:18.151 --> 02:23:20.850
<v Speaker 1>takes a hold of somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you allow these atrocities to</v>

2944
02:23:20.851 --> 02:23:24.360
<v Speaker 1>take hold because fear is within you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in other cases,</v>

2945
02:23:24.361 --> 02:23:28.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the greed virus or some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that takes hold,</v>

2946
02:23:28.111 --> 02:23:32.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's really like this thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really limits your ability to use</v>

2947
02:23:32.071 --> 02:23:33.920
<v Speaker 1>rational thought into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2948
02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:37.590
<v Speaker 1>to harness your own power of choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But fear is that original,</v>

2949
02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:40.030
<v Speaker 1>original virus that the religions played</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2950
02:23:40.031 --> 02:23:41.240
<v Speaker 1>so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2951
02:23:41.250 --> 02:23:43.320
<v Speaker 1>fear and guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because it's such a</v>

2952
02:23:43.321 --> 02:23:47.730
<v Speaker 1>distortion of a really important aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being alive.</v>

2953
02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have fear of</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

2954
02:23:50.191 --> 02:23:54.000
<v Speaker 1>You have to have fear of animals and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to fear of the ocean.</v>

2955
02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:57.330
<v Speaker 1>You have to have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a healthy respect for</v>

2956
02:23:57.331 --> 02:24:02.331
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of stepping off of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliff or the consequences of walking</v>

2957
02:24:02.371 --> 02:24:05.790
<v Speaker 1>into a bear den with a mom and her cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things are real.</v>

2958
02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:08.370
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to have fear.</v>

2959
02:24:08.730 --> 02:24:12.210
<v Speaker 1>But there's some fear that people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists for no reason.</v>

2960
02:24:12.450 --> 02:24:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2961
02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:15.510
<v Speaker 1>the idea that he's a good god fearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2962
02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:18.690
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god fearing god is fucking love.</v>

2963
02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:23.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like the most perfect form of love</v>
<v Speaker 1>and truth,</v>

2964
02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:26.160
<v Speaker 1>not when the skies on fire because</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are blood fucking</v>

2965
02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:29.130
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

2966
02:24:29.131 --> 02:24:31.080
<v Speaker 1>you see where this other perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from,</v>

2967
02:24:31.081 --> 02:24:33.630
<v Speaker 1>but you know to fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

2968
02:24:33.660 --> 02:24:37.290
<v Speaker 1>It's this trans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It totally fucks the mind like it sets</v>

2969
02:24:37.291 --> 02:24:39.810
<v Speaker 1>the mind upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once the minds upside down,</v>

2970
02:24:39.820 --> 02:24:41.490
<v Speaker 1>it looks at everything all funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2971
02:24:41.550 --> 02:24:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Nothing makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've removed a cornerstone of logic.</v>

2972
02:24:44.610 --> 02:24:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Now you need to fear god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

2973
02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:49.710
<v Speaker 1>fear god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then everything else is just</v>

2974
02:24:49.711 --> 02:24:53.310
<v Speaker 1>twisted up and fucked up and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even use your rational mind.</v>

2975
02:24:53.311 --> 02:24:55.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't find the way out because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

2976
02:24:55.770 --> 02:24:58.440
<v Speaker 1>The whole paradigm has been turned on</v>
<v Speaker 1>its head and twisted.</v>

2977
02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it an interesting in that respect</v>

2978
02:25:00.391 --> 02:25:03.360
<v Speaker 1>then that it seems that the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge we gathered,</v>

2979
02:25:03.361 --> 02:25:08.040
<v Speaker 1>more information we acquire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less we have to be fearful of,</v>

2980
02:25:08.490 --> 02:25:09.990
<v Speaker 1>the more we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2981
02:25:09.991 --> 02:25:13.420
<v Speaker 1>that's not an angry god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a meteor a,</v>

2982
02:25:13.590 --> 02:25:16.260
<v Speaker 1>and then one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well we'll figure out how to deflect</v>

2983
02:25:16.261 --> 02:25:18.720
<v Speaker 1>those meteors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to worry about the ice age</v>

2984
02:25:18.721 --> 02:25:22.740
<v Speaker 1>ending or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or rather a dinosaur killing chunk of</v>

2985
02:25:22.741 --> 02:25:24.130
<v Speaker 1>iron and stone from</v>

2986
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:27.850
<v Speaker 2>the sky slamming into the ocean and</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing all of us because we see those</v>

2987
02:25:27.851 --> 02:25:30.640
<v Speaker 2>fuckers coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we just shoot a net at it and push</v>

2988
02:25:30.641 --> 02:25:35.641
<v Speaker 2>it off into jupiter or some shit mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all information that will slowly</v>

2989
02:25:35.891 --> 02:25:40.891
<v Speaker 2>but surely eliminate the need for fear</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess that's probably going to</v>

2990
02:25:42.071 --> 02:25:47.071
<v Speaker 2>extend to the consequences of injury and</v>
<v Speaker 2>death as well.</v>

2991
02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean at one point in time they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

2992
02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:54.460
<v Speaker 2>things keep going the way they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee if they get to you within a</v>

2993
02:25:54.461 --> 02:25:56.260
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that probably going to be able to</v>

2994
02:25:56.261 --> 02:25:57.130
<v Speaker 2>reanimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animate you.</v>

2995
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2996
02:25:59.051 --> 02:26:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean it will certainly remove</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences eventually,</v>

2997
02:26:01.901 --> 02:26:05.350
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much we can do right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We surrender our power to use those</v>

2998
02:26:05.351 --> 02:26:07.960
<v Speaker 2>fears all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many times have you seen somebody</v>

2999
02:26:07.961 --> 02:26:09.040
<v Speaker 2>shriek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3000
02:26:09.041 --> 02:26:11.380
<v Speaker 2>because the fucking cockroach was around</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the room.</v>

3001
02:26:11.650 --> 02:26:13.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a cockroach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're clean,</v>

3002
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:15.850
<v Speaker 2>they're cleaning up the garbage that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the floor.</v>

3003
02:26:15.970 --> 02:26:20.320
<v Speaker 2>They've never harmed anyone ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that little thing is going to cause</v>

3004
02:26:20.321 --> 02:26:24.280
<v Speaker 2>you to scream and your heart to race and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can actually choose,</v>

3005
02:26:24.281 --> 02:26:26.440
<v Speaker 2>actively choose through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3006
02:26:26.650 --> 02:26:30.580
<v Speaker 2>exposure to that and working through</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to get over that fear like we have</v>

3007
02:26:30.581 --> 02:26:35.050
<v Speaker 2>these choices and I think you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse your fear into actual danger so</v>

3008
02:26:35.051 --> 02:26:38.710
<v Speaker 2>that fear and danger on the same level</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can go too far where you can</v>

3009
02:26:38.711 --> 02:26:41.710
<v Speaker 2>remove too much fear so you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually afraid of danger.</v>

3010
02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:44.500
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do like grizzly man clearly did</v>

3011
02:26:44.501 --> 02:26:45.310
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3012
02:26:45.310 --> 02:26:48.190
<v Speaker 2>when he was hanging camping with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzlies and should've had more fear</v>

3013
02:26:48.191 --> 02:26:49.750
<v Speaker 2>for those fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't.</v>

3014
02:26:49.751 --> 02:26:51.190
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting werner herzog.</v>

3015
02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3016
02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:54.370
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be really cool.</v>

3017
02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Is going to come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

3018
02:26:55.751 --> 02:26:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck what he wants to</v>

3019
02:26:57.941 --> 02:26:59.500
<v Speaker 2>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about grizzly man</v>

3020
02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:05.180
<v Speaker 2>cave of forgotten dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That too.</v>

3021
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk about that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>

3022
02:27:08.130 --> 02:27:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to them about that tom</v>
<v Speaker 2>cruise movie where he played a bad guy</v>

3023
02:27:10.691 --> 02:27:13.900
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time of jack reacher,</v>

3024
02:27:14.770 --> 02:27:17.170
<v Speaker 2>but grizzly man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think we're dealing with,</v>

3025
02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.960
<v Speaker 2>if you have never seen that documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of my favorite unintentional</v>

3026
02:27:19.961 --> 02:27:22.090
<v Speaker 2>comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to see it.</v>

3027
02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:24.880
<v Speaker 2>It's about a guy who decided he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to save the bears.</v>

3028
02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:28.600
<v Speaker 2>The bears did not need fucking saving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want saving.</v>

3029
02:27:28.660 --> 02:27:31.450
<v Speaker 2>They didn't need saving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't interested in his saving</v>

3030
02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:34.600
<v Speaker 2>and eventually the atum eventually they</v>
<v Speaker 2>determined he was.</v>

3031
02:27:35.050 --> 02:27:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've figured out the assessment.</v>

3032
02:27:37.630 --> 02:27:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris part bears are so amazing,</v>

3033
02:27:40.061 --> 02:27:43.990
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bringing it back to our camp as we bring</v>

3034
02:27:43.991 --> 02:27:44.824
<v Speaker 2>this bitch home.</v>

3035
02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:46.690
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were up there,</v>

3036
02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:49.150
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like,</v>

3037
02:27:49.151 --> 02:27:50.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since you're,</v>

3038
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:54.850
<v Speaker 2>since you've been practicing archery for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years now and you've been</v>

3039
02:27:54.851 --> 02:27:57.250
<v Speaker 2>really getting into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have been the perfect first</v>

3040
02:27:57.251 --> 02:28:00.070
<v Speaker 2>archery hunt because it's a controlled</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

3041
02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:01.233
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3042
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:04.990
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really high likelihood of success.</v>

3043
02:28:04.991 --> 02:28:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Even though we both struck out it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>high likelihood of success.</v>

3044
02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:09.700
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3045
02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:13.270
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a crazy intimate connection that</v>

3046
02:28:13.271 --> 02:28:18.271
<v Speaker 2>you have with an animal when you're up</v>
<v Speaker 2>close with them within 20 plus yards and</v>

3047
02:28:18.821 --> 02:28:22.580
<v Speaker 2>you shoot it with a bow and arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is like some really</v>

3048
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:26.150
<v Speaker 3>old dna that you tap into that some like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

3049
02:28:26.890 --> 02:28:31.160
<v Speaker 3>there's like a switch that goes off</v>
<v Speaker 3>where your tissue is like,</v>

3050
02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:33.620
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've seen this before,</v>

3051
02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:36.770
<v Speaker 3>this we did this 500 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

3052
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:41.790
<v Speaker 3>there's genetics I think that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>attached to archery and some sort of</v>

3053
02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:43.670
<v Speaker 3>strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently I have,</v>

3054
02:28:43.970 --> 02:28:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a traditional archer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done that,</v>

3055
02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:50.840
<v Speaker 3>but they say it's even stronger in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shooting,</v>

3056
02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:55.900
<v Speaker 3>even just shooting a regular bows like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>recurve bow has an even more sort of a</v>

3057
02:28:57.411 --> 02:29:02.411
<v Speaker 3>visceral connection to the human body</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the human mind and you know,</v>

3058
02:29:04.270 --> 02:29:07.730
<v Speaker 3>with ted nugent calls the spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 3>flight of the out of the mystical flight</v>

3059
02:29:07.731 --> 02:29:12.560
<v Speaker 3>of the arrow that there's some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird ancient calling.</v>

3060
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:14.390
<v Speaker 3>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do that,</v>

3061
02:29:14.391 --> 02:29:17.090
<v Speaker 3>when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if a catapult to do that launch</v>

3062
02:29:17.130 --> 02:29:18.770
<v Speaker 3>catapult on a motherfucker like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

3063
02:29:18.771 --> 02:29:22.100
<v Speaker 3>this feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people progress that all the way</v>

3064
02:29:22.101 --> 02:29:22.970
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3065
02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think the catapult wasn't used for</v>

3066
02:29:24.651 --> 02:29:25.910
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for use,</v>

3067
02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:30.860
<v Speaker 3>for war cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus christ be a herd of elk.</v>

3068
02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:37.190
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you go look for scraps.</v>

3069
02:29:38.130 --> 02:29:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Take you shoot a recurve all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shoot a recurve all the time.</v>

3070
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super way less accurate so I wouldn't go</v>

3071
02:29:44.191 --> 02:29:47.490
<v Speaker 1>hunting with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really accurate with them.</v>

3072
02:29:47.491 --> 02:29:48.241
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3073
02:29:48.241 --> 02:29:48.661
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3074
02:29:48.661 --> 02:29:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess for me it's way less accurate.</v>

3075
02:29:50.731 --> 02:29:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some people are really practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get really good at it,</v>

3076
02:29:53.581 --> 02:29:57.840
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many weird things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>judging distance,</v>

3077
02:29:58.200 --> 02:30:00.980
<v Speaker 1>super weird site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well lisa,</v>

3078
02:30:01.090 --> 02:30:02.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot instinctive so there's no site so</v>

3079
02:30:02.910 --> 02:30:04.880
<v Speaker 1>you're just feeling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you read a book,</v>

3080
02:30:05.050 --> 02:30:06.840
<v Speaker 1>zen and the art of archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eugene arrows book,</v>

3081
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:11.760
<v Speaker 1>great book and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It applies to regular compound bow,</v>

3082
02:30:12.060 --> 02:30:14.400
<v Speaker 1>but you really feel it when you have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>recurve and.</v>

3083
02:30:14.401 --> 02:30:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just a piece of wood and sinewy</v>

3084
02:30:17.150 --> 02:30:20.800
<v Speaker 1>twisted and you're knocking the air and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going off instinct cause</v>

3085
02:30:20.801 --> 02:30:22.620
<v Speaker 1>there's so much more variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's less,</v>

3086
02:30:22.970 --> 02:30:24.080
<v Speaker 1>it's less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3087
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:28.080
<v Speaker 1>mechanic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like you're just more of like a</v>

3088
02:30:28.081 --> 02:30:31.160
<v Speaker 1>flow type of thing and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to fun to do that.</v>

3089
02:30:31.290 --> 02:30:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I always imagined that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3090
02:30:33.141 --> 02:30:33.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

3091
02:30:33.300 --> 02:30:38.300
<v Speaker 3>a lot like playing pool in that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>develop a feel for where it's gonna go.</v>

3092
02:30:39.850 --> 02:30:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have to do it.</v>

3093
02:30:41.311 --> 02:30:45.510
<v Speaker 3>So they say that it's one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>important things about traditional</v>

3094
02:30:45.511 --> 02:30:47.640
<v Speaker 3>archery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instinctive shooting is that you have to</v>

3095
02:30:47.641 --> 02:30:51.900
<v Speaker 3>shoot hours every day to be really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really accurate,</v>

3096
02:30:52.350 --> 02:30:54.420
<v Speaker 3>but like if you watch like olympic</v>
<v Speaker 3>recurve shooters,</v>

3097
02:30:54.690 --> 02:30:56.400
<v Speaker 3>they have a lot of weird shit going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3098
02:30:56.401 --> 02:31:01.401
<v Speaker 3>They have like a clicker so they'll pull</v>
<v Speaker 3>the arrow back a certain distance and it</v>

3099
02:31:01.741 --> 02:31:06.741
<v Speaker 3>click will go off because you could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the go all the way to when I'm making a</v>

3100
02:31:07.261 --> 02:31:11.700
<v Speaker 3>motion like you could pull it back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your chin or you could pull it past your</v>

3101
02:31:11.701 --> 02:31:14.790
<v Speaker 3>chin and it gets not like a compound bow</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it hits a wall.</v>

3102
02:31:15.090 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 3>Compound bows extremely accurate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys like john who was a</v>

3103
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:25.010
<v Speaker 2>guy who have set up my bow and he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote the curriculum for the world</v>

3104
02:31:25.291 --> 02:31:27.180
<v Speaker 2>archery federation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

3105
02:31:27.181 --> 02:31:32.100
<v Speaker 2>and travels all over the world to teach</v>
<v Speaker 2>people proper technique and teach people</v>

3106
02:31:32.101 --> 02:31:35.100
<v Speaker 2>and coach international teams and</v>
<v Speaker 2>archery.</v>

3107
02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:40.640
<v Speaker 2>He was saying that if you get like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rifle shooter and they shoot like</v>

3108
02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:44.970
<v Speaker 2>freehand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not resting in something to 100 yards,</v>

3109
02:31:44.971 --> 02:31:49.950
<v Speaker 2>that archers are actually regularly more</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate at a hundred yards with a bow</v>

3110
02:31:49.951 --> 02:31:53.340
<v Speaker 2>and arrow than someone holding a rifle</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

3111
02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really wild.</v>

3112
02:31:55.321 --> 02:31:57.770
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3113
02:31:57.771 --> 02:32:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the traditional shooting though,</v>

3114
02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:04.340
<v Speaker 2>compound bow shooting your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got a 70 pound bow it's going</v>

3115
02:32:04.341 --> 02:32:06.210
<v Speaker 2>to shoot 70 always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3116
02:32:06.211 --> 02:32:07.410
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a variable.</v>

3117
02:32:07.411 --> 02:32:11.820
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to factor any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>recurve bow can shoot 20 pounds if you</v>

3118
02:32:11.821 --> 02:32:14.610
<v Speaker 2>just pull it back a little bit to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking 65,</v>

3119
02:32:14.611 --> 02:32:15.090
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3120
02:32:15.090 --> 02:32:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Depending on how much you can actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>bend the limbs of that.</v>

3121
02:32:17.820 --> 02:32:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And go.</v>

3122
02:32:18.931 --> 02:32:22.020
<v Speaker 2>So the up and down variability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean side to side,</v>

3123
02:32:22.021 --> 02:32:23.820
<v Speaker 2>you should get pretty accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3124
02:32:23.821 --> 02:32:25.770
<v Speaker 2>just by anchoring and kind of lining</v>
<v Speaker 2>that up.</v>

3125
02:32:25.771 --> 02:32:29.760
<v Speaker 2>But the up and down really depends on</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far you pull and your breath and</v>

3126
02:32:29.761 --> 02:32:32.690
<v Speaker 2>your release is not all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your release gets super squirrely too</v>

3127
02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:35.430
<v Speaker 2>because its fingers don't have a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>release thing.</v>

3128
02:32:35.431 --> 02:32:40.110
<v Speaker 2>So you hold on a little tight or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let the string flow through your</v>

3129
02:32:40.111 --> 02:32:41.310
<v Speaker 2>fingers the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just</v>

3130
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:45.060
<v Speaker 2>shoots off all squarely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3131
02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:47.460
<v Speaker 2>So that's why the olympic recurve</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3132
02:32:47.461 --> 02:32:50.940
<v Speaker 2>they have like clicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they pull their arrow back and once</v>

3133
02:32:50.941 --> 02:32:54.030
<v Speaker 2>it gets to a certain length it sets off</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little click.</v>

3134
02:32:54.480 --> 02:32:58.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's like click and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>released the arrow so they know when to</v>

3135
02:32:58.321 --> 02:32:58.920
<v Speaker 2>release it.</v>

3136
02:32:58.920 --> 02:33:02.070
<v Speaker 2>They know when they've pulled it back</v>
<v Speaker 2>far enough to get that click.</v>

3137
02:33:02.071 --> 02:33:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>

3138
02:33:03.061 --> 02:33:05.250
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

3139
02:33:06.090 --> 02:33:08.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta think you'll lose a little some</v>

3140
02:33:08.611 --> 02:33:09.870
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3141
02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:12.380
<v Speaker 2>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're starting to move at all,</v>

3142
02:33:12.400 --> 02:33:15.180
<v Speaker 2>all the way towards the compound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at a certain point might as well</v>

3143
02:33:15.181 --> 02:33:17.450
<v Speaker 2>just shoot the compound if you take all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

3144
02:33:17.640 --> 02:33:19.590
<v Speaker 2>the feel of that thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3145
02:33:19.591 --> 02:33:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at a compound bow,</v>

3146
02:33:21.570 --> 02:33:24.630
<v Speaker 2>if you look at someone who's shooting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>compound bow like people,</v>

3147
02:33:24.631 --> 02:33:27.450
<v Speaker 2>I put a picture of me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3148
02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:30.180
<v Speaker 2>from our camp that ben took when we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3149
02:33:30.390 --> 02:33:32.400
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>commented on,</v>

3150
02:33:32.401 --> 02:33:37.290
<v Speaker 2>like look at that fucking weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like always pulleys and cables and all</v>

3151
02:33:37.291 --> 02:33:40.530
<v Speaker 2>these things hanging off of it and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>site and the stabilizer.</v>

3152
02:33:40.531 --> 02:33:41.880
<v Speaker 2>There's so much going on.</v>

3153
02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:45.420
<v Speaker 2>In your case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to the max as much shit going on on</v>

3154
02:33:45.421 --> 02:33:47.670
<v Speaker 2>any boat is ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been on a boat.</v>

3155
02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried everything.</v>

3156
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:51.750
<v Speaker 2>I tried everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've whittled it down,</v>

3157
02:33:51.810 --> 02:33:53.970
<v Speaker 2>have added things and taking things</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3158
02:33:53.971 --> 02:33:54.810
<v Speaker 2>But oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

3159
02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:55.920
<v Speaker 2>There's the photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3160
02:33:55.950 --> 02:33:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot going on and I fucking</v>

3161
02:33:58.350 --> 02:34:02.660
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all those cables and pulleys and you</v>

3162
02:34:02.661 --> 02:34:06.030
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stabilizer and the adjustable site</v>

3163
02:34:06.031 --> 02:34:08.520
<v Speaker 2>that goes up and down depending on</v>
<v Speaker 2>distance,</v>

3164
02:34:08.521 --> 02:34:10.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's so fucking accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3165
02:34:11.850 --> 02:34:13.110
<v Speaker 2>But so fun too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3166
02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:18.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's very few things I</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy as far as clearing my mind as much</v>

3167
02:34:18.311 --> 02:34:19.880
<v Speaker 2>as just shooting at a target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3168
02:34:20.770 --> 02:34:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Well it demands president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This demands that you're in the moment</v>

3169
02:34:24.371 --> 02:34:26.690
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about other shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3170
02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:28.960
<v Speaker 2>because everything is so finite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same with pool.</v>

3171
02:34:28.961 --> 02:34:33.961
<v Speaker 2>I think gravitate naturally to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>activities that to be good demands full</v>

3172
02:34:34.211 --> 02:34:36.730
<v Speaker 2>attention and inattention is bliss.</v>

3173
02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Is happiness in intention because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the present moment.</v>

3174
02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:42.850
<v Speaker 2>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely removes all of the outside</v>

3175
02:34:42.851 --> 02:34:46.990
<v Speaker 2>distractions that really aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not important right now.</v>

3176
02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're breathing.</v>

3177
02:34:49.810 --> 02:34:52.420
<v Speaker 2>You have food in your belly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're alive,</v>

3178
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:55.030
<v Speaker 2>you're healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is important?</v>

3179
02:34:55.150 --> 02:34:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a bone in your hand.</v>

3180
02:34:56.531 --> 02:34:58.750
<v Speaker 2>What's important as you make that arrow</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit that x,</v>

3181
02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:02.340
<v Speaker 2>so shoot it stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop thinking about some girl you fucked</v>

3182
02:35:02.341 --> 02:35:04.310
<v Speaker 2>when you were 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3183
02:35:05.610 --> 02:35:08.380
<v Speaker 2>While you thinking about a car that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>sold when you were 22,</v>

3184
02:35:08.381 --> 02:35:09.940
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had that car today,</v>

3185
02:35:10.270 --> 02:35:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I could fix it up and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are all these extraneous silly</v>

3186
02:35:13.331 --> 02:35:15.160
<v Speaker 2>thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are these traumas that these</v>

3187
02:35:15.161 --> 02:35:17.440
<v Speaker 2>animals don't carry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you ever heard of a bear with</v>

3188
02:35:17.441 --> 02:35:19.780
<v Speaker 2>erectile dysfunction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe never.</v>

3189
02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Maybe maybe this gay bears maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can still get it hard and</v>

3190
02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:24.940
<v Speaker 2>viagara I don't know.</v>

3191
02:35:24.970 --> 02:35:28.960
<v Speaker 2>All of these things that we have in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our monkeys are just broken because</v>

3192
02:35:28.961 --> 02:35:31.600
<v Speaker 2>we've ceased to recognize the monkey and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us.</v>

3193
02:35:31.900 --> 02:35:34.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so getting back to that and looking at</v>

3194
02:35:34.391 --> 02:35:37.750
<v Speaker 2>nature is just a great way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether you're hunting or camping or</v>

3195
02:35:37.751 --> 02:35:39.430
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking soak that in.</v>

3196
02:35:39.970 --> 02:35:42.400
<v Speaker 2>You'll learn shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also a feeling that you get when</v>

3197
02:35:42.401 --> 02:35:45.730
<v Speaker 2>you're in the woods where there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no cell phone reception,</v>

3198
02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:47.740
<v Speaker 2>there's no people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear anything.</v>

3199
02:35:47.741 --> 02:35:52.741
<v Speaker 2>You're just surrounded by trees and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife in some weird way.</v>

3200
02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:56.500
<v Speaker 2>It's for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find it lonely.</v>

3201
02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:58.310
<v Speaker 2>They find it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

3202
02:35:58.311 --> 02:36:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I hate this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't give a fuck about me because it</v>

3203
02:36:01.661 --> 02:36:06.160
<v Speaker 2>doesn't because you realize that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>really are a part of this enormous,</v>

3204
02:36:06.310 --> 02:36:09.280
<v Speaker 2>almost infinite system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite and the terms.</v>

3205
02:36:09.281 --> 02:36:12.580
<v Speaker 2>If you go down to the macro level or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>micro level,</v>

3206
02:36:12.581 --> 02:36:13.090
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3207
02:36:13.090 --> 02:36:18.090
<v Speaker 2>you're down to adams and you're down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>subatomic particles and then you expand</v>

3208
02:36:19.331 --> 02:36:24.331
<v Speaker 2>from there to cells and cell walls and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the structure of tissue in the body and</v>

3209
02:36:24.821 --> 02:36:28.780
<v Speaker 2>then the instincts that come with</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping the body alive and then with a</v>

3210
02:36:28.781 --> 02:36:33.781
<v Speaker 2>human being language and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and media that you have absorbed</v>

3211
02:36:35.831 --> 02:36:39.460
<v Speaker 2>that has given you this distorted idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what life is,</v>

3212
02:36:39.461 --> 02:36:42.910
<v Speaker 2>what being a human is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what being a man is that music should</v>

3213
02:36:42.911 --> 02:36:43.300
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

3214
02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:45.220
<v Speaker 2>When you see your girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3215
02:36:45.221 --> 02:36:46.670
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they.</v>

3216
02:36:46.671 --> 02:36:51.671
<v Speaker 2>There should be a a score to your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you are enormously important</v>

3217
02:36:51.731 --> 02:36:55.150
<v Speaker 2>because your ego wants you to survive</v>
<v Speaker 2>long enough to shoot your loads into</v>

3218
02:36:55.151 --> 02:36:57.850
<v Speaker 2>someone and make little baby arby's and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

3219
02:36:57.851 --> 02:36:59.320
<v Speaker 2>All these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

3220
02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:01.300
<v Speaker 2>They don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're in those woods,</v>

3221
02:37:01.301 --> 02:37:04.930
<v Speaker 2>all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the woods confront you with</v>

3222
02:37:04.931 --> 02:37:09.931
<v Speaker 2>this ultimate reality that you are a</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of this infinite system and this</v>

3223
02:37:10.750 --> 02:37:14.080
<v Speaker 2>infinite system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you really expand upon it,</v>

3224
02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very itself,</v>

3225
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:18.830
<v Speaker 2>the very planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this planet and all planets themselves</v>

3226
02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:22.760
<v Speaker 2>become tiny little subatomic particles</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the nature of the universe.</v>

3227
02:37:23.140 --> 02:37:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3228
02:37:24.441 --> 02:37:29.441
<v Speaker 1>That's the perspective is so key and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be kind of mind boggling to think</v>

3229
02:37:29.451 --> 02:37:30.290
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to,</v>

3230
02:37:30.580 --> 02:37:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like we're,</v>

3231
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:34.640
<v Speaker 1>we're lords of our own universe in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>

3232
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Our body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our thoughts can manifest different</v>

3233
02:37:36.861 --> 02:37:39.470
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our choices create the environment that</v>

3234
02:37:39.471 --> 02:37:40.750
<v Speaker 1>we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3235
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:43.910
<v Speaker 1>it's like we have our own universe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're plugged into this,</v>

3236
02:37:44.190 --> 02:37:46.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater universe that is,</v>

3237
02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:49.250
<v Speaker 1>that we know all around us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet and everything else and</v>

3238
02:37:49.251 --> 02:37:53.630
<v Speaker 1>that's plugged into the larger and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start just expanding your perspective</v>

3239
02:37:53.631 --> 02:37:56.840
<v Speaker 1>and it just kind of really goes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely.</v>

3240
02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:59.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the cell is as part of an organ is</v>

3241
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:02.000
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it's universal liver cell,</v>

3242
02:38:02.001 --> 02:38:03.410
<v Speaker 1>the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liver cells,</v>

3243
02:38:03.411 --> 02:38:05.570
<v Speaker 1>the liver in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one cell in that thing.</v>

3244
02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:08.570
<v Speaker 1>It goes up and down infinitely and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get a,</v>

3245
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:10.730
<v Speaker 1>get a perspective that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3246
02:38:10.731 --> 02:38:12.560
<v Speaker 1>everything's gonna be okay no matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

3247

<v Speaker 1>Like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking relax,</v>

<v Speaker 1>enjoy yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get back in touch with the monkey,</v>

3249
02:38:17.721 --> 02:38:20.780

<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there'll be another time,</v>

3252
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:26.330
<v Speaker 1>there'll be another opportunity for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to go.</v>

3253
02:38:26.331 --> 02:38:30.740
<v Speaker 1>We get so caught up in the minutia of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the details of this thing or that thing.</v>

3254
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:33.560
