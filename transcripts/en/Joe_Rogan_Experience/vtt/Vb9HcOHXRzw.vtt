1
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.043
Experience.

2
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.760
Larry.
Rob Bar,
ladies,
gentlemen.
What's up dude?

3
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.380
Nothing that feeling good.
California weed.
Gotcha.
Right?

4
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.660
A little bit.
It's not the same.
No,
no.

5
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.200
There is no weed and Queens.
Queens is,
you've got to go to the Bronx.

6
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.330
I used to go to up to four of them to get weed Queens,
isn't it?

7
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.800
Where are you from?
Well,
I used to,
I was born in New Jersey.

8
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.890
I lived in Boston for most of my young adult life when I lived in New York and

9
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:47.280
lived in new Rochelle,
which is,
yeah,
which is sad,

10
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.630
but that's like close to where weed is.
Yeah.
But I never,

11
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.270
I didn't smoke weed back then.
Very,
very rarely.

12
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.260
I didn't really smoke weed until I was 30 living here.
Right.

13
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.870
So I discovered weed and I was just like,
man,

14
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:04.220
movies who knew ice cream?
It's delicious.

15
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.720
That movies were amazing.
Everything is better.
So that was like,

16
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.090
oh my God,
there's like Ben folds is great.

17
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.550
Soon as you take your first hit of weed,
you're just like,
oh my God,
Ben folds.

18
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.020
And those are the things that people don't like about people that smoke weed.

19
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:25.070
When they talk about it like a,
Oh my God,
it's moves amazing.

20
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.850
Oh look at this sunset shot eight is the sunsets.

21
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.940
Incredible.
It's a weird,
that's a weird thing with the,

22
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:36.560
the people that don't like the effects of pock cause he affects a pot.

23
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:41.210
It's just like you become calmer and like super appreciative of everything.

24
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:43.280
Like you know,
they'll call it like stone or talk,

25
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:47.720
but what it really is like recognizing the wondering things that you ordinarily

26
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:49.160
take for granted.
You know,

27
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:53.360
I think a lot of that has to do at time dilation because things feel longer.

28
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.260
So I think you're able to appreciate things in the moment a little bit more.

29
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.670
Yeah.
But definitely possible.
That's like a minute.
It feels like two minutes.

30
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.940
Yeah.
I think there's a bunch of things going on,
right?
No,
that's it.

31
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.803
That's the only thing.

32
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.270
Why does life seem shorter though?
It seems like every year it goes faster.

33
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:18.530
Is that because we're so stoned and it's like it doesn't add up?
No,

34
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:22.550
I think that's just a facet of recognizing how brief it really is.

35
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:27.410
As you get older and you hit 40 you go,
oh Jesus.
If everything goes great,

36
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.170
I'm at the halfway point.
Like if I don't get cancer,
hit by a bus,
dying,

37
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.260
I was car accident,

38
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.380
like all these different variables that you start to consider and then you

39
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:38.600
realize like how when you work all day too,

40
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:42.770
you think about how quick God Damn Day goes by and you're saying that things

41
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:45.230
slow down when you get older.
Now I'm saying you're saying it,

42
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.870
it slows down when you smoke weed,
you know and appreciate everything,

43
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:50.960
but yet life seems like it's going faster at the same time,

44
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.430
but as I've gotten older,
I've actually been way more appreciative of things.

45
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.800
I don't know,
like in my twenties I was just like,
who cares?
Yeah,
no,

46
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.850
I'm way more appreciative too.

47
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:05.490
But I agree with you that time does seem like it's going fast.
Oh my God.
Yeah,

48
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.810
it's February.
Isn't that amazing?
It was just January.
Yeah.
Well not only that,

49
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.210
it was just July.
It was hot.

50
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.130
It's like a year is not nearly as long as we used to think it was.

51
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.170
And I think part of that also is when you were a kid,

52
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:25.030
you were in fucking school and those nine months of classes seemed like forever.

53
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.810
It's an eternity because you're forced to do something you don't want to do.

54
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.070
Once you get older and you know you,
you kind of recognize what that really was.

55
00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:37.000
You realize how short a year actually is,

56
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.930
but if you ask a 21 year old right now,
it's like,
is Liz as a year long?

57
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.360
And they're like,
did,
it's totally long.
Like I wonder if they,

58
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.510
if they feel it's a good impression of a 21 year old,
well,

59
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:48.400
it's a percentage of their life to

60
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.250
20 years old and you know,
you'll see,

61
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.240
you see things in a different perspective when you're older.
Yeah.
You know,

62
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.460
you could look back on two years and it's just like,
oh my God.

63
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:03.790
Like that two years was nothing.
When you're a kid,
you're just like,

64
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:07.930
that's like a third of my life.
Two years.
We're time travelers.

65
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.720
Yeah.
I mean,
when you're a little kid,
like every year is a huge deal,
you know?

66
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:16.060
That's why you say like,
I'm four and a half,
you know?

67
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:19.410
No one says I'm 24 and a half match.

68
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.230
If you're dating a girl and you go,
how old are you?
And she's like 24 and a half.

69
00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:28.000
I feel like I got to go.
You're fucking,
you're six.
You're like,

70
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:32.020
you have some genetic abnormality.
It makes you look like you're 24,

71
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.700
24 and a forth.
Yeah.
There's,
that's a weird thing about kids today,
right?

72
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:37.534
With this,
um,

73
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.360
this thing that they're saying that the hormones in the meat or causing them to

74
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:42.640
reach puberty quicker than ever before,

75
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.880
and that girls that are like 12 and 13 years old,

76
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:48.040
they look like women and they're getting for,

77
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.990
have you noticed girls are getting furrier lately?
I think it's from the knees.

78
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:55.340
This your own subs.
So wait,
hold on your own test.
You notice that?
No,
not,

79
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.580
there's hormones in meat that are making kids grow up quicker.
They,

80
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.480
there's a bunch of factors that they believe are making kids grow quicker and

81
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:06.610
reach puberty quicker and also become larger.

82
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.160
They think it's a high protein diet that Americans take.
Like we,

83
00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:14.670
we have incredibly abundant resources when it comes to food and crazy and meat

84
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.200
protein,
all hormone filled and,

85
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.010
and on top of that antibiotics are thinking of antibiotics or having a weird

86
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:24.310
effect on people because you're absorbing a certain amount of it from the food

87
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:27.010
that you eat.
Right.
There's a lot of variables.

88
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:31.750
So why or when you look back at humans from like a hundred years ago,

89
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:35.140
why are they so much smaller?
They didn't have much food.
Is that it?
Yeah,

90
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.830
it was hard to get food.
I don't even mean fat.
Smaller,
like just smaller,
small.

91
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.020
That's a vulnerable.
Having not having enough food.
Right.
You know,

92
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.180
you,
when you look at what people can do today,
we just go into a supermarket,

93
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:52.010
you get cold meat.
Like that wasn't,
that wasn't that easy.
Right?
Right.

94
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.200
There was no freezers.

95
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.740
I just saw a documentary about the Russian hockey team and they were saying how

96
00:05:56.741 --> 00:06:00.050
they came to America for the first time in the 70s like the one that we beat in

97
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:04.130
the 80 [inaudible] and they were like,
you can get vegetables in the winter.

98
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.650
What does this mean?
Yeah,
right.

99
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.640
How do you get fruit and vegetables when people can't grow them here?
Yeah.

100
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:11.570
Our shipping,

101
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.680
the ability to get oranges from Florida to New Mexico,

102
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.770
it's fucking incredible.
Like that's never existed in time.

103
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.480
So a hundred years ago they had to eat what was near them and they had the ice

104
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:27.470
house.
Where I'm at tonight in Pasadena was an ice house.

105
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.500
It was a place they would take giant blocks of ice from the great north.

106
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.990
They would put them on boats,

107
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.440
they would put them in these cargoes that were insulated.

108
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:39.860
They're these thick walls and steel and all this different stuff to try to

109
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.620
encapsulate the cold.
And then they would bring them to a,

110
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.510
and you would go and buy ice and you'd put it in your ice box.

111
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.180
So if you had milk or something like that.
And he didn't want it to go bad.

112
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.210
You want it to last like two days,
no preservatives.
There's just no preserved.

113
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.390
Right.
They didn't have any,
you had to just store everything,
everything,

114
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.250
but not only that,
everything went quick.
You couldn't,
you had to keep shopping.

115
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.940
You had to go to the grocery store like every other day.
And when are we talking?

116
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:07.820
When is a hundred years ago?
Hundred years ago.
Yeah.

117
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.000
So the people that you're looking at these little tiny like civil war people,

118
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.010
men were like 125 pounds.
That was like the average size for a man.

119
00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:18.590
A briefly.
It's like,
yeah,
I mean,
you know,
everybody's always comparing.

120
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:23.000
Like what if the current athletes played athletes from the 60s it would destroy,

121
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:27.170
that would be such a slaughter fest.
People are bigger,
faster,

122
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.640
and not even without steroids.
It would be a few people that would,
it's always,

123
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:34.010
yeah,
it's crazy when people are just like,
well,

124
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:38.420
what if will Chamberlain went against Lebron James and it's like not even a

125
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:42.410
contest,
but if we'll,
we'll Chaim was still a giant man.

126
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.210
The other thing is if will Chamberlain live today speed.
They didn't have the,

127
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.610
the game is so great,
quicker and different in every sport,

128
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.330
but don't you think that they like will Chamberlain was a super athlete.

129
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:55.040
He was a big,
tall,
strong dude.

130
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.160
So if he just got involved in the same sort of strength and conditioning

131
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:01.970
programs that today's modern athletes get involved with,
understood nutrition,

132
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:04.490
recovery,
all the different shit that like Koby Bryant does.

133
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.790
Like Coby Brian was one of the first guys to go to Germany and get that blood

134
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:09.940
spinning procedure and I know he's on,

135
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.450
he was on top of the cryogenic thing too before anybody goes to those 250 degree

136
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:18.110
below zero booths for like three weeks.
Why is that legal of steroids aren't?

137
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.760
Well,
it's not as good.
That's why it's,
it's pretty good,
but it's not.

138
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:25.700
It's just steroids.
Steroids turned you into a super person,
right?

139
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.910
But what these guys can do today with all that is partially why they're so good.

140
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.370
And also that people imitate their atmosphere.

141
00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:39.140
If you're around a bunch of Michael Jordan Hansen elevates the game.

142
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:42.680
It's not that the physical capabilities of the elite athletes are that much

143
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:46.370
different.
I think you just,
you have to be better.
Yeah.
You look at your,

144
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.200
the people who came before you and you're not going to be like,

145
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:51.290
well I'll settle for half of what they did.
You're going to be like,

146
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:52.310
I gotta be better than that.

147
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.670
Could you imagine if like Babe Ruth came back and tried to compete against Jose

148
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.460
Conseco when Jose can,
Seiko was in his juice in prime,
first of all,

149
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:05.070
I feel like Babe Ruth would be brought up on rape charges

150
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.800
or just be like,
he would be the bill Cosby baseball.

151
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.510
Like that was probably just like,
oh yeah,
of course.
She said no,
what,

152
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.390
you're on the Yankees.
Yeah.

153
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.640
Well I think rape was probably like super duper duper common.
You know,

154
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:26.700
a thousand years ago were like almost everybody raped.

155
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.230
I guarantee you can go back to a point of like really primitive man what?

156
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:32.790
It was unbelievably common.

157
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.820
And I think that's like one of the things that people are freaking out about

158
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:35.821
today.

159
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:39.240
Like when you know this whole argument about rape culture and discussion about

160
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:41.550
rape jokes and all those things are like in a court,

161
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:46.080
like how funny of a defense that would be.
It like go back a hundred years ago,

162
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:49.480
man.
So I have a slave

163
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.670
dude.
Do you not know how this country was founded?

164
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.760
And it looks like the Second Amendment argument,

165
00:09:56.761 --> 00:09:59.880
you know this country's founded to right to bear arms,

166
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.010
salsa founded by people that owned slaves.

167
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.340
Like those people you worship were slave owners.
Yeah.

168
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.510
And it was founded by people who couldn't fit in in Europe.
Yeah.

169
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.630
People who just were like,
I don't write,
you know,
I'm,
I'm the Weirdo here.

170
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.890
And people that were so fucking fed up that they got in a boat with no

171
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:20.520
vegetables and they went across the ocean.
No vegetables,

172
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.110
no energy bars.
A lot of them got sick as fuck.
People died on that trip.

173
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.510
I mean that's a long trip.
Was Shitty,
shitty food.

174
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.330
And what did they eat back then?
Like beef jerky and stuff.

175
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:33.460
Like what could they preserve fish?
I'd probably just say fifth.

176
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.990
They caught they did they catch fish?
Is that,
is that proven?

177
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.960
They would have to try to catch fish.
Why would you not?
You're in the ocean.
Yeah,

178
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:43.500
that'd be crazy.
I would assume grain.
Probably a lot of grain.

179
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.950
Well they're also always traveling to like when you're fishing,

180
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.550
like presumably the law,
even if you're trolling,

181
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:52.230
which means like pulling over behind.

182
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.800
I would imagine the boat would be going faster than that.
If it's got oars,

183
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:59.490
I mean,
and uh,
sales rather than those big crazy fucking sales.

184
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.310
I bet they're going faster than you would want to troll for.

185
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.700
So you're not going to slow down on the off chance that you catch a fish.

186
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.540
What's trolling?

187
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.780
Trolling is like when they take a line and they pull up behind a boat with a

188
00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:11.010
hook and a,

189
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.120
a flashy lure and the fish see it and they think that's a fish transform away

190
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.720
and they chase after it and they eat it.
They almost instinctive.

191
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:21.100
They can't help themselves,
but it's really great.
Yeah,

192
00:11:21.101 --> 00:11:22.320
it's a boring way to fishing.

193
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.500
I just went deep sea fishing in Redondo beach this weekend.

194
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.040
We just dropped a line down and I had a really bad experience.

195
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:33.600
I caught a Pelican alive pelican cause I didn't drop it quick enough and the

196
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:38.130
Pelicans,
we'll go for it.
I caught like,
I think a 50 pound Pelican,

197
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.760
like this Pelican was gigantic and they had to like some do.

198
00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:44.100
Some captain dude came out.
He's like,
I got this.

199
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.290
And he pulled the Pelichet out by his beak out of the water and had to like cut

200
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:53.100
the hookup.
So he's just like living with a hook and I'm done.
Anyway,

201
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.360
thing happened once with a seal,
a seal,
a store,

202
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.450
a seal or sea lion.

203
00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:02.760
One of those fucking things I was fishing with these guys is camera dudes from

204
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.710
news radio where like there were big time fisherman.

205
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:08.600
They'd go out every weekend though again.
The show must be so fun.
Yeah.

206
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.380
And I'm like,
all right,
one day I was like,
come on,
let's go,
let's go.

207
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.550
So we all went out for shit.
I fucking didn't get any visual.

208
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.000
I caught a fucking seal.
Did you?
Did you take it?
No,
we had to cut the line.

209
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:22.720
It was so awful.
Like it's a mammal.
It's got a hook in its mouth.

210
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.640
It personality.

211
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.090
It's a testament to the intelligence of dolphins because you never hear about

212
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:30.780
someone accidentally catch a dolphin.
You mean they,

213
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.380
that's what they used to eat back in the day though.

214
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:35.860
They would just get one big dolphin and feed 20 people and then they might have

215
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:38.760
eight dolphins are bigger fish instead of trying to catch these people

216
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.460
definitely killed dolphins,
but they would never,
they're not seeing the cove.

217
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.670
That's why,
I mean they kill and eat dolphins for sure.
They always have been,

218
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.880
but they don't catch them with hooks.
I mean if you,
you'd have to like,

219
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.880
you'd have to Jig them,
which means like you'd have to pass,

220
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.760
throw the hook over their body and pull on it.
Like catch their body.

221
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.150
They're not going to willingly bite a fake fish.
They're too smart now,

222
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.490
but dolphins are so nice.
They probably came up with like,
Hey,

223
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:04.930
can we help you guys?
And they're just like,
there's definitely been some of that,

224
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.000
hey,
what's up guys?
You need help.

225
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.060
If they probably ate cuter things back in the day,
like that.

226
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:11.350
Things that usually you'll be like,

227
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.400
oh look a seal or like have a little baby sea lion and you know that back then

228
00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:16.091
that was like,
no,

229
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:19.870
that's like Turkey dinner for like three weeks for our village or something.

230
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.290
Yeah.
I think we think things are too cute,
man.

231
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.610
You gotta get over how cute things are.

232
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.530
Is that the first bird that you almost killed?
You killed a bird before.

233
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.860
Never killed.
I've never killed a bird.
Um,
even killing a fish is weird,
you know,

234
00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:37.030
I'm not from the country where I've,
I grew up killing anything.

235
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.950
Killing things are weird.
I Dunno.
It's weird.
Killing bugs sometimes.
Yeah.

236
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:45.070
It's weird thing to feel weird.
It's like weird to take a life,
but you know,

237
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:46.750
you got it.
I got to eat here,

238
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.200
but it's even weirder that we have somebody else do it.
Oh,

239
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.720
supermarket cool with that.
That's,
that's the weirdest part about it though,

240
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.010
isn't it?
It is and it's cool.
It's cool.

241
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.820
It's cool to be able to get like to just be able to go to the store and they

242
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:02.590
have lamb,
you know,

243
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.780
fucking amount of effort you would have to go through to get a sheep and kill it

244
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:11.260
and butcher it and raise it pieces and then kill it.
Fuck,

245
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.510
you got to be friends with it for awhile.

246
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.960
So these people who are doing it are doing us a huge service,

247
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.730
but there's also a weirdness with people if you don't like,

248
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:24.640
you don't think of yourself as being a killer while you're wearing like leather

249
00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:27.880
shoes you got belt on.
It's made out of Nike.

250
00:14:27.881 --> 00:14:32.520
That's made by like Filipino kids with bloody fingers,
no fingernails.

251
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.910
China of course we can't,
we can't think about this stuff dehydrated.

252
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:40.240
That's like the contract we make when we're like we want to live in a society

253
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:42.670
where we have convenience,
right?
Yeah.

254
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:46.570
I was listening to this radio lab podcast about cities and they were talking

255
00:14:46.571 --> 00:14:51.290
about like the hectic crazy pace of cities and they were saying that the pace is

256
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:52.040
directly

257
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.660
<v 2>mathematically related to how many people live in the city.
The pace,
the pace.</v>

258
00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:00.830
The pace of the way you talk,
the amount of syllables per second,

259
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:06.130
the amount of steps per minute that you take when you're walking directly

260
00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:09.290
related to the population of the city.
It was amazing.

261
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.370
They're like broke it down as a matter of mathematical equation with these like

262
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.950
physicists that they thought this through and they've done all these tests where

263
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:19.110
they called people,
they called post offices,
they called in,
they,

264
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.660
they set up like a weigh points like here's like the start,
here's the beginning.

265
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.470
And they measured everybody who walks through that way point like an unknown way

266
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:29.120
point.
They had no idea there are being studied.

267
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.550
They put a piece of string down on the ground,

268
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.390
they tied it to one post and another pro.

269
00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:36.380
So they have an arbitrary beginning start time and end time.

270
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.220
And these people would walk through it and they would count in every city what

271
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:44.720
is the average number?
So this guy walked 20 feet per second or whatever.

272
00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:49.721
This guy walked 15 and they would figure out how many steps and they would throw

273
00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:54.410
it all into a computer and they found out that it's directly proportional to how

274
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:55.400
many people live in the area.

275
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.010
<v 1>It is the fastest walkers.
Do you remember?
Well I didn't pay attention.</v>

276
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.060
I was just fascinated.

277
00:16:00.061 --> 00:16:02.660
They were just ringing and they would just read out a bunch of numbers.

278
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.513
Should be skinny though,

279
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.710
you know cause well la be one of the most per capita people that live in the

280
00:16:07.711 --> 00:16:10.230
city and the most people in the purse city.
Right.
What do you imagine?

281
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.960
I didn't say,

282
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:15.840
well there's a lot of people in la but la is also spread out.

283
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.170
But you shouldn't be skinny because what you fucking eat and drink like that's

284
00:16:19.171 --> 00:16:23.310
so dumb that you think that way.
I walked so much.
But if you walk a mile a day,

285
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.540
yeah,
probably sprain your ankle.
I just don't think I'm a fast walker.
But

286
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:32.380
you have to walk a lot I think to actually like lose weight from it.
Yeah.

287
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.000
I would assume sometimes I got into biking at some point and I was like,

288
00:16:36.001 --> 00:16:40.920
here we go.
This is,
here comes the exercise.
Do you know a little exercise?

289
00:16:40.921 --> 00:16:45.921
Biking is used to ride like 25 miles a day to get like a really good workout and

290
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.360
that's a lot of risk.
25 miles is 25 miles of lottery,

291
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:57.540
25 million lines of possibility where cars can hit you.
Lions,
cars,
cars.

292
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.830
I'm talking about real things.
Cars.
Yeah.

293
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.180
Mountain lions are a problem with people with dirt bike ride.
Really?
Yeah.

294
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.720
They say it's like a rolling a ball of yarn passed a cat.

295
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.980
You know a cat can't resist themselves when they see a mountain back go by,

296
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.730
they think is trying to run from them.
I hear they're fine with people though.

297
00:17:14.731 --> 00:17:17.780
Like hikers and stuff.
Is that true?
No,
no,
no.

298
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.680
Mountain lions in Griffith and like I go hiking there.
Am I at risk?
Oh,
for sure.

299
00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:23.310
Yeah.

300
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.780
I mean most likely the mountain lions going to stay clear of you because they've

301
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:30.090
learned over the years that when you fuck with people usually get killed.

302
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.330
So they develop these instincts to stay shy of people,

303
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:38.360
but if the wrong mountain line with a sprained ankle finds you,

304
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.740
<v 2>your,
you know,
you're there when it's hungry and it says,
fuck it,</v>

305
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.080
I'm not starving to death and it just takes you down,

306
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.500
<v 1>that can happen to it there.
It doesn't happen that often.</v>

307
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.630
Jury's kind of out on how you deal with the

308
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.070
<v 3>mountain lion attack.
Right.
It's not the same as a bear.
You don't play dead,</v>

309
00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:56.550
right?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You fight back,
fight back.
You Punch it in the fight back.

310
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.270
Is that a shark?
Well,
you do whatever you can.
If you can punch,

311
00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.170
do whatever you can.

312
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.480
You want to make it so that it's worried about being injured by yes.

313
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.610
Big l l yeah.
It's supposed to like jump your arms up in the air,

314
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.590
but you're all oddly enough,
you're not supposed to make eye contact with it.

315
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.130
It sounds like my sex life.
Terrible.
Joe.
Sorry again,

316
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.860
your shirt.
Take off your shirt,
make it into a ball and throw it.

317
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.550
I pretend to be really big.
I threw my shirt and I would do cat things.

318
00:18:23.551 --> 00:18:26.490
I think it's cause it's still can't work.
Do that with a cat.
It's going

319
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.350
let you roll a ball past him.

320
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.460
Talk about the large cats are so terrifying to me.
Mountain lions are awful.

321
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.510
If you get bitten by one,
they're awful.
It's just gotten bitten by one.

322
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.440
A Guy I got to see that you coupon mountain line at some point too that I could

323
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:46.320
see a guy in Cupertino.
Uh,
his kid,

324
00:18:46.321 --> 00:18:48.120
his six year old kid got attacked right in front of them.

325
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.050
They were walking on a trail.
That's where apple is.
Mount line jumps out.

326
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:56.450
Bites a kid.
There's mountain lions like in Hollywood.
Yeah,
I saw it.

327
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.170
I saw a fox on the street in Hollywood.
Fox just walking around.

328
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:06.000
Oh yeah.
In Los Feliz and shit.
What wasn't a cougar?
Uh,

329
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.920
I don't know what her real fox.
Yeah.
Real Fox.
Yeah.
They have real foxes in La.

330
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.900
We made like a fake Fox.
He was trying to say like foxy lady.
No,
no.
Oh yeah.

331
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.540
Foxy lady
was a fuck.
Hey,

332
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.940
sell this real facts in Lowe's.
Feel it.
Know I didn't think that boxes,

333
00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.890
we're not like a Fox walking around.
My friend's cat just got eaten by coyotes.

334
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.200
That happens all the time.
Yeah.
Wow.

335
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:36.230
Did you see there was a article showing frozen people and animals and people

336
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:38.550
that have died from being frozen like it's a little,

337
00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:41.160
there's a lot of homeless people just like sitting there and I would like a park

338
00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:45.040
bench frozen,
but one thing was interesting was a Jamie.
They have a,

339
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.100
like if you see Fox frozen in water,

340
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.450
it's a Fox that was trying to cross this water and it just froze like mid,

341
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:52.913
mid thing it,

342
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.120
there's an elk that was frozen standing up and then coyotes ate it while it was

343
00:19:57.121 --> 00:19:58.110
standing up.
Yeah.

344
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.360
So it's like just skeleton standing up in a field stuck in the snow and ice.

345
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.520
It's so creepy to homeless people in the,

346
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.530
there was one guy with like his eyes wide open looking.
Oh yeah,
look at that.

347
00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.200
This bottom one,
right?
That,
why is it PSI so messed up?
Because it's frozen.

348
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:19.110
Super cold.
A little bit better I think.
But I'm actually,
you know what?

349
00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:23.160
I'm cool with animals that died naturally in the wild.
They all died naturally.

350
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.670
I mean,
everything is,
you know,
it'd be unnatural if they stayed alive.

351
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.130
Unless this has to do with global warming.
I'm fine with it.

352
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.170
Can we prove that this has nothing to do with global warming?
And what did,

353
00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.580
what are your thoughts on global warming?
Love it.
Happy,
huge fan.

354
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.400
Uh,
my thoughts on it.
I,
you know what,
I,
um,

355
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.130
I mean it's hard to deny that something fucked up is happening right now,

356
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.200
<v 1>right?
Yeah.
Pretty hard to deny.
Yeah.</v>

357
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:55.060
I definitely believe that we've fucked things up.
I don't know if we have,

358
00:20:55.090 --> 00:21:00.090
I think we certainly have done a lot of damage as far as like pollution and

359
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:01.991
particulates.

360
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:06.760
But I listened to people that say that they know that we have done it and I

361
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:10.890
believed them and I trust them.
I mean,
scientists.
Yeah.
But I don't know,
you know,

362
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.860
I have no,
I'm an idiot.
I don't,
we believe scientists on that.
Well,

363
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:16.720
I certainly do.
I mean,
I,

364
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.320
what I'm saying is I don't know what the fuck is going on.
I'm listening to them.

365
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.650
And they're making a lot of sense and I would always go towards the scientists,

366
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.750
but I have no idea.

367
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.380
Like whether or not people were actually causing global warming or whether or

368
00:21:29.381 --> 00:21:32.170
not global warming is going to be the sky is falling moment.

369
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:37.000
That 2000 wasn't for the 2012 wasn't,
I don't know,
just feel like it's,

370
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.250
it's so scary that we are just like,
I don't want to deal with that right now.

371
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.160
I think so,
yeah.

372
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:45.370
I think it's like one of these things where in order to actually deal with it,

373
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:49.540
we'd have to be way more scared right now because every time a report comes out,

374
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:53.770
scientists are just like,
yeah it's going to be all over and like 20 years,

375
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.190
you know?
But didn't they say that about aids to that aids would be over.

376
00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.040
We'd all be dead by [inaudible] 97 or something like that.

377
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.510
Did they say fuck yeah they were,

378
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.770
there were some doom and gloom motherfuckers back when when Magic Johnson came

379
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:06.400
out with aids.

380
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.520
That's when everybody fucking panic cause it was like a Zombie movie where the

381
00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:11.740
president goes on TV and tells you he's a Zombie.

382
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.650
I'm sorry I'm going to become a Zombie and a couple of days like what?

383
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.850
Like Magic Johnson Johnson was the king.
He says

384
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.110
fucking huge super athletes and just one of the best basketball players of all

385
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:25.810
time.
It would be like if Lebron came out with global warming,

386
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:30.280
like he just was like I have global.
Oh my God the prawns got global warming.

387
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.950
Is there any positive things about aids though?

388
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.710
Just like let it like besides weight loss and stuff like that,

389
00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:38.740
is there anything positive to look at it because like I know so many people that

390
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:42.790
have aids now and they're,
they're like they don't have aids.
HIV positive.

391
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:46.150
You probably get to do a lot of interviews.
I don't know.

392
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.310
Well I've seen this.

393
00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:55.690
There was some scientific study they did where they injected a sick person with

394
00:22:55.691 --> 00:23:00.550
HIV,
like the HIV to combat some other disease.

395
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:04.120
Like it was an inner form of HIV.
I didn't hear you hear about that.

396
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.870
Didn't we cure it?
Well,
this is what they're trying to do now.
They're trying to,

397
00:23:07.871 --> 00:23:11.650
this is like some radical new form of therapy for certain diseases.

398
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.000
I can cancer even they're injecting like diseases into the disease.

399
00:23:16.001 --> 00:23:20.330
So the disease fights the cancer or the other way around.

400
00:23:20.331 --> 00:23:22.480
I think cancer can defeat aids.

401
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.390
It's like Freddy versus Jason.
It's like rock,
paper,
scissors of diseases.

402
00:23:28.391 --> 00:23:31.860
You would never think the paper would be to ride,
but it does.
That's true.

403
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.040
I'm not even kidding.

404
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:36.300
I think that there's something like if you inject a certain type of cancer into

405
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:40.570
an aid sale,
it just goes like,
it just fucking kills the aids.
Well,

406
00:23:40.571 --> 00:23:42.240
there's no aids sell,
right?

407
00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.710
There's t cells that are bad and it's your immune system that's shot.

408
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.780
So with with aids it'll be really hard I think.
I think,
yeah,
it's not,
yeah,

409
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.810
there's like an actual,
like you could see what aids looks like.

410
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.530
There's like a photo of AIDS when you want to bring something up on Google photo

411
00:23:57.531 --> 00:24:00.180
of AIDS.
This is a photo of the virus,
right?
Yeah.

412
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.950
Can they find that isolated in your body?
I know that they did.

413
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:08.060
The HIV thing with a tumor because they could find the tumor and then just shoot

414
00:24:08.061 --> 00:24:08.870
something into it.

415
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.820
So you could possibly put HIV and herpes and have HIV instead of herpes.

416
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:16.550
And some people have actually probably rather have that would want that.

417
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.930
I don't know.
Herpes is,
well,
how are those drugs,
those protease inhibitors,

418
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:25.760
those are,
are those really bad for your body?
For Eight,
the HIV?
Oh yeah.

419
00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:27.200
I mean,
I don't think that they're as bad anymore.

420
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:31.010
I hear AIDS belly is a thing now you get like aids belly.
I'm not kidding.

421
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:36.000
Like there's like you can stand up.
This is very,
it's belly.
No,
no,

422
00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:37.040
there's,

423
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.430
there were all these ads all over New York at some point that we're like,

424
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.700
are you dealing with AIDS belly?
She get the fuck out of there.
Where to God,

425
00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:46.820
there's a thing.
Call in if you guys have aids,

426
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.570
might be one of those things that someone created as a marketing ploy.

427
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.680
I'm trying to sell my average for men and it's not worried or aid the AIDS
belly.

428
00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:00.320
Do you suffer from AIDS belly?
Um,

429
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.020
I thought that was a real commercial for a second.
Uh,
yeah,
I,

430
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.970
I hear that you just,

431
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:09.110
I think it's the pills that distend your belly.

432
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:14.130
Um,
I don't know.
We know a dude who has HIV.
He's fine.
Yeah,

433
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.260
Eddie too.
I've known several people that got it and I was looking at the same,

434
00:25:18.261 --> 00:25:20.500
gosh longer.
I don't know.
Maybe we'll talk later.
Yeah.

435
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.730
Don't want to out somebody but magic Johnson.
No,
no,
no.

436
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.570
I can actual person I actually know and you know,
he's,
he's fine.

437
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.380
I just told him I understand how we thought that it was going to kill everybody.

438
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:33.711
Well,

439
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:38.600
I guess I understand scientists to figure it out a way to cure most of the

440
00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:42.590
issues that come along with that disease.
So what was a death sentence?
Well,

441
00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:44.870
you're all,
I'm assuming,
I don't know this person,
you know,

442
00:25:44.871 --> 00:25:49.400
but I'm assuming that they are of the middle class and they are like,

443
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.340
they're not like a poor poverty stricken person.
Right.

444
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.810
He's not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination.
No,
no.
It think it's all,
it's,

445
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.900
he's actually probably pretty poor.
It's all paid for by insurance insurance,

446
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:04.920
which is,
I assume people still do die of AIDS,
right?
That's it.

447
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.850
That's the question we were asking actually asking this the other night.

448
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.270
We're like wounds.
The last time you heard about someone dying of aids,

449
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.600
like it used to be you'd Freddie Mercury died of aids.
Holy Shit,

450
00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:15.980
Freddie Margarie fuck.

451
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.380
Like there was always these people that were dying of aids.

452
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.970
You don't hear that anymore,
you know?
Right.
Definitely not high profile people.

453
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.270
I haven't really even know about low profile.
Okay.
Eight let's just,

454
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:27.590
we don't know.
So let's just take a guess.

455
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.420
AIDS deaths per year would 2014 let's say 2014 do you think might be adding like

456
00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:33.340
2009 in it?

457
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.800
I would say seventy thousand sixty thousand this is like a really dark prices,

458
00:26:39.561 --> 00:26:43.950
right?
I realize that many.
Yeah,
I still 60,000

459
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.360
<v 2>I would say even maybe even in the u s let's say the u s because here's where it</v>

460
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:52.590
gets funky when they start counting Africa and one of the reason why it gets

461
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:57.120
funky is because if you say HIV USA,
USA,

462
00:26:57.121 --> 00:26:59.550
let's just go with USA.
Okay.
Because if you go with the world,

463
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.970
the real problem with the world is as explained,
explained to me in Africa,

464
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.150
it's easy.
They can get funding from AIDS organizations.

465
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.630
If someone has HIV,
they,
the lawyer will say,
you know,

466
00:27:09.631 --> 00:27:11.600
this person is getting aids.
They're,

467
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.520
they're testing positive for aids and this is like,

468
00:27:14.521 --> 00:27:16.050
there's x amount of AIDS cases,

469
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.620
but they might not have HIV and they're not going to test him for it.
What?

470
00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:22.560
They might have a bunch of different diseases,
like an Africa,

471
00:27:22.561 --> 00:27:25.770
you could have a whole host of different diseases that destroy your immune

472
00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:29.250
system,
so they might have HIV,
but they also might have a bunch of other shit.

473
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.680
That's what I was going to say,
like you die of pneumonia,
right?

474
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.670
When they say 30,000 when they say those numbers in Africa,

475
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.500
what it's been explained to me by legit scientists is that it's possible that

476
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:43.830
you have to consider that those people don't all have HIV.

477
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.070
It might be unrelated illnesses that's causing their immune system to get

478
00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:49.980
destroyed.
Some of them might have HIV,
HIV,

479
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:54.300
but some of them might have cancers and toxic poisoning.
Who knows?

480
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.760
There could be a lot of other issues,
so they don't,
yeah,

481
00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.020
they just seeing people who have aids,

482
00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:01.620
they're not testing every single person that they throw into this grand number,

483
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.460
but that's not in the u s in the u s so in the u s yeah,

484
00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:07.470
that's what I was saying.
Let's go with the s not worldwide.

485
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:11.070
What do you want to say?
I'm going to,
I'm going to say a 20,000 okay.

486
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:16.071
I say 12 I say 60 I say one the US died of AIDS in 2014

487
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:21.563
<v 4>here we go.</v>

488
00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.820
<v 2>An estimated 1.5 million people die for 2013 39 million people have died</v>

489
00:28:33.161 --> 00:28:36.250
worldwide.
We're so dumb.
What's wrong with us?

490
00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.540
An estimated one point feel so dumb.
Right.
And people,
this is worldwide.

491
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:41.680
A worldwide.
Okay.

492
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:47.410
Africa is 90% still 1.4 that Christ subsaharan Africa.
Here it is.

493
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.510
Subsaharan Africa has the biggest burden of HIV AIDS with almost 70% of the

494
00:28:52.511 --> 00:28:57.400
global total of new HIV infections.
But that's HIV.
Hmm.
That's not good enough.

495
00:28:57.401 --> 00:28:58.320
Saying AIDS.

496
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.560
You've got to say in theU s aids related deaths in the US in 2010 HIV was a

497
00:29:04.301 --> 00:29:06.760
seventh leading cause of death.

498
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.493
<v 4>Huh.</v>

499
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.140
<v 2>That sounds like a lot of people.</v>

500
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:15.710
1.1 million people in the u s right now are living with HIV dad.

501
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.370
Oh,
here we go.
I was right.

502
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:23.180
The estimated deaths 13,834 with a you were closest.

503
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.120
Yeah,
and that was in 2011

504
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.340
<v 4>okay.</v>

505
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:32.900
<v 2>So I,
you know,
that sounds like a lot.
That's a lot of people.</v>

506
00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:37.230
I mean that's a lot of people.
Still a lot of people.
If it's the seventh yeah.

507
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.150
If I look at something like pneumonia or even chicken pox or how many people die

508
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.040
year,
how

509
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.870
<v 1>many people die of alcohol?
Oh,
things like that one.
Oh that's giant.</v>

510
00:29:46.871 --> 00:29:51.000
That's seventy thousand seventy thousand plus in America every year.
Every year.

511
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.820
Just directly from drinking themselves to death.
Yeah,

512
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.220
but that's not even like car related deaths from alcohol.

513
00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:02.020
That's not domestic violence.
Murder.
How many from pot?
Zero.

514
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.400
Yeah,
zero.

515
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.220
There's probably been some people that have done some stupid shit that's caused

516
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:08.260
them to die because they were on pot dabs.

517
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:13.300
If you smoked pot and then just drove off the fucking bridge cause you spaced

518
00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.920
and you drowned,
there's pot take that hit who who gets,

519
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.230
I mean essentially are their numbers.
I don't think there must be.
There must be.

520
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.681
I mean,

521
00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:27.040
I don't know if you've heard that and all these anti legalization arguments I've

522
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:28.030
ever heard those numbers.

523
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.150
Well it's probably not nearly as prevalent because it doesn't affect your motor

524
00:30:31.151 --> 00:30:32.290
skills the way alcohol does.

525
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.350
Like everybody knows across the board that if you drink,
you get drunk,

526
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.380
you're compromised.
But Pot doesn't really compromise your physically.

527
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:43.240
So did numbers are going to be way different alcohols like 100% like you pull

528
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:45.460
people over and they're drunk,
they're not driving as good.

529
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:48.820
It's 100% if you've had seven drinks and you get in the car,

530
00:30:48.821 --> 00:30:51.250
you just don't drive as good as you do when you're sober.

531
00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:55.390
It's 100% but there's people that can get high as fuck and get in a car and

532
00:30:55.391 --> 00:30:59.200
drive.
Excellent.
And there's no issue that's driving really poorly,

533
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:04.180
really high.
They've actually done studies.
I've test some people,

534
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.730
no recognizable issues except when they get to high,
it's by,

535
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.240
but these people are probably rookies.

536
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.820
They're getting these rookies that don't get high and they're getting them too

537
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:16.120
high and they fucking,
they're turning corners and they panic and the mid corner,

538
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.000
you know what happens when I get really manic drive?
I forget.

539
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:21.030
I'm driving for a few minutes.
Yeah,

540
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.780
like you're driving and you're just like your,

541
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:27.700
your mind is wandering to something else.
You've got the Ben Folds Alabama.

542
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.270
But yeah,
that's true.
That's scary too because you're always thinking like,

543
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:38.530
what was I doing for like the last 10 minutes was I even like awake at this
time?

544
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.470
It's too loud.
My headphones went out.
Oh,
went out.

545
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.840
You know that weird thing,

546
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.670
that weird thing that people do where you are in the middle of doing something

547
00:31:48.671 --> 00:31:51.370
and you go,
Whoa,
how the fuck did I get here?
Like how did I,

548
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.550
how did I zone out and autopilot all the way home,

549
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.960
took all the turns and then you're driving.
You mean drop street?
No,

550
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:04.090
totally sober.
Just space out,
but do everything correctly.
I've done,
oh,
I do that.

551
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.810
I forget why.
I went into a certain room of my apartment a lot.

552
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.630
Like I'll just be like,
I got to go to the kitchen and I'll be in the kitchen.

553
00:32:10.631 --> 00:32:15.130
I'm like,
what did I need in the kitchen?
I remember walking in there,
I guess.

554
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.700
Yeah.
Sometimes when I'm driving I went like miles and I'm like,
oh,

555
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:20.560
I'm already past this spot.
Yeah.

556
00:32:20.561 --> 00:32:23.650
And it sucks because when you come out of realizing that you're like,

557
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.630
am I still in it?
Am I still in my driving like,

558
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.020
like you're still kind of trying to catch up to the now cause you're thinking so

559
00:32:29.021 --> 00:32:31.570
much like trying to figure out what you were doing in the past that you're not

560
00:32:31.571 --> 00:32:35.560
even paying attention to what you're doing.
Yeah.
No,

561
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:38.440
I mean I do in the shower all the time.

562
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:41.690
I'll just shower everything and forget that I've watched anything.
Oh yeah.

563
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.910
I'll be like,
did I wash any part of my body?

564
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.900
And then all of a sudden they'll be like,

565
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.240
oh I guess and then I'll just shower again.

566
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.240
Or you forgot that you forgot to wash the butthole and then you have to turn the

567
00:32:50.241 --> 00:32:54.170
shower back on it.
I don't smoke pot.
Have these problems everybody does.

568
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.130
Everybody has one of the things they say to cured Alzheimer's or to prevent it

569
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.370
as much as possible.
You're supposed to take different routes to work.

570
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.730
He's supposed to drive different ways to prevent Alzheimer's.
Yeah.

571
00:33:04.731 --> 00:33:08.570
Not to prevent it,
but to slow down the onset if it's coming.
If you have it,

572
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.070
they say,

573
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:13.130
they say that when people go and do the same thing every day and the exact same

574
00:33:13.131 --> 00:33:17.540
order,
there's no unusual input.
So your brain just recognizes it.

575
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:22.200
Site as a on a subconscious level and never has to process like I don't have to

576
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.400
process,
I get this.
So it becomes atrophied.
Yeah.

577
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:29.960
I feel that I feel creatively atrophied when I don't meet new people or don't

578
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:32.870
see a new place.
If you're just seeing the same people every day,

579
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.000
you just feel like,
like your mind is dying.
Well yeah,
you get bored.

580
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.020
Just get blocked into the same experience over and over and over again.
Yeah.

581
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.580
Driving around like going,
I think probably move into a new fucking place.

582
00:33:46.581 --> 00:33:50.540
It'd be really smart for us to,
I mean that's what we all were designed for.

583
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:53.930
We're designed,
we're hunter gatherers.
That's what we're,
that's our DNA.

584
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.290
I just like,
I think about too,
and you know I,
you tour all the time and I,

585
00:33:57.291 --> 00:33:59.810
I travel on the road to do stand up and it's like,

586
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:04.460
I wonder what that does to my mind to have to get used to a city for four days

587
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:08.840
and be alone.
Like that's a weird thing on things.
Weird.
It's so weird.

588
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:12.860
I go so many days where I don't talk to anyone and the first time I talked to

589
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:17.030
people is an hour of stand up.
Yeah.
Like that's like crazy.

590
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.840
What does that do to your brain?
It's not good.
It can't be right.

591
00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.990
A lot of comics get depressed when they do the road.
Oh yeah.

592
00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:27.740
I figured out a way to stop that early.
What do you do?
Bring your friends.

593
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.910
I want to bring friends on the road with me.
I really,

594
00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.830
and my toy where you could get openers,
don't let me bring open,

595
00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:37.280
I did it back then.
That's the only way I did it.
I demanded it.
Yeah.

596
00:34:37.281 --> 00:34:40.220
I've been doing it that way since the 90 [inaudible] it is so much more fun when

597
00:34:40.221 --> 00:34:42.440
they let me do that.
I just tell them,
I go,
look,
I'm,

598
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.960
I'm going to bring you a great comic.
I'm going to give you a great show.

599
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:46.770
I'll pay for his airfare.
I'll,
I'll,

600
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.060
I took the heads financially to bring guys out cause it was like,

601
00:34:50.061 --> 00:34:51.050
it's way better.

602
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:56.230
There's a difference between making 500 extra bucks and being miserable and

603
00:34:56.301 --> 00:34:59.300
lonely or even 500 less bucks and hanging out with your friend.

604
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.220
And it's good for them too because it gives these guys who might be landlocked

605
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.020
in La.
I take them on the road,

606
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.050
expose them to these clubs and then chill and then like,
like Hinchcliffe I just,

607
00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:12.920
I took him to the comedy works in Denver and then he got booked as a headliner

608
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:15.380
after you opened for me.
So it was like,
you know,
you can,

609
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:20.150
you can do that and you can get guys in the door that way too,
you know?
Yeah.

610
00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:23.300
It's great.
I love to bring people,
I mean it's got it.

611
00:35:23.301 --> 00:35:26.660
Force your agent into doing it for you and just tell them this is the show.

612
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.220
It just keeps you from just needing to masturbate all day.
Like I just all day,

613
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.880
man,
that's where you're wrong is crazy.
Doesn't keep you from doing that.
Oh,

614
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.190
you gotta do it anyway.
[inaudible] I forgot

615
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.340
<v 3>something back in my room.
Guys knocking on your door.
10 minutes later.</v>

616
00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.790
Are we still going to have lunch?
Hey,
I'm,
oh,
I'm still,

617
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.440
I can't find it.

618
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.080
I went back to the flashlight the other day and I was like,
why did I leave this?

619
00:35:52.081 --> 00:35:56.640
This?
I had never done it.
I've never done it.
That's good.
Yeah.

620
00:35:56.641 --> 00:36:00.180
We used to have a sponsor.
Oh,
I'd never at one of our earliest,
can I get one?

621
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.600
How do I wish?
Were they expensive round?
We had a box of them.

622
00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:06.280
Do we still have a box from here?
Did I bring a box in?

623
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.150
See if you can find one for me.

624
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:12.210
That video where they interviewed the girl who's the model for the fleshlight?

625
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:17.460
Yeah,
the zone model.
They are there.
I don't know that.
Maybe they lied about that,

626
00:36:17.461 --> 00:36:21.750
but they said she's probably shit.
It doesn't live or give a giant in there.

627
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.080
It looks like some sort of a octopus thing.
Romanian this and she's like,

628
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.330
I'm so proud it's my vagina.

629
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.210
That was one of those local news pieces where they go,

630
00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:33.300
this is what we're going to tell you.
We're going to tell you the flesh line.

631
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.700
10th anniversary of being Montenegro.
Yeah,
he's got one.
Well,
that's the good one.

632
00:36:37.701 --> 00:36:41.220
It looks like a beer cans.
They could just keep it in the fridge.
This,
yeah,

633
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.520
that's a mouth one to rub her mouth.

634
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:49.120
It looks like a can.
I literally had some sponsors or some,
uh,

635
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.980
guests that told me I can't be on an episode where you do that,
will you?

636
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.780
Will you have the,
like Sam Harris,

637
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.980
first time he came on and it was like one of the stipulations.
What he couldn't,

638
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.080
we couldn't have that as a sponsor for the episode that he was on.
Why?

639
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.280
Because he didn't want to be associated with a rubber vagina.
Why?

640
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.121
That's so crazy.

641
00:37:06.121 --> 00:37:10.290
And he's a neuroscientist and an author and a respected intellectual.
It's crazy.

642
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.890
Couldn't you just not do it on that episode then?
That's what I did.

643
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.410
That's what I did.
You miss them.
I miss them.

644
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.540
What you meant to fleshlight they were so fun to talk about all the time and I

645
00:37:21.541 --> 00:37:23.210
don't miss,
we said what?
As much as we could have.

646
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.030
What would you say is the biggest advantage to using a flashlight?

647
00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:27.870
Doesn't feel like your hand,
it feels like,

648
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:31.620
I mean if you put the right lotion on it actually feels pretty good.
It's crazy.

649
00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.750
I haven't done it in like a long time so I was like,

650
00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.700
I was like Oh my God this is but then the,
she's got grossed out a little bit.

651
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.590
You should,
it just grows.
I just felt a little gross.
It's um,
it's just,

652
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.310
they designed some sort of a rubbery,
I don't know what the way I actually use,

653
00:37:47.311 --> 00:37:49.020
it's almost like a food based thing.

654
00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:52.320
I think it was like gelatin based but it feels like human flesh.

655
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:55.680
It's way better than your hand because your hand,

656
00:37:55.681 --> 00:38:00.600
you feel I know hand signals.
I do have times where I'm like need,

657
00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.510
there needs to be more,
you know like I need more out of this.

658
00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:06.420
I don't know what I need to do differently.
That's a commitment though.

659
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.900
Fuck that thing.
Cause you got to wash it afterwards and it's just,

660
00:38:09.901 --> 00:38:12.790
you feel like a loser.
Oh wash it.

661
00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.740
You shoot up a load into his fucking rubber tube.
You're like,

662
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.180
what is wrong with me?

663
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.510
I just want to get to the point financially where I could just throw it out.

664
00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.990
Just get a new one.
How much do they call?
Well,
they're like,
that's registering.

665
00:38:25.991 --> 00:38:28.140
They're pretty expensive,
but when we were getting them for free,

666
00:38:28.141 --> 00:38:31.880
I used to do that.
I got ready,
like I'll be like,
ah,

667
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.050
I just leave it on the nightstand and then two days later I'm like,

668
00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:36.070
you know what?
I'm just throwing this away.
Yeah,

669
00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:39.850
you don't want to wash four day old come out of your flesh and my girlfriend do

670
00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:43.000
it.
I'll just hire a housekeeper.
No,
no,
no.

671
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:47.260
You don't have to vacuum clean these things is a box of them.

672
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.630
There's like a hamper full by the bed.
There's a great video in like,

673
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.090
I think it's like local news in China where they see one of these and like a

674
00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:59.140
puddle of water and they think it's a new fish that they've discovered a species

675
00:38:59.141 --> 00:39:02.350
of fish.
That was hilarious.
I don't believe that.
I think

676
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.720
he says it.
It's true.
No,
it was on the news was on the news.

677
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:12.190
That's how I found out it.
It
has to be true,
but when you see it though,

678
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:16.810
it looks like a fish.
There's no way there's the photo of HIV.
Whoa.

679
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:22.480
It looks like we aim on backup.
Does.
Did you pull it up?
I asked him to,
yeah.
Yeah.

680
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:26.080
I didn't see that.
It wasn't looking.
That's what HIV looks like.

681
00:39:26.081 --> 00:39:30.200
Did you show us this,
Jeremy?
Yeah.
They took one on the bottom left.
It looks like.

682
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.540
Oh my God.
It looks exactly like we'd aids is weed.

683
00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:39.850
They convinced the other cells to attach it.
It's just weird,
man.

684
00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:43.770
It looks like the Geo Dome that Pauly Shore Stephen Baldwin wearing,

685
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:48.810
but it's covered by we'd donuts.
Wow.
It's covered by the phone lights.

686
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:53.140
Remember biodome
areas,
but it's green.

687
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:57.730
Oh my God.
Look at the one up top.
Look at the one above that.
Jamie.
Go up there.

688
00:39:57.731 --> 00:40:00.430
That that one is the blue strings.
What the fuck?

689
00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.940
Why is that one so different looking smoke.

690
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.570
What said that in the article it said HIV is evolving.
What does it say?
Jammy.

691
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.340
That's crazy.
Click on it.
Again.
Evolving to be less deadly.
Whoa.

692
00:40:12.341 --> 00:40:16.840
That's fascinating because it likes us started being rude,

693
00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.260
just trying to kill him.
[inaudible] PC.
The will.

694
00:40:20.261 --> 00:40:23.110
I realize this is just less flair in the world when all those gay people start

695
00:40:23.111 --> 00:40:24.730
dropping like flies.
What?
To be honest,

696
00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:26.570
the guy that wrote this article and he has one nice,

697
00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:29.970
so maybe read something wrong and he's a contributor.
He's not a writer,

698
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:34.550
he's not a writer.
Well,
let's see the image.
Look at the image of that thing.

699
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.730
It's crazy.
Organisms like that,
like disease,
a weird articles.

700
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:44.731
So terrifying because there are these thoughtless little lifeforms that will

701
00:40:45.191 --> 00:40:50.140
take over your life and on a huge percentage of people kill them.

702
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.110
You don't like the amount of flu deaths every year.

703
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.140
You would pay attention the amount of flu deaths.
Yeah,
it's a lot.
It's shit.

704
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:58.500
Scared the fucking shit out.
I've never gotten a flu shot though.
What?

705
00:40:58.501 --> 00:41:02.980
I've never gotten the flu.
What?
Never had the flu ever.
Never,
ever.
It's amazing.

706
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.460
Isn't that crazy?
What do you we do you,
are you like super healthy with no,

707
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:08.110
I'm actually the opposite.
I'm very,

708
00:41:08.111 --> 00:41:12.490
very unhealthy in my diet and never got the flu.
I never got a flu shot either.

709
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.640
To do so much a bottle.
You,
I wonder if that,
I wonder what that is.

710
00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:19.990
You have excellent genes.
You have an excellent immune system.
What are you,
um,
um,

711
00:41:19.991 --> 00:41:23.530
HPV
human pussy warm

712
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.690
now.
What,
what a nationality are you?
Uh,

713
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:32.560
my mom was born in Israel and uh,
my dad is just like hardy stark and weird,

714
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:33.920
like can't be an American.

715
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.080
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't know what it is.
No,</v>

716
00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:39.020
because my parents had gotten the flu a bunch of times.
Israelis,

717
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:41.510
that's some healthy stock man.
Those are survivors.

718
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.170
There's some tough fucking people come out of Israel,
you know,
tough women.

719
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.063
It's very,
yeah,

720
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:49.820
very different than what we associate with like American Jewish women.

721
00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.300
Like the stereotype is what,
like kind of whiny and like,

722
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.280
yeah,
we've,
we've got a mate,
you're going to make us late.

723
00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.600
Like very motherly Israeli women are just very much like,
I'm right.
You're wrong.

724
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.660
There's the commercial though that they thought it was something.

725
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:09.140
So not buying this at all.
Not even

726
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:15.110
the fact that this guy doesn't know that that's rubber or some sort of squid are

727
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.250
either completely retarded or this is bullshit.
And I'm going with,

728
00:42:19.251 --> 00:42:23.270
this is bull look Damon measuring
this is a joke.

729
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.090
This guy's an idiot.
Yeah.

730
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:29.750
What is it like just looking at their treat people look at her.

731
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:33.320
She's on TV and her and that's sewer grease that they have it in.
Dude.

732
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:38.120
This is like their version of self parody.
It's got a gutter oil.

733
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:41.420
That's great.
Yeah.
I don't buy it for a fucking,

734
00:42:41.421 --> 00:42:44.600
so it's like got like warts on it.
It's hit the road

735
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.140
that's been worn for our country.
That's amazing that you've never had the flu.

736
00:42:51.141 --> 00:42:55.500
I don't think I've ever the mellow.
Yeah,
buddy.
I've never had it.
And,
um,
yeah,
I,

737
00:42:55.501 --> 00:42:58.640
I just,
I really,
I now I can't get flu shots.
I feel like,

738
00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:00.540
I feel like if I get a flu shot,
I'm just going to go,

739
00:43:00.541 --> 00:43:01.970
I don't think you need to get a flu shot.

740
00:43:01.971 --> 00:43:04.160
And the flu shots are tricky because they're very,

741
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:07.040
like this year was particularly ineffective.

742
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.490
Like even my doctor was mocking it this year because it's so strong now.
So no,

743
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.060
just a,
they've failed.
It's like they,

744
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:18.610
they make these calculations based on whatever strains are out there and then

745
00:43:18.611 --> 00:43:20.570
they'd develop a vaccine for that strain of the flu.

746
00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.690
But this year was like completely ineffective.
Like oh,
totally effective.

747
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:25.190
And like 20% of the cases.

748
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.090
So like a lot of people that got the flu shot still wound up getting the flow.

749
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:32.330
People I know they've got the flow.
Yeah.
I mean there's no guarantee.

750
00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:36.500
But here's one thing you should fucking do.
Folks get goddamn fascinated.

751
00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:41.760
There's a measles outbreak at Disneyland because these fucking people think that

752
00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.470
you don't have to vaccinate your kids.
Like there's other protocols.

753
00:43:45.471 --> 00:43:49.100
Like maybe you might think that like giving your kid 26 injections when they're

754
00:43:49.101 --> 00:43:50.890
born is kind of fucked up and there's others,

755
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.340
there's doctors that agree with you,

756
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:57.080
but there's almost no doctors that agree that you should never get vaccinated.

757
00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:00.260
Why?
What's their reason?
They're just like,
it's Kinda don't want vaccines,

758
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.910
but there's certain drugs like polio and shit like that that's been almost

759
00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.710
almost completely eradicated because of vaccines.
Like it's,

760
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:11.960
there's real science behind vaccine polio is making a comeback.
Yeah.
Yeah.

761
00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:15.500
I heard polio is coming back as Holly Holly was coming back and all this is

762
00:44:15.501 --> 00:44:20.060
because people don't want to violate any vaccines.
You know?
It's so easy.

763
00:44:20.061 --> 00:44:21.050
It's so quick.

764
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:26.290
It's like it's so you get an autism for some people that believe that.

765
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:31.620
Yeah.
There's also some people that book,
well here's what's crazy.

766
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.540
<v 2>There's people that can eat certain foods that you would have no problem with</v>

767
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:39.870
and they get really sick.
Like people that have nut allergies,

768
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.850
like my kid goes to school and they make sure you have like we are and no nuts

769
00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:48.510
school.
They have like you can't bring nuts in your,
in your food.

770
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.330
You can't bring like snacks that have nuts in them.

771
00:44:51.331 --> 00:44:53.070
You can't do it because some kids,

772
00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:57.450
they'll eat those fucking things and they just die.
So some people,

773
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.960
if you inject the same thing and a thousand people,

774
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.010
you might have 999 people that have zero problem with it at all.

775
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:08.310
But one person has a real reaction.
And the question becomes,

776
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:13.640
do we change this drug that's so beneficial to all the 909,

777
00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.770
nine people?
Because one person has an adverse reaction,

778
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:21.270
one biological anomaly as it were.
So that's,
no,
you can't,
I mean,

779
00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:25.080
obviously you can't,
that's what doctors are running into.
And then there's also,

780
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.380
there's a lot of suspicion of pharmacological greed.
You know,

781
00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:29.910
that these people that are making the money,

782
00:45:29.911 --> 00:45:33.000
these pharmacy companies that they're just greedy as fuck and they want,

783
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.670
you could get by with like three injections,

784
00:45:35.671 --> 00:45:38.970
but they want you to get 20 because the amount of money that they'll earn,

785
00:45:38.971 --> 00:45:42.510
it's substantially more if you get 20 if you mandate that every kid has to get

786
00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:46.170
20 injections.
Yeah,
I mean it's,
it's crazy to me that,

787
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:50.610
that people are just like not doing it.
It's so scary because these,
you know,

788
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:54.990
you could get like a serious disease that we've eradicated.

789
00:45:54.991 --> 00:45:59.010
It could get hold again and then if enough people are not vaccinated against

790
00:45:59.011 --> 00:46:03.990
that disease,
it can be a fucking real issue.
Diseases.
Scary.
Terrifying.
Man.

791
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.500
That's scary.
I didn't have any thing about diseases.

792
00:46:07.501 --> 00:46:08.850
I never was worried about them.

793
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:13.470
I got an AIDS test in 1994 and I was shitting my pants,
shitting my pants.

794
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:16.890
Believe that I've gone this long without major problems.

795
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.850
Do you ever think about that?
Like how like crazy it is that,

796
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.490
that we can go this long without getting something crazy?
Yeah.

797
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.200
Like Ebola or,
you know,
some sort of weird cancer that no one's heard of.

798
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:31.350
What I was going to say is I never had a problem with it until I did this TV

799
00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:35.460
show and I talked to this Russian guy who worked in the biological weapons

800
00:46:35.461 --> 00:46:40.461
department and the Soviet Union where they had trenches filled with anthrax and

801
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:45.720
all these people that are virus experts.
We went to the,
um,
the um,
uh,

802
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:50.610
what is it called?
The center for the CDC sit down in Galveston,
Texas with the,

803
00:46:50.611 --> 00:46:54.310
a four foot thick walls and they have all the worst hemorrhagic viruses

804
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:58.200
contained in that lab where they study them and try to devise vaccines and shit

805
00:46:58.201 --> 00:47:00.870
for them.
The crazy space suits every,

806
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.800
every room has vacuums and the ceiling that pull all the air out of it in case

807
00:47:04.801 --> 00:47:06.430
anything.
I mean,
there's all,
I mean,
I've seen the,

808
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.950
I know they're not afraid of anything other than natural shit.

809
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:12.390
They're afraid of diseases.

810
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:16.140
They're afraid of diseases that just emerge on their own out of nowhere.

811
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:19.650
And their thought is it's just a matter of time where we're running and there's

812
00:47:19.651 --> 00:47:22.890
like a wave behind us it's going to hit.
It's just something that's like,

813
00:47:22.891 --> 00:47:25.530
what do you,
what are you,
should you get afraid of that?

814
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.950
You can't do anything about that.
So what,
like I wish I,
I,

815
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.190
I wish I was more concerned

816
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:34.660
<v 3>about stuff like that.
Like it's,
it's,
it's just so crazy that I can't even,
like,</v>

817
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:39.160
what would I do what I do to prevent it?
This is not wear a mask.
Like,
you know,

818
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.830
Japanese tourists.
Would you have a good immune system?
Obviously,

819
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:45.460
if you've never gotten the flu every right at a high temperature.
Oh yeah.

820
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:49.000
Have you ever shit while having a high,
you can't get a lot of stomach viruses.

821
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:54.070
I just get a lot of those.
Hmm.
I Dunno why,
but yet never,
never the flu.

822
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:57.400
Isn't that crazy?
It's amazing.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm turning now.

823
00:47:57.401 --> 00:48:01.150
I feel like I'm jinxing it.
No,
you'll be fine.
Just stay positive.

824
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.250
Eat Oranges and stay positive.
Someone's going to want to give me the flu now.

825
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.390
They're going to get really bad.

826
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:11.080
It's just weird that we share this earth with these little aliens.

827
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.560
They want to kill us.
I mean,
that's really what they are.

828
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.140
It's weird biological things you can't even see and we want to kill them.

829
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.890
They want,
yeah,
it's a war.
It's a war going on man.
And they crazy when they,

830
00:48:20.891 --> 00:48:24.580
when they take over your body and it decomposes,

831
00:48:24.581 --> 00:48:27.820
they literally eat your body.
That's what's so fucked up about it.
Right.

832
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.460
When they win,
it's like a bonanza.
You know,
like the,
it's a,

833
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:33.640
it's a fine day.

834
00:48:33.641 --> 00:48:38.200
Take it because the best way to spread is to don't kill 'em quick.

835
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.530
You've got to kill him slowly.
So they spit on everything.

836
00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:44.500
Cough and everybody on the subway,
that's how you spread.

837
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.080
But the real motherfucker diseases,

838
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:51.190
they're like dudes who are like to pump chumps like I can't wait.
They can't,

839
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:54.310
they can't help themselves.
They just want to kill you quick.
You know,

840
00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:57.640
like there's some strains of the flu that that literally aren't as deadly

841
00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:00.970
because they kill you so quick they can't get is what's the,

842
00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:04.600
what's the craziest disease they've discovered?
Is it still anthrax?

843
00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:08.870
Like what's the craziest,
well,
hemorrhagic viruses are the scariest.
Those,

844
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.250
they're just,
you're like in a day you're gun.
Well they get Ebola.

845
00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.670
You could still,
I know people had Ebola and they were just like,
well,

846
00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:19.300
I got fever and then I went to the doctor and like if you get it quick enough,

847
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:23.130
if they catch what it is quick enough and they get you to a real hospital and

848
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:27.220
America land of the free home of the brave.
But if you're in Africa,
you were,

849
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:31.760
that's right here.
Oh America,
right here.
I can stop respect.

850
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:35.620
No like you.
But if you're going to thatch hut roof place,

851
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:38.780
fucking Bangladesh and they tell you you have a bullet,

852
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.150
you're going to be shitting your pants.

853
00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.540
They're going to like rummage through their Tupperware looking for Madison.
Nope,

854
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:47.050
we got nothing.
You know the pop the top on these things.

855
00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.520
Look for something they could fix you with.
Nope.
Nope.

856
00:49:50.521 --> 00:49:53.110
They're not going to happen.
Chickens or running around on the floor.

857
00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:57.280
Front of you.
I've seen chickens in little Armenia.
In Hollywood.
Yeah.

858
00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:00.810
Running around.
How are your chickens and new chicken stories?
You're,
you're,

859
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:05.320
you're,
you're no,
I got to hire someone to kill the coyote.
Yeah.
I have 20 well,

860
00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.730
I used to have 20 floor.
You live on a farm or something?
No,

861
00:50:07.731 --> 00:50:10.670
I just have a big piece of property and that's great.
I have a big chicken.

862
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.860
My dream,
man,
it's great.
I eat fresh eggs every morning.
That's the dream.
Yeah.

863
00:50:14.861 --> 00:50:17.590
They were like,
guys,
I don't know why I love the orange egg too.

864
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:19.720
They're delicious eggs.
That is the dream,
man.

865
00:50:19.721 --> 00:50:23.470
I want to get a plot of land and to make food on it.
Yeah.
You know,

866
00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:27.660
I've been doing that over the last few years and you're ready man.
If go down,

867
00:50:27.661 --> 00:50:28.730
if the infrastructure

868
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:31.760
<v 1>implodes,
you're like,
you're not though.
You could do it.
No,</v>

869
00:50:31.761 --> 00:50:33.530
because then you're dealing with all these other more than I could,

870
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.870
but then you're dealing with all these people that aren't ready.

871
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.611
So what are you gonna do?

872
00:50:36.611 --> 00:50:38.980
You're gonna be doing like guy the by herself with shotgun.

873
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.460
All these people are starving.
No,

874
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:43.580
you're going to give them food and you're going to run dry and it's going to

875
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:47.000
suck for everybody involved.
You better off if an asteroid hits,

876
00:50:47.001 --> 00:50:50.020
if it hits your fucking head,
you know,
you don't want to be like,
no,

877
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:52.970
I'll be the cards the guy live in up there.
You know,

878
00:50:52.971 --> 00:50:55.910
and the remnants of a fucking shattered world.
I don't think,

879
00:50:55.911 --> 00:50:59.660
I mean that apocalyptic.
I think I'm talking about like our outage.

880
00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:01.370
You know what if,
what if food becomes,

881
00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:05.080
I mean food is going to be scarce at some point,
right?
There's going to people,

882
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:07.670
everyone's talking about the agricultural meltdown.
Like you know,

883
00:51:07.671 --> 00:51:10.580
we're not going to be able to,
to just crops and like I don't buy it.

884
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.700
People are going to be like killing each other for food.
Right.
I don't buy it.
No.

885
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.970
I think they're just not paying as much attention to crops as they would if they

886
00:51:16.971 --> 00:51:20.270
had to pay more attention.
It's the same thing what we're talking about earlier.

887
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:21.530
I think that,
you know,

888
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.240
you don't think about it cause you don't have to to think about it.
But if,

889
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:28.820
if it became a real issue and the government started putting massive amounts of

890
00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:32.810
resources to growing crops for all the country,
they'd put their funds into that.

891
00:51:32.811 --> 00:51:34.190
Halliburton gets behind it.

892
00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:38.210
They have giant government contracts to grow crops in a fucking crops growing

893
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:40.430
everywhere.
You know,
they would,
they would take a pipeline.

894
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.950
They can take a pipeline from Alaska,
right?
They can take oil.

895
00:51:42.951 --> 00:51:44.330
They bring it all the way down to Arkansas.

896
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.520
How come they can't do that with water?
Well,
they can.

897
00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.380
Of course they could if they wanted to do that.
I,

898
00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:52.340
I feel like the whole water thing is like,
there's gotta be a way,

899
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:55.460
there's gotta be a way to it,
right?
Eventually.
Yeah.

900
00:51:55.461 --> 00:51:57.080
We talked about that a couple of weeks ago.

901
00:51:57.081 --> 00:52:00.380
Apparently it's like stupid expensive and it's not that efficient yet.
Right.

902
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:01.610
But one day,
yeah.

903
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.670
Some someone's gonna figure out a way to do it in a way that makes sense.

904
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:06.840
They're going to make money off of it and it's,

905
00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.740
I don't think we're going to run out of food.
I think we're gonna run US space.

906
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.800
We're gonna run out of resources and we're going to run out of air,

907
00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.980
we're going to fuck the air up,
or that's gotta get shit.

908
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:21.250
You look at graphs of population and like from the time of of Jesus,

909
00:52:21.261 --> 00:52:22.790
or even before like the time of cavemen,

910
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:26.450
like there's been this like steady graph and then all of a sudden the industrial

911
00:52:26.451 --> 00:52:28.610
revolution happens and it's like spikes.

912
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:32.240
And like we have so many more people than we can handle.

913
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:37.420
There's gotta be something,
right?
I don't understand things,
but I feel like I,

914
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.740
you know,
I,
I'm not speaking out of any expertise,

915
00:52:39.741 --> 00:52:43.100
but something's going to happen,
right?
Well,
there's definitely a pattern,
right?

916
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:47.290
It's definitely a pattern of abuse and overuse and gluttony and you know,

917
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.600
pollution of the ocean,
pollution of the air.
But when they,

918
00:52:50.601 --> 00:52:52.670
if they figure it out and what is the depressing part?

919
00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:56.210
It's not because what I think when people have their back up against the wall,

920
00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.440
that's when they're forced to innovate.

921
00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:00.380
When they literally are forced like just like all these other things we've been

922
00:53:00.381 --> 00:53:00.831
talking about.

923
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:03.170
When you're forced to recognize the fact that we're running out of food,

924
00:53:03.171 --> 00:53:06.590
then the government figures out how to step and ensure the fact that people get

925
00:53:06.591 --> 00:53:10.910
food.
I think there's gonna come a point until there is no such thing as waste.

926
00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.390
The waste is going to equal energy and there'll be able to like,

927
00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:16.610
when is it right now if you take,

928
00:53:16.611 --> 00:53:21.500
there's new cars that are so good at emissions that when they're driving through

929
00:53:21.501 --> 00:53:23.630
a polluted area like they were driving through Mexico City,

930
00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.250
the air that comes out of the is actually

931
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:30.330
<v 2>cleaner than the air that goes in.
That's a fact.
Whoa.
Yeah.</v>

932
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.200
There's German cars that do that.
The Porsche nine 11 turbo.
In fact,

933
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:37.650
when you drive through Los Angeles,
if you're driving through downtown,

934
00:53:37.651 --> 00:53:40.020
it's thick with fucking stinky smog.

935
00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:45.000
The air coming out of the exhaust pipes is better to fucking breathe than the

936
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:49.590
air that it's taking in and it's intake.
Wow.
Yeah.
That's nuts.

937
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:53.250
So it's going to come a point in time where they could figure out how to use

938
00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:54.390
that shitty air,

939
00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:59.400
like use the carbon dioxide and the carbon monoxide in the air for fuel.

940
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:01.860
They just need to figure out how to extract it.

941
00:54:01.861 --> 00:54:05.460
Like right now what we're doing is like we have,
there's a two step process.

942
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:10.080
You know,
you make something and that like there's like a waste product,

943
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:13.980
but that waste product is,
it's really almost an engineering issue.

944
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.810
It's almost like once we innovate to a point where whatever that stuff is,

945
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:20.370
like with everything will be clear.

946
00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.730
Labeling renewable like nuclear waste or gasoline.
Like,
okay,

947
00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:27.480
here's a perfect example.
People that live by,
by airplanes,

948
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.190
anybody lives by airports,

949
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:33.720
significant amount of people suffer lung damage of lung disease,
asthma.

950
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:36.570
It's like pretty significant.
You should never live near an airport.

951
00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:39.210
Major airports especially,
well,
there's this,

952
00:54:39.211 --> 00:54:42.810
there's some shit that you're breathing in,
right?
But why is it out there?

953
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:47.830
How do you get it?
What it,
what is that stuff?
Is it flammable?
Is it,

954
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:51.630
can it be used as fuel?
How can it be extracted from the methane?
Right?

955
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:53.400
I Dunno what the fuck it is,
but there is methane,

956
00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:57.390
but that's what about dialogic about the fact that they're a cloud wifi waves

957
00:54:57.391 --> 00:55:00.170
and cellular waves all everywhere.
That's true.

958
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:05.100
There's like so much stuff that we,
it we create that is bad for us.

959
00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:06.780
Well,
that's not necessarily true.

960
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:09.990
I don't think they've ever proven that's why Wifi is bad for you or that

961
00:55:09.991 --> 00:55:13.170
cellular is bad for you.
It just feels bad.
It's bad for bugs.

962
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:18.000
It's really bad for bees.
Is it?
Yeah.
It's real bad for bees.
Bees.

963
00:55:18.001 --> 00:55:21.450
Apparently their communication system gets completely fucked up by Wifi,

964
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.520
Wifi and by cellular networks.

965
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:26.790
It's like they're hearing and next door neighbor that won't stop banging and it

966
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:30.210
never goes away.
I don't think they can live.
They can live,
but they're like,

967
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:34.580
ah.
Everywhere around them as people,
lol,
you know?
Fuck it.

968
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.780
<v 3>Yeah.
They just hear everything we're saying.
They probably don't just hear it.</v>

969
00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.420
They hear all the porn we're watching on the Internet.

970
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:43.280
They hear like everything through the airways.

971
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:46.890
<v 2>Can you send a text?
It's like,
ah,
she's</v>

972
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.460
flying in a row.
You ever go somewhere that has no cell phone?
No cell phone,

973
00:55:53.461 --> 00:55:57.830
no Wifi.
Oh yeah.
It feels so quiet.
It feels amazing.
Like,

974
00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.800
yeah cause Elan in the,
I've actually,
yeah,
only

975
00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.610
<v 3>in the last year I've made a point of being away from my phone like totally away</v>

976
00:56:03.611 --> 00:56:06.430
from my phone,
not just in the other room,
but like if I go on a hike,

977
00:56:06.431 --> 00:56:10.720
I leave the phone in the car.
Like,
because like we are never alone.

978
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:14.560
We're never like unreachable.
It's true.
Like even if you're alone,

979
00:56:14.561 --> 00:56:15.880
you're not alone because you're like,

980
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:19.090
Oh let me check out what friends are tweeting at me.

981
00:56:19.091 --> 00:56:22.570
She'd just turn it off though if you're going on a hike because then when a

982
00:56:22.571 --> 00:56:23.800
mountain going to be,

983
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.710
<v 5>but even if I turn it off,
I feel like I still have the option.</v>

984
00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:31.460
<v 1>I just want to be totally away from it and it feels great and then I get back</v>

985
00:56:31.461 --> 00:56:35.180
and I'm like,
Ooh,
I have like four emails.
You know what?
I know what you mean.

986
00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:38.060
Isn't it funny?
We're so scared to be away from my phone.

987
00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:40.230
Like something bad's going to happen.
Like,

988
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:43.400
how often do you actually need is a phone.
You know what's going to happen.

989
00:56:43.401 --> 00:56:47.540
So rarely do you actually need it to stay alive.
So rarely.

990
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:50.540
But like if you go on a hike,
you like pop better,
bring the fucking phone.

991
00:56:50.541 --> 00:56:54.620
Just foaming times hiked.
Yeah,
like a hundred times.
Nothing happens.

992
00:56:54.621 --> 00:56:59.030
You'd be fine.
I've never,
I've never been attacked on a hike.
Well,

993
00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.190
when I lived in Colorado,
I used to pack heat.
I used to walk Karen,

994
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:07.040
it would drive me crazy while I was walking in these mountain line infested

995
00:57:07.041 --> 00:57:11.120
woods.
Fuck that.
And even if they don't kill people all the time,

996
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:15.000
if you were there,
the one like the guy in Cupertino where his daughter got a,

997
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:18.410
or a son rather got attacked by mountain line.
If that guy had a gun,

998
00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:20.690
he could have shot it.
Not even at the animal,

999
00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:24.620
just shot it near the animal and that thing would run and you're done.
It's over.

1000
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:29.150
You know,
they hear a boom.
It fucking just take off.
Freaks him out.

1001
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:31.700
But how often does your kid get attacked by a mountain lion?

1002
00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:36.170
If you live in Cupertino and you're that guy and you're walking down that road

1003
00:57:36.171 --> 00:57:38.800
and it happens,
all those numbers are not comforting.
Yeah.

1004
00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:42.150
<v 5>It doesn't matter
guys.</v>

1005
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:46.050
Son has been attacked to wife is screaming,
why didn't you bring your gun?

1006
00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:50.910
How often does it
fucking happened?
It happens,

1007
00:57:50.911 --> 00:57:55.080
but I mean if gonna Chunk taken out of his ass forever,

1008
00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:59.280
he's going to be that boy in the locker room.
They make fun of,
you know,

1009
00:57:59.281 --> 00:58:03.450
those fake asses where they take the fat from other parts of their body and they

1010
00:58:03.451 --> 00:58:07.110
put it in the bud.
It started real.
Yeah,
it's real.
It started in a Columbia,

1011
00:58:07.111 --> 00:58:08.370
I believe,
or Brazil.

1012
00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.420
Most Colombians or Brazilians ha girls have that.
No,
it's,

1013
00:58:12.421 --> 00:58:16.890
that's how common is something pretty common.
More than half.
It's Pr.

1014
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:22.020
It's pretty cool.
So they take fat out of like,

1015
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.240
oops and Jamie,
you might even be able to find it,

1016
00:58:26.241 --> 00:58:28.710
but they take it out of their side and they put in there,
but,

1017
00:58:28.711 --> 00:58:32.910
but lately they've been noticing that the fat doesn't takes in,

1018
00:58:32.911 --> 00:58:36.780
it goes down their legs and it makes their ankles super fat.

1019
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:40.500
And so people in Columbia where these like,

1020
00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:45.000
like ugg boots type things are really popular because so many girls I've had

1021
00:58:45.001 --> 00:58:47.490
this problem,
it goes down to their ankles.
Yeah.

1022
00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:51.420
Like little kids site there but doesn't tense everything that he does.

1023
00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.240
Columbia Little Kids Angle,

1024
00:58:57.250 --> 00:59:01.550
<v 1>uh,
Columbia just by luck or whatever.</v>

1025
00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:04.430
So what I would just take,

1026
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:09.410
I know that they're doing fat translation to the buttocks and for steadily

1027
00:59:09.411 --> 00:59:14.060
enhancement.
If you Google anything,
you'll find it longterm results.

1028
00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:16.101
Wow.

1029
00:59:16.101 --> 00:59:21.101
The result of the buttock augmentation show that there are oh 0.5 1.0 centimeter

1030
00:59:22.251 --> 00:59:24.560
reduction at two months.
Oh,
okay.

1031
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:27.080
They're just talking about the efficacy conclusion.

1032
00:59:27.081 --> 00:59:30.770
The hypotheses is that fat applied graphs are real.

1033
00:59:30.771 --> 00:59:34.640
Graphs was demonstrated and not only the graphs real,

1034
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:39.790
but they are able to live and they persist with the patient's growing.

1035
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:45.041
If the patient gained weight to the glutes area and losing circumference when

1036
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:49.430
losing weight.
So what they're saying is it works.
They're saying that that fat,

1037
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:52.850
when you transplant it to the ass,
it does make your ass thicker and that,

1038
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:57.200
what are you doing?
What was that?
I'm reading it.
If,
fuck,
how dare you.

1039
00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:02.090
They're saying that it makes it that no damage to the graft was observed.

1040
01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:06.890
So they,
this,
they're saying that it's fine.
It works.
It's like skin graphs,

1041
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:11.270
but they actually can make your ass fatter and they can make another party.

1042
01:00:11.271 --> 01:00:15.620
You thinner man.
But it probably comes out all lumpy.
No,
I mean,
how are they,

1043
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:18.260
how do they get it all smooth and perfect?
I mean,

1044
01:00:18.261 --> 01:00:21.020
I'm sure there's a more of a process than just stuffing it in.

1045
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.700
I would assume they put it in a blender or something.

1046
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.770
They must like dilute it somehow.
Right?
I don't know man.
Well,

1047
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:30.410
they're injecting it.
Right.
So it's not where I want to have fun too.

1048
01:00:30.411 --> 01:00:34.030
Like look at,
um,
botched but enlargement surgery.

1049
01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.660
Whoa,
whoa.
Hello.
Holy Shit.
That works.

1050
01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.420
That's incredible and cool.

1051
01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.290
But Oh my God,
look at that.
But with the Thong,
well,

1052
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:49.700
there's no difference the same,

1053
01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:52.460
but while there's a lot of bullshit with these things for sure,

1054
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:56.360
but augmentation and [inaudible].
Great.
Well let's go to that page.

1055
01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:57.710
Let's find out what they do.
Also,

1056
01:00:57.711 --> 01:01:02.210
one of them's like more in polar and Paige not image.
There you go.

1057
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:07.970
Um,
the,
um,
the,
the,
the ones where they have implants though,

1058
01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:12.050
that's scary.
That's where they're taking like a hunk of something,

1059
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:16.010
like a fucking,
some sort of a,
it's like a,

1060
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.550
it's like a rubber thing and they're sticking it in there.

1061
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.700
Isn't it crazy that no matter what context,
when I see a nice bud,

1062
01:01:22.701 --> 01:01:24.800
I don't even see the whose face it is.

1063
01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:29.120
I'm just like instantly a little bit turned on like you just see a bigger,

1064
01:01:29.121 --> 01:01:34.010
but why?
Why is that?
Does anyone ever,
because it's like more better for children,

1065
01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:38.720
especially the hips to waist ratio.
When you see a woman with a wide hips,

1066
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:41.870
you think,
oh,
I was just thinking immediately like,
oh,
okay.

1067
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.840
We strongly advise against surgical butt implants.

1068
01:01:44.841 --> 01:01:48.800
If your office work environment requires excessive sitting over eight to 10

1069
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:50.060
hours a day after surgery,

1070
01:01:50.061 --> 01:01:55.061
the doctors will advise you not to sit directly in your reshaped but for at

1071
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:58.970
least a few days to avoid any unneeded stress to the operated areas during your

1072
01:01:58.971 --> 01:02:03.950
recovery.
Yeah.
What the fuck,
man.
I like Peggy and HR can't get it done.
Yeah.

1073
01:02:03.951 --> 01:02:05.840
If you're going to sit in front of a desk,

1074
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:10.430
if you've seen the implants that have failed,

1075
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:15.050
now what those implants are talking about,
Jamie,
this is fat.
No,
this is,
yeah,

1076
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:18.460
this is an implants.
I think it's silicone,
right?
Or selling homes,

1077
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.060
but versus fat transfers.
Here you go.

1078
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:25.140
If your butt area has began sagging a bit and you're slightly older than age

1079
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:28.560
than a surgical lift will probably be the most appropriate surgical.

1080
01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:32.340
But lift and Thailand is performed by removing fat tissue followed by the

1081
01:02:32.341 --> 01:02:34.110
tightening of the surrounding skin,

1082
01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:38.970
the tissue in your buttocks as normally excised.
I love that.
Slashed cut.

1083
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:44.870
That's the same thing and that's like punched slash hit near the blood crease to

1084
01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:48.780
give a natural look with minimal scars.
This amazing new technique.

1085
01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:52.530
Lee's an unknown.
Possible scar.
Knew your buttocks crease.
Yeah.
That's noticeable.

1086
01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:56.400
It's fuck.
You see it in porn films when girls are getting diaried.
Yeah.

1087
01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:59.280
You see this weird scar where their butt cheeks meet their tank.

1088
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.173
I've never seen it.

1089
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.100
It technique is very popular with Australian and American clients who save 40%

1090
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:07.050
when compared to the prices back home.

1091
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:10.410
But you get 100% more diseases.

1092
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.740
The new technique is offered in Bangkok and works by carefully sawing away,

1093
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:20.700
no cutting away tissue near the intersection of your button lower back.

1094
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:24.900
I mean,
you know,
it feels like a decent thing to do.

1095
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:29.430
This is supposedly what a Kim Kardashian guide she got the Brazilian butt lift

1096
01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:29.581
is,

1097
01:03:29.581 --> 01:03:32.430
which is what all the Brazilian girls supposedly have is why you always go and

1098
01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.160
Brazilians have great ass.
No,
this is,
I mean that's been confirmed,
right?

1099
01:03:35.161 --> 01:03:36.900
She has something and so it was Nicki Minaj,

1100
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:38.860
she looks way different than she used to live.

1101
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.260
They live with her but you're still looked like and she also doesn't look like

1102
01:03:43.261 --> 01:03:47.550
that.
Like,
like she would have that muscular legs.
Like it's not like she's,

1103
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.760
her legs are these thick fucking like a Serena Williams type athlete legs.

1104
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.480
No,
no.
They're like,
she's got a big old,
oh Geez Louise.
Good Lord.

1105
01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:01.330
Oh my goodness.
That's a blue day.
But that's an athlete's.

1106
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:03.980
But like you look at Serena's body like Jesus,

1107
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:06.630
that's how fucking that's a performer.
You know,
like her,

1108
01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:09.180
her body can move and ways.

1109
01:04:09.181 --> 01:04:13.500
Kim Kardashians just looks like she's wearing a diaper.
Like just weird.

1110
01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:16.500
You know what I mean?
It's like this red stitch.
It's got a load.

1111
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:19.530
It doesn't make sense.
It doesn't make sense with their legs.

1112
01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.590
Well there's some images of her like,

1113
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:24.870
like you see those photos like Kim Kardashians breaks the Internet.

1114
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.390
Her ass looks fantastic,
like spectacular.

1115
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.780
But then you see here like there's some red carpet video of her walking around

1116
01:04:30.781 --> 01:04:34.350
with it.
Here.
It's weird as fuck cause it doesn't match the rest of her legs.

1117
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:37.710
Like it's way better to have a smaller,

1118
01:04:37.711 --> 01:04:42.270
but that fits your legs than it is to have these thin legs.
In this,

1119
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.560
I actually have the opposite.
I don't have a butt like I have any,

1120
01:04:46.561 --> 01:04:50.370
but I'm making us look at your,
but I'm not having any,
I don't have,
yeah,

1121
01:04:50.371 --> 01:04:53.580
I don't really have a,
but should I show,
I mean it's like,

1122
01:04:57.290 --> 01:05:00.720
well it just looks like you don't work out.
You don't work out.
Right.

1123
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.790
Do you lift weights with your,
but yeah.
Do you have a seat and it all,

1124
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:12.450
does it,
um,
don't like when you're,
um,
when you're lifting weights,

1125
01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:15.870
do you do squats or anything with your legs?
No,
I shut it all it is,

1126
01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:20.620
but I do a lot of like,
like curls for the girls running and crossings.

1127
01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.580
But running is really good for your legs but it's not so good or bad.

1128
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.390
But like if you watch marathon runners,
they're in,
they don't have like fitbits.

1129
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.850
It's just not a lot of like jumping up.

1130
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.620
I know I've always had an issue with that.

1131
01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:36.400
There's always like pants don't fit right.
It would slide down,
you can fix it.

1132
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.280
Don't get lazy and get a butt job.
It's getting batch jobs together.

1133
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:43.490
That's the boy's Day.

1134
01:05:45.830 --> 01:05:50.110
You imagine that became a thing
but it played,

1135
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.580
they would take off her and little,
you know,

1136
01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:55.030
fat things here and so it would actually look better here and then it would make

1137
01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:56.450
her look together at the same time.

1138
01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:59.830
You would be so self conscious on stage cause it looks like you're wearing a

1139
01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:03.250
fucking diaper.
It looks like you like imagine I just got a huge,

1140
01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:07.090
but oh my God,
if butts on guys became big,

1141
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:12.070
he tied the end of your shorts tight to your leg and just filled your shorts

1142
01:06:12.071 --> 01:06:15.670
with shit.
And that's what it looks like.
But I have no jokes about it.

1143
01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:18.820
It's just a huge,
but you don't even bring it up.

1144
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:23.650
I had a friend that had a huge ass and he was massively self conscious about it

1145
01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:27.700
because he wasn't overweight too much in his upper body.
He was very pear shaped.

1146
01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:32.410
Whereas upper bottle use arms look totally normal and then there's upper body

1147
01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:37.411
look fairly overweight and then it got to his gut and it distended on the sides.

1148
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:39.610
And then his ass was enormous.

1149
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.100
His ass and legs where he carried all of his weight.

1150
01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:45.490
So people who look like you know,
and when you get in arguments to people,

1151
01:06:45.491 --> 01:06:48.900
they'll go look at your fucking ass dude.
Like I,
if I would look like you,

1152
01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:51.640
I would be grumpy too.
Like people would get really mean with him because of his,

1153
01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:56.620
but that's what I think.
You know there's certain guys who look okay fat,

1154
01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.440
you know like there's certain guys that are like,
oh you're a fat guy,

1155
01:06:59.441 --> 01:07:01.600
you look great fat.
And then there's some guys that look really,

1156
01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:03.760
really bad fat and I think it's,
if you're,

1157
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:08.790
if your lower half is in shape and your upper half is not like Jonah Hill has

1158
01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:12.880
that I have that.
If I'm like I used to be way fatter like,

1159
01:07:12.881 --> 01:07:14.230
and it looks weird because my,

1160
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:18.670
I have skinny legs and then you then it looks like you just heard this like half

1161
01:07:18.671 --> 01:07:23.080
fat Minotaur where people are allowed to have a fat gut.

1162
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.320
But if you have like a fairly normal guy but an enormous fat ass and fat pigs

1163
01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:31.740
and people like what the fuck?
Like yeah,

1164
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:36.700
you're weirdly proportioned and I don't understand you because you don't fit in

1165
01:07:36.701 --> 01:07:40.720
my database.
Yeah.
Like we have a database of pot bellies.

1166
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:42.140
Like you see a guy with a pot belly,

1167
01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:45.790
you don't even blink because we all have a database.
It's not like a weird thing,

1168
01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:49.120
but if you see a girl with a pot belly,
you want to protect things,

1169
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:53.800
either pregnant or a fucking weird body.
When the weird body freaks you out.

1170
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:57.490
Like even if you have no desire to have sex with this woman,

1171
01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:01.550
if a woman comes near you and she's got a giant Joey Diaz sides belly,

1172
01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.160
you're kind of freaked out.
But his body makes sense.
It makes sense on his body.

1173
01:08:06.161 --> 01:08:09.160
Like you look at it and you're like,
Oh,
you're that guy.
I know that guy.

1174
01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.370
My Dad has hung out with that guy.
You know,
this is a database.

1175
01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.460
This is the face of that guy.
But if you have a guy that has like really

1176
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:20.420
<v 3>skinny legs,
like super skinny legs,
but like Ralphie May's arms.
Yeah,</v>

1177
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:24.980
it's really weird.
What the fuck is going on?
I don't understand what I'm saying.

1178
01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:28.460
I gotta get Outta here.
I'm too weirded out.
I gotta get Outta here,
man.
Yeah,

1179
01:08:28.461 --> 01:08:32.660
like chess night is over.
New Weird bodies will freak us out.

1180
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.210
Like things like we have like a database withdraw from it and when,

1181
01:08:37.211 --> 01:08:40.460
when when something doesn't fit in there,
it's just like up to weird.
Got to go.

1182
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.850
I turned down sex ones because this girl had a square,

1183
01:08:43.851 --> 01:08:47.620
but where it was like kind of burned down sex because of it.
Yeah,

1184
01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.760
because it just freaked me.
I don't,
you know,

1185
01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:53.570
it freaked me out because she had no waste for one thing and then her butt was

1186
01:08:53.571 --> 01:08:57.950
completely flat,
almost indented that.
It's just when you saw it you're just like,

1187
01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.900
ah.
So you were like on top.

1188
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:05.010
I actually would was like,
all right,
well you know what?
I got to go.

1189
01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:07.100
I just took off right before bed.

1190
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:11.420
I could never go and I caught her sponge Bob Square pants because I think it was

1191
01:09:11.421 --> 01:09:15.190
just,
it was too gross and call it tour face.
No,
no,
I just put it on.

1192
01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:18.500
He just tweeted about it up.
Just put it on her face with her full name.

1193
01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.250
I just gave out her address.
Geo tagged it.

1194
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:27.680
If you're looking for a flat,
this is your spot.
This is your pirate map.

1195
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.820
I feel like if I'm already there,
I mean it's like,

1196
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:35.200
it's so great that someone's willing to be there and do it.

1197
01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:39.810
And then weird that like,
it probably would feel just as good,
like the,

1198
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:41.240
as far as the sensation,

1199
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:44.510
but you wouldn't be as a rouse so it wouldn't be as good.

1200
01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:46.610
And it's all just based on the shape of the body.

1201
01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.300
And people get angry at that man.
They say you're shallow and you know,

1202
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.770
this is a really like surface way of thinking.
It's so immature and so stupid,

1203
01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:59.420
but those people are all fat.
That's why they're saying that hot chicks,

1204
01:09:59.421 --> 01:10:02.990
a great bodies,
they never,
they never feel like that.
When you tell a girl like,

1205
01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:06.800
God,
your body is amazing.
They never go,
oh,
you just are attracted to,

1206
01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:11.090
I got to say the hazing.
I gotta be the devil's advocate here.
And I gotta say,

1207
01:10:11.091 --> 01:10:13.250
I've,
I've been with,
look,
I've been with a lot of one

1208
01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.890
double digit double digit women.
Um,

1209
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.590
and uh,
I've been with some,
you know,

1210
01:10:21.591 --> 01:10:24.890
like very good looking and some very average and,
you know,
whatever.

1211
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:29.950
I think I've actually been more aroused by more normal looking women.

1212
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.230
Then later you'll probably more models cause I'm more comfortable.

1213
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:37.640
I feel like I have less to prove.
Right.
Like there's like,
it's also like there's,

1214
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:42.500
there's something about like a normal looking body that is a little more

1215
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:45.200
attractive to me.
You have a buddy who would go to strip clubs,

1216
01:10:45.201 --> 01:10:48.140
new to always want to like talk to the girls that were overweight like that.

1217
01:10:48.141 --> 01:10:50.840
What he was actually tracking overweight.
I mean,
you know,

1218
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:54.320
well overweight for a strip club is know for sure.
But yeah,

1219
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:56.720
I mean what kind of overweighted they're going to get like 2030 pounds

1220
01:10:56.721 --> 01:11:00.260
overweight.
But he would go for the big girls because they're easy.

1221
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:04.040
But he wasn't even trying to like have sex with him.

1222
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:07.010
He just was attracted to that and he'd want to get dancers stem because he said

1223
01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:10.410
it would make sense that they would date him.
Oh yeah.
That's what you want.

1224
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.950
That's what every guy wants to strip clubs.
You want,
you want girl to like you.

1225
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.490
Yeah.
Any guy who denies that is lying.
Like you want the girl to be like,

1226
01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.630
you know,
oh my God,
I want to leave with him.
She's a 10 she's like,
oh,
hi sweetie.

1227
01:11:21.631 --> 01:11:26.610
Yeah,
it's all,
it's all of that.
So fucking gross.

1228
01:11:26.611 --> 01:11:30.480
I want her to be in love.
I wonder to come back please.
Barry,

1229
01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.830
are you going to be wanting to take her out of that town?

1230
01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.790
Peri Peri telling me you want to take her out of Kokomo,
Indiana.

1231
01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:40.980
Give you dances for free.
Oh yeah.
Just stay bearing.
I'll stay.

1232
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.180
Stay Joe Rogan.
Yeah.
They don't want you to,

1233
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:48.570
they don't want you to like no guy.

1234
01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:53.520
Like even though people will pay for prostitution,
no guy would prefer that.
What?

1235
01:11:53.521 --> 01:11:55.500
You would prefer someone to be attracted to you.

1236
01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.330
You wouldn't want a girl who was putting on an act where you know specifically

1237
01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:04.140
that she doesn't want to be there.
You'd want her to be really good salmon porno.

1238
01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:06.890
Like you don't want a girl who you know is acting well.

1239
01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:10.320
That's why we were things that are so rude.
Unless they're so good,

1240
01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:13.360
they can trick you.
That's great.
Yeah.
But you don't want to see the eye.

1241
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.310
You don't want to see the act

1242
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:19.110
comic or like a fucking magician where you could see their hands moving,

1243
01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:20.310
you know?
Yeah.

1244
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:23.640
You're getting a different girl every time and you can play around with

1245
01:12:23.641 --> 01:12:27.930
different races and ages and,
yeah.
What I'm saying is if,

1246
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:32.180
what would you prefer though?
That's not what I'm saying.
Well,

1247
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.250
I mean let's engineer 30,

1248
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:38.530
or do you want one car or would you rather have keys to the dealership and he

1249
01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:40.440
just,
just pick whatever you want.
No,
it's not.

1250
01:12:40.441 --> 01:12:44.160
We're talking about people you fuck.
Oh my God.

1251
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.560
Yeah.
I Dunno.
I,
I got,
um,
a prostitute when I was,
I mean,
this is,

1252
01:12:49.561 --> 01:12:53.940
I'm going to be on Ra Shell and I talk about this story when I was in Atlantic

1253
01:12:53.941 --> 01:12:58.920
city and I got a hooker hooker's from Atlantic city show.
No.

1254
01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:02.830
Is it an HBO?
Yeah.
At least do an HBO show.
Those were so depressing.
Ooh,

1255
01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:05.970
I remember trying to masturbate to those when I was a kid.
I'm not real.

1256
01:13:05.971 --> 01:13:10.530
Sex would come on very real sex and it would be like just old people tickling

1257
01:13:10.531 --> 01:13:14.640
each other and you're just like,
what?
Like for a second there would be like,
oh,

1258
01:13:14.641 --> 01:13:15.540
this is kinda hot.

1259
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:19.770
And then they would just have these like fat lesbians slapping each other and

1260
01:13:19.771 --> 01:13:22.280
you're like,
this is really weird.
Do you think that if,

1261
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:27.240
if prostitution wasn't so chastise with prostitution was legal,

1262
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:30.660
then it would be like going and getting massages?

1263
01:13:30.661 --> 01:13:34.230
It would be so normal and it wouldn't feel dirty or bad at all.
I bet.

1264
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:38.550
I bet that's,
if it was legal,
prostitution was completely legal.
Okay.

1265
01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:40.290
And these places were totally above ground.

1266
01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:43.560
It was just like going to a massage parlor.
If you go to a massage parlor,

1267
01:13:43.561 --> 01:13:46.020
now you go,
hello.
Everybody's greets you.
They're all nice.

1268
01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:48.600
You don't feel weird about it.
You put on your robe,
you go there,

1269
01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:51.210
some stranger rubs your neck and rubs your back.

1270
01:13:51.211 --> 01:13:54.530
You feel so much better and you actually have a wonderful time with them.
It's,

1271
01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:56.850
it's,
it's fine because it's not guilty.

1272
01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:00.660
But if it was guilty for you to be in your underwear and have some lady dig or

1273
01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:01.950
elbow,
elbow into your back,

1274
01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:05.190
you'd have all these weird connections with it would only be able to go to shady

1275
01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:08.330
places to get that massage.
It would be like this Weirdo.

1276
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.250
I don't think it has anything to do with the law.
I think the law

1277
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.710
<v 1>has nothing to do with it.
I think it's our weirdness with sex.</v>

1278
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.720
I think it's right.
Right,
but,
but that weirdness was,

1279
01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:19.410
sex is connected to the fact that it's illegal on how channel.

1280
01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:22.420
Because then you're,
then you would say like,
oh,
what if you know,

1281
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:25.300
I didn't have to pay for it.
What if I told my girlfriend,
oh,
you know,

1282
01:14:25.301 --> 01:14:26.740
I'm just going to have sex with this girl.

1283
01:14:26.741 --> 01:14:31.090
I know that's totally unrelated because we're talking about you're paying for a

1284
01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:33.940
service for something.
Yeah,
we're talking about prostitution now.
I know,

1285
01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:37.780
but I think it's the stigma of the sex of it.
Not The law,

1286
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:42.730
because it's not really like,
no,
I don't think it's considered like,
you know,

1287
01:14:42.731 --> 01:14:44.410
you don't feel like you're breaking out.

1288
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:47.560
What of you think you're using masturbation,

1289
01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:50.740
you're using her to masturbate though.
You're not like you're not having sex.

1290
01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.960
I mean,
you're in and out in like seven minutes.

1291
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.810
Explain that again so that you don't think it's about,

1292
01:14:55.811 --> 01:15:00.070
so you're saying that if it was legal that it would remove some of the stigma

1293
01:15:00.071 --> 01:15:02.420
attached to it.
The stigma by who though?
Well,

1294
01:15:02.421 --> 01:15:06.820
buy most people who think of it as being a dirty thing.
I mean most people,

1295
01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:08.920
they don't want their daughter to become a prostitute.

1296
01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:11.560
They don't want their ex girlfriends to become prostitutes.
They don't,

1297
01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.130
I mean it's just like this thing.
You don't want to be stripping angle,

1298
01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.460
but there's a stigma to that.
There is.
There is.
There's certainly is.

1299
01:15:18.461 --> 01:15:19.294
But this is like,

1300
01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:22.300
I think it's because we're living in this country where weirder about sex than

1301
01:15:22.301 --> 01:15:23.590
we are about anything and no question,

1302
01:15:23.591 --> 01:15:26.380
but don't you think that part of that weirdness is to do with the law?

1303
01:15:26.650 --> 01:15:31.650
The fact that we legislate whether or not you can hardly eat and no one has a

1304
01:15:32.201 --> 01:15:34.660
problem with it.
You can go have sex with anybody you want,

1305
01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:38.800
but for some reason other we can legislate whether or not you have sex with

1306
01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:43.780
anybody you want.
If they give you money,
which is crazy.
I mean,
it's crazy.
Yeah.

1307
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.970
I mean it is crazy.
Yeah.
There's a lot of crazy,
I think,

1308
01:15:45.971 --> 01:15:49.210
I'm not saying that gambling is illegal is crazy,
too crazy,
ridiculous.

1309
01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:54.280
I'm not saying people should,
you know,
go get proud.
Salad should be prostitutes,

1310
01:15:54.281 --> 01:15:58.060
but you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do.
Well,

1311
01:15:58.061 --> 01:15:59.590
you know what's crazy about it?
He's like,

1312
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:04.840
how open we are about calling them escorts were just like,
that's fine.

1313
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:08.110
Well,
they get like you go into the yellow pages,
even not even in Vegas,

1314
01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:11.440
like places where it's totally like in New York and there's just escort service,

1315
01:16:11.441 --> 01:16:12.370
escort service.

1316
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:16.540
Like who is really under the impression that they're not having sex?
Yeah.

1317
01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.980
There's a few people that don't like this weird legal gray area are there?
Yeah,

1318
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:23.350
there's like every,
it's like every cop,

1319
01:16:23.351 --> 01:16:26.650
every one who makes the law just like fine.
Well,

1320
01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:30.730
there's some weird thing where they're allowed to go out with you and have sex

1321
01:16:30.731 --> 01:16:34.270
if they choose to.
But if it says,

1322
01:16:34.271 --> 01:16:37.570
if it's like written down in paper,
at the end of this date,

1323
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:41.380
I'm going to Suck Your Dad Kinda and I'm going to rub your balls,
which is nuts.

1324
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:42.670
It's crazy.
Well,

1325
01:16:42.671 --> 01:16:45.880
it's just stupid that you could tell a person what to do and not to do.

1326
01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.180
And the idea of beings that if it's legal,

1327
01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.020
like everybody's going to go into prostitution or everyone's going to go get

1328
01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:56.410
prostitutes and the marriages will crumble.
And that's not true.

1329
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.920
If you look at statistics in Australian,
it's legal,

1330
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:03.070
like legalized prostitution is actually led to a lower rate of divorce in

1331
01:17:03.071 --> 01:17:06.730
Australia.
Yeah,
well it's legal in some places here,
right?

1332
01:17:06.731 --> 01:17:10.000
Sort of one area in Carson city.
Yeah.

1333
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.250
It's like way the fuck out in the middle of nowhere.
Not Pretty hypocritical.

1334
01:17:13.251 --> 01:17:16.820
Right.
It's weird.
It's just weird telling people what they can do.
You know what?

1335
01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.510
I think a lot of it is to a politician would never stand behind changing that

1336
01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:22.700
law.
Like I think everyone thinks it's kinda crazy.

1337
01:17:22.701 --> 01:17:24.560
But I don't think to get a politician to be like,

1338
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:28.400
I'm fighting for prostitute rights.
They all use them.
Who's going to do that?

1339
01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:32.510
Well,
that's one of the issues with that guy in New York.
Um,
the,

1340
01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:35.780
the guy who was the mayor of New York or the governor of New York,

1341
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:39.800
and they found out that he was using prostitutes,
Spitzer,
Eliot Spitzer.

1342
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:41.600
He was the fucking governor.

1343
01:17:41.601 --> 01:17:46.601
He was busting people for prostitution while he was using prostitutes.

1344
01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:51.200
I mean,
he's just,
he's a God damn target.
But that guy,
like,

1345
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.101
you know,
I mean,

1346
01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:56.510
he was the top of the heap as far as politicians in New York state and he was

1347
01:17:56.511 --> 01:17:59.580
using prostitute.
Yeah.
I mean,
is that,
I mean,

1348
01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:03.200
I'm speaking most of them out and say,
look,
let's get real with this.
He couldn't,

1349
01:18:03.201 --> 01:18:06.670
yeah.
Line would stand behind that.
Who was with me,
crickets,
crickets.

1350
01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.590
Because he just comes out and tries it.

1351
01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:15.060
<v 5>I mean,
there's a place that my buddy told me about in,
uh,</v>

1352
01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:17.140
in Seattle,
let's say Seattle,
he just went,

1353
01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:21.590
that is a marijuana store on one side.
And on the other side,

1354
01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:26.120
it's just a whorehouse and it's,
you can go in with your Visa Card,
get your weed,

1355
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:31.040
get your pussy,
and God bless America in an hour,
45 minutes.
God bless America.

1356
01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:31.993
That's how it should

1357
01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.900
<v 2>did.
You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

1358
01:18:33.901 --> 01:18:36.150
Like there's a law that they're passing in some state,

1359
01:18:36.151 --> 01:18:38.200
I forgot some backwards as state where they're,

1360
01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:42.900
they're going to make certain tattoos and body piercings illegal.

1361
01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:46.780
Like they're going to be able to decide for what reasons.
Exactly.
They're just,

1362
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:47.623
it's

1363
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:49.720
<v 1>thanks.
Have a reason.
Like I once had an argument,</v>

1364
01:18:49.721 --> 01:18:52.210
someone over like seat belt laws,
right?
Should you,

1365
01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:55.900
should you be allowed to wear a seatbelt if you want to or not want to?
Right,

1366
01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:59.560
right.
But then you,
you,
you think if people get injured all the time,

1367
01:18:59.561 --> 01:19:01.750
you're dealing with higher health insurance costs.

1368
01:19:01.751 --> 01:19:06.600
You're dealing with way more flooded hospitals with car accidents and deaths.

1369
01:19:06.610 --> 01:19:08.620
Less dumb people,
more dumb people dead.

1370
01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:12.520
Other people will suffer from you being dumb.
Whereas a tattoo,

1371
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:14.050
no one else will suffer from that.

1372
01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:16.940
<v 2>Yeah.
I don't know what the fucking logic behind it is.</v>

1373
01:19:16.941 --> 01:19:19.850
I think it's just they want to change the appearance of the young folks.

1374
01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.910
They see these kids with these giants,
your holes,
that's what it is.
You know,

1375
01:19:22.911 --> 01:19:26.330
it freaks them out.
Each kids these days is can't live and let live,

1376
01:19:26.331 --> 01:19:29.410
and a lot of older people especially,
they don't want to live and let live.

1377
01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:31.040
They want everybody to be just like them.

1378
01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:35.950
And when the fucking God damn kids not spiky hearings and they're crazy hair and

1379
01:19:35.951 --> 01:19:40.040
he'd just get upset and you want to stop face tattoos,
like who you know,
come on,

1380
01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:44.600
you can't.
They,
it's,
it's not a good thing to do,
but you can't.
You can't stop it.

1381
01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:47.270
You know?
It's not good to tattoo stars all over your fucking forehead,

1382
01:19:47.271 --> 01:19:50.600
but if you want to do it,
that's your thing.
Go ahead and do it.

1383
01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.480
You can't stop people from doing what they want to do because it's not,

1384
01:19:53.481 --> 01:19:55.250
you're right.
They might like it.

1385
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:59.180
They might see the world that totally legitimately differently than you do and

1386
01:19:59.181 --> 01:20:03.080
they might want to look like that lizard man do split his tongue and tattooed

1387
01:20:03.081 --> 01:20:06.740
his face.
Green had implants,
dermal implants and his eyebrows.

1388
01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.050
He's getting somebody to

1389
01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:11.550
<v 1>the show.
I met him,
he was in front row and the audience in Austin,</v>

1390
01:20:11.551 --> 01:20:14.790
Texas and one of my shows and I was like,
how much attention do you want,
man,

1391
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:18.420
you sit in front row and he looked like a fucking lizard person.
He didn't,

1392
01:20:18.421 --> 01:20:21.270
he didn't.
He get arrested for it.
Oh,
that's a different guy.

1393
01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:25.870
I think he got his eye.
There's a guy who got his eyeballs tattooed black who?

1394
01:20:26.050 --> 01:20:29.850
Who recently got arrested for assault.
Oh God.
Yeah.

1395
01:20:29.851 --> 01:20:31.650
Good luck convincing the jury that you're cool.

1396
01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:37.370
The ear thing pisses me off when girls have their ears stretched out.
I met,
yeah,

1397
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:40.620
I met this girl and in Vegas that beautiful,

1398
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:45.270
but then her ears were that big open like where she had the big plug in the

1399
01:20:45.271 --> 01:20:49.200
middle of it and you know that girl and 20 years is not going to have that inner

1400
01:20:49.201 --> 01:20:52.740
ear.
You can fix it.
Can you fix it?
Tied in a knot,
cut that,

1401
01:20:52.741 --> 01:20:56.640
cut a section off it off,
and they put together and they sell it.

1402
01:20:56.641 --> 01:21:01.310
And you'll have scars in the bottom of your ear.
Labioplasty on your ears.
Right,

1403
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.000
exactly what it's like.
Yeah.
It's like,
yeah,
it's not a fix it.
They can,
I mean,

1404
01:21:06.001 --> 01:21:10.920
it doesn't look good,
but it won't look unbelievably freakish.
Yeah,

1405
01:21:10.921 --> 01:21:13.920
you could,
you could correct most things,
right,
that you can correct,

1406
01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:15.870
but there's a dude that I know he's got,

1407
01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:20.010
his shit is like this big and he does Jujitsu,
so he's got a tape his ears up.

1408
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:23.190
William does Jujitsu.
Hundreds.
It takes the plug out and then he tapes.

1409
01:21:23.191 --> 01:21:26.430
He puts tape on his ears.
Yeah,
it's nuts.

1410
01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.040
It's just people are weird with those things,
man.

1411
01:21:32.041 --> 01:21:34.860
But you can't stop them from doing it.
They like it.

1412
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:37.420
What do you gear if you don't like it,
don't do it to yourself.

1413
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:41.170
See that passing a law that prevents passed.
It's passed.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1414
01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:44.250
It's past this.
Uh,
hold on,
let me,
let me find it.
You know,

1415
01:21:44.251 --> 01:21:47.820
in Europe there's like a lot of laws.
There's laws with naming kids.

1416
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:51.840
You can't name a kid anything you want and not the certain England.

1417
01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:55.670
There's a law that makes you,
um,
makes you,

1418
01:21:55.671 --> 01:22:00.390
you have to practice archery for two hours every Sunday.
It's like on the books,

1419
01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.100
like every male has to pray.

1420
01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:04.720
It's like one of those laws has been there since like the 16 hundreds.

1421
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.920
Everyone's dying of arrows to the head.
Yeah.
It's in,

1422
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:11.720
it's in Pennsylvania apparently that this uh,
this legislation,
yeah.

1423
01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:16.620
There's laws in New York of dancing is illegal in certain blocks.
Gll Really?

1424
01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:20.930
Yeah.
There's areas where you can't dance dance from like the 1800,

1425
01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:25.360
some sort of crazy law.
Footloose can't be gay.
There's a lot of areas of can't.

1426
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:29.490
It's illegal to be gay.
I have gay sex.
Yeah.
That's sodomy illegal.

1427
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:33.930
It's blowjobs are illegal in a lot of states.
Yeah.
There's a,

1428
01:22:33.931 --> 01:22:36.090
I'm trying to find this fucking legislation.
It's,

1429
01:22:36.091 --> 01:22:38.610
I'm looking under the wrong date because this is all,
uh,

1430
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:43.170
in 2012 at some new one because I just tweeted a few days ago,

1431
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:46.170
see if you can find that shit,
Jamie.
I don't know where it is,

1432
01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:49.110
but the idea of anybody telling you,

1433
01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:54.120
you know you can't wear those pants.
You can't do that to your hair.

1434
01:22:54.121 --> 01:22:56.100
You can't do that to your nose.

1435
01:22:56.430 --> 01:23:00.600
I saw a picture of a guy who had the tip of his nose removed.
Have you seen that?

1436
01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:04.280
That's a new thing.
Those extreme body modification guys are doing.
Yeah.

1437
01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:08.440
Have you seen it?
I have,
yeah.
Fuck.
I've seen the forehead.
Donuts.

1438
01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:12.250
People get those huge foreheads,
but they can get that taken off.

1439
01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:15.940
They can get your news,
your nose put back,
but then when they do that,

1440
01:23:15.941 --> 01:23:17.680
they cut your fucking scalp open.

1441
01:23:17.681 --> 01:23:21.790
Slide that thing down your fucking head and leave that big horseshoe in the

1442
01:23:21.791 --> 01:23:23.650
center.
It's awesome.
They must get so much.

1443
01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:29.080
It's probably get a lot of Dick Dick with holes in it.
Barbs and stuff.

1444
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:30.850
He got a lot of like those,

1445
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.110
those dicks with dudes like they put those bolts and their dicks.
Yeah,

1446
01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:38.860
they have like piercings all over their Cox.
My friend had a,

1447
01:23:38.861 --> 01:23:42.520
he got a shitty lip job where they're supposed to pierce it,

1448
01:23:42.521 --> 01:23:46.300
like underneath all the shitty live jobs by the way.
Yeah.

1449
01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:50.170
But anytime he sneezes it just squirts out like a fire hose out of his mouth.

1450
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:54.670
My God,
no.
Yeah,
there's like ones,

1451
01:23:54.671 --> 01:23:57.630
but they removed pieces of their cheek.
You can see in their mind

1452
01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:04.540
they put a hole in there as a whole more and more and more until it becomes like

1453
01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:08.050
you could literally look in and see their gums and their teeth.
It's horrific.

1454
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:10.990
I think people have mental illnesses and you know,

1455
01:24:10.991 --> 01:24:15.970
it just manifests in different ways.
Body dysmorphia is real shit,
man.

1456
01:24:15.971 --> 01:24:18.030
It's like those crazy women that never think there.

1457
01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:21.760
Of course breasts are big enough,
they get nuts like they can,

1458
01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:24.880
they can't see it and they just want a bigger and bigger and bigger,

1459
01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:29.620
but that's what they want.
Who Cares?
They're probably crazy anyway.

1460
01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.980
You know,
if you,
I wouldn't want to hang out with them,

1461
01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:35.980
but if you want to and you want to go do it,
who gives a shit?

1462
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:39.520
It doesn't hurt anyone else.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's weird.
It's weird.

1463
01:24:39.521 --> 01:24:42.850
All the choices that people make,
you know,
people are strange,

1464
01:24:42.851 --> 01:24:47.680
like stylistic choices.
People are very strange,
but when people try to life,

1465
01:24:47.681 --> 01:24:50.290
great.
Yeah.
When people try to legislate against that,

1466
01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:54.730
create laws that say anything like did they could easily make a law that say no

1467
01:24:54.731 --> 01:24:56.980
more massage.
You know,
if someone,

1468
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:59.550
if someone decided to make a law that says no more massage,

1469
01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:03.940
I would be fucking God damn furious.
Especially colleges are,
are incredible.

1470
01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:06.970
I've only started getting them recently and they're like,
it's mass.

1471
01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:10.270
This world makes you feel so much better.
Just relaxes you.

1472
01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:13.630
Loosens all your muscles up.
Everything falls into place better.

1473
01:25:13.631 --> 01:25:16.420
You feel healthier,
less stressed out.
Yeah.

1474
01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:19.630
I got a really weird one recently where they like beat me up.

1475
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:21.820
They basically liked this more than just like beat me.
Yeah.

1476
01:25:21.821 --> 01:25:25.360
Like a Thai massage and she was just standing on me.
Yeah.

1477
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:29.130
It's time massage sauce.
She had her foot in my butt at some oil.
Yeah.

1478
01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:32.610
Did you stretch you out to like pull your legs and stuff?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1479
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:35.650
It was to stop bumping into that ouchy loud.

1480
01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:40.120
Did you get the prostate massage also though?
Have you ever had that?
No.

1481
01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:41.990
I've never gotten any of those like happy I me,

1482
01:25:41.991 --> 01:25:43.810
I've never even been offered that.
That's not a happy ending.

1483
01:25:43.811 --> 01:25:46.840
That's just like an actual part of massage that a lot of places our finger in

1484
01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:49.600
your back,
they just rub around.
We went to never hurt.
Nobody.

1485
01:25:49.601 --> 01:25:53.080
Massages your prostate and irregular fucking massage.

1486
01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:56.400
I've had many sizes that were not whack off massage places and then they rub

1487
01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:57.850
your bottle would rub their,

1488
01:25:57.851 --> 01:26:02.170
put their thumb on it and they just rub around your butthole muscles around your

1489
01:26:02.171 --> 01:26:04.340
asshole cannot be real

1490
01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:08.840
<v 3>prostate massage like a finger in it with a little finger now.
Shut the fuck up.</v>

1491
01:26:08.841 --> 01:26:13.670
I swear to God,
I swear to God I go to a lot.
I go to like,
yeah,

1492
01:26:13.671 --> 01:26:16.340
those are not regular massage parlors or jerk off places,

1493
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:18.600
but this is a place that didn't jerk me off.
This isn't like if Nora,

1494
01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:19.820
they rub your butthole.

1495
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:24.290
It's either time massage or Chinese massage that the guy off.

1496
01:26:24.291 --> 01:26:28.910
Pretty normal where they white tees.
Yeah.
Let me just finish them off.

1497
01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.080
Well,
it's weird that we have spots where you're not supposed to touch.
You know?

1498
01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:35.480
And for women it's abreast,
but for man that it doesn't matter at all.

1499
01:26:35.481 --> 01:26:36.980
You could rub a guy's breasts,

1500
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:40.580
you brought rubber guys packs and it does absolutely nothing.
Like no one cares.

1501
01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:41.101
Oh yeah.

1502
01:26:41.101 --> 01:26:45.480
She rubbed the hell out of a woman can have your arm and just push down on

1503
01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:48.500
breasts and manipulate them.
And you know,
nobody freaks out.

1504
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:52.100
But even that much like a stripper,
like I wanted to feel like she liked me,

1505
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:53.511
you know what I mean?

1506
01:26:53.511 --> 01:26:56.900
Like I wanted to feel like I was different than the other massage.
Of course.

1507
01:26:56.930 --> 01:27:01.400
You know,
like I was better at Cha taking a massage.
Yeah,
of course.
And she did.

1508
01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:06.260
And I'm dating and she's my wife.
She's my dream girl.
She's the one,

1509
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:10.760
my one of a kind.
She stopped rubbing all those other dudes.
Yeah.
Eventually

1510
01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:17.150
lucky people should be able to do anything they want.

1511
01:27:17.151 --> 01:27:20.180
If they want to suck dicks for money,
they can do it.

1512
01:27:20.181 --> 01:27:22.910
As long as there's a camera in the room,
see how hypocritical that is?

1513
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:25.760
If you wanted to film it and make a living by putting that on the Internet and

1514
01:27:25.761 --> 01:27:28.490
have a camp and the guy could still come in and pay you,

1515
01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:30.380
he could still come in and pay you 500 bucks.

1516
01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:34.490
You blow him on camera and then look,
we just made porn.
Oh,
okay.
You made porn.

1517
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.190
Did you get all your tests?
It really is.

1518
01:27:37.191 --> 01:27:41.780
It's just antiquated from the time where there would be prostitute areas where

1519
01:27:41.781 --> 01:27:46.250
they would walk around and it would be bad for business business or the

1520
01:27:46.251 --> 01:27:51.170
neighborhood and you have to see it would be CD,
but you can't change it now.

1521
01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:53.660
There's no politician that's going to change that,

1522
01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.960
but they will still arrest people.
That's where it gets really weird.

1523
01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:01.610
It's like your rest has his arrest number paying for pleasure.
Oh,
it's,

1524
01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:05.150
I mean the same thing as gambling.
I grew up,
my dad was a bookie.
I wasn't,
yeah,

1525
01:28:05.151 --> 01:28:07.310
he was arrested several times for it.
No,
she didn't.
Well,

1526
01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.140
what sports betting sports betting.
Yeah.

1527
01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.040
He was involved with the Gambino crime family.
Was this like,

1528
01:28:13.041 --> 01:28:15.500
I like how weird was that was weird.
I didn't know.

1529
01:28:15.501 --> 01:28:17.980
I didn't know about it at all until I was older.
Wow.

1530
01:28:17.981 --> 01:28:21.230
And then I found out that he didn't know at all.
I didn't know at all.
No,

1531
01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.930
he was just,
he did,
he was like,
he's got a job.
You know,

1532
01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.730
he told everyone he was an accountant for me.

1533
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:28.610
Is that your phone's vibrating like that?
It's probably just,
you know,

1534
01:28:28.611 --> 01:28:32.300
it's the old ball and chain.
Would you,
when you were a kid,
would you wonder like,

1535
01:28:32.301 --> 01:28:35.200
hey,
where the fuck is done and he'd get arrested?
No.

1536
01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:38.660
I would wonder why he would promise these.
Like he would promise like,
you know,

1537
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:41.660
a trip to California and then all of a sudden he'd be like,

1538
01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:43.310
I don't have the money.
Or He'd be like,

1539
01:28:43.311 --> 01:28:48.200
I'm in jail and I didn't know I'm in jail.
And he didn't know why.
No,

1540
01:28:48.201 --> 01:28:50.810
I didn't know why.
I didn't know why he wouldn't say he was in jail.

1541
01:28:50.811 --> 01:28:54.530
He would just be like,
I can't see you this week.
Oh,
it would happen a few times.

1542
01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:57.020
But,
so he's in jail for like very short.
It was a,

1543
01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:59.540
he was an informant for the FBI for a little bit too.

1544
01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:04.470
Took down this whole ring.
Holy Shit.
Yeah,

1545
01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:09.360
that's dead now so I can talk about it.
Fuck yeah,
that'd be so stressful.

1546
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:14.160
It was,
it was,
and he took me around with him like to do this.
He,

1547
01:29:14.161 --> 01:29:16.620
I remember he had to put cameras in this office and I was like,

1548
01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.880
cause you know he had,

1549
01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:22.470
he had shared custody so I would have to see him on weekends and he and he would

1550
01:29:22.471 --> 01:29:26.190
have to go on weekends and put like these little mini cameras with this FBI
dude,

1551
01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:29.460
Whoa,
reverend meet these guys,

1552
01:29:29.461 --> 01:29:32.160
these gambling guides in the back of a pizzeria in Brooklyn.

1553
01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.550
And they would all give me $50 bills.
How long did this go on for?

1554
01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:40.320
25 years.
For 25 years.

1555
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:44.130
You were involved with your dad doing this then I found out when I was a

1556
01:29:44.131 --> 01:29:48.030
teenager and I started working for it and I became a book.
He also,
whoa.

1557
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.230
That's cool.
So when,

1558
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:52.800
when your dad turned state's evidence and you dad became an informant,

1559
01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:56.130
did you know that he had turned state's evidence?
How old were you at the time?

1560
01:29:56.131 --> 01:29:59.520
I was like eight.
You were eight?
Yeah,
I was real young.

1561
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:03.630
So you started working for him after he became an informant?
He did.

1562
01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:04.271
He became a foreman.

1563
01:30:04.271 --> 01:30:07.320
Took down this one ring and then he started working for a different gambling

1564
01:30:07.321 --> 01:30:12.240
ring.
Oh my,
for a different booking office.
I'm so crazy.
It was really nuts.

1565
01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:16.500
What did he did?
It was so normal for me.
Oh yeah.
We talk about all the time.

1566
01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:17.850
I was part of the business.

1567
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.720
At some point it started with me like I would have to dispose of evidence.

1568
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:24.270
Like they were like,
my dad was like,
how do we get this kid a job?

1569
01:30:24.271 --> 01:30:25.560
So they would be like,

1570
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.770
just take these trashcan trash bags and throw them in different dumpsters around

1571
01:30:28.771 --> 01:30:32.130
town.
Wow.
So I would take these trends and if I got caught with it,
it would be,

1572
01:30:32.131 --> 01:30:34.920
so,
you know,
these were like gambling slips.
These are evidence.

1573
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:39.630
And then I graduated to like I,
I would,
uh,
do you ever get caught with them?
No.

1574
01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:42.720
No,
no,
no.
I never,
but if you did,
it would have been a big deal.

1575
01:30:44.490 --> 01:30:47.910
It would have been strange to have a 16 year old kid going around with the

1576
01:30:47.911 --> 01:30:51.960
evidence for this gambling ring.
So your dad gets busted.

1577
01:30:52.170 --> 01:30:55.470
He turned state's evidence,
right.
He gets his people arrested.

1578
01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:59.790
Apparently what happened was he was told by one of the guys,

1579
01:30:59.791 --> 01:31:02.820
one of the FBI guys that there's going to be a raid but we don't have enough

1580
01:31:02.821 --> 01:31:07.170
evidence yet so we won't arrest you or we will arrest you still,

1581
01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:12.440
but we won't prosecute you if you put up cameras and stuff and you get this,

1582
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:14.610
you get us more evidence.
And he did.

1583
01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:19.090
And then the weirdest thing is they just let him go back to doing it.
Now.

1584
01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:22.890
Was it sanctioned?
That was the question was,
is it when they,
when he went back,

1585
01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:25.980
they know he was doing it and they let them know,
no,
I don't think that.

1586
01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:29.880
They just like monitor you forever.
They just let you go.
It was like that was it.

1587
01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:33.330
So he just went back to what he always did.
Went back to a different place.

1588
01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:37.560
How do you justify that?
Like that's had to be so weird for him to like,
arrest,

1589
01:31:37.561 --> 01:31:39.210
get people arrested for doing something.

1590
01:31:39.211 --> 01:31:43.470
He is eventually going to go and do himself.
Yeah.
I never,
you know what,

1591
01:31:43.471 --> 01:31:47.070
I never asked him that.
That's a weird one.
I never,
he,
he actually,

1592
01:31:47.071 --> 01:31:50.370
the reason he got into it to give him more in depth thought it was,

1593
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:55.020
he embezzled uh,
I think $2 million from Ricoh cameras.

1594
01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.210
She is Christ.

1595
01:31:56.220 --> 01:32:01.220
He was the CFO of Ricoh cameras and he's a million.

1596
01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:04.570
He was making,
you know,
in like the mid eighties,
he was making like six,

1597
01:32:04.571 --> 01:32:08.470
$700,000 a year,
which is like now it's way more.
Um,

1598
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:12.040
and he was a million and a half now,
right?
Yeah.

1599
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:13.780
He was making a lot of money back then.

1600
01:32:13.781 --> 01:32:16.660
We would take limos to Atlantic city every weekend.
Whoa.

1601
01:32:16.690 --> 01:32:21.610
And then as the story goes,
he was just for two years,
I think,

1602
01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:22.780
just embezzling money.

1603
01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:25.930
He was just like doing shady transactions and taking money off the top.

1604
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.550
And then he got caught when there was a new CEO and he blackmailed the CEO

1605
01:32:30.551 --> 01:32:33.190
because he had information on the company that they didn't want coming out.

1606
01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:35.890
And he got out,
but he could never work in the industry again.

1607
01:32:35.891 --> 01:32:39.970
So he became a gambler.
I mean a,
a bookie and a gambler.
That's crazy.

1608
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:44.020
So He's,
he embezzled $2 million.

1609
01:32:44.050 --> 01:32:48.250
Scottfree scottfree yeah.
Wow.
Yeah,

1610
01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.220
yeah.

1611
01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:55.870
They were starting to get charges together and he was facing like 40 life,

1612
01:32:55.900 --> 01:33:00.400
almost life in prison.
He loves the craziest fucking stressful applying.

1613
01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.430
And then he,
you know,
he became a gambler.

1614
01:33:03.431 --> 01:33:07.070
And this was around the time my mom left and was like 86,
um,

1615
01:33:07.150 --> 01:33:12.070
he bet $300,000 on the red sox to win the world series in [inaudible] 86.

1616
01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:14.200
Oh my God.
In the world series.
You remember that?

1617
01:33:14.201 --> 01:33:17.980
It was a good buck and he lost 300,000,

1618
01:33:17.981 --> 01:33:20.710
which was like most of their savings.
And my mom left him the next day.

1619
01:33:22.150 --> 01:33:26.530
Jesus Christ,
man,
no wonder why you're a comic.
I'm like,

1620
01:33:26.650 --> 01:33:30.550
no wonder.
I thought it was so cool,
man.
When I,
when I got involved in it,

1621
01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:34.480
it was like the Sopranos was on TV.
It was like my dad's a gangster,
but he was,

1622
01:33:34.481 --> 01:33:36.550
he was this like fat Jewish guy.
Like he wasn't,

1623
01:33:36.970 --> 01:33:38.380
he wasn't involved in any of that.

1624
01:33:38.381 --> 01:33:42.540
Like he knew guys that were like strong men for the,
for the guy for,
you know,

1625
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:46.220
really connected.
What did he die from?
Colon cancer.
Oh,

1626
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:49.000
it was probably a lot of it due to stress right now.
He was,

1627
01:33:49.001 --> 01:33:50.470
he treated his body like crap.

1628
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:54.190
He basically didn't exist for the last 10 years of his life.
He didn't pay taxes.

1629
01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:58.210
He wasn't on the Mat.
He didn't have id and he was just like,
totally.

1630
01:33:58.211 --> 01:33:59.980
He kept going.
He didn't have a bank account,

1631
01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.610
50,000 in cash above his bed on a headboard,

1632
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:06.670
witness protection program styles that what was going on?
No,

1633
01:34:06.671 --> 01:34:09.490
he just didn't want to pay taxes.
He didn't want to pay tax on any of his money.

1634
01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:12.790
So you can't like exist really.

1635
01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:14.950
So did he know that he would still health insurance?

1636
01:34:14.951 --> 01:34:17.470
So he didn't have any of that stuff and you didn't take care of his body.

1637
01:34:17.471 --> 01:34:21.100
And then he got sick and it was already like stage four,
stage five.

1638
01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.170
So he didn't know he was sick and just decided,
fuck it.

1639
01:34:23.171 --> 01:34:26.440
I'm not going to pay taxes.
I'm just going to ride this out.
This was,
I mean,

1640
01:34:26.441 --> 01:34:31.080
he didn't pay taxes I think for around 15 years.
He didn't pay taxes.
Yeah,

1641
01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:35.380
he didn't exist.
He didn't have a driver's license.
He faked a driver's license.

1642
01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:39.900
He got a fake Id.
Not you should.

1643
01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:41.320
He's a great dad.
He was like,

1644
01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:46.390
you should do a one man show about your dad.
I know.

1645
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:50.140
Well that's the story on our each show is I talk about my dad too.
Wow,

1646
01:34:50.170 --> 01:34:51.040
that's amazing.

1647
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:54.460
He would take me to Atlantic city all the time and he taught me how to sort of

1648
01:34:54.461 --> 01:34:57.620
count cards in blackjack,
like he was in addition to being a bookie,

1649
01:34:57.621 --> 01:35:01.280
he was a Sicko gambler.
Like that was the,
you know,
his big vice.

1650
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:05.600
Like he never did drugs.
He never drank,
but he would gamble like all his money.

1651
01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.900
That's incredible,
man.
Yeah.
My grandmother got arrested when I was a little kid.

1652
01:35:08.901 --> 01:35:12.800
She used to run numbers for the mob and they wanted her to turn state's evidence

1653
01:35:12.801 --> 01:35:15.230
and she wouldn't do it.
So they locked her in jail for six months.

1654
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:17.840
So whenever we would go visit my grandma,

1655
01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:20.240
like she wouldn't be there and my grandfather were there.
Oh,

1656
01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:24.500
your grandma's visiting aunt Josie.
She was like,
have some things she was doing.

1657
01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:28.010
She's with aunt Marie this week.
She was like,
it was some story,

1658
01:35:28.011 --> 01:35:33.011
but meanwhile she was in some cell somewhere because she wouldn't rat on these

1659
01:35:33.231 --> 01:35:35.780
guys don't do like their version of the lottery.

1660
01:35:35.781 --> 01:35:37.100
It would be like running numbers.

1661
01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:42.230
Like there would be the numbers is how much people bet total.
Right.
Yeah.

1662
01:35:42.231 --> 01:35:45.420
I did a version of that when I was in high school.
There was um,

1663
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:49.700
football cards that you could sell,
which was,
it's the craziest thing.
It's,

1664
01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:52.180
you basically have to pick out of,
um,

1665
01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:57.110
I think you list like 10 games that weekend and all the football games and you

1666
01:35:57.111 --> 01:36:01.940
have to pick five winners out of the 10,
which is like,
it feels easy.

1667
01:36:01.941 --> 01:36:02.510
Right?

1668
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:07.510
But it's like so difficult out of these games to pick five winners and like you

1669
01:36:07.641 --> 01:36:12.410
charge like $5 a card and if like you know less than half the people when you

1670
01:36:12.411 --> 01:36:13.191
make money and it was,

1671
01:36:13.191 --> 01:36:17.240
I was making money doing this for like all of high school and then in college I

1672
01:36:17.241 --> 01:36:20.570
became like a real book.
You like I would actually get clients.
That's so crazy.

1673
01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:21.081
Yeah.

1674
01:36:21.081 --> 01:36:24.050
I would go to these frat parties and get all these frat kids to bet through me.

1675
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:26.750
Whoa.
Do you have any issues with that?

1676
01:36:26.751 --> 01:36:30.760
Like guy's not paying or with like the school finding out?
Yeah you do.

1677
01:36:30.761 --> 01:36:33.890
You have like a few issues but then it's just they can't bet anymore and they

1678
01:36:33.891 --> 01:36:36.530
want a bet these people want to bat like there's never,

1679
01:36:36.531 --> 01:36:39.380
you never need to strong arm people because they just can't bet next week if

1680
01:36:39.381 --> 01:36:42.980
they don't pay and everyone wants it.
That I've never understood that.
When you,

1681
01:36:42.981 --> 01:36:44.510
when you do that,

1682
01:36:44.511 --> 01:36:48.500
do you have to have like a stash of cash that you can match up with?
Well,

1683
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:49.490
I had a deal,

1684
01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:53.930
worked out with my dad's gambling office where they would pay all of my losses

1685
01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:58.460
and I would keep half my winnings.
Ah,
so no matter who lost,

1686
01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:01.340
they would pay them and I would just keep half the winning.

1687
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:02.510
Now when you did that,

1688
01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:07.090
did you have to have like a really sick knowledge of sports?
Did you get into it?

1689
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:10.600
Yeah.
How much time does it require?
A lot.
And you've got to,

1690
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:13.550
you got to stay on top of the odds because they're constantly changing and if a

1691
01:37:13.551 --> 01:37:16.450
lot of people are betting on one side,
you got to move the,
the,

1692
01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:21.350
the points spread to,
to favor the other side so people bet the other side.
Wow.

1693
01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:24.980
Yeah,
it was nuts.
So you do like,
you could make up fun like prop bets.

1694
01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.390
Like they have weird stuff.

1695
01:37:26.391 --> 01:37:31.250
Like will the Broncos score as much as Shaquille O'neil on Sunday?
Oh,

1696
01:37:31.251 --> 01:37:33.410
weird.
Crazy.
But crazy bets.
Yeah.

1697
01:37:33.411 --> 01:37:36.590
Those were bets of people got accused of like shaving on that.

1698
01:37:36.591 --> 01:37:39.570
Like they got informed,
you know,
about certain things like,
no,

1699
01:37:39.571 --> 01:37:43.730
I'm not saying you should lose this game,
but if you do this,
it would behoove us,

1700
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:47.690
oh,
that happens to get to a certain number.
Like you know,
Dude,
you're at 32.

1701
01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:51.290
Oh right,
okay,
cool,
cool,
cool.
And just throw some bricks.
I learned,
you know,

1702
01:37:51.291 --> 01:37:55.190
I apparently,
I didn't know this,
that like uh,
my dad would fix horse races.

1703
01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:56.070
That was his

1704
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:00.060
<v 1>big thing was you would just basically pay a Jackie to,</v>

1705
01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.130
to hold a horseback.
I knew a jock.
You got arrested for that.
Yeah.
It all,

1706
01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:08.880
it's so common apparently.
Yeah.
There's a guy who used to run those chariots,

1707
01:38:08.881 --> 01:38:12.830
you know those chariots.
You ever see those cold like,
yeah.
Yeah.

1708
01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:17.900
And he literally stood up to try to get the horse of slowed down because he was

1709
01:38:18.361 --> 01:38:22.140
winning and they caught him standing up like you piece of shit.
He does a,
you,

1710
01:38:22.141 --> 01:38:23.820
you hold them back for several races.

1711
01:38:23.821 --> 01:38:27.930
They become a huge underdog and then you let them lose and they win.
That's like,

1712
01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.420
it's the classic way to,
to,
to do it.
Well,

1713
01:38:30.421 --> 01:38:33.330
this guy was trying to slow his horse down and they,
you know,

1714
01:38:33.331 --> 01:38:37.880
they barred him from being a jockey ever again.
And then he went and hired,

1715
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:42.150
hired William Kunstler.
Some counselor kept talking about it.
He's a legend.

1716
01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:43.500
I got constantly my side,

1717
01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.170
I'm going to assume these cocksuckers and not going to make any money.

1718
01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:50.670
George the Greek,
he was this guy in the Greek,
he died of cancer too.

1719
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:53.520
You know what Jimmy?
The Greek,
there's like a whole documentary about it.
Oh sure.

1720
01:38:53.521 --> 01:38:58.290
Yeah.
That's the guy that popularized gambles.
Butts were higher.
Yeah.

1721
01:38:58.310 --> 01:39:01.830
That's why you got a fire where,
yeah,

1722
01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:05.520
you were saying about slave owners breeding,
you know,

1723
01:39:05.521 --> 01:39:10.380
the largest blocks with the uh,
yeah,
yeah.
That was his whole thing.
But meanwhile,

1724
01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:15.210
you know,
he makes them like actual points.
Like they did do that.
Like they,

1725
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:19.620
they did have slaves where they guaranteed took the largest males.
Yeah.

1726
01:39:19.710 --> 01:39:22.860
And tried to make them with the largest females to make stronger slaves.

1727
01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:26.610
I mean that has to have happened at some point in time.
You know,

1728
01:39:26.670 --> 01:39:31.320
and it's the athletics that you see like from,

1729
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:36.350
from black African Americans is like they're the best athletes on earth and

1730
01:39:36.691 --> 01:39:38.430
where your white guy and your name is Jimmy the Greek,

1731
01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:41.130
you got to try to figure out why that is,
you know,

1732
01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:46.440
and you gotta be so sure about it even though it's not scientific for him it was

1733
01:39:46.441 --> 01:39:48.620
like,
yeah.
You know,
what they used to do is to take the,

1734
01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:52.260
the guys with the fucking biggest dicks and the best athletes,

1735
01:39:52.261 --> 01:39:55.230
they breed them with the biggest women and they make the biggest slaves,

1736
01:39:55.231 --> 01:39:59.190
like bought a big bottle home.
But they would say crazy shit back then on TV,

1737
01:39:59.191 --> 01:40:02.710
like Howard Cosell got in trouble for smoke smoke on the,

1738
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:06.780
that little monkey run like that was like a statement that he had of a,

1739
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:09.720
there was a football player who was like really fucking fast.
Well,

1740
01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:12.280
what becomes taboo changes all the time.
Right?
You ever,

1741
01:40:12.281 --> 01:40:15.970
have you ever go back recently and watched like Eddie Murphy raw or odd?
Yeah.

1742
01:40:15.971 --> 01:40:20.850
I was just like,
oh my God,
this is all gate.
This is all like homophobic,
weird,

1743
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:25.500
weirdly angry towards gay people material.
Yeah.
And everybody went along with it.

1744
01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:28.980
Like there was a way back then.
All you just do say just fuck fucking faggot.

1745
01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:33.480
And everybody was,
yeah.
Oh,
in my lifetime,
faggot was fine.

1746
01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:37.050
It was fine to say like I,
I remember when I was a kid,
it was just like,

1747
01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:41.580
it's just a fun word.
And now it's like,
it's on the par of the n word.
Yeah.

1748
01:40:41.581 --> 01:40:43.590
You're not supposed to use it anymore.
It's too bad.

1749
01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:47.150
It was a great word while it lasted.
I miss it.

1750
01:40:47.151 --> 01:40:52.110
And even when it was not used in a gay sense,
you know the facts of pen.
Yeah.

1751
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:56.920
It's a little faggot monkey over here to try and throw bananas at me.

1752
01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:59.260
Get back up you tree.
Yeah.
This is,

1753
01:40:59.261 --> 01:41:02.500
I feel like we're going to get a Jessebelle article about this podcast.

1754
01:41:02.590 --> 01:41:05.260
Why would not say anything that's run on right?
We're fine.
We're not,

1755
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:06.423
we're not like,

1756
01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:11.200
we're not on the side of Jimmy the Greek or on the side of,
uh,

1757
01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:16.050
people that are calling up football player on Monday.
We'll just say in a weird,

1758
01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:19.510
but black people can run better.
I mean,
we could all look,
well,

1759
01:41:19.511 --> 01:41:22.870
I don't know why it's racist to say the best athletes.

1760
01:41:23.290 --> 01:41:26.590
I don't know why that's racist.
It's good.
They're better.
Like,

1761
01:41:26.591 --> 01:41:30.640
look at Lebron James,
look at Kobe Bryant,
look at John Jones,

1762
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:33.490
look at it and there's a scroll.
John said it's sugar ray Leonard.

1763
01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:35.080
That's what they're,
you know,

1764
01:41:35.081 --> 01:41:38.980
in their lack of educational infrastructure,

1765
01:41:38.981 --> 01:41:41.950
that's what they're able to do.
Maybe that's what,

1766
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:45.730
that's who their role models are.
There's also like bone density.

1767
01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.210
African Americans have a significantly more bone density than white people.

1768
01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:49.931
In fact,

1769
01:41:49.931 --> 01:41:53.860
African American women on par a lot of times have a similar bone density to

1770
01:41:53.861 --> 01:41:57.220
white European men.
It's weird.
Yeah.

1771
01:41:57.250 --> 01:42:00.940
There's like physical advantages to being a African America,

1772
01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:05.200
especially like there's people from certain parts of Africa that are just

1773
01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:10.120
unbelievably good at running to the point where all marathon runners and all

1774
01:42:10.121 --> 01:42:14.560
these like Olympic medalists and like certain distance running came from with

1775
01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:18.580
wipe out all Norway and they have huge people.

1776
01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:23.520
They're like,
Scandinavians are sure.
I was just in Sweden past weekend.
Yeah,

1777
01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:28.180
they're like all like a lot of biking.
Look,
God's huge looking dudes.
And again,

1778
01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:32.080
where's that square jaws?
Genetics.
Like those were vikings.

1779
01:42:32.081 --> 01:42:35.650
They literally were vikings.
Yeah.
I mean,
why were vikings bigger?

1780
01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.500
They got the spoils.
They got all the food.

1781
01:42:38.501 --> 01:42:42.100
They got the food and the the toughest and the strongest state alive.

1782
01:42:42.130 --> 01:42:46.300
They live in these harsh northern climates way before they had anything other

1783
01:42:46.301 --> 01:42:48.490
than burning wood to stay warm.

1784
01:42:48.610 --> 01:42:52.900
I mean that they survived like that for hundreds and hundreds of years and

1785
01:42:52.901 --> 01:42:55.450
there's just a strong genes of these vikings.

1786
01:42:55.510 --> 01:43:00.280
But it's okay to be a viking because then you are,
you know,
you were a conqueror,

1787
01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.440
you will like a winner.
But if you like,

1788
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:05.290
say that someone has like really good genes because they were a slave,

1789
01:43:05.291 --> 01:43:09.010
it's like derogatory.
So that's where people take issue with it,
you know?
Oh,

1790
01:43:09.011 --> 01:43:11.110
I can see why people take issue with it.

1791
01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:13.810
Like if there was a bunch of people that were from north,
if you try to,

1792
01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:16.300
if you will,
like some shitty Greek type guy and you're on TV.

1793
01:43:16.450 --> 01:43:20.260
The thing about these guys from Sweden,
fucking Norway is the bigger,

1794
01:43:20.261 --> 01:43:24.130
because they used to kill everybody.
They were on horses,
they had big sword.

1795
01:43:24.131 --> 01:43:26.540
There were big guys from Norway,

1796
01:43:26.541 --> 01:43:28.670
all of the fucking ones that were bigger survive.

1797
01:43:28.690 --> 01:43:32.200
They would breed the big males with the big females and they would come with the

1798
01:43:32.201 --> 01:43:34.660
best athletes.
Yeah.
Nobody even from Norway would get mad at,

1799
01:43:34.661 --> 01:43:38.860
you know what I mean?
The bad thing is I grew up with guys like that.

1800
01:43:38.861 --> 01:43:41.530
Like all my dad's friends were like that.
My uncles were like that,

1801
01:43:41.531 --> 01:43:45.880
and he just would be just so casually racist at the dinner table,
you know?

1802
01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:51.220
I mean,
seriously,
you know,
like even now,
like my parents,
my mom,

1803
01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:52.040
my ground,
you

1804
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.280
<v 3>know,
they'll just be like,
I just don't understand why Mexicans have to be here.</v>

1805
01:43:55.410 --> 01:43:58.790
You know?
Like they'll say things like that,
like just so reasonable.

1806
01:43:59.350 --> 01:44:02.210
Like just like,
I just don't understand.
Why do they have to be here?

1807
01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:08.450
There were people that grew up in a certain pattern and that certain pattern,

1808
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:12.800
which is normal to distrust people of other ethnicities and races.

1809
01:44:12.850 --> 01:44:14.120
It's like that's the pattern.

1810
01:44:14.121 --> 01:44:17.990
It's so normal soldered into your brain and to break that pattern.

1811
01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:22.430
It was all the humor.
It was all the humor of my family growing up was racial.

1812
01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:26.870
Imagine if someone tried to put on like Archie bunker on a TV show today.

1813
01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:32.060
Oh yeah.
How long would that last?
How long would it last before he wouldn't even,

1814
01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.390
it would implode just by Twitter and Facebook comments.
Yeah.

1815
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:38.510
It'd be a great podcast though.
The Archie Bunker podcasts,

1816
01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:44.390
you can't be racist like that anymore.
He just doesn't exist.
No,

1817
01:44:44.490 --> 01:44:45.520
it's the other way is,
you know,

1818
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:50.180
you have to have every type of demographic in a show.
Yeah.

1819
01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:51.350
You got to cover everything.

1820
01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:55.880
You got to cover every single base from top to bottom.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

1821
01:44:56.330 --> 01:45:00.170
we live in a time where people just more aware of what was fucked up about the

1822
01:45:00.171 --> 01:45:00.921
past too.

1823
01:45:00.921 --> 01:45:04.400
We live in a time where people were more aware of what was really bad about,

1824
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.030
you know,
or,
or what's going on.
Now.
People are really aware of that.

1825
01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.860
Like I don't think there could have been,

1826
01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:13.430
there could be another holocaust now people would know about it instantly.

1827
01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:16.610
I wonder,
I mean,
look at North Korea,

1828
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:19.740
they could have something similar there and I wonder how much,

1829
01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:23.900
how many people would have to die before they would act before people,

1830
01:45:23.901 --> 01:45:27.220
they don't have oil there.
They don't have resources that we need.
Yeah.
Right.

1831
01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:30.620
But I mean like how far can it go?
I mean,

1832
01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:33.410
he is essentially the last of the great dictators.
Right?

1833
01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:38.210
How far do you think he'd go with his like human rights atrocities before we as

1834
01:45:38.211 --> 01:45:42.580
a,
you know,
United world said,
fuck this.
It's clear.
All he would have to do is,

1835
01:45:42.650 --> 01:45:46.610
is go past a border once.
Once he got,
he's like,

1836
01:45:46.611 --> 01:45:50.150
I need more land or I need more people or I need more resources,

1837
01:45:50.151 --> 01:45:54.410
then we're just like,
no way it happened.
It was the Korean War,
right?

1838
01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:57.650
Yeah.
Was that,
we're just fine.
He's,
if he's contained,

1839
01:45:57.651 --> 01:46:01.490
they're killing all these people that we don't care about,
you know?
Yeah.

1840
01:46:01.491 --> 01:46:02.110
It was that one of the,

1841
01:46:02.110 --> 01:46:07.110
it's one of the few times in history where there's like there's a North Korea

1842
01:46:08.210 --> 01:46:12.320
and South Korea and they live right next to each other and they fucking hate

1843
01:46:12.321 --> 01:46:15.050
each other and they look exactly the same.
Well it's in,

1844
01:46:15.051 --> 01:46:17.960
there were Pakistan it was like that too similar but they have different

1845
01:46:17.961 --> 01:46:20.460
religions.
Right.
Don't they?
It doesn't.

1846
01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:25.070
Indian Pakistan delete shit like Indians more Hindu,
Pakistani Muslim.

1847
01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:28.880
Yeah.
There is a,
there is a religious war there but they are so close.

1848
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:31.280
There was this vice documentary about,
um,

1849
01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.580
I feel like vice docker decorators are just like fodder for hipsters to have

1850
01:46:34.581 --> 01:46:38.510
conversations.
They are guys,
doc man,

1851
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:43.220
no where they show the border and there's just these troops just staring at each

1852
01:46:43.221 --> 01:46:45.920
other like Pakistan trips in India trips.

1853
01:46:45.921 --> 01:46:49.440
Just like looking at each other a few feet away,
just like don't do man.

1854
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.040
And they all have

1855
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.940
<v 1>bombs,
both sides.
Oh they are?
They have nukes.
Yeah.</v>

1856
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:55.500
It's like us being at war with Mexico,
you know,

1857
01:46:55.530 --> 01:47:00.530
like going down to La Jolla and you look at tanks pointing in your yeah.

1858
01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:05.040
Mexico.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A big part of it.
Yeah.
That's,
that's uh,

1859
01:47:05.670 --> 01:47:09.600
that's one of the big issues with some people in la.

1860
01:47:09.650 --> 01:47:12.130
I said La was stolen from the Mexicans.
You know,

1861
01:47:12.150 --> 01:47:16.110
there was some radical UCLA professor that I ever had this video.

1862
01:47:16.111 --> 01:47:20.600
So he was putting out about this was stolen Latino land and like,
yeah,

1863
01:47:20.610 --> 01:47:23.220
this crazy speech that he was giving,
like stolen.

1864
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:26.080
Like what generation are we talking about here,
man?
Like when,

1865
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.790
when was this stolen?
I mean it was,
it was one.
Yeah,

1866
01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:34.410
in a war by the way.
It wasn't yours to begin with.
Like who's w w w what,

1867
01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.380
what about the native Americans?
Well,
you know what?

1868
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:40.890
Mexico is native American plus Spanish.
That's what it is.
Spanish came down,

1869
01:47:40.891 --> 01:47:44.810
landed the anchors,
they bread,
everybody had sacks.
They,
you know,

1870
01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:46.680
I mean that is a lot of what Mexico is.

1871
01:47:46.681 --> 01:47:51.300
That's a lot of Mexican heritage has to do with people from Spain who came over

1872
01:47:51.301 --> 01:47:55.620
to Mexico.
I mean that is,
that's the real reality.
And you want it,

1873
01:47:55.621 --> 01:47:58.860
you go back before then,
like w w what was,
you know,

1874
01:47:58.861 --> 01:48:00.720
are we going to give everything to the Inuits?

1875
01:48:00.721 --> 01:48:04.350
So we're going to give everything to the people that came over from Asia and the

1876
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:05.580
Bering Strait.
Like they're the original ones.

1877
01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:08.730
The native Americans are the original Mexicans,

1878
01:48:08.731 --> 01:48:13.260
original North Americans like this.
It wasn't all Mexico.
This is all people.

1879
01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:18.000
It's all people,
you know,
and we destroyed them.
The only like arc,

1880
01:48:18.010 --> 01:48:20.420
like though annihilated these people.
Yeah,

1881
01:48:20.490 --> 01:48:23.640
we wipe them off the face of the earth.
There's a lot of that.

1882
01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:28.530
The other argument is that we don't let them come over here.

1883
01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:32.430
Like,
you know,
there's a clear border,
you know,
there's a clear border,

1884
01:48:32.431 --> 01:48:35.550
there's like a lot of issues.
Like it's hard to just get over here.

1885
01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.000
Like you can't just like,
it doesn't matter who owns it.
It's,

1886
01:48:39.001 --> 01:48:41.420
everybody's not really,
you know,

1887
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:45.900
of course you can't really come over here if you do.
They keep an eye on you.

1888
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.820
They don't want you to stay.
Right.

1889
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:51.360
Did you hear what he just busted a Russian spiring recently?

1890
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:54.920
Like that's still a thing.
We still have Russian spies.

1891
01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:57.560
What'd you hear about the hot chick that they have?
That was a Russian spies.

1892
01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:02.520
There was a hot chick that was like chatting guys up and getting information.

1893
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:07.350
Wow.
She's back.
She's like a superstar back in Russia.
We deported her.

1894
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:11.220
Isn't that Russia is a villain again?
That's what I mean.

1895
01:49:11.221 --> 01:49:15.390
It's been mad at you always have been.
I think it's just not cool at all.

1896
01:49:15.391 --> 01:49:18.180
Is this really the only way that you could search things yet?

1897
01:49:18.181 --> 01:49:21.180
We have to see you search in front of those cameras now.

1898
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:25.440
That's the only way to do it then Amy Adams.
Okay,

1899
01:49:25.441 --> 01:49:29.490
let's buy a couple more things cause it was awkward.
Yeah,
that's her.
That's the,

1900
01:49:29.491 --> 01:49:29.591
uh,

1901
01:49:29.591 --> 01:49:34.591
the Russian and she's in like the maximum diversion of Maxim in Russia.

1902
01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:35.180
Look,

1903
01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:40.050
she frictional flushed and hot is more interesting than anything else that you

1904
01:49:40.051 --> 01:49:44.310
do.
Oh yeah.
Was she an escort or what?
How did she,
well,

1905
01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:47.970
she was a spy and she worked for,
what is,
she would like

1906
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.520
<v 3>mate with guys,
breed with them,</v>

1907
01:49:51.521 --> 01:49:55.450
get their sperm and their ideas and information.

1908
01:49:56.530 --> 01:50:01.240
She would,
um,
oh,
she sent marriage.
He looks like a bond,
like a bond spy.

1909
01:50:01.570 --> 01:50:04.720
She looks really looks like it.
She tweeted a marriage proposal,

1910
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:09.520
but that was back in 2013 she might have since gone on to a thousand different

1911
01:50:09.521 --> 01:50:14.110
dicks.
Yeah,
that's the next article.
Yeah.
Who knows?

1912
01:50:14.890 --> 01:50:17.620
Who knows who?
She's Russian spy.
It goes to a thousand decks.

1913
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:23.310
It's hilarious though that they hired a woman to go over and seduce men and get

1914
01:50:23.441 --> 01:50:26.860
information from them.
Smart.
It's cute.
Russians,
man.

1915
01:50:26.861 --> 01:50:30.700
They will never be okay with just being number two.
Number two.
Yeah.
They can't,

1916
01:50:30.730 --> 01:50:33.910
nobody wants to sell to all these guys do like Putin and all the guys who run

1917
01:50:33.911 --> 01:50:38.830
the government were part of,
you know,
the real USSR.
They were raised in that.

1918
01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:41.080
Yeah.
That's normal to them.
Well,

1919
01:50:41.081 --> 01:50:46.081
Putin is the most gangster of all the people today that's in control of a large

1920
01:50:46.331 --> 01:50:48.700
government.
Right?
Because he's so transparent.

1921
01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.810
Like when they arrest people and take away their businesses and throw them in

1922
01:50:52.811 --> 01:50:56.330
the Gulag and,
right.
It's awful.
It's like they're Reagan.
Yeah.

1923
01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:01.450
He's way worse than that.
Anybody like Putin,

1924
01:51:01.451 --> 01:51:05.650
the guy got elected out,
like he laughed,
like he did his term,
laughed,

1925
01:51:05.651 --> 01:51:09.700
put some puppet government in his place and then went back and started running

1926
01:51:09.701 --> 01:51:13.900
it again.
They're very alpha culture.
I grew up with a lot of Russians,

1927
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:18.700
like it's really all about strongest,
most,
you know,
best jewelry,

1928
01:51:18.701 --> 01:51:22.450
best dressed.
It's like very alpha.
Like these guys are so alpha.

1929
01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:25.690
While they have to be probably survived that weather isn't there.

1930
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:30.750
Probably some lightweight meet a lot of Phila jumpsuits if you're living in

1931
01:51:31.991 --> 01:51:34.120
Russia,
you know what I mean?
Like the genetics,

1932
01:51:34.121 --> 01:51:37.600
just the culture in the genes to survive that sort of an environment.

1933
01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:39.880
Unbelievably harsh climate.
You know?

1934
01:51:39.881 --> 01:51:43.910
So many didn't scant resources under the thumb of an oppressive government.
Yeah.

1935
01:51:43.911 --> 01:51:48.250
I just read a stat that I'm directly related to Stalin,

1936
01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:53.290
like directly related,
49 million people died.
Wow.

1937
01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:57.340
He killed 49 million people during his reign.
That's insane.
Yeah.

1938
01:51:58.090 --> 01:52:01.810
That's great.
I never would have thought it was that high.
Yeah.
49 million.
Wow.

1939
01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:04.310
Like unnatural causes.
That's so,

1940
01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:06.700
and he put them in camps like concentration camps and stuff.

1941
01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:10.570
Isn't it funny that he doesn't get brought up the same way or does or any of

1942
01:52:10.571 --> 01:52:12.970
these in that crazy horrible murders because he's too scary.

1943
01:52:12.971 --> 01:52:16.740
He has too much power.
I think that Olin or,
I mean,
uh,

1944
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:20.770
I think meant fashion Russia in general.
You know,

1945
01:52:20.771 --> 01:52:25.660
we're talking about someone count 49 billion PT killed 49 million people.
Yeah.

1946
01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:30.310
That's so bizarre.
That does not brought up on a regular basis.

1947
01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:33.160
I couldn't believe it either.
I looked at,
I was like,
this can't be real.
Yeah.

1948
01:52:33.161 --> 01:52:34.150
He would,
you know,

1949
01:52:34.151 --> 01:52:38.170
he basically would just send people to these Siberian gulags because what do

1950
01:52:38.171 --> 01:52:40.750
they,
and they would just work to death and he would just kill them.

1951
01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:43.060
What's the number of people that Hitler supposedly killed?

1952
01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:46.570
My eight 8 million right now.
Weird.
Yeah.
It weird.

1953
01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:49.680
That's very strange that he's responding.
I mean,
it was so much more,

1954
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:54.560
Hitler did that very quickly too and was going to keep going I think so it was

1955
01:52:54.561 --> 01:52:56.900
just,
he just,
just getting ramped up.
Yeah.
Hiller is,

1956
01:52:56.901 --> 01:53:00.740
is like a different category than any evil.
You know,

1957
01:53:00.741 --> 01:53:03.140
there's like evil and then there's a huge jump to Hitler.

1958
01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.270
No one even approaches that.
Well,

1959
01:53:05.271 --> 01:53:07.760
I think the really scary thing about Hitler for a lot of people,

1960
01:53:07.761 --> 01:53:10.580
it wasn't just that he was evil because there have been evil people throughout

1961
01:53:10.581 --> 01:53:14.290
history,
but that he was incredibly charismatic and we can watch it,
right?

1962
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:17.600
We can actually see it on a film for like one of the first times.

1963
01:53:17.601 --> 01:53:21.200
Like if someone can go back and see video footage of Alexander the Great and go,

1964
01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:25.000
oh,
that's what was going on.
Or Napoleon,
oh,
that's what was going on.

1965
01:53:25.001 --> 01:53:29.140
We could see Stalin and we don't talk about that.
Yup.
Yeah,
yeah.

1966
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:31.910
There's something about those speeches that Hitler gave though,

1967
01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:36.970
where he was out there in front of all the fucking hair was going crazy and he's

1968
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:40.550
screaming and he's mapped up right now that we know like what he was doing.

1969
01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:45.560
He was messed up.
He was all messed up.
Harry was,
he was a great artist.

1970
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:50.900
Painter.
Yeah.
Let's see.
George W.
Bush was a painter too.
Oh,
he's great.

1971
01:53:51.010 --> 01:53:55.520
Have you seen the,
it's like a Karma.
He paints,

1972
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:59.550
paints stuff that like a nine year old would paint.
Yeah,

1973
01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:03.590
I think he paints like her dog and Turkey.
Yeah,
exactly.

1974
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:09.680
Turkey.
Yeah.
He paints like a kid and like,

1975
01:54:09.710 --> 01:54:14.000
you know the look has a little blue underneath it as the background and then

1976
01:54:14.001 --> 01:54:18.710
that's it.
It's artwork is dog shit.
Hitler.
No,

1977
01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:20.330
she's just crying.
You got to pay attention.

1978
01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:23.210
You can't just sit there on your iPad and seriously,

1979
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:25.250
you can't just interject in the middle.

1980
01:54:25.251 --> 01:54:28.030
This is twice you did that in a row or you didn't know were saying

1981
01:54:28.130 --> 01:54:28.281
<v 5>no,</v>

1982
01:54:28.281 --> 01:54:31.160
I know what you were saying the first time in the second time I was looking at

1983
01:54:31.161 --> 01:54:34.250
star and it says 40 to 60 million is what I was watching when you guys started

1984
01:54:34.251 --> 01:54:38.950
this second story,
you said a was how many million did you say?
49 million.
Yeah.

1985
01:54:38.951 --> 01:54:42.710
They were saying actually,
uh,
historians are saying 40 to 60 million.

1986
01:54:42.711 --> 01:54:44.810
So that's what I was looking at law and I thought you guys were talking.

1987
01:54:45.110 --> 01:54:47.810
<v 3>No,
we were just talking about George Bush,
his artwork,</v>

1988
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:51.810
his dogs aren't Hitler killed 60 million.
No,
no.

1989
01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:54.850
40 to 60 right.

1990
01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:59.420
It's a shock when you're talking about people being murdered.

1991
01:54:59.421 --> 01:55:03.740
That's a huge range.
Fuck.
Maybe 20 more million.

1992
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:06.050
Often the case with serial killers too,

1993
01:55:06.051 --> 01:55:09.140
like everybody's scared of like certain serial killers and then you hear about

1994
01:55:09.141 --> 01:55:12.360
some that no one even knows about and they killed her honored pills.

1995
01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:15.620
How does everybody not know everything about how many serious look is this

1996
01:55:15.621 --> 01:55:18.920
fucking shitty artworks as George Bush shitty art work?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1997
01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:22.610
He trusts puppies and shit.
And he wears.
He wears an apron.

1998
01:55:24.810 --> 01:55:25.101
You know,

1999
01:55:25.101 --> 01:55:28.760
I'm ready to paint with an apron on or do you imagine the fucking nightmares

2000
01:55:28.761 --> 01:55:31.370
that guy must have?
I don't think he knows.
I don't think.

2001
01:55:31.371 --> 01:55:35.030
I think that guy is so simple that he just has just like whatever.

2002
01:55:35.031 --> 01:55:38.910
Some people told me to do things and I did them might be right.
Yeah,

2003
01:55:38.930 --> 01:55:41.990
he might be right.
That guy sleeps just fine.
What about Dick Cheney?

2004
01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:44.310
How's he sleep?
He sleeps with a baby

2005
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:47.930
<v 1>in his mouth.
He sleeps chewing on a baby.</v>

2006
01:55:48.810 --> 01:55:53.100
He painted and I know a painting is perfect.
That's hilarious.

2007
01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:57.600
George Bush made a painting of Jay Leno for j ladder.
He gives you a painting.

2008
01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:00.930
Wow.
Who would thing?
Who would have thought that guy was a war criminal?

2009
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:03.450
You imagine all the time he spent making that painting.

2010
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:06.510
Just imagine how creepy you would feel about George Bush just sitting there

2011
01:56:06.511 --> 01:56:09.660
thinking of nothing but you for hours while he's painting.

2012
01:56:09.661 --> 01:56:12.810
You look how proud he looks.
He's like,
I made this short.

2013
01:56:12.811 --> 01:56:16.650
You and Jay Leno's like it's haunted.
Oh,
that's great.
I feel it.

2014
01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:18.990
It's got the texture.
I'm a million dead Iraqis.

2015
01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:24.480
I found the weapons of mass destruction and it's this fucking painting.

2016
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:27.450
It's terrible artwork,
man.

2017
01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:33.080
Weird that this guy is like one of the most hated figures in American politics

2018
01:56:33.541 --> 01:56:34.710
ever worldwide.

2019
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:39.270
Like George w people connect him with the Iraq war,

2020
01:56:39.330 --> 01:56:42.840
the Afghanistan war with all,
he's going to go down as one of the worst ever.

2021
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:46.260
If not though worst,
we're still too close to it.
Well,

2022
01:56:46.261 --> 01:56:50.430
the poor decisions that were made following nine 11 and how nine 11 happened,

2023
01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:51.330
you know,

2024
01:56:51.330 --> 01:56:54.690
and then all a crazy conspiracy people that think that he was in on it or they

2025
01:56:54.691 --> 01:56:58.020
were in on it and yeah.
And you know,
all those conspiracies when they're like,

2026
01:56:58.050 --> 01:57:01.830
it's an inside job.
It's never like Bush,
you know,

2027
01:57:01.831 --> 01:57:04.980
it's like some rogue CIA guy,
you know?

2028
01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:08.040
I feel like people think that like bushes.
They're just like,
okay,

2029
01:57:08.041 --> 01:57:12.480
we got to knock down these towers.
Do you remember?
I'm Vincent the Chin Gigante.

2030
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:15.170
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Well,
he was like,
well,

2031
01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:17.580
immersed in the crime world because your dad,

2032
01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:22.440
he used to walk around like a crazy person with a bathrobe on and act like he

2033
01:57:22.441 --> 01:57:25.980
was nuts.
Yeah.
And that's how he got away with a lot of what he did.

2034
01:57:25.981 --> 01:57:28.050
Like you wouldn't talk to anybody in his house.

2035
01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:31.370
He would go walk and he would walk and talk to people and he would act like he

2036
01:57:31.371 --> 01:57:34.650
was nuts all the time.
Well,
I think it also came out later that he was nuts.

2037
01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:38.250
Schizophrenia.
Yeah.
Well I guess if you act like him that's long enough.

2038
01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:40.500
Eventually.
Maybe the like nature,

2039
01:57:40.501 --> 01:57:43.270
it's like you don't hold your eyes like that will stay that way.
You know?

2040
01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:44.730
It's maybe it's one of those things.
Yeah.

2041
01:57:44.731 --> 01:57:47.250
You like hide in plain sight kind of thing.
Well,

2042
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:50.100
maybe Bush is like a really smart guy and everybody's shut.

2043
01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:54.120
Shut the door is everybody gone.
Listen man,
I knew what the fuck was going on.

2044
01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:57.030
How do you think,
and nobody,
nobody's angry at me.

2045
01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:58.920
Notice that everybody hates Dick Cheney.

2046
01:57:59.610 --> 01:58:03.710
I believe that the powers like the real powers,
like,
you know,

2047
01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:05.670
not like Illuminati type stuff,
but like,

2048
01:58:05.671 --> 01:58:08.330
you know the guys like the robes and the Karl Rove's and the,

2049
01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:10.890
the people who actually get presidents elected,

2050
01:58:11.370 --> 01:58:15.690
they don't want to choose people that have a lot of independent opinions.

2051
01:58:16.210 --> 01:58:19.020
They want to choose people that are just gonna be like,
okay,
sure,
sure.

2052
01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:20.040
Well that's John F.

2053
01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:23.520
Kennedy who want power so bad that they'll just be willing to do anything for
it,

2054
01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:25.710
you know,
and John F.
Kennedy,

2055
01:58:25.711 --> 01:58:29.010
that was like the big knock on him was that he wouldn't play ball is that,

2056
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.340
you know,

2057
01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:34.340
he had this idea in his head how he was going to do things and they shot it out

2058
01:58:34.561 --> 01:58:36.480
of them I think.
And people too,
you know,
there was like,

2059
01:58:36.481 --> 01:58:39.440
why don't they just do what they said they were going to do during the election.

2060
01:58:39.441 --> 01:58:41.200
And I found out once that,
you know,

2061
01:58:41.201 --> 01:58:45.310
there's a full day when you are elected where they take you to the CIA,

2062
01:58:45.311 --> 01:58:46.330
if you're elected president,

2063
01:58:46.690 --> 01:58:49.600
they take you there and they tell you all the secrets.

2064
01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:54.140
Like they tell you all the secrets that people don't know,
like,
uh,

2065
01:58:54.150 --> 01:58:57.070
for a full day,
they're just like,
okay,
here's,

2066
01:58:57.100 --> 01:59:00.430
here's all the shit that the American public does not know.

2067
01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:04.060
And then I feel like you're like,
oh,
well I can't do any of that stuff.

2068
01:59:04.061 --> 01:59:08.460
I said like,
there's like aliens pointing something at us,
you know,

2069
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:09.790
who knows what,
you know?
Well,

2070
01:59:09.791 --> 01:59:12.820
there's for sure some shit that we're doing like covertly,

2071
01:59:12.821 --> 01:59:16.900
but a lot of people were going to close Guantanamo Bay.
Actually.
I'm,
no,

2072
01:59:16.901 --> 01:59:21.880
you're not.
And here's why.
And you're like,
Oh yeah,
I'm not.
Yeah,
of course.

2073
01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:24.520
Yeah.
There's so much stuff.
Fuck.

2074
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:27.970
And there's so many financial interests I've got to pee.
Is that,
yeah.
Cool.

2075
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.820
Go ahead and I do that.
Yeah.
We got to wrap this thing up sooner.
Unfortunately.

2076
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:33.340
