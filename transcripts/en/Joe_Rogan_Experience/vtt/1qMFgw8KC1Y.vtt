<v Speaker 1>A woman was coming towards him.</v>

234
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.000
<v Speaker 1>It looked like he was just taking a bunch of cool photos of New York.</v>

235
00:07:54.001 --> 00:07:56.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them that he put up on his Instagram.</v>

239
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.890
<v Speaker 1>probably thought that he was perving,</v>

243
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 1>She hit him and he went on Twitter and went on this rant about violence,</v>

244
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:15.060
<v Speaker 1>about the black community and their propensity for violence about this woman</v>

245
00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.350
<v Speaker 1>calling her an animal,</v>

246

251
00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Anthony shows my all time favorite radio show.</v>

252
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I listened to it all the time and now all of a sudden it is no more.</v>

253
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:31.710

258
00:08:34.171 --> 00:08:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I no one panicked.</v>

259
00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Like may cause opie and Anthony both have kind of fuck you money.</v>

260
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Jim Norton doesn't.</v>

261
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.650
<v Speaker 1>So selfishly thinking,</v>

262
00:08:40.651 --> 00:08:40.981
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

263
00:08:40.981 --> 00:08:44.310
<v Speaker 1>well there goes everything because the show done well.</v>

264
00:08:44.311 --> 00:08:47.220
<v Speaker 1>You are always going to be great because you're a funny comic and you can always</v>

265
00:08:47.221 --> 00:08:49.080
<v Speaker 1>work and you never have to worry about that.</v>

266
00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:50.400
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

267
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it is a crazy thing,</v>

268
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:53.883
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

269
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:54.450
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

270
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:54.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

271
00:08:54.781 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden like</v>

272
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 3>that for things that he said on the show a hundred times.</v>

273
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.761
<v Speaker 3>I think what happened,</v>

274
00:09:00.761 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 3>I started,</v>

275
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 3>I think what happened was he tweeted,</v>

276
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 3>like he told,</v>

277
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I talked to him multiple times since then.</v>

278
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 3>He was walking and people don't believe that he was actually taking legitimate</v>

279
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:09.481
<v Speaker 3>in New York photos.</v>

280
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the points of contention.</v>

281
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 3>People like he was being creepy,</v>

282
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.720
<v Speaker 3>but he really wasn't like Anthony has had this giant Hubble like camera in the</v>

283
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 3>studio every day for probably six months now he's getting into photography.</v>

284
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 3>It's what he's been doing.</v>

285
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 3>So that was not unusual at all to hear.</v>

286
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 3>He was out and about taking photos.</v>

287
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:27.504
<v Speaker 3>That's legit.</v>

288
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 3>And I guess this woman got angry and I talked to him and he said that she just</v>

289
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:32.341
<v Speaker 3>said something like,</v>

290
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

291
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 3>you know this white boys,</v>

292
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:33.931
<v Speaker 3>take my picture,</v>

293
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 3>you white motherfucker,</v>

294
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

295
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 3>She said she clocked him and he kept defending himself.</v>

296
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 3>And as he's putting his arms up,</v>

297
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 3>she is going,</v>

298
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

299
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.230
<v Speaker 3>don't touch me.</v>

300
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:43.861
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

301
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:44.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

302
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 3>that thing like that a woman might do to prevent you from hitting her,</v>

303
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

304
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 3>and you could see how frightening that would be.</v>

305
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Cause then then people think you're beating on this woman.</v>

306
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

307
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 3>So he's putting his hand up and you know,</v>

308
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 3>I know him well enough to know he's not going to just punch a woman in the</v>

309
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 3>phase.</v>

310
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 3>So she's doing that.</v>

311
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:00.920
<v Speaker 3>And I think a few black guys came around and they didn't do anything to amp,</v>

312
00:10:00.921 --> 00:10:01.411
<v Speaker 3>but they were like,</v>

313
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:01.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

314
00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:02.400
<v Speaker 3>don't touch her.</v>

315
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.451
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

316
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:03.841
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

317
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:04.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

318
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 3>and who has always armed and he's licensed to carry,</v>

319
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

320
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.333
<v Speaker 3>didn't hit her.</v>

321
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.760
<v Speaker 3>It didn't pull out his pistol and a went home and I guess was really upset and</v>

322
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:15.961
<v Speaker 3>went out on,</v>

323
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:16.351
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

324
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 3>a Twitter rampage.</v>

325
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.321
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

326
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:20.154
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

327
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was bad the next morning when I saw it because my ex girlfriend called</v>

328
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:25.290
<v Speaker 3>me and she's like,</v>

329
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.111
<v Speaker 3>what happened with Anthony?</v>

330
00:10:26.111 --> 00:10:27.940
<v Speaker 3>He got beat up by a woman and there,</v>

331
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.411
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

332
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:30.640
<v Speaker 3>So I looked and I saw the tweets.</v>

333
00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:30.931
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

334
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

335
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 3>I actually texted him about one.</v>

336
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever done that before.</v>

337
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.120
<v Speaker 3>There was one that I texted her around that comes that you all right man,</v>

338
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.900
<v Speaker 3>does it?</v>

339
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.171
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

340
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:37.381
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

341
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:37.771
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine.</v>

342
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:38.604
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna Cocoa.</v>

343
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.983
<v Speaker 3>It was scary.</v>

344
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:40.883
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

345
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

346
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.301
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

347
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:42.740
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

348
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.740
<v Speaker 3>the thing about aunt is he's developed this sort of style of communicating on</v>

349
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 3>the show where he goes on these long,</v>

350
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 3>hilarious,</v>

351
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 3>entertaining profanity filled rants.</v>

352
00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.970
<v Speaker 3>And there's one thing about hearing it,</v>

353
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:05.180
<v Speaker 3>but there's another thing of like seeing it in a text form is this is not the</v>

354
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:06.114
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

355
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.230
<v Speaker 3>It looks at things don't,</v>

356
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 3>don't look good in print.</v>

357
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.293
<v Speaker 3>Certain things.</v>

358
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 3>And I think what happened was,</v>

359
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.030
<v Speaker 3>is in the middle of like when you have,</v>

360
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 3>you have a contextual conversation,</v>

361
00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:15.331
<v Speaker 3>it's like you have people,</v>

362
00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:16.440
<v Speaker 3>there's inflection,</v>

363
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.020
<v Speaker 3>there's another guy next to you going,</v>

364
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.211
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

365
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:18.391
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

366
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:19.111
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by that?</v>

367
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 3>And then you're clarifying it or it's just,</v>

368
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:25.290
<v Speaker 3>it's a different energy when you're tweeting and you're that mad.</v>

369
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.561
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

370
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 3>I think he like any type of an assault,</v>

371
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 3>even if it's a woman hitting you and it's not life threatening,</v>

372
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.270
<v Speaker 3>it's still like an hour later you're like,</v>

373
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.620
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck just happened?</v>

374
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Like I think it just freaked him out and she hit him a couple times,</v>

375
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:37.854
<v Speaker 3>five times or so,</v>

376
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.580
<v Speaker 3>and he showed me pictures of his face and he had like a little,</v>

377
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.930
<v Speaker 3>you could see that he had been struck him and he wasn't making it up.</v>

378
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 3>And so he went on and when I looked at the,</v>

379
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:46.131
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

380
00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:46.921
<v Speaker 3>the flow of things,</v>

381
00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 3>like I know Anthony and I know what he's saying.</v>

382
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.120
<v Speaker 3>He was not calling all black people animals.</v>

383
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:51.481
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't,</v>

384
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:52.530
<v Speaker 3>because he's never said that.</v>

385
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.940
<v Speaker 3>He's talking about a behavior of this woman.</v>

386
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 3>And I think that what happened was he was so mad.</v>

387
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 3>And when you're tweeting that aggressively and you've just,</v>

388
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking dealing with this in your head that sometimes things come out</v>

389
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.930
<v Speaker 3>jumbled and muddied.</v>

390
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:05.201
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

391
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:05.771
<v Speaker 3>if you know aunt,</v>

392
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:06.604
<v Speaker 3>you know what he's saying?</v>

393
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.361
<v Speaker 3>People who don't know,</v>

394
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm reading this going,</v>

395
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.071
<v Speaker 3>what does he mean?</v>

396
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 3>He's saying that there's violence in black people and their animals,</v>

397
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:16.630
<v Speaker 3>like people are putting these pieces of a puzzle together and they're making a</v>

398
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:18.430
<v Speaker 3>picture and it was like,</v>

399
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.863
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

400
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 3>I know him well enough to know that in a conversation if someone said,</v>

401
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 3>are you trying to say black people or animals,</v>

402
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 3>he would go,</v>

403
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

404
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.351
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

405
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:28.150
<v Speaker 3>It's a bay behavioral based that,</v>

406
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

407
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Cause you said that about white people too.</v>

408
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 3>So I mean it was just one of those things where once it was in print,</v>

409
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.500
<v Speaker 3>it's even in context,</v>

410
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 3>we lie as a country like you know like when cancel Colbert came out the,</v>

411
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 3>the activist knew the context that he was making those Asian jokes and didn't</v>

412
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 3>give a fuck.</v>

413
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 3>She still wanted to sink him.</v>

414
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.311
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

415
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:45.371
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

416
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:45.521
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

417
00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:46.001
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

418
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:46.481
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to,</v>

419
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

420
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.780
<v Speaker 3>showed the difference between the,</v>

421
00:12:47.781 --> 00:12:47.990
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

422
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.111
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

423
00:12:48.111 --> 00:12:50.860
<v Speaker 3>the same thing between this and native Americans and how ridiculous says but I</v>

424
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:51.694
<v Speaker 3>don't care.</v>

425
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 3>So we've gotten to a point now where we don't even pretend to not understand the</v>

426
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 3>context anymore.</v>

427
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 3>We admit that we understand the context that we go after people anyway.</v>

428
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 3>So something like this is bound to,</v>

429
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

430
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 3>to sink you because it can be taken both ways unless you actually sit there and</v>

431
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:10.660
<v Speaker 3>talk to the guy and each tweet has to come out like a film.</v>

432
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Each tweet has to be a beginning,</v>

433
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:13.061
<v Speaker 3>middle,</v>

434
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 3>and end with no explanation needed around it in order to,</v>

435
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.150
<v Speaker 3>to be survivable,</v>

436
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.200
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense.</v>

437
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:20.411
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

438
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:20.951
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

439
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:21.784
<v Speaker 3>the big,</v>

440
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.970
<v Speaker 3>big key to what you said that it could sink you will,</v>

441
00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 3>it only syncs you if you work for a company.</v>

442
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.270
<v Speaker 3>And in my opinion,</v>

443
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 3>that's unnecessary in this day and age,</v>

444
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:32.110
<v Speaker 3>it's unnecessary.</v>

445
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.210
<v Speaker 3>And I think you guys,</v>

446
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:39.040
<v Speaker 3>and I think Anthony for sure would be far better off with a podcast.</v>

447
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.470
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can get a podcast and put it on their phone.</v>

448
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 3>Now everybody's phone has a little Jack that sticks in your car and you play</v>

449
00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 3>your phone through your car.</v>

450
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has that now.</v>

451
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.921
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

452
00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 3>it's not an uncommon thing.</v>

453
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 3>It's more common to have that Jack than it is to have satellite radio.</v>

454
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Most people have to get a satellite radio thing installed in their car.</v>

455
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Most people already have that Jack,</v>

456
00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:58.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

457
00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

458
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.670
<v Speaker 3>it's so God damn easy.</v>

459
00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:01.150
<v Speaker 3>And I get,</v>

460
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I bet you could get all the same sponsors.</v>

461
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I bet you could get all of the same sponsors and you would have no middleman and</v>

462
00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:08.560
<v Speaker 3>you don't look at the studio.</v>

463
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:08.961
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

464
00:14:08.961 --> 00:14:10.780
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't take much to put something together.</v>

465
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:11.321
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

466
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:12.101
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of time,</v>

467
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of effort.</v>

468
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:13.451
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

469
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:14.990
<v Speaker 3>you gotta know someone who's an engineer,</v>

470
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.800
<v Speaker 3>know someone who knows how to put this stuff together and set up the</v>

471
00:14:17.801 --> 00:14:18.371
<v Speaker 3>microphones.</v>

472
00:14:18.371 --> 00:14:19.210
<v Speaker 3>But other than that,</v>

473
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 3>what's the difference between this and satellite radio?</v>

474
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.571
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>

475
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 3>the differences,</v>

476
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.640
<v Speaker 3>nobody can fucking fire you.</v>

477
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 3>You can go on some con rampage that fucking animal con and no one,</v>

478
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:30.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

479
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:31.121
<v Speaker 3>people might say,</v>

480
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:32.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm not downloading your podcast anymore,</v>

481
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.280
<v Speaker 3>but at least you have the opportunity to communicate,</v>

482
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.450
<v Speaker 3>to explain yourself.</v>

483
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 3>And if the people decide that they don't like your character based on one thing</v>

484
00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:43.840
<v Speaker 3>that you said or one rant that you went on,</v>

485
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.010
<v Speaker 3>that is their decision.</v>

486
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.900
<v Speaker 3>But it's not the decision of a company.</v>

487
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 3>And when things get Kino companies are squirrely man,</v>

488
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:55.291
<v Speaker 3>they have fucking and stocks and they have responsibilities and all you need is</v>

489
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:59.630
<v Speaker 3>a few activists that start web pages and you know,</v>

490
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 3>fire Anthony and Anthony can,</v>

491
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 3>we were going after those sponsors,</v>

492
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 3>we're going to let them know we're boycotting but mostly just noise.</v>

493
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Mostly nonsense.</v>

494
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 3>Mostly just soft targets.</v>

495
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.480
<v Speaker 3>But all you need is a few of those in up a fucking accompany will panic.</v>

496
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.240
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

497
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:15.861
<v Speaker 3>What happens is,</v>

498
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:16.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

499
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:17.750
<v Speaker 3>to $1 billion company,</v>

500
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:21.380
<v Speaker 3>so you get guys like you know Scott and Jim who runs it,</v>

501
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:22.401
<v Speaker 3>who you know,</v>

502
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:25.280
<v Speaker 3>they're just the 4th of July weekend was coming and then all of a sudden they're</v>

503
00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 3>getting phone calls from the New York Post and the Washington Post,</v>

504
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.630
<v Speaker 3>although all the press obviously has a narrative and they did a shit job.</v>

505
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.660
<v Speaker 3>But the Washington Post I thought was the worst offender with the way they</v>

506
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:36.141
<v Speaker 3>covered it.</v>

507
00:15:36.141 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Cause the woman wrote things.</v>

508
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:37.581
<v Speaker 3>It was just really,</v>

509
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 3>it was revolting to read,</v>

510
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.883
<v Speaker 3>which she right.</v>

511
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 3>She was talking about Anthony saying that these guys came around and she was</v>

512
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:45.794
<v Speaker 3>saying like,</v>

513
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.041
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

514
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:47.750
<v Speaker 3>well I guess if a bunch of African American where,</v>

515
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:48.081
<v Speaker 3>how was she?</v>

516
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Said a bunch of gentlemen want to defend that someone from defaming,</v>

517
00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 3>an African American woman.</v>

518
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:53.001
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

519
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:54.050
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what was happening.</v>

520
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:55.910
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't acknowledged and Anthony was being hit.</v>

521
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.520
<v Speaker 3>She acted like that.</v>

522
00:15:57.521 --> 00:15:59.590
<v Speaker 3>These guys had read his Twitter feed and not like it.</v>

523
00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 3>It was just like she read the Twitter feed in them in the future.</v>

524
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:03.590
<v Speaker 3>It was repulsive about this.</v>

525
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:03.741
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

526
00:16:03.741 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 3>a woman who looks like the fucking fake deaf interpreter from Mandela's funeral</v>

527
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.570
<v Speaker 3>was beating on Anthony,</v>

528
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.123
<v Speaker 3>but a</v>

529
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:12.963
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

530
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 3>that's a meme.</v>

531
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.020
<v Speaker 3>That guy's a meme.</v>

532
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.883
<v Speaker 3>He's rules.</v>

533
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.281
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

534
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:16.501
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

535
00:16:16.501 --> 00:16:18.110
<v Speaker 3>the company that these guys just getting,</v>

536
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:18.921
<v Speaker 3>all of the sudden they're just there.</v>

537
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 3>They're home and they're getting phone calls in the office the day before</v>

538
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 3>vacation.</v>

539
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 3>So what are your comments?</v>

540
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.240
<v Speaker 3>And they probably weren't even that familiar with it until they getting calls</v>

541
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 3>from the paper and they're like,</v>

542
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.080
<v Speaker 3>what do we do with this?</v>

543
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.200
<v Speaker 3>And then this is what the press does and this is why you got to hate them</v>

544
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 3>because I think Sirius was going to try to write it out.</v>

545
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:33.050
<v Speaker 3>That's my opinion.</v>

546
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Cause they knew a holiday weekend was coming.</v>

547
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:35.841
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

548
00:16:35.841 --> 00:16:35.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

549
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.080
<v Speaker 3>this is purely a guess because no one was saying anything.</v>

550
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden the press starts going,</v>

551
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.370
<v Speaker 3>we have not had a comment from Sirius satellite radio.</v>

552
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 3>So we're assuming that they agree with Mr. Coleman has opinions.</v>

553
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.690
<v Speaker 3>They do this sneaky shit to push you into defending yourself.</v>

554
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.760
<v Speaker 3>So now the company with shareholders,</v>

555
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:53.101
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

556
00:16:53.101 --> 00:16:53.481
<v Speaker 3>it has to go,</v>

557
00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:53.601
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

558
00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:55.430
<v Speaker 3>how do we tell people that we don't agree with?</v>

559
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.510
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like if the press is the made them do it,</v>

560
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.550
<v Speaker 3>but the press understands how to corner you into giving a statement,</v>

561
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:05.660
<v Speaker 3>a definitive statement,</v>

562
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.310
<v Speaker 3>cause they know that you're not used to this.</v>

563
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.290
<v Speaker 3>They know that these guys come into work,</v>

564
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:09.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

565
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 3>in management positions are not used to getting phone calls going.</v>

566
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:14.900
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about this statement and that statement?</v>

567
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:15.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

568
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.310
<v Speaker 3>it was really,</v>

569
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.720
<v Speaker 3>it was a very frustrating thing when I saw at the press did with it that that to</v>

570
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:23.590
<v Speaker 3>me is always who my biggest complaint is with always it's wordpress.</v>

571
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.540
<v Speaker 3>This is no nuance to the way they report on certain things like this cause</v>

572
00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:28.820
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

573
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.140
<v Speaker 3>there's nuance to this,</v>

574
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 3>especially if you look into it and character.</v>

575
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.740
<v Speaker 3>If you in context rather if you understand that guy and you,</v>

576
00:17:35.741 --> 00:17:36.860
<v Speaker 3>you look at him.</v>

577
00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.221
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

578
00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:42.221
<v Speaker 3>there is a problem with violence in the black community to pretend there's not a</v>

579
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:45.770
<v Speaker 3>problem with violence in the black community is to pretend that there aren't</v>

580
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.830
<v Speaker 3>insane amounts of murders going on in Chicago to that there's not issues with</v>

581
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 3>the amount of black people that are in jail.</v>

582
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 3>The percentage of the population now are those economic problems,</v>

583
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.970
<v Speaker 3>are those problems related to upbringing?</v>

584
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.960
<v Speaker 3>Are those pro yes.</v>

585
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.591
<v Speaker 3>Education?</v>

586
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

587
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

588
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.930
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of fucking disparity.</v>

589
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:05.490
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of problems with poverty.</v>

590
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.090
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of problems with the structure of our culture itself and that you</v>

591
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 3>could attribute a lot of those problems to racism,</v>

592
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 3>to racism in the way that funds are allocated.</v>

593
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:15.940
<v Speaker 3>The way that you know,</v>

594
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.100
<v Speaker 3>the attention that society puts on impoverished communities.</v>

595
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.300
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely institutionalized,</v>

596
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.780
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

597
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.800
<v Speaker 3>But to pretend that it's not a problem is ridiculous.</v>

598
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.210
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>

599
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 3>So when he's taking a picture of some chick and she starts punching him,</v>

600
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.370
<v Speaker 3>I think he's allowed to talk about the problem with violence,</v>

601
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.780
<v Speaker 3>with that community,</v>

602
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.260
<v Speaker 3>with the community that this person is from that's beating him up.</v>

603
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Did he do it the right way?</v>

604
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.563
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

605
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.381
<v Speaker 3>absolutely not.</v>

606
00:18:43.381 --> 00:18:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Did he do it in a way that can be misconstrued or construed or interpreted as</v>

607
00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:47.550
<v Speaker 3>racist?</v>

608
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely did.</v>

609
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:48.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

610
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:49.321
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

611
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 3>He fucked up.</v>

612
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.090
<v Speaker 3>He did it the wrong way.</v>

613
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 3>He probably shouldn't have done it on Twitter.</v>

614
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.000
<v Speaker 3>You probably should have made a video.</v>

615
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 3>You probably should have made a video explaining,</v>

616
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.330
<v Speaker 3>showing what happened to him and explaining what goes on.</v>

617
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.800
<v Speaker 3>Explaining this 140 fucking characters things.</v>

618
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 3>He's a big part of the problem it would add.</v>

619
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:08.460
<v Speaker 3>So that's exactly what it was.</v>

620
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Because Anthony is so good at clarify.</v>

621
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you talk about race or a million other things,</v>

622
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:14.544
<v Speaker 3>whether it's religion,</v>

623
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:20.080
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to make your point without stepping in shit and then having to go</v>

624
00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:22.860
<v Speaker 3>off on 50 a digression.</v>

625
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:23.061
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

626
00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:23.221
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

627
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:23.941
<v Speaker 3>that's not what I meant him.</v>

628
00:19:23.941 --> 00:19:24.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

629
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.601
<v Speaker 3>that's not what I meant.</v>

630
00:19:24.601 --> 00:19:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

631
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.020
<v Speaker 3>and that's the worst part of discussing stuff is that people jump on the side.</v>

632
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:29.640
<v Speaker 3>What are you saying that all people do?</v>

633
00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:30.300
<v Speaker 3>And we'll all black too.</v>

634
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:30.661
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

635
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:31.494
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

636
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.900
<v Speaker 3>So in order to be able to get your point across,</v>

637
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:35.130
<v Speaker 3>you have to walk a narrow,</v>

638
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.370
<v Speaker 3>you almost have to close people's argument doors,</v>

639
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.260
<v Speaker 3>like a get smart episode.</v>

640
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:41.790
<v Speaker 3>As you're walking this way,</v>

641
00:19:41.791 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 3>your point gets through.</v>

642
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.770
<v Speaker 3>And Anthony is a genius at doing that.</v>

643
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.340
<v Speaker 3>A genius at it because we've debated race so many times,</v>

644
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.031
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

645
00:19:51.031 --> 00:19:51.481
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

646
00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:52.200
<v Speaker 3>on the show at him.</v>

647
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.033
<v Speaker 3>But trace,</v>

648
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.550
<v Speaker 3>we'd go back and forth and,</v>

649
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.520
<v Speaker 3>and Patrice loved Anthony Cause he said Anthony,</v>

650
00:19:56.521 --> 00:19:57.630
<v Speaker 3>he's an adorable racist.</v>

651
00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:57.751
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

652
00:19:57.751 --> 00:19:58.760
<v Speaker 3>Patrice was so funny with,</v>

653
00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.161
<v Speaker 3>he never,</v>

654
00:19:59.161 --> 00:19:59.580
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

655
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.180
<v Speaker 3>never was upset by Anthony's opinions because Anthony would listen to him and</v>

656
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 3>they would go back and forth.</v>

657
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Half The Times Patrice was right and half the time Anthony was right.</v>

658
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.210
<v Speaker 3>But on Twitter I think like,</v>

659
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 3>like in that emotion when you're saying x,</v>

660
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:12.744
<v Speaker 3>Y and Z,</v>

661
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.230
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

662
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he did as good a job as he should have done of closing those doors</v>

663
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:18.841
<v Speaker 3>behind him.</v>

664
00:20:18.841 --> 00:20:23.841
<v Speaker 3>Almost like sealing off things that people can get to you on because he was so</v>

665
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:25.740
<v Speaker 3>upset because he had had a physical assault.</v>

666
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 3>And I know it sounds like I'm talking in circles and just defending my friend,</v>

667
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.060
<v Speaker 3>but I've been with him for 10 years in this medium of totally uncensored.</v>

668
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.530
<v Speaker 3>And I'm telling you,</v>

669
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:36.660
<v Speaker 3>I know him well enough to know that he's like,</v>

670
00:20:36.661 --> 00:20:40.050
<v Speaker 3>he's got weird things where he'll talk about race and people misinterpret them</v>

671
00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:43.350
<v Speaker 3>and I've talked to him privately and the guy does not hate black people and I</v>

672
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:45.450
<v Speaker 3>know that that's just all his friends defending him.</v>

673
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>But I'm telling you that he does not because I know him well.</v>

674
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 3>And then to hear people going,</v>

675
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 3>he hates black people.</v>

676
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:55.261
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's in this not afraid of being misconstrued or interpreted as</v>

677
00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:56.411
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

678
00:20:56.411 --> 00:21:00.640
<v Speaker 3>He's not afraid of it by saying what he really believes is his opinion about</v>

679
00:21:00.641 --> 00:21:02.470
<v Speaker 3>certain aspects of a group,</v>

680
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.370
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

681
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:03.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

682
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:04.050
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>

683
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:04.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

684
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:04.661
<v Speaker 3>gender,</v>

685
00:21:04.661 --> 00:21:05.494
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

686
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.370
<v Speaker 3>He's not afraid of speaking his mind about things because he's got that fuck you</v>

687
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:09.760
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

688
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part of it.</v>

689
00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 3>And he's got 150,000 guns.</v>

690
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:13.203
<v Speaker 3>Those are the two things.</v>

691
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.170
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

692
00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:18.580
<v Speaker 3>a big part of it that drove me fucking crazy is people are not,</v>

693
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.760
<v Speaker 3>they're not taking into account the reaction that someone has when they get</v>

694
00:21:21.761 --> 00:21:22.540
<v Speaker 3>assaulted.</v>

695
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Because when you get hit by someone,</v>

696
00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:28.110
<v Speaker 3>some fucking stranger that you don't know hits you as specially when you've got</v>

697
00:21:28.111 --> 00:21:29.290
<v Speaker 3>a gone,</v>

698
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.970
<v Speaker 3>you've got a fucking bullet launching gun,</v>

699
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.390
<v Speaker 3>you've got a thing inside you that has explosions,</v>

700
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 3>you press a trigger,</v>

701
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 3>explosions propelled bullets and they end lives instantly.</v>

702
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:47.290
<v Speaker 3>And Anthony's an expert with one and he has it on him at all times and he's</v>

703
00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 3>getting hit and he's like,</v>

704
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

705
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.440
<v Speaker 3>And so he gets on left fucking animal con.</v>

706
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah Bitch,</v>

707
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:54.550
<v Speaker 3>fuck you this back.</v>

708
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:55.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

709
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Speaker 3>it's getting hit is a very disturbing thing.</v>

710
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.130
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

711
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:00.371
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

712
00:22:00.371 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Speaker 3>there's one thing to get hit and it's like getting hit in a sparring session is</v>

713
00:22:04.001 --> 00:22:05.410
<v Speaker 3>infuriating with people.</v>

714
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.580
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen people go fucking crazy cause they get choked out in a Jujitsu</v>

715
00:22:09.581 --> 00:22:10.240
<v Speaker 3>session,</v>

716
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.530
<v Speaker 3>getting punched his way,</v>

717
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:12.364
<v Speaker 3>more traumatic,</v>

718
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.780
<v Speaker 3>getting punched by a stranger multiple times for taking a fucking photograph.</v>

719
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the exchange was between the two of them.</v>

720
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.601
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

721
00:22:20.601 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

722
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.380
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

723
00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.970
<v Speaker 3>if he was saying something that was infuriating,</v>

724
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:25.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

725
00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:25.641
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

726
00:22:25.641 --> 00:22:26.474
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't there,</v>

727
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:26.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

728
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna pretend I was there.</v>

729
00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:28.511
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

730
00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:32.230
<v Speaker 3>you've got to take into account the reaction that people have when you hit them.</v>

731
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.401
<v Speaker 3>And it would it to me,</v>

732
00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:33.791
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

733
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:35.560
<v Speaker 3>I hate to keep going back to the press,</v>

734
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.800
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't focus on the fact that he,</v>

735
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.730
<v Speaker 3>like he handled himself properly in that because I know I would,</v>

736
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I would have pulled the gun in that moment,</v>

737
00:22:43.271 --> 00:22:45.770
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a panicky Pete and I would just been,</v>

738
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.990
<v Speaker 3>what other guys were coming over,</v>

739
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:48.190
<v Speaker 3>I would have at least brandished it.</v>

740
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.580
<v Speaker 3>And he acted physically responsible like as a,</v>

741
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.030
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

742
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.800
<v Speaker 3>as a fucking guy with a pistol on him.</v>

743
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Cause people get shot all the time for dumb arguments and dumb things.</v>

744
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:58.620
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

745
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:03.620
<v Speaker 3>he handled himself absolutely right and lost his cool once he got home and uh,</v>

746
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.350
<v Speaker 3>people didn't take the press,</v>

747
00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:06.250
<v Speaker 3>didn't take that into account.</v>

748
00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:08.350
<v Speaker 3>They hopped on the fact that he didn't get a police report.</v>

749
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:09.591
<v Speaker 3>And I wished he had.</v>

750
00:23:09.591 --> 00:23:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Now in hindsight,</v>

751
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.650
<v Speaker 3>because they're all going,</v>

752
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:12.161
<v Speaker 3>Mr Colby,</v>

753
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 3>did I get a police report?</v>

754
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:13.840
<v Speaker 3>But here's the deal.</v>

755
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Had he gotten a police report,</v>

756
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 3>they would have just ignored it.</v>

757
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.920
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't have said,</v>

758
00:23:17.921 --> 00:23:19.390
<v Speaker 3>well at least he got a police report.</v>

759
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.340
<v Speaker 3>They would have glanced over the fact and then said,</v>

760
00:23:21.341 --> 00:23:21.521
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

761
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:22.660
<v Speaker 3>well I ain't look and get a police report,</v>

762
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.840
<v Speaker 3>so they would just using that as a reason to kind of ignore the fact that he got</v>

763
00:23:25.841 --> 00:23:26.051
<v Speaker 3>hit.</v>

764
00:23:26.051 --> 00:23:26.261
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

765
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:26.311
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

766
00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:27.640
<v Speaker 3>we didn't see a police report.</v>

767
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.210
<v Speaker 3>All the press harped on the fact that he didn't get a police report,</v>

768
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.620
<v Speaker 3>but Ansi response was,</v>

769
00:23:32.621 --> 00:23:33.160
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>

770
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:33.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

771
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.960
<v Speaker 3>I know enough cops to know that me getting hit by some lady in Times Square is</v>

772
00:23:37.961 --> 00:23:41.020
<v Speaker 3>not a fucking priority for Nyp d who's worried about terrorists.</v>

773
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:41.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

774
00:23:41.381 --> 00:23:42.580
<v Speaker 3>especially if he's fine.</v>

775
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a real issue also with the press</v>

776
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of people in the press.</v>

777
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll clarify that.</v>

778
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.880
<v Speaker 1>What they're trying to do is they're trying to close those get smart doors as</v>

779
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 1>they write a piece as well,</v>

780
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.460
<v Speaker 1>and as they're writing a piece,</v>

781
00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:00.590
<v Speaker 1>they are also trying to placate all the people that are going to be up in arms</v>

782
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:01.580
<v Speaker 1>about their opinions.</v>

783
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.040
<v Speaker 1>If they could possibly be supporting a racist,</v>

784
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 1>if they could possibly be taking his side,</v>

785
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:07.310
<v Speaker 1>agreeing with him,</v>

786
00:24:07.311 --> 00:24:08.540
<v Speaker 1>seeing his point of view,</v>

787
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 1>they could be misinterpreted or they could be interpreted as being racist as</v>

788
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:13.760
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

789
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.320
<v Speaker 1>So they have to worry about that as well.</v>

790
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're with a liberal rag,</v>

791
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

792
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 1>if you have a very liberal newspaper that you work for and they have a clear</v>

793
00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:21.831
<v Speaker 1>agenda,</v>

794
00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:22.700
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of them do,</v>

795
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:23.810
<v Speaker 1>the Washington Times does,</v>

796
00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:24.110
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

797
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll wash it.</v>

798
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Absolute washing post does.</v>

799
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them that have a liberal slant and if you are reporting for</v>

800
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

801
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

802
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:34.790
<v Speaker 1>and it's something like this that's very controversial and something where</v>

803
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:35.190
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

804
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things that automatically have like a knee jerk reaction to</v>

805
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:38.990
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

806
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of them knee jerk reaction to what's conceived as racist.</v>

807
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:43.630
<v Speaker 1>It perceived as racist.</v>

808
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.991
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

809
00:24:43.991 --> 00:24:44.240
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

810
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.730
<v Speaker 3>and another thing that they do that's even,</v>

811
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.760
<v Speaker 3>that's even more enraging is what people who write for the press now have to do</v>

812
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.370
<v Speaker 3>is not just reporting what happened.</v>

813
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.660
<v Speaker 3>It's how do I editorialize under the guise of being impartial.</v>

814
00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.480
<v Speaker 3>And they do that a lot too and that I don't like either.</v>

815
00:25:01.481 --> 00:25:03.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like that to me is the worst crime they commit.</v>

816
00:25:03.491 --> 00:25:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

817
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.960
<v Speaker 3>It's the editorializing as they're going along.</v>

818
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Like it's legitimate.</v>

819
00:25:09.071 --> 00:25:09.371
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

820
00:25:09.371 --> 00:25:10.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

821
00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.310
<v Speaker 3>like NBC and I'm on a Zimmerman Fan.</v>

822
00:25:12.311 --> 00:25:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Either aunt was a big supporter.</v>

823
00:25:13.451 --> 00:25:13.961
<v Speaker 3>Zimmerman,</v>

824
00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:16.240
<v Speaker 3>I thought Zimmerman should have went to jail for something.</v>

825
00:25:16.241 --> 00:25:18.430
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what legally I have no ground to stand on,</v>

826
00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:19.450
<v Speaker 3>but I kind of thought he was a con,</v>

827
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.320
<v Speaker 3>but a but button on a guy who was out to commit a murder or either,</v>

828
00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:24.640
<v Speaker 3>I thought there was a line in between,</v>

829
00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:25.390
<v Speaker 3>but whatever,</v>

830
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.660
<v Speaker 3>like NBC edited that tape like Eh,</v>

831
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:29.570
<v Speaker 3>can't do.</v>

832
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.950
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason to do that unless you're pushing something.</v>

833
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.980
<v Speaker 3>But they're doing it under the guise of being impartial and I'm sure they've</v>

834
00:25:35.981 --> 00:25:37.660
<v Speaker 3>done it plenty of times to vilify blacks.</v>

835
00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:38.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying they haven't,</v>

836
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.550
<v Speaker 3>he lost that lawsuit,</v>

837
00:25:39.551 --> 00:25:40.100
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

838
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.320
<v Speaker 3>I know he did crazy.</v>

839
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:42.011
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

840
00:25:42.011 --> 00:25:43.390
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely nuts.</v>

841
00:25:43.391 --> 00:25:46.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why the news has such a different level of what they can get away</v>

842
00:25:46.721 --> 00:25:49.570
<v Speaker 3>with and what they can do because they're seen as doing a public service.</v>

843
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.381
<v Speaker 3>In my opinion though,</v>

844
00:25:50.381 --> 00:25:53.100
<v Speaker 3>I think they lost it because everybody was hating that guy and they just want,</v>

845
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.570
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want him to win something on top of this.</v>

846
00:25:55.571 --> 00:25:57.090
<v Speaker 3>The fact that he's still has his freedom,</v>

847
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.040
<v Speaker 3>the kid lost his life.</v>

848
00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>

849
00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.140
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a sucky fucking security guard.</v>

850
00:26:02.141 --> 00:26:02.800
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

851
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

852
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.850
<v Speaker 3>I think if you're going to look at that guy and find fault and what he did,</v>

853
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.090
<v Speaker 3>it's how did he handle the situation and what a more confident,</v>

854
00:26:10.091 --> 00:26:11.920
<v Speaker 3>competent person have handled it the same way.</v>

855
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.630
<v Speaker 3>Like here's a perfect example.</v>

856
00:26:13.631 --> 00:26:15.610
<v Speaker 3>My friend big John McCarthy who was a cop,</v>

857
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.990
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you,</v>

858
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.890
<v Speaker 3>you know the referee.</v>

859
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:18.801
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

860
00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:18.931
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

861
00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:19.764
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

862
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.490
<v Speaker 3>That guy was a cop a long time,</v>

863
00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.570
<v Speaker 3>but great guy,</v>

864
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.370
<v Speaker 3>but knows how to handle shit.</v>

865
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.940
<v Speaker 3>If Big John McCarthy saw that kid walking in the neighborhood,</v>

866
00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:28.841
<v Speaker 3>he probably would have said,</v>

867
00:26:28.841 --> 00:26:29.530
<v Speaker 3>how you doing man?</v>

868
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.363
<v Speaker 3>Everything cool.</v>

869
00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:30.691
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

870
00:26:30.691 --> 00:26:32.020
<v Speaker 3>it had a conversation with him.</v>

871
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.370
<v Speaker 3>Everything would've been fine.</v>

872
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.000
<v Speaker 3>Like even if the kid got up in arms or got mouthy with them,</v>

873
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.830
<v Speaker 3>he would have probably calmed them down,</v>

874
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:39.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

875
00:26:39.401 --> 00:26:41.740
<v Speaker 3>without having to get into some physical altercations.</v>

876
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Not only the kid wouldn't have been able to mount them and bash his fucking head</v>

877
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:47.620
<v Speaker 3>off the ground because he's physically in competent.</v>

878
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.160
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to fucking could patrol the neighborhood,</v>

879
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.540
<v Speaker 3>you can't do it just with a gun,</v>

880
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:51.820
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

881
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Can't be,</v>

882
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 3>you can't have the only,</v>

883
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.830
<v Speaker 3>the last resort is your only resort.</v>

884
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:56.371
<v Speaker 3>You keep,</v>

885
00:26:56.371 --> 00:26:57.600
<v Speaker 3>can't physically defend himself.</v>

886
00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 3>He's out of shape.</v>

887
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:02.820
<v Speaker 3>He's soft and doughy and he's not physically able to hold that guy off.</v>

888
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 3>But yet he's put himself in this position where he's like a security.</v>

889
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.290
<v Speaker 3>He's the force of,</v>

890
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:07.501
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

891
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 3>of the truth of the law.</v>

892
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

893
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:10.051
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

894
00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

895
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.330
<v Speaker 3>you're not qualified for that job.</v>

896
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.343
<v Speaker 3>He's just not.</v>

897
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 3>So when that kid's on top of him bouncing his fucking head off the curb,</v>

898
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

899
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't see any way out for him other than using a weapon right when that kid is</v>

900
00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Speaker 3>beating the shit out of him.</v>

901
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.680
<v Speaker 3>But he should have never gotten to that position.</v>

902
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:26.490
<v Speaker 3>He should've never,</v>

903
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 3>it should've never escalated to that.</v>

904
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.160
<v Speaker 3>You're telling me the only way to people can communicate like that is it comes</v>

905
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:32.994
<v Speaker 3>into violence.</v>

906
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:33.361
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

907
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:33.800
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

908
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 3>it's how do you deal with it?</v>

909
00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 3>How do you communicate?</v>

910
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.740
<v Speaker 3>How did you address this person?</v>

911
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.990
<v Speaker 3>What did you say when he talked back to you?</v>

912
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:40.891
<v Speaker 3>What did you say?</v>

913
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:41.401
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>

914
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:42.810
<v Speaker 3>what were the exchange of words?</v>

915
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.351
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

916
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:43.950
<v Speaker 3>and those,</v>

917
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:44.611
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

918
00:27:44.611 --> 00:27:45.930
<v Speaker 3>There's a big difference between,</v>

919
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 3>there's a video that we played the other day.</v>

920
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

921
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 3>was there some,</v>

922
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.041
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

923
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:50.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

924
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.300
<v Speaker 3>do you even lift bro?</v>

925
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:52.163
<v Speaker 3>You ever see that guy?</v>

926
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.670
<v Speaker 3>The Russian guy?</v>

927
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.533
<v Speaker 3>Is He Russian?</v>

928
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.510
<v Speaker 4>There's even a worst one though.</v>

929
00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.631
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

930
00:27:57.631 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 4>The Pakistani kids though,</v>

931
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:00.840
<v Speaker 4>in New York where the Bronx,</v>

932
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.160
<v Speaker 4>the police chief in Bronx,</v>

933
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:02.731
<v Speaker 4>New York was like,</v>

934
00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 4>stop doing it.</v>

935
00:28:03.601 --> 00:28:04.860
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get killed.</v>

936
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.030
<v Speaker 4>That like these two kids had just gone to youtube and they go up to people and,</v>

937
00:28:08.031 --> 00:28:09.540
<v Speaker 4>and horrible neighborhoods and are like,</v>

938
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:10.420
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

939
00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.830
<v Speaker 4>you got a problem while he's holding a calculator and he's just trying to be</v>

940
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:14.251
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>

941
00:28:14.251 --> 00:28:17.550
<v Speaker 4>But these guys are just bashing their heads in and stuff and said the Bronx,</v>

942
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.780
<v Speaker 4>a chief police or something.</v>

943
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:19.201
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

944
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:19.471
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

945
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:20.041
<v Speaker 4>stop it.</v>

946
00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:20.351
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

947
00:28:20.351 --> 00:28:21.184
<v Speaker 4>these videos,</v>

948
00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.220
<v Speaker 3>my point is if you watch those videos,</v>

949
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:24.881
<v Speaker 3>the guy,</v>

950
00:28:24.881 --> 00:28:25.421
<v Speaker 3>he comes up to,</v>

951
00:28:25.421 --> 00:28:27.430
<v Speaker 3>people that look like they work out and goes,</v>

952
00:28:27.431 --> 00:28:28.211
<v Speaker 3>do you even lift bro?</v>

953
00:28:28.211 --> 00:28:29.044
<v Speaker 3>Look how small you are.</v>

954
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.660
<v Speaker 3>And some people handle it.</v>

955
00:28:31.661 --> 00:28:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

956
00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.430
<v Speaker 3>Some people go,</v>

957
00:28:33.431 --> 00:28:33.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

958
00:28:33.731 --> 00:28:33.911
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

959
00:28:33.911 --> 00:28:34.211
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

960
00:28:34.211 --> 00:28:34.541
<v Speaker 3>I don't even,</v>

961
00:28:34.541 --> 00:28:35.231
<v Speaker 3>don't pull it up.</v>

962
00:28:35.231 --> 00:28:36.064
<v Speaker 3>We don't need to see it.</v>

963
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.911
<v Speaker 3>Some people go,</v>

964
00:28:36.911 --> 00:28:37.241
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

965
00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't even lift,</v>

966
00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:38.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

967
00:28:38.801 --> 00:28:39.670
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm small.</v>

968
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.050
<v Speaker 3>And then they laugh and they walk away.</v>

969
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.550
<v Speaker 3>And some people like threatened them.</v>

970
00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.390
<v Speaker 3>Like it,</v>

971
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:47.100
<v Speaker 3>it depends entirely on how to people interact with each other.</v>

972
00:28:47.101 --> 00:28:47.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

973
00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:51.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what we don't know about the Anthony situation.</v>

974
00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.460
<v Speaker 3>That's what we don't know about the Zimmerman situation.</v>

975
00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.070
<v Speaker 3>It's not just about what went down,</v>

976
00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.350
<v Speaker 3>it's about how did it all play out,</v>

977
00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.180
<v Speaker 3>how could it have been avoided?</v>

978
00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.450
<v Speaker 3>There's little subtleties in language like when Jonah Hill is apologizing</v>

979
00:29:04.451 --> 00:29:05.284
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>

980
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:05.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

981
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:05.891
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>

982
00:29:05.891 --> 00:29:06.041
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

983
00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:07.190
<v Speaker 3>and he's obviously not a homophobe.</v>

984
00:29:07.191 --> 00:29:08.080
<v Speaker 3>We just got mad and said,</v>

985
00:29:08.081 --> 00:29:08.771
<v Speaker 3>suck my Dick Faggot.</v>

986
00:29:08.771 --> 00:29:10.120
<v Speaker 3>It was a stupid thing in a moment.</v>

987
00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.610
<v Speaker 3>And he's at the tonight show and again,</v>

988
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.230
<v Speaker 3>he's just apologizing is I don't think he never had to deal with something like</v>

989
00:29:14.231 --> 00:29:14.740
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

990
00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.521
<v Speaker 3>And he said something.</v>

991
00:29:15.521 --> 00:29:15.791
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

992
00:29:15.791 --> 00:29:15.961
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

993
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:17.050
<v Speaker 3>the intent doesn't matter.</v>

994
00:29:17.051 --> 00:29:17.801
<v Speaker 3>It's the word,</v>

995
00:29:17.801 --> 00:29:18.634
<v Speaker 3>the words.</v>

996
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.481
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>

997
00:29:19.481 --> 00:29:19.780
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

998
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.780
<v Speaker 3>I know you're on the spot in that moment and I'm not going to crucify the guy,</v>

999
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.960
<v Speaker 3>but I wish I was there so I could just appear on the seat next to him.</v>

1000
00:29:25.961 --> 00:29:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Like in that woody Allen scene,</v>

1001
00:29:26.921 --> 00:29:29.080
<v Speaker 3>when the guy walks out to correct the guy on line and go,</v>

1002
00:29:29.081 --> 00:29:29.291
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1003
00:29:29.291 --> 00:29:30.430
<v Speaker 3>the intent is everything.</v>

1004
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:34.180
<v Speaker 3>Because if the words don't matter the next time somebody said the fucking giants</v>

1005
00:29:34.181 --> 00:29:35.020
<v Speaker 3>killed the jets,</v>

1006
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.550
<v Speaker 3>well we'd better call the police.</v>

1007
00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:37.061
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1008
00:29:37.061 --> 00:29:37.870
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1009
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:38.591
<v Speaker 3>It's the intent.</v>

1010
00:29:38.591 --> 00:29:39.640
<v Speaker 3>We understand every,</v>

1011
00:29:39.641 --> 00:29:40.151
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

1012
00:29:40.151 --> 00:29:44.230
<v Speaker 3>every single interaction or phrase has an intent behind it,</v>

1013
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:44.740
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1014
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.250
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't always come through in the written word.</v>

1015
00:29:47.251 --> 00:29:49.990
<v Speaker 3>It's just that it's an inflection and that's something that you and I had a</v>

1016
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:54.760
<v Speaker 3>conversation about with the Tracy Morgan situation with the people pretending</v>

1017
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 3>that what he was saying when he was on stage,</v>

1018
00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:59.560
<v Speaker 3>you know that he was going to stab a sign of his son was gay.</v>

1019
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Like his whole act is filled with him saying ridiculous shit.</v>

1020
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.200
<v Speaker 3>This is not a statement.</v>

1021
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 3>It's not an affidavit.</v>

1022
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 3>He's making court.</v>

1023
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.831
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1024
00:30:07.831 --> 00:30:10.570
<v Speaker 3>you're taking it out of context because it's a soft target.</v>

1025
00:30:10.571 --> 00:30:11.404
<v Speaker 3>If you do that,</v>

1026
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.861
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1027
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stab my son because he's gay.</v>

1028
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.730
<v Speaker 3>As a statement of fact or at the,</v>

1029
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:19.210
<v Speaker 3>at the end of a political rally is a pretty awful thing to say,</v>

1030
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.900
<v Speaker 3>but if you've opened up with I'm going to get you pregnant and I'm going to mold</v>

1031
00:30:22.901 --> 00:30:24.190
<v Speaker 3>shit and make a hat out of it,</v>

1032
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.680
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of hard to take any one statement and go,</v>

1033
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 3>well that's the serious one.</v>

1034
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:28.871
<v Speaker 3>But that's again,</v>

1035
00:30:28.871 --> 00:30:32.500
<v Speaker 3>that's that purposely ignoring context or even when you can't ignore it saying,</v>

1036
00:30:32.501 --> 00:30:32.651
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1037
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:34.690
<v Speaker 3>we understand the context and we don't fucking care.</v>

1038
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 3>It's just soft targets.</v>

1039
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:38.830
<v Speaker 3>People find soft targets and those targets,</v>

1040
00:30:38.831 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1041
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.470
<v Speaker 3>if they're all ganging up on Anthony too.</v>

1042
00:30:41.471 --> 00:30:42.220
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing.</v>

1043
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying Boo Hoo Anthony,</v>

1044
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.490
<v Speaker 3>let's pay attention to what's really going on.</v>

1045
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:49.120
<v Speaker 3>If you're writing an article out of the blue for no reason about Jim Norton,</v>

1046
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:49.631
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1047
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:50.464
<v Speaker 3>you're the only guy,</v>

1048
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.830
<v Speaker 3>I think Jim Norton is a despicable person and you write this article,</v>

1049
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.680
<v Speaker 3>you have the option to respond to that and you can go,</v>

1050
00:30:56.681 --> 00:30:56.861
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1051
00:30:56.861 --> 00:30:58.840
<v Speaker 3>who are you mister reporter,</v>

1052
00:30:58.841 --> 00:30:59.561
<v Speaker 3>Dick Wad.</v>

1053
00:30:59.561 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Let's take a look at you.</v>

1054
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.980
<v Speaker 3>And then other people can take a look at him too.</v>

1055
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.960
<v Speaker 3>But when everybody's piling on,</v>

1056
00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:06.100
<v Speaker 3>it's a free for all.</v>

1057
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.670
<v Speaker 3>It's a free ride and then you're there flailing wildly.</v>

1058
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.400
<v Speaker 3>All the Louie Louie CK actually raised a really good point about that.</v>

1059
00:31:12.401 --> 00:31:13.240
<v Speaker 3>When something has happened,</v>

1060
00:31:13.241 --> 00:31:13.451
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

1061
00:31:13.451 --> 00:31:13.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1062
00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:14.381
<v Speaker 3>you have to remember too,</v>

1063
00:31:14.381 --> 00:31:15.610
<v Speaker 3>everybody's not googling you.</v>

1064
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.480
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone is not googling Joe Rogan or Jim Norton or Anthony Kumi at like,</v>

1065
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:20.530
<v Speaker 3>so you're seeing,</v>

1066
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:21.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1067
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.880
<v Speaker 3>every result of that yourself and it appears overwhelming.</v>

1068
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.530
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is like people may be reading news day or the post or the Gawker</v>

1069
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.900
<v Speaker 3>or vice or you know,</v>

1070
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:31.751
<v Speaker 3>whatever they're reading,</v>

1071
00:31:31.751 --> 00:31:36.100
<v Speaker 3>but they're not reading every single article on Anthony Kumiai or on Jim Norton.</v>

1072
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.270
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

1073
00:31:37.271 --> 00:31:41.200
<v Speaker 3>that's where the overwhelming thing is sometimes misleading because people are</v>

1074
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 3>all reading little snippets of it.</v>

1075
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:43.980
<v Speaker 3>But when you know,</v>

1076
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 3>the company is getting calls from again,</v>

1077
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:49.630
<v Speaker 3>five or six different outlets to them and feels overwhelming and like what the</v>

1078
00:31:49.631 --> 00:31:51.940
<v Speaker 3>fuck do we do with this because this wasn't on the air.</v>

1079
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.171
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's what,</v>

1080
00:31:53.171 --> 00:31:53.471
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

1081
00:31:53.471 --> 00:31:54.910
<v Speaker 3>they haven't discussed this with me,</v>

1082
00:31:54.911 --> 00:31:55.121
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1083
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:57.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm purely speculating because to them,</v>

1084
00:31:57.761 --> 00:31:58.511
<v Speaker 3>if it was on the air,</v>

1085
00:31:58.511 --> 00:31:59.261
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing they would have said,</v>

1086
00:31:59.261 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 3>well that's what he does on the air.</v>

1087
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:01.750
<v Speaker 3>But they're not looking at it like,</v>

1088
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 3>well he was reacting to being hit.</v>

1089
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.450
<v Speaker 3>I think they just were like,</v>

1090
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.940
<v Speaker 3>oh okay we got to fire him.</v>

1091
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that's why they,</v>

1092
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.540
<v Speaker 3>they kind of just reacted very quickly.</v>

1093
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I think they fucked themselves.</v>

1094
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:12.581
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

1095
00:32:12.581 --> 00:32:15.580
<v Speaker 3>They fucked themselves cause they were supposed to be the place where it was</v>

1096
00:32:15.581 --> 00:32:16.414
<v Speaker 3>free speech.</v>

1097
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.800
<v Speaker 3>This is the wild place.</v>

1098
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.090
<v Speaker 3>But we're the virus.</v>

1099
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.100
<v Speaker 3>There was the virus channel member.</v>

1100
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 3>Now it's Sirius Xm talk.</v>

1101
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.840
<v Speaker 3>That's it is Sirius XM talk.</v>

1102
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:27.930
<v Speaker 3>We have to rename it but we don't know what would they have to,</v>

1103
00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.490
<v Speaker 3>they have to ask you fly input.</v>

1104
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:30.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't want my name on the show.</v>

1105
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:30.941
<v Speaker 3>Like I want,</v>

1106
00:32:30.941 --> 00:32:31.751
<v Speaker 3>I want to be on this show,</v>

1107
00:32:31.751 --> 00:32:33.090
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to be ob and Jimmy.</v>

1108
00:32:33.091 --> 00:32:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't people to feel like I'm jumping into Anthony's seat cause I'm not,</v>

1109
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1110
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.290
<v Speaker 3>if they call it opie show,</v>

1111
00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:39.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm much more with that</v>

1112
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.810
<v Speaker 5>because that's what it was before he met Anthony.</v>

1113
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:41.961
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

1114
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:43.400
<v Speaker 5>Me How it call we Ms. Anthony.</v>

1115
00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.061
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1116
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:44.331
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1117
00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:45.170
<v Speaker 5>that would be kind of a,</v>

1118
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:47.580
<v Speaker 5>or Tony will call Tony so they don't know who we're talking about.</v>

1119
00:32:47.581 --> 00:32:48.380
<v Speaker 5>What to say.</v>

1120
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 5>Bring where's Tony?</v>

1121
00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.420
<v Speaker 5>And it'll be sneaky.</v>

1122
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.120
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

1123
00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.180
<v Speaker 5>it is a horrible,</v>

1124
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.980
<v Speaker 5>and it's like people get mad at me and opiate.</v>

1125
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.180
<v Speaker 5>It's like we don't,</v>

1126
00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.440
<v Speaker 5>I tried to say like,</v>

1127
00:32:57.441 --> 00:32:59.390
<v Speaker 5>we didn't mad at you for what?</v>

1128
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:00.200
<v Speaker 5>Because the,</v>

1129
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.410
<v Speaker 5>the people think that we're like a bunch of teenagers hanging out and like you</v>

1130
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:06.380
<v Speaker 5>guys should walk in support and it's like,</v>

1131
00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:07.214
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1132
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:11.600
<v Speaker 5>you know dumb motherfuckers that say that Anthony I've talked to,</v>

1133
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.670
<v Speaker 5>he wouldn't walk and he told me,</v>

1134
00:33:13.671 --> 00:33:14.120
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1135
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 5>you got to make your money like,</v>

1136
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:16.610
<v Speaker 5>and it's all a and B,</v>

1137
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:17.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm under contract.</v>

1138
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.010
<v Speaker 5>I can't just walk.</v>

1139
00:33:19.011 --> 00:33:20.600
<v Speaker 5>I have three more months in the contract.</v>

1140
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 5>And Ob tried to clear this up on the air.</v>

1141
00:33:22.851 --> 00:33:23.900
<v Speaker 5>Like if we just walk out,</v>

1142
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.710
<v Speaker 5>if they don't fire us and we just walk and say a bunch of more subs leave cause</v>

1143
00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:28.281
<v Speaker 5>they realize like,</v>

1144
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:28.461
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1145
00:33:28.461 --> 00:33:29.540
<v Speaker 5>the show really is gone,</v>

1146
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.930
<v Speaker 5>then all of a sudden serious wants to take action on us for breach.</v>

1147
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 5>It's a whole fucking illegal.</v>

1148
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.260
<v Speaker 5>People just don't get that part of it.</v>

1149
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.270
<v Speaker 5>And they think that we're fucking Anthony.</v>

1150
00:33:38.271 --> 00:33:38.481
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1151
00:33:38.481 --> 00:33:40.400
<v Speaker 5>who doesn't think we're fucking Anthony Anthony?</v>

1152
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.620
<v Speaker 5>He knows we're not fucking,</v>

1153
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.160
<v Speaker 5>only an idiot thinks you're fucking Anthony,</v>

1154
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:45.260
<v Speaker 5>but there's always going to be idiots with opinions out there.</v>

1155
00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.343
<v Speaker 5>And I'm fine with that.</v>

1156
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.450
<v Speaker 5>When people say like,</v>

1157
00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:47.721
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

1158

1159
00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:51.440
<v Speaker 5>but I got to cancel because I'm staying with Anthony.</v>

1160
00:33:51.441 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't get mad at those people or people like I'm going to keep serious and I'm</v>

1161
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:56.090
<v Speaker 5>also going to listen to ant.</v>

1162
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.333

1163
00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:00.680

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.410
<v Speaker 5>they listen to me an opie and then they fucking listen to Anthony.</v>

1168
00:34:09.411 --> 00:34:10.460
<v Speaker 5>There's no competition.</v>

1169
00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:11.151
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to,</v>

1170
00:34:11.151 --> 00:34:12.680
<v Speaker 5>we're not like here you don't mention Anthony.</v>

1171
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.450
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to fucking shell comes out.</v>

1172
00:34:14.451 --> 00:34:14.721
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>

1173
00:34:14.721 --> 00:34:17.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to tweet it because I want him to succeed cause he's one of my closest</v>

1174
00:34:17.961 --> 00:34:18.500
<v Speaker 5>friends.</v>

1175
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.520
<v Speaker 5>It's going to succeed.</v>

1176
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:20.571
<v Speaker 5>It's going to,</v>

1177
00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:21.041
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

1178
00:34:21.041 --> 00:34:21.441
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1179
00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:22.274
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

1180
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:23.730
<v Speaker 1>he's an entertaining guy.</v>

1181
00:34:23.731 --> 00:34:28.731
<v Speaker 1>He's an interesting guy in the platform of the Internet is so free and easy and</v>

1182
00:34:28.801 --> 00:34:31.860
<v Speaker 1>he's already got a full professional set up at his house.</v>

1183
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.690
<v Speaker 1>People don't know if you've never seen.</v>

1185
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:38.850
<v Speaker 1>One of the main reasons I started this podcast is because of live from the</v>

1186
00:34:38.851 --> 00:34:42.360
<v Speaker 1>compound because he set up fucking greenscreen in his house,</v>

1187
00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.950
<v Speaker 1>a professional studio,</v>

1188
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 1>and he was playing images behind him of like the city of like he had a green</v>

1189
00:34:49.591 --> 00:34:50.021
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

1190
00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:55.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean a beautiful green screen po like professional broadcast quality cameras,</v>

1191
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.100
<v Speaker 1>like the whole deal.</v>

1192
00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:56.701
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1193
00:34:56.701 --> 00:34:57.750
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

1194
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.350
<v Speaker 1>And that slowly but surely led to what you're seeing right here.</v>

1195
00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Like him doing that while he was already on Sirius and Sirius tried to stop him</v>

1196
00:35:07.531 --> 00:35:08.364
<v Speaker 1>from doing that.</v>

1197
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.940
<v Speaker 1>They got it.</v>

1198
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.590
<v Speaker 1>They gave him a hard time about that.</v>

1199
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1200
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1201
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:11.630
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1202
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.081
<v Speaker 5>that was it.</v>

1203
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:14.150
<v Speaker 5>I think that was a contractual issue too where they're like,</v>

1204
00:35:14.151 --> 00:35:14.361
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1205
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:15.410
<v Speaker 5>this is the medium you're on.</v>

1206
00:35:15.411 --> 00:35:16.041
<v Speaker 5>But eventually they like,</v>

1207
00:35:16.041 --> 00:35:16.521
<v Speaker 5>they're kind of like,</v>

1208
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:17.280
<v Speaker 5>let them do it and they're like,</v>

1209
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:17.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1210
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.613
<v Speaker 5>it's only,</v>

1211
00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.750
<v Speaker 1>it would only help the show.</v>

1212
00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:20.501
<v Speaker 1>It's just more,</v>

1213
00:35:20.501 --> 00:35:21.670
<v Speaker 1>more advertising,</v>

1214
00:35:21.671 --> 00:35:23.230
<v Speaker 1>more people paying attention,</v>

1215
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:24.670
<v Speaker 1>more entertainment,</v>

1216
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1217
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.370
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get more people that,</v>

1218
00:35:27.371 --> 00:35:27.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1219
00:35:27.511 --> 00:35:29.350
<v Speaker 1>that's what people are realizing about the Internet.</v>

1220
00:35:29.351 --> 00:35:29.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1221
00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.130
<v Speaker 1>bars.</v>

1222
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Earlage got all upset at Metallica fans for downloading his shit and it created</v>

1223
00:35:35.111 --> 00:35:37.180
<v Speaker 1>this huge shit storm.</v>

1224
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>You know where everybody's</v>

1225
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.191
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1226
00:35:38.191 --> 00:35:38.401
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1227
00:35:38.401 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 3>don't you have enough fucking money?</v>

1228
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Like we,</v>

1229
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 3>you're worried about people downloading your shit.</v>

1230
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.250
<v Speaker 3>More people going to come see you in concert.</v>

1231
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it really has turned out to be for all musical artists.</v>

1232
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1233
00:35:48.301 --> 00:35:49.680
<v Speaker 3>you're not selling as many records,</v>

1234
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:53.340
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to get more fans and there's more people going to see you in</v>

1235
00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:53.761
<v Speaker 3>concert.</v>

1236
00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:54.361
<v Speaker 3>And guess what?</v>

1237
00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:56.090
<v Speaker 3>That's all your money when you,</v>

1238
00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:00.120
<v Speaker 3>when you can set that up and have people just come out and see you in concert,</v>

1239
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.380
<v Speaker 3>that's actually better.</v>

1240
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:02.640
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mind.</v>

1241
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you why I didn't mind large doing that because I think that he kind of</v>

1242
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 3>say it.</v>

1243
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:10.530
<v Speaker 3>What was happening is with the music industry was not prepared for the onslaught</v>

1244
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.520
<v Speaker 3>of downloads.</v>

1245
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.121
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1246
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:12.810
<v Speaker 3>they're greedy.</v>

1247
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Twats the,</v>

1248
00:36:14.021 --> 00:36:14.761
<v Speaker 3>I mean the business,</v>

1249
00:36:14.761 --> 00:36:15.541
<v Speaker 3>not the artists,</v>

1250
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:16.950
<v Speaker 3>but the fucking guys behind the scenes.</v>

1251
00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.900
<v Speaker 3>They've been raping artists for years.</v>

1252
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:19.950
<v Speaker 3>Fucking taking all their money.</v>

1253
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:24.540
<v Speaker 3>But we had it not because I think iTunes was born of the idea of Napster falling</v>

1254
00:36:24.541 --> 00:36:25.200
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

1255
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:25.710
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

1256
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I kinda like it because now I can go buy a song or two songs.</v>

1257
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not going to download a whole fucking Nicki Minaj album,</v>

1258
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:36.000
<v Speaker 3>but there's one song you're like fucking minutes looking ass Nigga is the</v>

1259
00:36:36.001 --> 00:36:38.100
<v Speaker 3>fucking greatest song ever done.</v>

1260
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.040
<v Speaker 3>It's the fucking greatest thing ever done.</v>

1261
00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:42.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to buy the whole album,</v>

1262
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:45.740
<v Speaker 3>but that fucking video is ha is sexy railing.</v>

1263
00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.381
<v Speaker 3>I dude,</v>

1264
00:36:46.381 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love that song.</v>

1265
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:48.511
<v Speaker 3>I for real love it.</v>

1266
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:49.344
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

1267
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 3>And that I would buy it.</v>

1268
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:50.941
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to buy the whole dumb.</v>

1269
00:36:50.941 --> 00:36:51.900
<v Speaker 3>I wish we could play it,</v>

1270
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:53.040
<v Speaker 3>but we'll get pulled over you.</v>

1271
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a song you can't sing.</v>

1272
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:57.210
<v Speaker 3>Also with the windows down to I found out recently,</v>

1273
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:58.450
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of inwards.</v>

1274
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.671
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1275
00:36:58.671 --> 00:36:59.504
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>

1276
00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:00.551
<v Speaker 3>But the eye,</v>

1277
00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 3>the lying she uses in that a fucking great.</v>

1278
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.980
<v Speaker 3>And I love the song.</v>

1279
00:37:05.981 --> 00:37:07.240
<v Speaker 3>So that's just an example.</v>

1280
00:37:07.241 --> 00:37:11.580
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't buy that whole album and I like it for my own dumb little cds that</v>

1281
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:12.271
<v Speaker 3>are on iTunes.</v>

1282
00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I liked the fact that can make some money there and they're not just going to,</v>

1283
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.700
<v Speaker 3>people are still going to steal them pie.</v>

1284
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:17.841
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1285
00:37:17.841 --> 00:37:19.320
<v Speaker 3>this is still brilliant people out there,</v>

1286
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 3>but the majority of people aren't computer geniuses.</v>

1287
00:37:23.161 --> 00:37:23.550
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

1288
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:26.190
<v Speaker 3>oh I'll go to iTunes for a buck and buy a couple of trends like that.</v>

1289
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like if it's easy to do,</v>

1290
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.550
<v Speaker 3>people are going to pay for it.</v>

1291
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.890
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to one click on Amazon.</v>

1292
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.110
<v Speaker 3>People who pay for one click on iTunes.</v>

1293
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1294
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:35.161
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1295
00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1296
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1297
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:37.680
<v Speaker 3>that's the way to do it.</v>

1298
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Make it so it's convenient.</v>

1299
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:39.781
<v Speaker 3>Make it,</v>

1300
00:37:39.781 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think eventually you're going well you're always going to have people</v>

1301
00:37:43.201 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 3>that have digital copies of things,</v>

1302
00:37:44.581 --> 00:37:45.430
<v Speaker 3>online stuff.</v>

1303
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.830
<v Speaker 3>It's always going to be the case,</v>

1304
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.180
<v Speaker 3>but people are getting more and more hesitant to do that because a lot of people</v>

1305
00:37:50.181 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 3>are getting fucked.</v>

1306
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Like people that are downloading illegal parting of the UFC as they're getting</v>

1307
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:55.644
<v Speaker 3>sued.</v>

1308
00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.290
<v Speaker 3>People that have downloaded movies are getting sued.</v>

1309
00:37:58.291 --> 00:37:59.670
<v Speaker 3>People that upload movies,</v>

1310
00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of those guys that had like a bunch of movies that they were sharing</v>

1311
00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:03.504
<v Speaker 3>on bit torrent,</v>

1312
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.210
<v Speaker 3>they're getting sued for fuckloads of money,</v>

1313
00:38:06.211 --> 00:38:06.570
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1314
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:06.710
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1315
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:07.170
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1316
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:07.651
<v Speaker 3>and people are like,</v>

1317
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:09.210
<v Speaker 3>why are they going after the little guy?</v>

1318
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.073
<v Speaker 3>Here's why.</v>

1319
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Because when the little guy starts to have to,</v>

1320
00:38:11.731 --> 00:38:12.271
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

1321
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:12.871
<v Speaker 3>you can get sued,</v>

1322
00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:13.031
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1323
00:38:13.031 --> 00:38:13.864
<v Speaker 3>they can't win.</v>

1324
00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:14.341
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1325
00:38:14.341 --> 00:38:14.521
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1326
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:15.271
<v Speaker 3>That's how it happens.</v>

1327
00:38:15.271 --> 00:38:16.230
<v Speaker 3>You walk into court and go,</v>

1328
00:38:16.231 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 3>your honor,</v>

1329
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.401
<v Speaker 3>they can't win.</v>

1330
00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:17.731
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1331
00:38:17.731 --> 00:38:18.360
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1332
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.193
<v Speaker 3>No charge.</v>

1333
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:19.621
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1334
00:38:19.621 --> 00:38:21.120
<v Speaker 3>you've got to pay for a fucking lawyer.</v>

1335
00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.310
<v Speaker 3>And a lawyer is a 20 grand hit minimum.</v>

1336
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.660
<v Speaker 3>So the average person,</v>

1337
00:38:24.661 --> 00:38:26.970
<v Speaker 3>when they have to get an attorney and they realize this is going to cost me</v>

1338
00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:27.870
<v Speaker 3>10,000,</v>

1339
00:38:27.871 --> 00:38:30.780
<v Speaker 3>$20,000 just to defend,</v>

1340
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.310
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to deal with it.</v>

1341
00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:32.851
<v Speaker 3>So a lot,</v>

1342
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:34.680
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of times that's what these little lawsuits are about.</v>

1343
00:38:34.681 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 3>It's getting just to back</v>

1344
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.970
<v Speaker 5>off and discouraging.</v>

1345
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:37.121
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1346
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:40.300
<v Speaker 5>I got errors and omissions insurance because of a conversation I have with you.</v>

1347
00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.890
<v Speaker 5>You told me about it.</v>

1348
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:42.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1349
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.200
<v Speaker 5>And when you were getting sued,</v>

1350
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.063
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

1351
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:45.701
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1352
00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:46.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1353
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.470
<v Speaker 5>it's a very frustrating process because you realize the legal process is not</v>

1354
00:38:50.471 --> 00:38:51.640
<v Speaker 5>free even if it,</v>

1355
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:53.260
<v Speaker 5>even if you think you're in the right,</v>

1356
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 5>but in a way it's saved me I think in the long run,</v>

1357
00:38:56.171 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 5>that experience because now I have it for everything.</v>

1358
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.250
<v Speaker 5>I do my books,</v>

1359
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.241
<v Speaker 5>DVDs,</v>

1360
00:39:01.241 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 5>cds,</v>

1361
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:06.010
<v Speaker 5>I get everything vetted and I have like $3 million worth of insurance,</v>

1362
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:08.380
<v Speaker 5>which is probably a panicky overkill on my part.</v>

1363
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.080
<v Speaker 5>But I do that because you want to protect yourself even from a,</v>

1364
00:39:13.081 --> 00:39:13.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1365
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1366
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:14.973
<v Speaker 5>what's the word?</v>

1367
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.593
<v Speaker 5>Not Frugal,</v>

1368
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 5>frivolous litigation.</v>

1369
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who's going to come after me.</v>

1370
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.020
<v Speaker 5>Somebody may hear something and then it may cause him to bang their fucking head</v>

1371
00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 5>into the wall and then say,</v>

1372
00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:26.770
<v Speaker 5>I caused an autistic reaction or I caused the fucking,</v>

1373
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:27.600
<v Speaker 5>I was the one,</v>

1374
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.380
<v Speaker 5>I was the one Al Roker made fun of the,</v>

1375
00:39:29.381 --> 00:39:30.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1376
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1377
00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:31.750
<v Speaker 5>you know the liver.</v>

1378
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:32.021
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1379
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:32.171
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1380
00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:36.610
<v Speaker 5>the Olympic logo is causing some kind of a epileptic epileptics,</v>

1381
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.713
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>

1382
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 5>someone can always file the suit and you have to pay to defend it.</v>

1383
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:41.530
<v Speaker 5>So that type of shit.</v>

1384
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.670
<v Speaker 5>It's nice to have,</v>

1385
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.031
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1386
00:39:43.031 --> 00:39:44.260
<v Speaker 5>that really does happen.</v>

1387
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:44.920
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1388
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.600
<v Speaker 5>There was a dude that I had on my podcast.</v>

1389
00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:47.710
<v Speaker 5>His wife was an epileptic,</v>

1390
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.580
<v Speaker 5>not on my podcasts,</v>

1391
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:49.540
<v Speaker 5>on my message board.</v>

1392
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.140
<v Speaker 5>His wife was an epileptic and uh,</v>

1393
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:56.050
<v Speaker 5>someone who had a logo that was like flashing and he started complaining about</v>

1394
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:56.111
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1395
00:39:56.111 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 5>you guys need to take that down.</v>

1396
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.410
<v Speaker 5>So then everybody put up a flashing logo.</v>

1397
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.990
<v Speaker 5>It was of course,</v>

1398
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.370
<v Speaker 5>but then he messaged me,</v>

1399
00:40:03.371 --> 00:40:03.671
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

1400
00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:04.504
<v Speaker 5>seriously,</v>

1401
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 5>my wife sees that she'll faint,</v>

1402
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.100
<v Speaker 5>so just go into a seizure.</v>

1403
00:40:07.101 --> 00:40:07.451
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

1404
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:08.284
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>

1405
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.670
<v Speaker 5>So I had to look it up.</v>

1406
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:10.151
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1407
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:10.391
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1408
00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:10.871
<v Speaker 5>it does.</v>

1409
00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:11.230
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1410
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.800
<v Speaker 5>there was a certain television show that was going on in Japan.</v>

1411
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.000
<v Speaker 5>It was like a kid's show.</v>

1412
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:19.900
<v Speaker 5>It's the one with the mighty are the four guys power rangers?</v>

1413
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:21.070
<v Speaker 5>Was it the power rangers?</v>

1414
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:22.480
<v Speaker 5>Whatever it was.</v>

1415
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:26.660
<v Speaker 5>This television show made kids have seizures for whatever reason.</v>

1416
00:40:26.661 --> 00:40:29.500
<v Speaker 5>Certain kids that have a certain issue,</v>

1417
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:33.340
<v Speaker 5>they would watch these flashing things and just video games.</v>

1418
00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:34.510
<v Speaker 5>Now have that at the beginning.</v>

1419
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.470
<v Speaker 5>Like if you played a video game like this game kid cost Caesar's,</v>

1420
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.270
<v Speaker 5>if you have that,</v>

1421
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:42.180
<v Speaker 5>if they used to have to warn you so and so you've been pre worn fucking weird by</v>

1422
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1423
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.450
<v Speaker 5>everything that we deal with,</v>

1424
00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.293
<v Speaker 5>it's annoying.</v>

1425
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.280
<v Speaker 5>Everything is because of lawsuits.</v>

1426
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.210
<v Speaker 5>So we kind of brought it on ourselves to like,</v>

1427
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:49.931
<v Speaker 5>people are like,</v>

1428
00:40:49.931 --> 00:40:50.591
<v Speaker 5>why do they have to,</v>

1429
00:40:50.591 --> 00:40:52.750
<v Speaker 5>companies have to be so like I'll get annoyed.</v>

1430
00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:54.520
<v Speaker 5>It's serious sometimes like what the fuck?</v>

1431
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:55.421
<v Speaker 5>And then I'm like,</v>

1432
00:40:55.421 --> 00:40:56.254
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

1433
00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.550
<v Speaker 5>they have a shitload of people working for them and every one of them has access</v>

1434
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 5>to human resources and any one of those people could just go to human resources</v>

1435
00:41:05.441 --> 00:41:08.410
<v Speaker 5>and say this is a hostile work environment because of something,</v>

1436
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.410
<v Speaker 5>you know these people like why can't we look at a girl's ass in the hallway?</v>

1437
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.161
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead,</v>

1438
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:12.731
<v Speaker 5>pinch your ass.</v>

1439
00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 5>It gets 1950 and then when they sue the company,</v>

1440
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.230
<v Speaker 5>the company's like,</v>

1441
00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:17.890
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1442
00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck we going to pay to defend this?</v>

1443
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:21.430
<v Speaker 5>Because you couldn't keep your hands off her.</v>

1444
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:23.800
<v Speaker 5>So as much as companies can drive me nuts.</v>

1445
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes all of these protective barriers that have been put in place had been</v>

1446
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.150
<v Speaker 5>because citizens have filed lawsuits,</v>

1447
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 5>some that were very legitimate,</v>

1448
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 5>like sexual harassment guys</v>

1449
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.390
<v Speaker 3>have kind of pieces of shit with that.</v>

1450
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:36.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1451
00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 3>that was probably a bad example because most guys,</v>

1452
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:38.654
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1453
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:41.570
<v Speaker 3>women have told me horror stories where they've got to deal with at work where</v>

1454
00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:42.404
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1455
00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:42.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1456
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Speaker 3>it's more than just a glance,</v>

1457
00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:44.631
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>

1458
00:41:44.631 --> 00:41:44.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1459
00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:46.790
<v Speaker 3>a guy rubbing his dick or while they're getting coffee and going,</v>

1460
00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:46.951
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

1461
00:41:46.951 --> 00:41:47.511
<v Speaker 3>I'm kidding.</v>

1462
00:41:47.511 --> 00:41:47.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1463
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.171
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1464
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:49.670
<v Speaker 3>how do you fucking deal with that if you're,</v>

1465
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:50.391
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1466
00:41:50.391 --> 00:41:51.440
<v Speaker 3>the companies have to deal with this.</v>

1467
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:54.290
<v Speaker 3>So then they put all this shit in place to protect themselves from these</v>

1468
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:56.930
<v Speaker 3>litigious fucking shithead employees.</v>

1469
00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1470
00:41:57.231 --> 00:41:57.861
<v Speaker 3>there's both,</v>

1471
00:41:57.861 --> 00:41:58.131
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1472
00:41:58.131 --> 00:42:00.830
<v Speaker 3>There's real scenarios where people are getting sexually harassed.</v>

1473
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Uber fucked up.</v>

1474
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:03.141
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1475
00:42:03.141 --> 00:42:05.780
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine being a chicken and office and some guy you don't want to have</v>

1476
00:42:05.781 --> 00:42:10.130
<v Speaker 3>anything to do with consistently hits on you and tell dirty jokes and fucks with</v>

1477
00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:12.140
<v Speaker 3>you and asks you if you're gaining weight.</v>

1478
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.320
<v Speaker 3>If you ignore them and say,</v>

1479
00:42:13.321 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1480
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1481
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.080
<v Speaker 3>they started getting weird.</v>

1482
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:16.580
<v Speaker 3>Guys are gross.</v>

1483
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:17.180
<v Speaker 3>Creepy.</v>

1484
00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad I'm not a check.</v>

1485
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't imagine being a heterosexual woman having to deal with men who want</v>

1486
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:24.500
<v Speaker 3>to fuck me,</v>

1487
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.520
<v Speaker 3>or just the energy,</v>

1488
00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 3>like the things that you can't prove in court,</v>

1489
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:29.720
<v Speaker 3>but the energy of the guy who wants to fuck you,</v>

1490
00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.950
<v Speaker 3>dumb dick up against the fucking top of your desk.</v>

1491
00:42:32.951 --> 00:42:34.310
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing well?</v>

1492
00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:35.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying hello.</v>

1493
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.820
<v Speaker 3>You know you posted on what's the,</v>

1494
00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.521

1495
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:37.900

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.200
<v Speaker 3>it's called.</v>

1497
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:43.200
<v Speaker 3>It's all mushed up fucking plump kids fucking making men and women work together</v>

1498
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:46.910
<v Speaker 3>for eight hours in a row together in a,</v>

1499
00:42:46.911 --> 00:42:48.590
<v Speaker 3>in a closed in environment.</v>

1500
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.560
<v Speaker 3>It's the automatic sexual tension between some folks.</v>

1501
00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:52.280
<v Speaker 3>It has to be,</v>

1502
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:52.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1503
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.530
<v Speaker 3>just there's no way around that man.</v>

1504
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Now from a,</v>

1505
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:56.210
<v Speaker 3>from a guy's point of view,</v>

1506
00:42:56.211 --> 00:42:59.120
<v Speaker 3>at least I think women are better because their whole thing is picking which</v>

1507
00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:00.140
<v Speaker 3>guys they want to fucking pee.</v>

1508
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.120
<v Speaker 3>I think women are better at going out of this.</v>

1509
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.760
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] was professional and not to do that.</v>

1510
00:43:04.761 --> 00:43:05.750
<v Speaker 3>We're just awful lot of,</v>

1511
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:06.680
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm awful at it,</v>

1512
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.400
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like there's just a,</v>

1513
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.850
<v Speaker 3>that's the social environment of the office.</v>

1514
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.440
<v Speaker 3>There's always going to be weirdness.</v>

1515
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:12.661
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1516
00:43:12.661 --> 00:43:16.340
<v Speaker 3>You know in the office and then if you have those fucking office parties where</v>

1517

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1521
00:43:25.641 --> 00:43:27.990
<v Speaker 3>You're dropping someone off and you want to have jerking off in front of her in</v>

1522
00:43:27.991 --> 00:43:29.840
<v Speaker 3>the car and she goes in and feels dirty.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Cause that happened for whatever big deal over here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>we have female interns.</v>

1535
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:51.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what keeps me from hitting on the Internet.</v>

1536
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking as Florentine,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll joke with them on the air.</v>

1540
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:59.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking look at their asses in the hallway.</v>

1541
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't flirt with them because a,</v>

1542
00:44:02.361 --> 00:44:06.890
<v Speaker 3>the most of our 21 and 22 I don't want one of them misinterpreting something and</v>

1543
00:44:06.891 --> 00:44:08.420
<v Speaker 3>going to human resources and going,</v>

1544
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:12.320
<v Speaker 3>this 45 year old piece of garbage is hitting on me and then I'm going to sue</v>

1545
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:13.020
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1546
00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:13.761
<v Speaker 3>And then the company is like,</v>

1547
00:44:13.761 --> 00:44:14.890
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get sued at what the fuck?</v>

1548
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.730
<v Speaker 3>Because companies have lost a lot of money with that.</v>

1549
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1550
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:19.340
<v Speaker 3>They've lost in legit cases,</v>

1551
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.870
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want to take a chance.</v>

1552
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.420
<v Speaker 3>So then they're going to fucking look at me and go one more time and you fall,</v>

1553
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1554
00:44:23.601 --> 00:44:23.961
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1555
00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:25.040
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I don't do it.</v>

1556
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.830
<v Speaker 3>Another aspect of this crazy litigious society that we live in is patent trolls.</v>

1557
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that Adam going through right now.</v>

1558
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 3>When we're all a part of it and we're trying to help him raise money for his</v>

1559
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:36.654
<v Speaker 3>legal funds,</v>

1560
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.150
<v Speaker 3>it's going to cost him $1 million.</v>

1561
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.830
<v Speaker 3>$1 million to defend against this patent troll.</v>

1562
00:44:42.831 --> 00:44:43.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1563
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:44.220
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

1564
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:48.300
<v Speaker 3>they already had a hearing and during the hearing or they had whatever it is,</v>

1565
00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:52.180
<v Speaker 3>when they meet down and they discuss the merits of the case and the,</v>

1566
00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:52.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1567
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.900
<v Speaker 3>the cases essentially thought to be frivolous,</v>

1568
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.850
<v Speaker 3>but they're still going forward with motion to dismiss.</v>

1569
00:44:56.851 --> 00:44:58.890
<v Speaker 3>That's why I tried to motion to dismiss and they said no.</v>

1570
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 3>So either,</v>

1571
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I guess what they will do is go for my guests will be the next step or they can</v>

1572
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 3>go for summary Judgment,</v>

1573
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:06.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1574
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:07.740
<v Speaker 3>maybe with a process,</v>

1575
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:09.060
<v Speaker 3>all the facts and they say,</v>

1576
00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:09.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1577
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:11.160
<v Speaker 3>should we go into depositions or whatever.</v>

1578
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:11.490
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1579
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.990
<v Speaker 3>it might be different in this kind of case,</v>

1580
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:14.161
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1581
00:45:14.161 --> 00:45:15.460
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of that's a,</v>

1582
00:45:15.461 --> 00:45:19.050
<v Speaker 3>that's a patent troll friendly area where they're from,</v>

1583
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.590
<v Speaker 3>which is why I think that a lot of these people set up offices and that part of</v>

1584
00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:23.220
<v Speaker 3>Texas,</v>

1585
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.430
<v Speaker 3>but fucking the supreme court just shot down.</v>

1586
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 3>They really hurt patent trolls saying something that you can't patent idea.</v>

1587
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:33.180
<v Speaker 3>Like you can patent a method of delivering an idea when you can't patent the</v>

1588
00:45:33.181 --> 00:45:35.330
<v Speaker 3>idea of just like episodic things on the internet or,</v>

1589
00:45:35.331 --> 00:45:37.420
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it was that they said you can't do it.</v>

1590
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.920
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

1591
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.330
<v Speaker 3>let's give them a shout out here.</v>

1592
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Cause my God has sent me this.</v>

1593
00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1594
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.500
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy who runs a Adam show over there.</v>

1595
00:45:43.501 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 3>He sent me this thing about it and give you the whole though.</v>

1596
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 3>There's the full deal.</v>

1597
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:51.950
<v Speaker 3>So far they have raised $425,000 for their,</v>

1598
00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:53.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1599
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.260
<v Speaker 3>for their defense,</v>

1600
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.970
<v Speaker 3>their most recent bill.</v>

1601
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:58.470
<v Speaker 3>This is incredible.</v>

1602
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.100
<v Speaker 3>They have been running at $100,000 a month,</v>

1603
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.010
<v Speaker 3>$100,000 a month for the last three months in legal bills.</v>

1604
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.460
<v Speaker 3>So they're now at a deficit of $20,000.</v>

1605
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Personal audio has shown no signs of backing down from their litigation posture</v>

1606
00:46:12.901 --> 00:46:17.160
<v Speaker 3>despite a discovery process that has revealed the completely weak connection to</v>

1607
00:46:17.161 --> 00:46:22.161
<v Speaker 3>be drawn between their PR purported patent apparatus and dissemination of media</v>

1608
00:46:22.471 --> 00:46:24.390
<v Speaker 3>files that we do as podcasts are.</v>

1609
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:28.170
<v Speaker 3>So what they're hoping for is that Adam somehow or another taps out.</v>

1610
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:29.123
<v Speaker 3>And if he does,</v>

1611
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.860
<v Speaker 3>then they try to hit everybody who podcast with,</v>

1612
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:32.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1613
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:32.221
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1614
00:46:32.221 --> 00:46:34.020
<v Speaker 3>give us 20 bucks a month or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1615
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.393
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1616
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:38.880
<v Speaker 3>so they're going to have to raise another 50,</v>

1617
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:43.620
<v Speaker 3>oh 500,000 to $750,000 to continue with the litigation.</v>

1618
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:44.581
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>

1619
00:46:44.581 --> 00:46:45.181
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

1620
00:46:45.181 --> 00:46:45.961
<v Speaker 3>It's sickening.</v>

1621
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:47.190
<v Speaker 3>And the only thing is,</v>

1622
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:47.340
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1623
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.140
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know what it's like in Texas.</v>

1624
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 3>I know in New York it's hard to get,</v>

1625
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 3>but everyone thinks like,</v>

1626
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:52.471
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1627
00:46:52.471 --> 00:46:52.861
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1628
00:46:52.861 --> 00:46:55.980
<v Speaker 3>I'll just try to get them to make them pay for my legal fees.</v>

1629
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.720
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't always happen.</v>

1630
00:46:57.721 --> 00:46:57.831
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1631
00:46:57.831 --> 00:46:58.001
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1632
00:46:58.001 --> 00:46:58.141
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1633
00:46:58.141 --> 00:46:58.711
<v Speaker 3>and it's a,</v>

1634
00:46:58.711 --> 00:47:00.510
<v Speaker 3>judges don't like to do that.</v>

1635
00:47:00.511 --> 00:47:01.770
<v Speaker 3>They don't like to give a,</v>

1636
00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:04.200
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it's called,</v>

1637
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's when you make the,</v>

1638
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:05.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1639
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:09.180
<v Speaker 3>the suing attorney with is suing the plaintiff,</v>

1640
00:47:09.181 --> 00:47:10.950
<v Speaker 3>pay the defendant's legal fees.</v>

1641
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.430
<v Speaker 3>It has to be proven to be such a litigious I,</v>

1642
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1643
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.000
<v Speaker 3>a frivolous thing.</v>

1644
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:16.950
<v Speaker 3>So that's a really hard thing to do.</v>

1645
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:17.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1646
00:47:17.731 --> 00:47:18.960
<v Speaker 3>And if you want to help,</v>

1647
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.120
<v Speaker 3>this is the way they've got it set up to help.</v>

1648
00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1649
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:23.070

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:47.080
<v Speaker 1>If you just Google that,</v>

1668
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 1>it's on fund anything.com you can,</v>

1669
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:50.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1670
00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.220
<v Speaker 1>you can find the,</v>

1671
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:51.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1672
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1673
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:57.070
<v Speaker 1>the link to it and Adam has a video up there that explains what's going on and</v>

1674
00:47:57.281 --> 00:47:58.600
<v Speaker 1>how this all got started.</v>

1675
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.130
<v Speaker 1>It's really gross.</v>

1676
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:00.440
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1677
00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:00.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1678
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.910
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at what the actual patented is itself,</v>

1679
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:04.151
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1680
00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:05.950
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy that they can sue for it.</v>

1681
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.860
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially releasing things in a serialized form,</v>

1682
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:09.760
<v Speaker 1>like a form one,</v>

1683
00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:09.941
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1684
00:48:09.941 --> 00:48:10.181
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

1685
00:48:10.181 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 1>and four on the Internet.</v>

1686
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:11.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1687
00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:12.334
<v Speaker 1>that's a list.</v>

1688
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1689
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:13.444
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like,</v>

1690
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1691
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that you could patent that it's just fucking bananas.</v>

1692
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:18.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1693
00:48:18.641 --> 00:48:18.780
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1694
00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:19.421
<v Speaker 3>and it's very,</v>

1695
00:48:19.421 --> 00:48:21.280
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it's called and they give them money.</v>

1696
00:48:21.281 --> 00:48:22.120
<v Speaker 3>It's really rare.</v>

1697
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:22.380
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

1698
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:22.960
<v Speaker 3>in London,</v>

1699
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.430
<v Speaker 3>in England,</v>

1700
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.921
<v Speaker 3>in London,</v>

1701
00:48:23.921 --> 00:48:24.401
<v Speaker 3>and fucking,</v>

1702
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1703
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:25.451
<v Speaker 3>England,</v>

1704
00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:26.560
<v Speaker 3>I think they're much more likely to,</v>

1705
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.710
<v Speaker 3>cause a lot of people are less likely to sue for something that's,</v>

1706
00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:29.950
<v Speaker 3>that they might be frivolous,</v>

1707
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.270
<v Speaker 3>although they may not get it,</v>

1708
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.390
<v Speaker 3>you may not be able to recover on a frivolous lawsuit because there may be legal</v>

1709
00:48:34.391 --> 00:48:35.350
<v Speaker 3>merits to this lawsuit.</v>

1710
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 3>Even if even if they lose,</v>

1711
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.560
<v Speaker 3>what are the personal audio they're called?</v>

1712
00:48:38.561 --> 00:48:39.250
<v Speaker 3>They may,</v>

1713
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.840
<v Speaker 3>it may not be a frivolous suit,</v>

1714
00:48:40.841 --> 00:48:42.520
<v Speaker 3>like in the legal system's eyes,</v>

1715
00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 3>the legal system may see this as a legit suit that they win or lose as opposed</v>

1716
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:48.910
<v Speaker 3>to a frivolous once Adam May not be able to get his money back,</v>

1717
00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:49.840
<v Speaker 3>even if he wins.</v>

1718
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

1719
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.670
<v Speaker 3>I totally hear you.</v>

1720
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:52.870
<v Speaker 3>So even if he wins,</v>

1721
00:48:52.871 --> 00:48:55.330
<v Speaker 3>he might still be hit with all these legal fees.</v>

1722
00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:55.601
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1723
00:48:55.601 --> 00:48:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And of course whoever loses it can't be over of course,</v>

1724
00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:59.051
<v Speaker 3>unless pat.</v>

1725
00:48:59.051 --> 00:48:59.471
<v Speaker 3>Cause you know,</v>

1726
00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:01.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing that the other place has more money than Adam does.</v>

1727
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:06.900
<v Speaker 3>So an appeal will cost money and everyone who podcasts has a very,</v>

1728
00:49:06.971 --> 00:49:10.380
<v Speaker 3>very vested interest in this because I don't think it's a good lawsuit.</v>

1729
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:13.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't think that their right to ask for this at all.</v>

1730
00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:15.460
<v Speaker 3>I think it's bullshit of course.</v>

1731
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.170
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1732
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 3>these guys have already made a shit load of money suing apple.</v>

1733
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.001
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1734
00:49:19.001 --> 00:49:19.141
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1735
00:49:19.141 --> 00:49:19.450

1736
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1737
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.400
<v Speaker 3>I think they made seven or 8 million,</v>

1738
00:49:21.401 --> 00:49:22.970
<v Speaker 3>8 million I think on the playlist or something.</v>

1739
00:49:22.971 --> 00:49:24.080
<v Speaker 3>And they were saying about a playlist hump.</v>

1740
00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.250
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crazy like that.</v>

1741
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I have to piss badly.</v>

1742
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:26.883
<v Speaker 3>Can I run in there?</v>

1743
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:28.143
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it man.</v>

1744
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.810

<v Speaker 3>Why I try to be a fucking cool image on the plane.</v>

1844
00:52:00.831 --> 00:52:01.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm flying,</v>

1845
00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:01.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1846
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm right from the airport right now.</v>

1847
00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm wearing my oversize Ozzie shirt,</v>

1848
00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.430
<v Speaker 3>my sweat pants.</v>

1849
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:06.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like that.</v>

1850
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.830
<v Speaker 3>You fly to be comfortable and that's such an easy thing to do.</v>

1851
00:52:09.831 --> 00:52:10.880
<v Speaker 3>You take that thing off,</v>

1852
00:52:10.881 --> 00:52:13.160
<v Speaker 3>put it in the tray that goes through,</v>

1853
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:13.880
<v Speaker 3>you're done,</v>

1854
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.750
<v Speaker 3>clip it back on.</v>

1855
00:52:14.751 --> 00:52:16.090
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to empty your pockets out.</v>

1856
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.010
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't include as one of your carry ons either when you have it around your</v>

1857
00:52:19.011 --> 00:52:19.351
<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>

1858
00:52:19.351 --> 00:52:22.340
<v Speaker 3>so if you have like a backpack and a suitcase,</v>

1859
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:25.310
<v Speaker 3>you can also have a fanny pack attached to your body so it doesn't count as not</v>

1860
00:52:25.311 --> 00:52:25.820
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

1861
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:26.090
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1862
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Does certain comments really?</v>

1863
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:31.760
<v Speaker 3>I had a woman tell me that I had to take it off and I put it in my back.</v>

1864
00:52:31.761 --> 00:52:32.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1865
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:32.871
<v Speaker 3>are you serious?</v>

1866
00:52:32.871 --> 00:52:33.201
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1867
00:52:33.201 --> 00:52:34.670
<v Speaker 3>what's the difference between this and the pocket?</v>

1868
00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:35.370
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

1869
00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:36.171
<v Speaker 3>it's a bag,</v>

1870
00:52:36.171 --> 00:52:36.680
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>

1871
00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 3>You have to have your bag inside another bag or you're going to have to check.</v>

1872
00:52:39.351 --> 00:52:40.760
<v Speaker 3>It should just be in a con.</v>

1873
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:41.960
<v Speaker 3>She of course she was and I was like,</v>

1874
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.651
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus,</v>

1875
00:52:42.651 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 3>fucking Christ.</v>

1876
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.650
<v Speaker 3>But you can't say you're being a con because that's a really,</v>

1877
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.360
<v Speaker 3>that's the little Chella plane.</v>

1878
00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.253
<v Speaker 3>She was conti.</v>

1879
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:48.861
<v Speaker 3>She of course she was.</v>

1880
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:50.870
<v Speaker 3>So I just opened up my backpack.</v>

1881
00:52:50.871 --> 00:52:51.770
<v Speaker 3>It's stuffed it in there.</v>

1882
00:52:51.771 --> 00:52:52.131
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>

1883
00:52:52.131 --> 00:52:53.540
<v Speaker 3>this is the dumbest fucking shit ever.</v>

1884
00:52:53.541 --> 00:52:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Like he said her,</v>

1885
00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:57.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting by the way in my seat when she said this to me.</v>

1886
00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:57.531
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1887
00:52:57.531 --> 00:52:58.250
<v Speaker 3>you on the plane?</v>

1888
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1889
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:59.361
<v Speaker 3>On the plane.</v>

1890
00:52:59.361 --> 00:53:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Sitting in my seat with my belt buckled the whole deal.</v>

1891
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:06.050
<v Speaker 3>So I had to take off the fanny pack and put it in my fucking backpack.</v>

1892
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:06.740
<v Speaker 3>The one,</v>

1893
00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:11.060
<v Speaker 3>one time only for this one chick that just decided that's ridiculous.</v>

1894
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1895
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:13.010
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens man.</v>

1896
00:53:13.011 --> 00:53:14.150
<v Speaker 3>You run into the wrong person.</v>

1897
00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:16.220
<v Speaker 3>What is it that a major airline or was it a,</v>

1898
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 3>a subsidiary,</v>

1899
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 3>like a smaller,</v>

1900
00:53:18.651 --> 00:53:18.891
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1901
00:53:18.891 --> 00:53:19.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1902
00:53:19.071 --> 00:53:19.904
<v Speaker 3>you have your Delta,</v>

1903
00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:20.931
<v Speaker 3>you have delta,</v>

1904
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:22.340
<v Speaker 3>but was it a big plan or a small plan?</v>

1905
00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:22.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1906
00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Cause a lot of times the ones on this,</v>

1907
00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:24.950
<v Speaker 3>like you had continental,</v>

1908
00:53:24.951 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 3>the continental express,</v>

1909
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 3>United,</v>

1910
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 5>United Express and the United expressing Cottonelle expressed there are other</v>

1911
00:53:29.761 --> 00:53:32.430
<v Speaker 5>airlines or American Eagle that's not American Airlines.</v>

1912
00:53:32.431 --> 00:53:36.240
<v Speaker 5>There are a smaller airline operating with the American logo.</v>

1913
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.190
<v Speaker 5>So there are totally separate airline.</v>

1914
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:39.480
<v Speaker 5>So what will happen is,</v>

1915
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:40.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1916
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:40.351
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1917
00:53:40.351 --> 00:53:40.591
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1918
00:53:40.591 --> 00:53:44.490
<v Speaker 5>they to me on the smaller planes are fucking worst with the regulations.</v>

1919
00:53:44.491 --> 00:53:45.660
<v Speaker 5>Headphones out please.</v>

1920
00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:47.670
<v Speaker 5>Like whether you were listening to music or not.</v>

1921
00:53:47.671 --> 00:53:49.390
<v Speaker 5>And it never happened to me on a big plane.</v>

1922
00:53:49.391 --> 00:53:51.240
<v Speaker 5>It was always those little American Eagle,</v>

1923
00:53:51.241 --> 00:53:51.871
<v Speaker 5>United Express,</v>

1924
00:53:51.871 --> 00:53:52.890
<v Speaker 5>continental express or whatever.</v>

1925
00:53:52.891 --> 00:53:56.030
<v Speaker 5>The delta was weird cause you're not operating,</v>

1926
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.690
<v Speaker 5>they are operating some equipment.</v>

1927
00:53:57.691 --> 00:53:59.400
<v Speaker 5>It's like a Corgan express.</v>

1928
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:01.680
<v Speaker 5>Whoever the fuck it's called is the actual airline.</v>

1929
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:04.440
<v Speaker 5>They use United paint and United ticketing,</v>

1930
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 5>but they're operating kind of as a courier service for United or whoever the</v>

1931
00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:08.813
<v Speaker 1>when they are.</v>

1932
00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:09.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1933
00:54:09.501 --> 00:54:10.311
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

1934
00:54:10.311 --> 00:54:10.610
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1935
00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.980
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be a tough Gig to be a flight attendant.</v>

1936
00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1937
00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.360
<v Speaker 1>But she,</v>

1938
00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.010
<v Speaker 1>that's just creating issues.</v>

1939
00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:17.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no need to do that.</v>

1940
00:54:17.541 --> 00:54:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1941
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm friendly if you're with me.</v>

1942
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I've never get an initial,</v>

1943
00:54:20.511 --> 00:54:20.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1944
00:54:20.751 --> 00:54:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I even argue with her,</v>

1945
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.551
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1946
00:54:22.551 --> 00:54:22.971
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1947
00:54:22.971 --> 00:54:23.781
<v Speaker 1>I got to take this off.</v>

1948
00:54:23.781 --> 00:54:24.081
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

1949
00:54:24.081 --> 00:54:24.531
<v Speaker 1>yes sir.</v>

1950
00:54:24.531 --> 00:54:24.980
<v Speaker 1>That's about it.</v>

1951
00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1952
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:25.610
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1953
00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:26.540
<v Speaker 1>just put it in my bag.</v>

1954
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

1955
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.651
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1956
00:54:27.651 --> 00:54:27.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1957
00:54:27.891 --> 00:54:28.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1958
00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1959
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.233
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to.</v>

1960
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.700
<v Speaker 1>But that's just creating an issue for no reason.</v>

1961
00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:36.701
<v Speaker 1>I saw a man and another man getting a mild dispute about something and this</v>

1962
00:54:37.191 --> 00:54:40.880
<v Speaker 1>woman who was the flight attendant treated bolted them like they were fucking</v>

1963
00:54:40.881 --> 00:54:44.000
<v Speaker 1>children and just rode it into the ground,</v>

1964
00:54:44.001 --> 00:54:45.080
<v Speaker 1>didn't let it go.</v>

1965
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Brought out the pilot,</v>

1966
00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:47.750
<v Speaker 1>made the pilot,</v>

1967
00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:48.680
<v Speaker 1>talked to both men.</v>

1968
00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Totally unnecessary.</v>

1969
00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:51.560
<v Speaker 1>What were they disputing though?</v>

1970
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:55.040
<v Speaker 1>There would be disputing overhead space and this is what happened.</v>

1971
00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1972
00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:00.520
<v Speaker 1>a guy had more than one thing in an overhead and another guy went to put</v>

1973
00:55:00.981 --> 00:55:02.000
<v Speaker 1>something in.</v>

1974
00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.330
<v Speaker 1>He like opened up the thing and there was no space in there.</v>

1975
00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think you said something like,</v>

1976
00:55:07.431 --> 00:55:07.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1977
00:55:07.701 --> 00:55:08.300
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>

1978
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:08.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1979
00:55:08.631 --> 00:55:10.100
<v Speaker 1>why do you have two things in there?</v>

1980
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.911
<v Speaker 1>And the guy said,</v>

1981
00:55:10.911 --> 00:55:11.091
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1982
00:55:11.091 --> 00:55:12.560
<v Speaker 1>first come first serve.</v>

1983
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.240
<v Speaker 1>And the other guy says bull shit.</v>

1984
00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:15.470
<v Speaker 1>And he sits down,</v>

1985
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:16.483
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1986
00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:17.681
<v Speaker 1>The one guy,</v>

1987
00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:18.650
<v Speaker 1>he's got two bags,</v>

1988
00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.390
<v Speaker 1>he puts it in there and he goes,</v>

1989
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

1990
00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.010
<v Speaker 1>there's no room for other people.</v>

1991
00:55:22.011 --> 00:55:22.191
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>

1992
00:55:22.191 --> 00:55:22.311
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1993
00:55:22.311 --> 00:55:22.761
<v Speaker 1>first come,</v>

1994
00:55:22.761 --> 00:55:23.390
<v Speaker 1>first serve.</v>

1995
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.931
<v Speaker 1>They got a guy,</v>

1996
00:55:23.931 --> 00:55:25.040
<v Speaker 1>he goes bull shit.</v>

1997
00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.090
<v Speaker 1>And he sits down.</v>

1998
00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:27.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole dispute.</v>

1999
00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.360
<v Speaker 1>The woman wouldn't let the guy have a drink.</v>

2000
00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:30.350
<v Speaker 1>The guy asked for a drink.</v>

2001
00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:30.860
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2002
00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:31.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2003
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:34.070
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have a drink if I decide to let you have a drink later,</v>

2004
00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you have a drink.</v>

2005
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.960
<v Speaker 1>She brought out the f,</v>

2006
00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.251
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2007
00:55:36.251 --> 00:55:36.331
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2008
00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:36.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2009
00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:37.141
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2010
00:55:37.141 --> 00:55:37.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2011
00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:39.920
<v Speaker 1>pilots and she even talked to me.</v>

2012
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.431
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

2013
00:55:40.431 --> 00:55:41.570
<v Speaker 1>if things go crazy,</v>

2014
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2015
00:55:41.991 --> 00:55:43.730
<v Speaker 1>if either one of these guys gets out of line,</v>

2016
00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:44.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2017
00:55:44.061 --> 00:55:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking to you to,</v>

2018
00:55:45.011 --> 00:55:46.040
<v Speaker 1>to take care of this.</v>

2019
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.880
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2020
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.541
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2021
00:55:47.541 --> 00:55:48.560
<v Speaker 1>all these fucking,</v>

2022
00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:49.310
<v Speaker 1>these guys aren't,</v>

2023
00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:50.143
<v Speaker 1>no one's getting out of,</v>

2024
00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.640
<v Speaker 1>you're creating something out of nothing.</v>

2025
00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:55.520
<v Speaker 1>But she kept harping on him and pestering.</v>

2026
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:58.280
<v Speaker 1>You know how there's some people that if they get in an argument about</v>

2027
00:55:58.281 --> 00:55:58.940
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2028
00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:00.050
<v Speaker 1>like whatever it is,</v>

2029
00:56:00.051 --> 00:56:00.370
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>

2030
00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:00.650
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2031
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:02.240
<v Speaker 1>there's something that winds them up.</v>

2032
00:56:02.241 --> 00:56:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's minor,</v>

2033
00:56:03.111 --> 00:56:06.110
<v Speaker 1>they will beat it into the ground until it becomes major.</v>

2034
00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.340
<v Speaker 1>They'll just ride you,</v>

2035
00:56:07.341 --> 00:56:08.091
<v Speaker 1>ride your ride,</v>

2036
00:56:08.091 --> 00:56:08.841
<v Speaker 1>you until you,</v>

2037
00:56:08.841 --> 00:56:10.100
<v Speaker 1>what could you shut the fuck up?</v>

2038
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:14.210
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like she was trying to get these guys to blow up so she could</v>

2039
00:56:14.211 --> 00:56:15.680
<v Speaker 1>justify her,</v>

2040
00:56:15.681 --> 00:56:17.510
<v Speaker 1>whatever internal strife,</v>

2041
00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:21.470
<v Speaker 1>her internal anger that she was projecting onto the situation,</v>

2042
00:56:21.471 --> 00:56:23.090
<v Speaker 1>but I saw the whole thing go down.</v>

2043
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 1>It was so minor.</v>

2044
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.390
<v Speaker 3>Either that or she was on a flight,</v>

2045
00:56:25.391 --> 00:56:26.680
<v Speaker 3>ones were too drunk,</v>

2046
00:56:26.681 --> 00:56:29.740
<v Speaker 3>began arguing and the flight got diverted and then she was late.</v>

2047
00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:32.890
<v Speaker 3>She was supposed to meet a guy with a huge Dick and she missed it because their</v>

2048
00:56:32.891 --> 00:56:34.420
<v Speaker 3>plane had to land in De Moines.</v>

2049
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I like your story better because my story,</v>

2050
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:39.760
<v Speaker 3>she's just fucking measly.</v>

2051
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:41.470
<v Speaker 3>Cut My story.</v>

2052
00:56:41.471 --> 00:56:44.140
<v Speaker 3>She was fucking on her way to get some giant Dick and she didn't want either one</v>

2053
00:56:44.141 --> 00:56:46.000
<v Speaker 3>of these fucking petty zilch is to interfere.</v>

2054
00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:51.820
<v Speaker 3>It was just was the way she talked to them.</v>

2055
00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:53.860
<v Speaker 3>It was like she had a green light.</v>

2056
00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2057
00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:56.160
<v Speaker 3>To say what she wanted it and push the issue is hard.</v>

2058
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:57.310
<v Speaker 3>They really do.</v>

2059
00:56:57.311 --> 00:56:57.671
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>

2060
00:56:57.671 --> 00:56:59.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean after nine 11 we all change that.</v>

2061
00:56:59.191 --> 00:57:01.150
<v Speaker 3>We saw flying and we got to give them a lot of leeway.</v>

2062
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.520
<v Speaker 3>But it does get to be a point where you have to be able to go like,</v>

2063
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:03.791
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2064
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:06.070
<v Speaker 3>you're being a fucking complete and utter twat.</v>

2065
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:06.580
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2066
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.100
<v Speaker 3>But you can never say that anymore ever.</v>

2067
00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 3>I do look at situations very differently.</v>

2068
00:57:10.781 --> 00:57:13.000
<v Speaker 3>If I see people getting into dispute on an airplane,</v>

2069
00:57:13.001 --> 00:57:13.131
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2070
00:57:13.131 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 3>I do look at it like as a potential.</v>

2071
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:15.551
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2072
00:57:15.551 --> 00:57:17.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't look at it as like a terrorist situation,</v>

2073
00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:19.960
<v Speaker 3>but I do look at it as a potential like,</v>

2074
00:57:19.961 --> 00:57:20.380
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2075
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:20.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2076
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.660
<v Speaker 3>people do bad shit to each other.</v>

2077
00:57:22.661 --> 00:57:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes bad shit can go down.</v>

2078
00:57:24.221 --> 00:57:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2079
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:27.760
<v Speaker 3>And people are still allowed to carry a lot of fucking dangerous shit on planes.</v>

2080
00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.820
<v Speaker 3>They took away pool cues and they took away knives and a few things and they</v>

2081
00:57:31.821 --> 00:57:34.030
<v Speaker 3>were going to bring back pocket knives and pool cues,</v>

2082
00:57:34.031 --> 00:57:35.710
<v Speaker 3>but then they changed it because,</v>

2083
00:57:35.711 --> 00:57:36.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2084
00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:36.881
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

2085
00:57:36.881 --> 00:57:37.714
<v Speaker 3>Someone did something,</v>

2086
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:37.991
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2087
00:57:37.991 --> 00:57:41.980
<v Speaker 3>that guy showed up in lax and shot a bunch of TSA workers.</v>

2088
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Remember that he killed that one TSA worker,</v>

2089
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:45.800
<v Speaker 3>that Guy May,</v>

2090
00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.910
<v Speaker 3>they pulled back this regulation change that they were going to have because of</v>

2091
00:57:48.911 --> 00:57:49.660
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>

2092
00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.000
<v Speaker 3>But people still bring skateboards on.</v>

2093
00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:55.000
<v Speaker 3>You could fuck somebody up on a scale Mac book pro,</v>

2094
00:57:55.001 --> 00:57:58.510
<v Speaker 3>even that Shit's fucking titanium or just let it get it all or close it while</v>

2095
00:57:58.511 --> 00:57:59.041
<v Speaker 3>it's still on.</v>

2096
00:57:59.041 --> 00:58:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Cause they always heat up and then say to somebody,</v>

2097
00:58:00.401 --> 00:58:00.910
<v Speaker 3>hold us down.</v>

2098
00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:01.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2099
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.380
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2100
00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm struggle.</v>

2101
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:04.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm really passive way to beat somebody up.</v>

2102
00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:05.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2103
00:58:05.501 --> 00:58:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you rubbed the bottom of it and get it all friction knee rubbing</v>

2104
00:58:09.281 --> 00:58:10.840
<v Speaker 3>on them and watch them get shocked and burn.</v>

2105
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.030
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2106
00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:12.370
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2107
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:16.690
<v Speaker 3>the idea of a violence on a plane just freaks a lot of people out.</v>

2108
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2109
00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.750
<v Speaker 3>the diversion of the flight,</v>

2110
00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:24.880
<v Speaker 3>we've seen too many videos of guys yelling and screaming or that one fucking buy</v>

2111
00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 3>Polak cut wherever they're from trying to open the door.</v>

2112
00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:28.571
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2113
00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.470
<v Speaker 3>I think a big part of it,</v>

2114
00:58:29.471 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 3>and we've seen so much more than the last 20 something years because there's no</v>

2115
00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:34.030
<v Speaker 3>more smoking on planes and I'm glad.</v>

2116
00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:38.110
<v Speaker 3>But I think a lot of what you see in rageful situations is people jonesing for</v>

2117
00:58:38.111 --> 00:58:38.944
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes.</v>

2118
00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Because there were times where I couldn't have a cigarette.</v>

2119
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:45.220
<v Speaker 3>Best thing I would do is quit smoking in 2001 but when I'd be on a flight,</v>

2120
00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:45.871
<v Speaker 3>if we were going to move,</v>

2121
00:58:45.871 --> 00:58:46.750
<v Speaker 3>when I was opening for dice,</v>

2122
00:58:46.751 --> 00:58:47.620
<v Speaker 3>we're going to Dallas.</v>

2123
00:58:47.621 --> 00:58:48.840
<v Speaker 3>It said it was an hour delay of,</v>

2124
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:49.361
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2125
00:58:49.361 --> 00:58:50.290
<v Speaker 3>that's another hour.</v>

2126
00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 3>I can't smoke.</v>

2127
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:52.550
<v Speaker 3>And you start your body,</v>

2128
00:58:52.551 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 3>you start to feel that fucking,</v>

2129
00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:55.510
<v Speaker 3>that withdrawal.</v>

2130
00:58:55.511 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people are probably going through that on planes and freaking out</v>

2131
00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:01.180
<v Speaker 3>that they can't smoke.</v>

2132
00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:01.361
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2133
00:59:01.361 --> 00:59:03.360
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee and I'm glad they can't smell it,</v>

2134
00:59:03.361 --> 00:59:04.360
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's a part of,</v>

2135
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.070
<v Speaker 3>and then it'll get the fucking petty do.</v>

2136
00:59:06.071 --> 00:59:07.450
<v Speaker 3>She's not even letting you have the fake.</v>

2137
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Some of the fake cigarettes do smell.</v>

2138
00:59:09.191 --> 00:59:10.024
<v Speaker 3>Kurt Metzger,</v>

2141
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:15.550
<v Speaker 3>These fucking things in the editing bay.</v>

2142
00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:19.510
<v Speaker 3>They smelled like vanilla bark and they are nowhere near as offensive as a real</v>

2143
00:59:19.511 --> 00:59:20.290
<v Speaker 3>cigarette.</v>

2144
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.000

2145
00:59:23.001 --> 00:59:24.800
<v Speaker 3>It was like the fuck you doing.</v>

2146
00:59:24.801 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 3>He had one that was smoking in here for why it was strawberry.</v>

00:59:28.581 --> 00:59:31.310
<v Speaker 3>the thing I'm reading about those is they don't know if that shit safe cause</v>

2151
00:59:31.311 --> 00:59:32.270
<v Speaker 3>you're breathing something.</v>

2155
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:38.270
<v Speaker 3>And there's no studies that have been done on it.</v>

2156
00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:41.510
<v Speaker 3>There's no studies about the secondhand smoke and whatever it is.</v>

2157
00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:41.681
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2158
00:59:41.681 --> 00:59:44.450
<v Speaker 3>it's also you're making someone breathe your smell.</v>

2159
00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2161
00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:45.370
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2162
00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:47.330
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you were spraying perfume in the area,</v>

2163
00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.171
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

2166
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Making people aware of your scent.</v>

2167
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:53.600
<v Speaker 3>Like wearing perfume.</v>

2168
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2169
00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Women don't know how to wear perfume.</v>

2170
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2171
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Some do.</v>

2172
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Most of them.</v>

2173
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:58.070
<v Speaker 3>You're generalizing that crazy.</v>

2174
00:59:58.290 --> 00:59:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2175
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can go anywhere where there's women in smell perfume.</v>

2176
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 3>If you focus in on it,</v>

2177
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:03.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2178
01:00:03.591 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 3>like why am I smelling having to smell this?</v>

2179
01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:09.560
<v Speaker 3>I was in a restaurant recently and some guy had one of those big ass vapor</v>

2180
01:00:09.561 --> 01:00:10.394
<v Speaker 3>pipes.</v>

2181
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:10.761
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2182
01:00:10.761 --> 01:00:15.320
<v Speaker 3>it was like a big fat tube one that he was puffing on and the fucking,</v>

2183
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.800
<v Speaker 3>it was filling the restaurant with smart.</v>

2184
01:00:17.801 --> 01:00:18.290
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2185
01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:23.290
<v Speaker 3>But because it's like a vapor pipe or whatever the fuck it's supposed to be and</v>

2186
01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:25.310
<v Speaker 3>not lighting a fire,</v>

2187
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 3>it's supposedly okay.</v>

2188
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:27.500
<v Speaker 3>But I'm like,</v>

2189
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

2190
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Because I was eating with my kids and I was like,</v>

2191
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:31.940
<v Speaker 3>we're sitting here in this guy smoke.</v>

2192
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:32.241
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2193
01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:33.200
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot of it.</v>

2194
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2195
01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:35.300
<v Speaker 3>he was taking these and you could see it.</v>

2196
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like those blue cigarettes,</v>

2197
01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:38.271
<v Speaker 3>you know those things,</v>

2198
01:00:38.271 --> 01:00:40.130
<v Speaker 3>those sharia blue e-cigs.</v>

2199
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.210
<v Speaker 3>When you blow those out,</v>

2200
01:00:41.211 --> 01:00:43.040
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's up and it's gone in seconds.</v>

2201
01:00:43.041 --> 01:00:44.420
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have any smell this.</v>

2202
01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:45.530
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of what I'm thinking.</v>

2203
01:00:45.531 --> 01:00:46.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2204
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Those are the ones that are okay.</v>

2205
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.201
<v Speaker 3>But those,</v>

2206
01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:49.550
<v Speaker 3>those fat ones that are like,</v>

2207
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 3>they're all different in their delivery method.</v>

2208
01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:52.371
<v Speaker 3>They're all different.</v>

2209
01:00:52.371 --> 01:00:52.561
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

2210
01:00:52.561 --> 01:00:52.691
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2211
01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:55.250
<v Speaker 3>the way they burn the oils and tobacco oil,</v>

2212
01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.750
<v Speaker 3>some of them it's fucking smoke.</v>

2213
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.800
<v Speaker 3>It's smoke.</v>

2214
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2215
01:00:58.041 --> 01:00:58.700
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>

2216
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.520
<v Speaker 3>you're burning oil instead of burning plant matter.</v>

2217
01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:01.941
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2218

2270
01:02:09.441 --> 01:02:09.831
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

2271
01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:10.161
<v Speaker 3>uh hey,</v>

2272
01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:10.581
<v Speaker 3>you're a little,</v>

2273
01:02:10.581 --> 01:02:12.170
<v Speaker 3>when Bob Kelly was in and he goes,</v>

2274
01:02:12.171 --> 01:02:12.921
<v Speaker 3>you're a little winded.</v>

2275
01:02:12.921 --> 01:02:17.921
<v Speaker 3>Waskow's that's cause I had to walk around you and Bobby like that fast.</v>

2276
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:19.320
<v Speaker 3>It was was,</v>

2277
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 3>it was like he had been</v>

2278
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.420
<v Speaker 5>waiting for someone to say Voss,</v>

2279
01:02:21.421 --> 01:02:22.200
<v Speaker 5>you seem winded.</v>

2280
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:22.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2281
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.770
<v Speaker 5>So just when you want to just take a fucking a pick ax and hit rich in the</v>

2282
01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:26.604
<v Speaker 5>chest,</v>

2283
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.740
<v Speaker 5>he reminds you of his comedic brilliance.</v>

2284
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:31.380
<v Speaker 5>Like he'll do something like to have the gun with the white fish and you hate</v>

2285
01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

2286
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.560
<v Speaker 5>But then as I said,</v>

2287
01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.020
<v Speaker 5>something that's so comedically brilliant,</v>

2288
01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:34.640
<v Speaker 5>like this guy,</v>

2289
01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.790
<v Speaker 5>there's a genius to rich Voss.</v>

2290
01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.410
<v Speaker 5>I love how you guys had just gotten done talking about how no is going to sit in</v>

2291
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:40.263
<v Speaker 5>Anthony seed.</v>

2292
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.150
<v Speaker 5>You should probably put a glass box around it.</v>

2293
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.460
<v Speaker 5>Boss comes in the room and the first thing he does is sit in,</v>

2294
01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:45.081
<v Speaker 5>they have to be seated.</v>

2295
01:02:45.081 --> 01:02:45.450
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

2296
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 5>I never really liked that guy anyway.</v>

2297
01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:51.060
<v Speaker 5>He's just a fucking Asberger's funny guy.</v>

2298
01:02:51.061 --> 01:02:52.170
<v Speaker 5>Like that's what Voss is.</v>

2299
01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:53.550
<v Speaker 5>He's completely,</v>

2300
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 5>he'll make fun of anybody.</v>

2301
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:56.550
<v Speaker 5>He'll make fun of anything.</v>

2302
01:02:56.550 --> 01:03:01.550
<v Speaker 5>Like he kinda does a purity to rich [inaudible] he's fucking be just turned 57.</v>

2328
01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:31.764
<v Speaker 5>so brutal,</v>

<v Speaker 5>But it's so funny to listen.</v>

2333
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.750
<v Speaker 5>Nobody has a better sense of humor about each other as a couple.</v>

2334
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:41.880
<v Speaker 5>Like I've seen them brutalize each other,</v>

2335
01:03:41.881 --> 01:03:44.400
<v Speaker 5>like the things that would destroy me as a,</v>

2336
01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:45.570
<v Speaker 5>as a member of a couple.</v>

2337
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 5>And they just laugh it off and they're fine.</v>

2338
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:50.400
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe it for like two goldfish.</v>

2339
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:53.160
<v Speaker 5>Like they just forget the hatred they spewed at each other.</v>

2340
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:54.750

<v Speaker 5>there's so funny together.</v>

2344
01:03:58.051 --> 01:04:00.720
<v Speaker 5>It's like gimme that's the relationship the two comedians should have.</v>

2345
01:04:00.721 --> 01:04:01.680
<v Speaker 5>And I could never have one.</v>

2346
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.891
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2347
01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:03.300
<v Speaker 5>it'd be a great reality show.</v>

01:04:04.261 --> 01:04:04.920
<v Speaker 5>They don't have,</v>

2351
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.090
<v Speaker 5>because the business stinks.</v>

2352
01:04:06.091 --> 01:04:09.990
<v Speaker 5>That's why our show business stinks that they haven't taken fucking rich and</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2361
01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.640

2362
01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.570
<v Speaker 5>maybe because they don't,</v>

2363
01:04:21.571 --> 01:04:22.404
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2364

2365
01:04:23.311 --> 01:04:24.240
<v Speaker 5>I was just saying maybe they don't want that.</v>

2366
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.530
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't even think of a followup resign.</v>

2367
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:25.710
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

2368
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:28.770
<v Speaker 5>the only thing that I could think of is that shows with comedians.</v>

2369
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:29.431
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 5>how many reality shows with comedians have there been Tammy Pesky tell you how</v>

2371
01:04:34.061 --> 01:04:34.890
<v Speaker 5>to show for a while.</v>

2372
01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:36.060
<v Speaker 5>Remember that and I do not.</v>

2373
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.133
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2374
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:40.950
<v Speaker 5>who else has anybody mean last comic standing?</v>

2375
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:45.951
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of a reality because comedians are to Pauly shore killed the whole</v>

2376
01:04:46.141 --> 01:04:50.010
<v Speaker 5>fucking genre or is it because comics are actually concise,</v>

2377
01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:55.011
<v Speaker 5>funny and not situational like or comedians are not goofy situation.</v>

2378
01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:59.550
<v Speaker 5>Funny like all doesn't realize she's putting pepper on her oatmeal,</v>

2379
01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:00.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2380
01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:01.194
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2381
01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.180
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>

2382
01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.040
<v Speaker 5>every dump cut in a reality show does something stupid.</v>

2383
01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:05.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to look for a walk.</v>

2384
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:08.460
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] but home it's upside down.</v>

2385
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.171
<v Speaker 5>Six,</v>

2386
01:05:10.171 --> 01:05:10.921

<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2390
01:05:13.651 --> 01:05:16.290
<v Speaker 5>And comics would just dissect comics or two in the moment.</v>

2391
01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:18.670
<v Speaker 5>This is how dumb we are as comedians will say like,</v>

2392
01:05:18.671 --> 01:05:18.851
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2393

01:05:19.031 --> 01:05:19.810
<v Speaker 5>what do you want me to do?</v>

2395
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:21.280
<v Speaker 5>There's a guy with a camera looking at me.</v>

2396
01:05:21.281 --> 01:05:21.510
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

2397
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.880
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2398
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.260
<v Speaker 5>we acknowledged too much.</v>

2399
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:23.830
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2400
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:24.820
<v Speaker 5>I did family jewels,</v>

2401
01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 5>I roasted gene and then they wanted me to do this kind of like pseudo reality</v>

2402
01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:30.460
<v Speaker 5>thing at the end with gene and his wife.</v>

2403
01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 5>And and someone else,</v>

2404
01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:33.280
<v Speaker 5>but of course like a Douche.</v>

2405
01:05:33.281 --> 01:05:34.690
<v Speaker 5>I referenced the camera guy and be like,</v>

2406
01:05:34.691 --> 01:05:34.850
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2407
01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:37.450
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to mention that he's here.</v>

2408
01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:38.980
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's what it is.</v>

2409
01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we're too,</v>

2410
01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.100
<v Speaker 5>we don't know how to shut the fuck up.</v>

2411
01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:43.090
<v Speaker 5>I Love Gene Simmons.</v>

2412
01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:44.050
<v Speaker 5>I can't watch that show.</v>

2413
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.250
<v Speaker 5>It's just so God damn.</v>

2414
01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:45.611
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

2415
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:46.444
<v Speaker 5>I love him too.</v>

2416
01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.200
<v Speaker 5>I love him.</v>

2417
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:47.951
<v Speaker 5>I can't watch this.</v>

2418
01:05:47.951 --> 01:05:48.820
<v Speaker 5>I would saw him the other day.</v>

2419
01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:50.550
<v Speaker 5>He was at the glory kickboxing fights in La.</v>

2420
01:05:50.551 --> 01:05:52.000
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking awesome to see him again.</v>

2421
01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:52.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2422
01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.340
<v Speaker 5>but however I can't watch,</v>

2423
01:05:54.341 --> 01:05:57.190
<v Speaker 5>I did sit so much fuckery in those shows.</v>

2424
01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.960
<v Speaker 5>There's no reality shows.</v>

2425
01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:04.170
<v Speaker 5>Every reality show has these fixed scenarios and they're faking shit that like</v>

2426
01:06:04.571 --> 01:06:05.760
<v Speaker 5>you would never think they fake.</v>

2427
01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:06.760
<v Speaker 5>Like there's certain,</v>

2428
01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.830
<v Speaker 5>like they were talking about those storage wars shows,</v>

2429
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:09.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2430
01:06:09.191 --> 01:06:11.110
<v Speaker 5>they just fill those storage's.</v>

2431
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:12.063
<v Speaker 5>They fill them.</v>

2432
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:13.090
<v Speaker 5>They set it all up.</v>

2433
01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.013
<v Speaker 5>It's all fake.</v>

2434
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.861
<v Speaker 5>But no one know.</v>

2435
01:06:14.861 --> 01:06:15.491
<v Speaker 5>Open the door.</v>

2436
01:06:15.491 --> 01:06:16.660
<v Speaker 5>We don't even know what's in there.</v>

2437
01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.740
<v Speaker 5>What's an a typewriter?</v>

2438
01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:19.030
<v Speaker 5>You fucking put it there.</v>

2439
01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.073
<v Speaker 5>They put the,</v>

2440
01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:22.990
<v Speaker 5>they put everything in those boxes.</v>

2441
01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:23.920
<v Speaker 5>It's all fake.</v>

2442
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.230
<v Speaker 5>You're hoping that they opened one from fucking,</v>

2443
01:06:26.231 --> 01:06:26.800
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2444
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.900
<v Speaker 5>from Hannibal lectors.</v>

2445
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:28.780
<v Speaker 5>One of his clients.</v>

2446
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.740
<v Speaker 5>Nice Limo with a fucking head in the jar.</v>

2447
01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.073
<v Speaker 5>That'd be,</v>

2448
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:33.063
<v Speaker 5>that'd be a critic.</v>

2449
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:34.360
<v Speaker 5>Hester Moffitt.</v>

2450
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.390
<v Speaker 5>You're hoping it's one of those,</v>

2451
01:06:37.391 --> 01:06:37.601
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

2452
01:06:37.601 --> 01:06:37.931
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

2453
01:06:37.931 --> 01:06:40.240
<v Speaker 5>It's all fixed and the only real one was the Osborne.</v>

2454
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:42.700
<v Speaker 5>Sharon said there was no take two ever.</v>

2455
01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:43.600
<v Speaker 5>They have to,</v>

2456
01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.160
<v Speaker 5>because it was nine months of filming.</v>

2457
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.690
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to commit to that kind of filming.</v>

2458
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:50.110
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to take the time it would take because I think that my life is</v>

2459
01:06:50.111 --> 01:06:51.460
<v Speaker 5>fascinating and like,</v>

2460
01:06:51.461 --> 01:06:51.920
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

2461
01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.020
<v Speaker 5>But I look at my life,</v>

2462
01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:53.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2463
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:54.280
<v Speaker 5>all right.</v>

2464
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.840
<v Speaker 5>Episodic reality show.</v>

2465
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:56.703
<v Speaker 5>Jim Norton.</v>

2466
01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:57.850
<v Speaker 5>I wake up,</v>

2467
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.140
<v Speaker 5>I go do the radio,</v>

2468
01:06:59.141 --> 01:06:59.681
<v Speaker 5>I come hall,</v>

2469
01:06:59.681 --> 01:07:00.514
<v Speaker 5>I go to the gym.</v>

2470
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.570
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing there.</v>

2471
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 5>Maybe a couple of funny lines on the radio and me and the gym.</v>

2472
01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:06.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm tired again.</v>

2473
01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:06.581
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

2474
01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:08.410
<v Speaker 5>there's a minute of the show kill.</v>

2475
01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.490
<v Speaker 5>Here's the real show.</v>

2476
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.260
<v Speaker 5>You getting prostitutes.</v>

2477
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.153
<v Speaker 5>I thought of that.</v>

2478
01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:14.590
<v Speaker 5>I've tried to pitch that to vice and they didn't want it.</v>

2479
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:15.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2480
01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:16.450
<v Speaker 5>I want to go look.</v>

2481
01:07:16.451 --> 01:07:16.961
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing,</v>

2482
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:19.180
<v Speaker 5>like I go from fucking place to place in brothels.</v>

2483
01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:21.400
<v Speaker 5>I give you reviews and they're just like,</v>

2484
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.771
<v Speaker 5>no one,</v>

2485
01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:22.750
<v Speaker 5>they said no.</v>

2486
01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:25.420
<v Speaker 5>Well like what's entertaining about finding like me getting blow jobs,</v>

2487
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:26.081
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>

2488
01:07:26.081 --> 01:07:28.510
<v Speaker 5>but they won't show the blow jobs and the hookers probably wouldn't sign up for</v>

2489
01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:31.810
<v Speaker 5>it cause they don't have to have a big blurry thing over everybody's head.</v>

2490
01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:32.710
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2491
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 5>here's what I want it to do.</v>

2492
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:35.680
<v Speaker 5>This was my idea for a reality segment.</v>

2493
01:07:35.681 --> 01:07:38.770
<v Speaker 5>I really want it to do this with massage girls because I fucking like,</v>

2494
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:41.080
<v Speaker 5>like I'm drinking this any type of milk product.</v>

2495
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:46.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking a horrible farter and I really wanted to take a hidden camera and</v>

2496
01:07:46.211 --> 01:07:51.211
<v Speaker 5>have massage girls come over and just somehow like signal the camera when I'm</v>

2497
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:52.510
<v Speaker 5>going to cut a gasser like,</v>

2498
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:53.710
<v Speaker 5>like I'll say beforehand,</v>

2499
01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:55.600
<v Speaker 5>every time I say the word yellow,</v>

2500
01:07:55.601 --> 01:07:57.340
<v Speaker 5>it means I'm about to Fart so that you'll,</v>

2501
01:07:57.341 --> 01:07:58.570
<v Speaker 5>you'll see me on there and I'll go like,</v>

2502
01:07:58.571 --> 01:07:58.721
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2503
01:07:58.721 --> 01:07:59.201
<v Speaker 5>like yeah,</v>

2504
01:07:59.201 --> 01:07:59.511
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

2505
01:07:59.511 --> 01:08:03.100
<v Speaker 5>something yellow and then I'll fart maybe quietly and then you can watch her</v>

2506
01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:04.293
<v Speaker 5>react.</v>

2507
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:07.660
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is you can't show the face.</v>

2508
01:08:07.661 --> 01:08:07.901
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2509
01:08:07.901 --> 01:08:09.700
<v Speaker 5>and too many of them would say no to that,</v>

2510
01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:11.620
<v Speaker 5>but that's what I wanted to do.</v>

2511
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.191
<v Speaker 5>But how am I,</v>

2512
01:08:12.191 --> 01:08:14.860
<v Speaker 5>how long would that be interesting Jim farts during massages.</v>

2513
01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:15.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2514
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 5>but you say that people</v>

2515
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.551
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't,</v>

2516
01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.050
<v Speaker 3>like you couldn't go to brothels,</v>

2517
01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:20.270
<v Speaker 3>but you could if the girls were porn stars.</v>

2518
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.133
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2519
01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:21.831
<v Speaker 3>That is true.</v>

2520
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:22.611
<v Speaker 3>And I would do that.</v>

2521
01:08:22.611 --> 01:08:23.444
<v Speaker 3>I would love to do that.</v>

2522
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:26.090
<v Speaker 3>But then I'm like Collin Quinn a long time ago,</v>

2523
01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:27.020
<v Speaker 3>remind me many,</v>

2524

01:08:27.461 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 3>My first,</v>

2526
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:28.761
<v Speaker 3>I go on an opiate addict.</v>

2527
01:08:28.761 --> 01:08:31.520
<v Speaker 3>I was dating a British girl and she was a real pervert.</v>

2528
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Like I drove a Saturn back then.</v>

2529
01:08:32.781 --> 01:08:36.590
<v Speaker 3>I still lived in Jersey and I used to fucking park outside of Dangerfield and</v>

2530
01:08:36.591 --> 01:08:37.371
<v Speaker 3>she would blow me.</v>

2531
01:08:37.371 --> 01:08:37.941
<v Speaker 3>I would trap.</v>

2532
01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:41.240
<v Speaker 3>She liked been to trap her head under my steering wheel and she'd go like,</v>

2533
01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I want you to bite me.</v>

2534
01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:43.460
<v Speaker 3>I want you to bite me.</v>

2535
01:08:43.461 --> 01:08:48.320
<v Speaker 3>Like she would repeat this mantra of me biting her on her back.</v>

2536
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:49.960
<v Speaker 3>But she liked to be bitten and brutalized.</v>

2537
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2538
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.040
<v Speaker 3>So would bite her back and she'd be like,</v>

2539
01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:53.330
<v Speaker 3>I want you to make me suck it.</v>

2540
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:57.080
<v Speaker 3>And then I would hold her head under the wheel and she'll be trapped under my</v>

2541
01:08:57.081 --> 01:08:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Saturday steering wheel</v>

2542

<v Speaker 3>and fucking,</v>

2543
01:09:01.311 --> 01:09:04.070
<v Speaker 3>she would suck my dick and lick my balls and whatever could kid.</v>

2544
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:04.911
<v Speaker 3>She was a good girl.</v>

2545
01:09:04.911 --> 01:09:05.091
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.040
<v Speaker 3>She was a really cool girl.</v>

2551
01:09:09.081 --> 01:09:10.430
<v Speaker 3>But she was a great girl.</v>

2552
01:09:10.431 --> 01:09:11.300
<v Speaker 3>I miss her terribly.</v>

2553
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.120
<v Speaker 3>I think she went back across the pond.</v>

2554
01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>

2555
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.733
<v Speaker 3>As they say.</v>

2556
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 3>And what was the point of this story?</v>

2557
01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:17.661
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2558
01:09:17.661 --> 01:09:18.494
<v Speaker 3>Collin College,</v>

2559
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.570
<v Speaker 3>she was really loud when I ate her pussy.</v>

2560
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Really super loud and it was say,</v>

2561
01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:24.711
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

2562
01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:25.700
<v Speaker 3>It's just moaning and groaning.</v>

2563
01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.790
<v Speaker 3>Gb One of those things.</v>

2564
01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:29.624
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2565
01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:31.250
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2566
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:31.550
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2567
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:32.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2568
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:32.893
<v Speaker 3>He said whatever it was.</v>

2569
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.250
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

2570
01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:33.380
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2571
01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.870
<v Speaker 3>I with my,</v>

2572
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.901
<v Speaker 3>my pussy,</v>

2573
01:09:38.901 --> 01:09:40.220
<v Speaker 3>like it's Manchester United,</v>

2574
01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:41.054
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2575
01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:44.390
<v Speaker 3>But I can't,</v>

2576
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:48.080
<v Speaker 3>it was a really loud and it puts you a sloppy fucking wet.</v>

2577
01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Like it was legit.</v>

2578
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:53.240
<v Speaker 3>Like I knew she wasn't putting on a show cause her pussy was sloppy.</v>

2579
01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:55.440
<v Speaker 3>But I was going to eat her pussy on the air opiate.</v>

2580
01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:56.271
<v Speaker 3>This is before I was there,</v>

2581
01:09:56.271 --> 01:09:57.380
<v Speaker 3>like a every day and it will be,</v>

2582
01:09:57.381 --> 01:09:58.790
<v Speaker 3>it's said quality and your pussy on the air.</v>

2583
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:02.270
<v Speaker 3>And I was going to do that and Colin Quinn stopped me and he goes,</v>

2584
01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:02.550
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2585
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:03.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2586
01:10:03.051 --> 01:10:03.621
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>

2587
01:10:03.621 --> 01:10:04.460
<v Speaker 3>you can do that.</v>

2588
01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:04.911
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2589
01:10:04.911 --> 01:10:05.211
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

2590
01:10:05.211 --> 01:10:05.811
<v Speaker 3>you're a comic.</v>

2591
01:10:05.811 --> 01:10:06.950
<v Speaker 3>You got to say funny shit.</v>

2592
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.160
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be that guy that does wacky things.</v>

2593
01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:10.641
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2594
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:11.750
<v Speaker 3>I never forgot that.</v>

2595
01:10:11.751 --> 01:10:12.471
<v Speaker 3>He was almost telling me,</v>

2596
01:10:12.471 --> 01:10:13.760
<v Speaker 3>don't be a stunt boy.</v>

2597
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:15.710
<v Speaker 3>You gotta say it funny.</v>

2598
01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:20.690
<v Speaker 3>You got to sit there and be funny verbally and I maybe in that case he was right</v>

2599
01:10:20.691 --> 01:10:21.410
<v Speaker 3>because I wasn't the guy,</v>

2600
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:23.750
<v Speaker 3>the Wacko who called up at eight pussy on the air.</v>

2601
01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like I have to be able to be funny in my delivery and say,</v>

2602
01:10:27.591 --> 01:10:27.891
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

2603
01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:28.371
<v Speaker 3>eh.</v>

2604
01:10:28.371 --> 01:10:29.630
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of a good point.</v>

2605
01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:30.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking back in hindsight,</v>

2606
01:10:30.861 --> 01:10:32.240
<v Speaker 3>I probably should have eaten her pussy on the arcs.</v>

2607
01:10:32.241 --> 01:10:33.230
<v Speaker 3>It'd be a very funny clip.</v>

2608
01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2609
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:34.760
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying though.</v>

2610
01:10:34.761 --> 01:10:35.690
<v Speaker 3>I know what he was saying.</v>

2611
01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2612
01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:39.470
<v Speaker 3>You can get stuck in that trap of being the stunt guy,</v>

2613
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.380
<v Speaker 3>having a one up yourself every time.</v>

2614
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.481
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2615
01:10:41.481 --> 01:10:41.811
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

2616
01:10:41.811 --> 01:10:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Jim Norton did this crazy thing.</v>

2617
01:10:43.341 --> 01:10:44.180
<v Speaker 3>He put his ass hole,</v>

2618
01:10:44.181 --> 01:10:45.014
<v Speaker 3>his finger in his ass.</v>

2619
01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:45.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2620
01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2621
01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:48.440
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be the guy that talks about it then the guy that actually</v>

2622
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.510
<v Speaker 3>demonstrates it and gets the laugh.</v>

2623
01:10:50.511 --> 01:10:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Cause then if I talk about it,</v>

2624
01:10:51.561 --> 01:10:52.211
<v Speaker 3>people like us not,</v>

2625
01:10:52.211 --> 01:10:52.700
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>

2626
01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:52.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2627
01:10:52.851 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that a weird thing where people get trapped in that stunk guide thing?</v>

2628
01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of those stunt guys that are on radio shows.</v>

2629
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a radio show that I did where they made this guy dress up like a</v>

2630
01:11:03.201 --> 01:11:06.410
<v Speaker 3>cow and it's rollerskate and jump over a chair.</v>

2631
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:09.130
<v Speaker 3>And if he didn't jump over that he didn't make over the chairs.</v>

2632
01:11:09.131 --> 01:11:10.100
<v Speaker 3>So they had to punish them.</v>

2633
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.881
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2634
01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:11.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2635
01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:11.480
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2636
01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.201
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>

2637
01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:13.100
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

2638
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.990
<v Speaker 3>whatever punishment they had and the punishment was,</v>

2639
01:11:15.991 --> 01:11:16.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2640
01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:16.481
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2641
01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:17.850
<v Speaker 3>I choked him unconscious.</v>

2642
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:18.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

2643
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.141
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

2644
01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:20.190
<v Speaker 3>you sure you want to do this?</v>

2645
01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:20.461
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2646
01:11:20.461 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 3>I got to do whatever they tell me to do.</v>

2647
01:11:21.661 --> 01:11:21.871
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2648
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:22.500
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

2649
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.580
<v Speaker 3>It was like so weird.</v>

2650
01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:23.971
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2651
01:11:23.971 --> 01:11:25.590
<v Speaker 3>this is a local radio show.</v>

2652
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:26.090
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2653
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 3>like you really have to do this.</v>

2654
01:11:27.481 --> 01:11:28.314
<v Speaker 3>But he was like,</v>

2655
01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:32.850
<v Speaker 3>like he was like a slave like in sort of like we'll do,</v>

2656
01:11:32.851 --> 01:11:33.270
<v Speaker 3>I will do it.</v>

2657
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Master tells me to,</v>

2658
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.790
<v Speaker 3>I will do what they tell me to do.</v>

2659
01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:40.860
<v Speaker 3>So I choke them unconscious a slave for the recognition of the radio.</v>

2660
01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:43.020
<v Speaker 3>She just sat there and I put my arms around and I go,</v>

2661
01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:44.490
<v Speaker 3>well let me know when you're gonna tap out.</v>

2662
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:45.271
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have,</v>

2663
01:11:45.271 --> 01:11:45.960
<v Speaker 3>you can't take it anymore,</v>

2664
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.130
<v Speaker 3>just tap out and I'll let you go.</v>

2665
01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:47.881
<v Speaker 3>You Ready?</v>

2666
01:11:47.881 --> 01:11:48.211
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2667
01:11:48.211 --> 01:11:48.371
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2668
01:11:48.371 --> 01:11:50.010
<v Speaker 3>And I just squeeze them out.</v>

2669
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:50.881
<v Speaker 3>And the weird thing is,</v>

2670
01:11:50.881 --> 01:11:52.500
<v Speaker 3>good luck doing that on a regular radio again.</v>

2671
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:53.201
<v Speaker 3>That's probably a while,</v>

2672
01:11:53.201 --> 01:11:53.670
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

2673

2676
01:11:57.601 --> 01:11:57.781
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2679

2681
01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:05.280
<v Speaker 3>like I know how to do it,</v>

2682
01:12:05.281 --> 01:12:06.390
<v Speaker 3>but what if I didn't know how to do it?</v>

2683

2685
01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:11.870
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what it was.</v>

2686
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:12.101
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2687
01:12:12.101 --> 01:12:14.310
<v Speaker 3>there's official or nonofficial with a few years back,</v>

2688
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:19.260
<v Speaker 3>two people got sued for taking photos with people where they were choking him in</v>

2689
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:20.330
<v Speaker 3>the picture as a joke.</v>

2690
01:12:20.331 --> 01:12:20.760

2734
01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:13.470
<v Speaker 3>it was a real situation.</v>

2735
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.100
<v Speaker 3>I always asked him,</v>

2840
01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.050
<v Speaker 5>Like you know the first sit right here.</v>

2841
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:47.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be combative with my hands.</v>

2842
01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:47.850
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

2843
01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:48.683
<v Speaker 5>that sounds good</v>

2844
01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:52.840
<v Speaker 6>right here.</v>

2845
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.673
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2846
01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:54.430
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2847
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:55.010
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2848
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:58.600
<v Speaker 5>that's good to hear you.</v>

2849
01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.453
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2850
01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:07.850
<v Speaker 5>Chantal leg kick.</v>

2851
01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:08.723
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2852
01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.990
<v Speaker 5>That was essentially the weight of his Shin and his leg and he puts something</v>

2853
01:16:12.991 --> 01:16:13.351
<v Speaker 5>into it,</v>

2854
01:16:13.351 --> 01:16:16.920
<v Speaker 5>but not enough to do any type of real damage.</v>

2855
01:16:16.921 --> 01:16:18.330
<v Speaker 5>It was just where it was.</v>

2856
01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.790
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't believe I reacted that way.</v>

2857
01:16:20.791 --> 01:16:21.720
<v Speaker 5>Like my system was like,</v>

2858
01:16:21.721 --> 01:16:22.441
<v Speaker 5>you'll get lightheaded,</v>

2859
01:16:22.441 --> 01:16:23.221
<v Speaker 5>tingly feeling.</v>

2860
01:16:23.221 --> 01:16:23.700
<v Speaker 5>You get like,</v>

2861
01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:24.181
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to vomit,</v>

2862
01:16:24.181 --> 01:16:25.014
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to vomit.</v>

2863
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.651
<v Speaker 5>And then I was like,</v>

2864
01:16:25.651 --> 01:16:26.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to pass out.</v>

2865
01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.360
<v Speaker 5>I had to go to the bathroom,</v>

2866
01:16:27.361 --> 01:16:28.410
<v Speaker 5>put water on my face,</v>

2867
01:16:28.411 --> 01:16:30.510
<v Speaker 5>like a fucking like an old lady.</v>

2868
01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:31.231
<v Speaker 5>But that's a,</v>

2869
01:16:31.231 --> 01:16:32.940
<v Speaker 5>that's a really painful technique.</v>

2870
01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:33.803
<v Speaker 5>This is certainly is.</v>

2871
01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:34.380
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>

2872
01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.360
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird thing because those guys,</v>

2873
01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.050
<v Speaker 5>they're so used to fighting off of pain and dealing with the pain and the</v>

2874
01:16:40.051 --> 01:16:43.710
<v Speaker 5>adrenaline of the fight that a lot of people underestimate the impact of leg</v>

2875
01:16:43.711 --> 01:16:44.280
<v Speaker 5>kicks.</v>

2876
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:44.660
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

2877
01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:45.451
<v Speaker 5>I've learned like,</v>

2878
01:16:45.451 --> 01:16:45.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2879
01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.470
<v Speaker 5>everyone knows you have,</v>

2880
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:48.330
<v Speaker 5>see hearts in mixed martial arts is painful,</v>

2881
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:49.830
<v Speaker 5>but after doing that I've been like,</v>

2882
01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:52.340
<v Speaker 5>it makes you watch the sport differently.</v>

2883
01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:53.040
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2884
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:53.701
<v Speaker 5>like to watch,</v>

2885
01:16:53.701 --> 01:16:54.301
<v Speaker 5>like I'll watch it.</v>

2886
01:16:54.301 --> 01:16:54.510
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2887
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:56.700
<v Speaker 5>my favorite fighters are those fucking Brazilian,</v>

2888
01:16:56.701 --> 01:16:58.230
<v Speaker 5>like you know those leg kickers,</v>

2889
01:16:58.231 --> 01:16:58.421
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2890
01:16:58.421 --> 01:17:01.950
<v Speaker 5>I know it's fucking Josie aldose or by both of those guys that are like,</v>

2891
01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:03.370
<v Speaker 5>we like flaps.</v>

2892
01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:03.810
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2893
01:17:03.810 --> 01:17:05.610
<v Speaker 5>Because after experiencing that,</v>

2894
01:17:05.611 --> 01:17:09.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm like the fact that guy can stand there and still fight after having his leg</v>

2895
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

2896
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.070
<v Speaker 3>it never ceases to amaze me that they don't immediately collapsed and just go</v>

2897
01:17:13.071 --> 01:17:13.430
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

2898
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.641
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2899
01:17:13.641 --> 01:17:16.460
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel it as much because of the adrenaline of the fight,</v>

2900
01:17:16.461 --> 01:17:19.100
<v Speaker 3>but it is unbelievably painful even with the adrenaline.</v>

2901
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.240
<v Speaker 3>And then after it's over.</v>

2902
01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Like did you have ever received a Uriah where his whole leg after he fought Aldo</v>

2903
01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.170
<v Speaker 3>was swollen to twice the size of his other leg.</v>

2904
01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.110
<v Speaker 3>He took all these photos of it and posted them on Twitter.</v>

2905
01:17:30.111 --> 01:17:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Like as it was healing,</v>

2906
01:17:31.401 --> 01:17:34.010
<v Speaker 3>it was just a giant purple sausage.</v>

2907
01:17:34.011 --> 01:17:35.000
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>

2908
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.550
<v Speaker 3>Or you see the leg kicks that knocked the guy's leg back.</v>

2909
01:17:37.551 --> 01:17:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Like when the guy standing on that leg kick.</v>

2910
01:17:38.961 --> 01:17:39.590
<v Speaker 3>That's sweet.</v>

2911
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Like if you kick a guy's leg hard enough to sweep it back where he's almost off</v>

2912
01:17:42.531 --> 01:17:42.891
<v Speaker 3>balance.</v>

2913
01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Like man,</v>

2914
01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.940
<v Speaker 3>that's a really hard how chihuahua kick and when still the kicked me,</v>

2915
01:17:46.941 --> 01:17:50.270
<v Speaker 3>I kept trying to get in to kick a little harder because he was going so gently.</v>

2916
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:51.080
<v Speaker 3>He's a nice guy.</v>

2917
01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.390
<v Speaker 3>He's a very nice and okay.</v>

2918
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2919
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:55.370
<v Speaker 3>he's such a meek like pleasant fellow a and then he just,</v>

2920
01:17:55.380 --> 01:18:00.350
<v Speaker 3>he kicked me slightly harder and it just jarred my head when he kicked me in the</v>

2921
01:18:00.351 --> 01:18:04.490
<v Speaker 3>arm and I had a headache for two hours because of my head jarred and I wasn't</v>

2922
01:18:04.491 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 3>ready for,</v>

2923
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:05.390
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2924
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2925
01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:06.501
<v Speaker 3>Well that's you know,</v>

2926
01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:08.930
<v Speaker 3>one of the places where concussions take place,</v>

2927
01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.630
<v Speaker 3>like everyone thinks a concussion is when you get hit in the head,</v>

2928
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:14.900
<v Speaker 3>but there's doctors explained it to me that a concussion is anything that</v>

2929
01:18:14.901 --> 01:18:16.250
<v Speaker 3>happens from your chest up.</v>

2930
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Like you can get like hit really hard in a football match.</v>

2931
01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:23.990
<v Speaker 3>You can get hit really hard like in the chest and the game and you get a</v>

2932
01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:28.991
<v Speaker 3>concussion because the impact that makes your head around your brain sloshes</v>

2933
01:18:29.181 --> 01:18:32.300
<v Speaker 3>around inside your skull and you get a concussion from that so you don't even</v>

2934
01:18:32.301 --> 01:18:33.530
<v Speaker 3>have to get hit in the head.</v>

2935
01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:34.543
<v Speaker 3>They get a concussion.</v>

2936
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:34.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2937
01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:35.410
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2938
01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 3>it's every one of those moves hurt a lot.</v>

2939
01:18:38.451 --> 01:18:41.580
<v Speaker 3>And when you feel the grip that a guy like that puts on you like again like a</v>

2940
01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.950
<v Speaker 3>cane is a fucking monster,</v>

2941
01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:45.220
<v Speaker 3>but any anyone who puts a grip on you and it's like it,</v>

2942
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:49.310
<v Speaker 3>it is simply an unbreakable situation.</v>

2943
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:54.311
<v Speaker 3>I'm in like I am only alive and not fucked in the ass because he's choosing not</v>

2944
01:18:54.321 --> 01:18:55.280
<v Speaker 3>to do those things.</v>

2945
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:57.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a really weird feeling to be.</v>

2946
01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 3>It makes you like maybe the older you get,</v>

2947
01:19:00.771 --> 01:19:01.640
<v Speaker 3>the more aware you are,</v>

2948
01:19:01.641 --> 01:19:02.990
<v Speaker 3>the bad shit can happen.</v>

2949
01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.330
<v Speaker 3>But it makes you very cautious in life.</v>

2950
01:19:05.331 --> 01:19:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Like these are the guys that are walking around and like you try not to start</v>

2951
01:19:09.201 --> 01:19:12.620
<v Speaker 3>confrontations with people for no reason cause you don't know who has a pistol.</v>

2952
01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:13.521
<v Speaker 3>That woman who was assaulted,</v>

2953
01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Anthony had no idea that he's a guy with a gun and lucky for her,</v>

2954
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.340
<v Speaker 3>he's not a maniac with a gun.</v>

2955
01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:20.750
<v Speaker 3>She had talk her on Twitter.</v>

2956
01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:24.470
<v Speaker 3>What if he just got a really good leg kick that when you decided I'm not going</v>

2957
01:19:24.471 --> 01:19:26.060
<v Speaker 3>to punch abroad but while whack.</v>

2958
01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:26.953
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2959
01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:28.311
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>

2960
01:19:28.311 --> 01:19:30.710
<v Speaker 3>but then they would have said he struck a woman and then he would have been even</v>

2961
01:19:30.711 --> 01:19:32.570
<v Speaker 3>probably more fuck cause they're an illegal proceedings.</v>

2962
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:33.231
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2963
01:19:33.231 --> 01:19:37.070
<v Speaker 3>she would have said that this just showed the gun very illegal.</v>

2964
01:19:37.071 --> 01:19:37.851
<v Speaker 3>Very illegal.</v>

2965
01:19:37.851 --> 01:19:38.660
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2966
01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2967
01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you look like fucking,</v>

2968
01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:41.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2969
01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.050
<v Speaker 3>You can't just show it.</v>

2970
01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:42.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2971
01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.250
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to do that.</v>

2972
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:43.600
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2973
01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.200
<v Speaker 3>it looks like chef from apocalypse now.</v>

2974
01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wanted him to be flashing at.</v>

2975
01:19:46.431 --> 01:19:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Joey Cola told me that he was working at pips and in Brooklyn and some guy in</v>

2976
01:19:50.751 --> 01:19:53.360
<v Speaker 3>the front row was heckling him and showing him his gun.</v>

2977
01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.980
<v Speaker 3>He's so fucking busy.</v>

2978
01:19:55.050 --> 01:19:56.660
<v Speaker 3>She fucking piece of shit.</v>

2979
01:19:56.661 --> 01:19:59.120
<v Speaker 3>You fucking terrible saying all this crazy shit to him.</v>

2980
01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.440
<v Speaker 3>And he goes and I'm upset.</v>

2981
01:20:00.441 --> 01:20:01.340
<v Speaker 3>I just gotta keep going.</v>

2982
01:20:01.341 --> 01:20:02.174
<v Speaker 3>My jokes,</v>

2983
01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm update telling my jokes,</v>

2984
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2985
01:20:03.831 --> 01:20:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Joey Cola,</v>

2986
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.710
<v Speaker 3>nicest guy in the world and he's,</v>

2987
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 3>he's onstage and</v>

2988
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.540
<v Speaker 5>this guy keeps brandishing.</v>

2989
01:20:09.541 --> 01:20:12.120
<v Speaker 5>It got his pips even around anymore for signing around anymore.</v>

2990
01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.160
<v Speaker 5>I just talked to a guy the other night,</v>

2991
01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:14.290
<v Speaker 5>he used to own pibs I forget.</v>

2992
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.491
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2993
01:20:14.491 --> 01:20:14.591
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2994
01:20:14.591 --> 01:20:15.630
<v Speaker 5>we always trying to get you in there.</v>

2995
01:20:15.631 --> 01:20:15.751
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2996
01:20:15.751 --> 01:20:17.130
<v Speaker 5>I did it when the Shults has had it.</v>

2997
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:18.660
<v Speaker 5>And then I think Ray Garvey,</v>

2998
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:20.040
<v Speaker 5>we took over and read ray died.</v>

2999
01:20:20.041 --> 01:20:21.180
<v Speaker 5>He had stomach cancer.</v>

3000
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.290
<v Speaker 5>Did you know ray or no,</v>

3001
01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:23.213
<v Speaker 5>I never worked there.</v>

3002
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:24.510
<v Speaker 5>I did a few spots there.</v>

3003
01:20:24.511 --> 01:20:25.350
<v Speaker 5>I never worked there either.</v>

3004
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.830
<v Speaker 5>I probably went there with auto one time and you know,</v>

3005
01:20:27.831 --> 01:20:30.750
<v Speaker 5>or would it be because dice was already long gone dice used to do that place.</v>

3006
01:20:30.751 --> 01:20:32.220
<v Speaker 5>A lot of ways from Dangerfield,</v>

3007
01:20:32.221 --> 01:20:33.120
<v Speaker 5>all those guys from pips.</v>

3008
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:33.900
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

3009
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.010
<v Speaker 5>George Schultz had it.</v>

3010
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:36.420
<v Speaker 5>Seth Schultz,</v>

3011
01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:37.283
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3012
01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:38.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3013
01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.490
<v Speaker 5>I know when Marty and,</v>

3014
01:20:39.491 --> 01:20:39.591
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3015
01:20:39.591 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 5>I think Marnie and Seth had it when I did it.</v>

3016
01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.540
<v Speaker 5>Dangerfield still around.</v>

3017
01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.950
<v Speaker 5>It is still going strong.</v>

3018
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:45.450
<v Speaker 5>I haven't done it in a long time.</v>

3019
01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:46.471
<v Speaker 5>I used to do that,</v>

3020
01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:48.180
<v Speaker 5>that that was one of the ones that helped me work on my,</v>

3021
01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.170
<v Speaker 5>my shit because you got 25 minutes to go up and I would put some notes on the</v>

3022
01:20:52.171 --> 01:20:52.980
<v Speaker 5>piano.</v>

3023
01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.150
<v Speaker 5>There's that black piano,</v>

3024
01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:54.720
<v Speaker 5>it's a block.</v>

3025
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.230
<v Speaker 5>It reminds me of the comedy store and you'd go up and there's a history there</v>

3026
01:20:58.231 --> 01:20:59.130
<v Speaker 5>and just do your shit.</v>

3027
01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:00.430
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

3028
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:02.790
<v Speaker 5>I worked out a lot of fucking material.</v>

3029
01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:05.940
<v Speaker 5>I paid my rent when I lived with Jim Florentine in North Jersey.</v>

3030
01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:08.520
<v Speaker 5>I would do seven spots on a Saturday,</v>

3031
01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.380
<v Speaker 5>a Saturday and six on a Friday.</v>

3032
01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:11.610
<v Speaker 5>And I would do Dangerfield,</v>

3033
01:21:11.611 --> 01:21:12.460
<v Speaker 5>seller Dangerfield,</v>

3034
01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.420
<v Speaker 5>seller from fucking first avenue and 60th to western and Mcdougal.</v>

3035
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:17.130
<v Speaker 5>And I drove out of the park,</v>

3036
01:21:17.131 --> 01:21:18.870
<v Speaker 5>my stupid fucking Saturn.</v>

3037
01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:19.531
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3038
01:21:19.531 --> 01:21:19.771
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3039
01:21:19.771 --> 01:21:20.940
<v Speaker 5>you knew where to park and you know,</v>

3040
01:21:20.941 --> 01:21:22.650
<v Speaker 5>it was a whole system I got into,</v>

3041
01:21:22.651 --> 01:21:25.200
<v Speaker 5>but danger fields really helped me develop as a comic.</v>

3042
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:26.610
<v Speaker 5>Did she ever do the Prom shows there?</v>

3043
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:27.121
<v Speaker 5>Yes I did.</v>

3044
01:21:27.121 --> 01:21:27.954
<v Speaker 5>They're horrible.</v>

3045
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.310
<v Speaker 5>But you were making 75 is set.</v>

3046
01:21:29.311 --> 01:21:29.630
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3047
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:30.463
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3048
01:21:30.490 --> 01:21:31.650
<v Speaker 5>And you did a lot of sets.</v>

3049
01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:32.431
<v Speaker 5>How many cents?</v>

3050
01:21:32.431 --> 01:21:33.264
<v Speaker 5>What we do at night.</v>

3051
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:34.530
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you do,</v>

3052
01:21:34.531 --> 01:21:36.450
<v Speaker 5>it depends on how many fucking awful,</v>

3053
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3054
01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:37.830
<v Speaker 5>teenagers were coming in.</v>

3055
01:21:37.831 --> 01:21:39.870
<v Speaker 5>But sometimes it'd be three or four a night.</v>

3056
01:21:39.871 --> 01:21:43.710
<v Speaker 5>You can make an extra 300 bucks or sometimes just one way.</v>

3057
01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:45.960
<v Speaker 5>One of the most painful promise shows ever is,</v>

3058
01:21:45.961 --> 01:21:50.760
<v Speaker 5>I did Caroline's years ago and I did a pro set and Willie Tyler and Leicester</v>

3059
01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:52.770
<v Speaker 5>were on the show and you know,</v>

3060
01:21:52.771 --> 01:21:53.491
<v Speaker 5>I knew them from,</v>

3061
01:21:53.491 --> 01:21:53.761

<v Speaker 5>solid goals to shows it very nice guy.</v>

3063
01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:56.460
<v Speaker 5>I had a,</v>

3064
01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.960
<v Speaker 5>one of the best ventriloquists ever and he's on stage and it was just not for</v>

3065
01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:01.860
<v Speaker 5>the kids and material,</v>

3066
01:22:01.861 --> 01:22:02.041
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3067
01:22:02.041 --> 01:22:03.110
<v Speaker 5>it was a little like he's,</v>

3068
01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:07.740
<v Speaker 5>and he's doing some song and I believe I can fly and on the fucking puppet sing</v>

3069
01:22:07.741 --> 01:22:10.380
<v Speaker 5>and it's a fun song and these kids from the Bronx,</v>

3070
01:22:10.381 --> 01:22:12.180
<v Speaker 5>we're just not enjoying it.</v>

3071
01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:14.670
<v Speaker 5>It was ugly fly home motherfucker,</v>

3072
01:22:14.671 --> 01:22:15.350
<v Speaker 5>you suck.</v>

3073
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.691
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3074
01:22:15.691 --> 01:22:17.250
<v Speaker 5>it was horrible.</v>

3075
01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:22.460
<v Speaker 5>I've net and he smiled and kept it professional and didn't acknowledge any of</v>

3076
01:22:22.861 --> 01:22:22.960
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3077
01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.870
<v Speaker 5>He that talked about take your money and get out.</v>

3078
01:22:24.871 --> 01:22:25.470
<v Speaker 5>That's what he did.</v>

3079
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember Al Lubell?</v>

3080
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:26.941
<v Speaker 5>Sure I do.</v>

3081
01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:27.600
<v Speaker 5>I live well.</v>

3082
01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.050
<v Speaker 5>I live well.</v>

3083
01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:29.100
<v Speaker 5>I need a giant cock.</v>

3084
01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:30.180
<v Speaker 5>That's what I remember about Al Labelle.</v>

3085
01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.350
<v Speaker 5>I've heard he had a big cock.</v>

3086
01:22:31.351 --> 01:22:31.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3087
01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:32.940
<v Speaker 5>Al Lubell was on stage.</v>

3088
01:22:32.941 --> 01:22:33.810
<v Speaker 5>We're doing prom shows,</v>

3089
01:22:33.811 --> 01:22:37.110
<v Speaker 5>a danger fields and a kid got onstage is big football player.</v>

3090
01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:39.360
<v Speaker 5>Kid came onstage,</v>

3091
01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.850
<v Speaker 5>took the microphone from Bell and Blue Cigar,</v>

3092
01:22:41.851 --> 01:22:42.870
<v Speaker 5>smoke in his face,</v>

3093
01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.600
<v Speaker 5>had a cigar and he was standing on on stage and all his friends were cheering</v>

3094
01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:48.030
<v Speaker 5>and no one did anything about it.</v>

3095
01:22:48.031 --> 01:22:48.451
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3096
01:22:48.451 --> 01:22:49.290
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

3097
01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.340
<v Speaker 5>that's why I stopped working there.</v>

3098
01:22:50.610 --> 01:22:51.900
<v Speaker 5>Not because it didn't happen to me,</v>

3099
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:52.890
<v Speaker 5>but they wouldn't.</v>

3100
01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:54.000
<v Speaker 5>I didn't feel they took,</v>

3101
01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:57.090
<v Speaker 5>they didn't protect the comics enough from hecklers.</v>

3102
01:22:57.091 --> 01:22:58.020
<v Speaker 5>Like they would never call,</v>

3103
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:59.670
<v Speaker 5>throw people out and that's why I stopped working there.</v>

3104
01:22:59.700 --> 01:22:59.791
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3105
01:22:59.791 --> 01:23:01.590
<v Speaker 5>it's very much like the comedy store in that way.</v>

3106
01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:05.070
<v Speaker 5>Both old sort of dark places in both with no crowd control.</v>

3107
01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 5>They had</v>

3108
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:06.821
<v Speaker 1>one guy.</v>

3109
01:23:06.821 --> 01:23:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember Bobby all?</v>

3110
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I met Bobby one time.</v>

3111
01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Bobby would take care of shit.</v>

3112
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I worked with Bobby a lot.</v>

3113
01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.620
<v Speaker 1>He was a Scottish guy who was about five foot eight wide and five foot eight</v>

3114
01:23:17.621 --> 01:23:18.280
<v Speaker 1>tall.</v>

3115
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.050
<v Speaker 1>He was a fucking tank,</v>

3116
01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:20.411
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

3117
01:23:20.411 --> 01:23:21.050
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't fat.</v>

3118
01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3119
01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:21.431
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

3120
01:23:21.431 --> 01:23:21.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3121
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:22.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3122
01:23:22.041 --> 01:23:22.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3123
01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:23.920
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't the skinniest guy in the world,</v>

3124
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:28.921
<v Speaker 1>but he was a power lifter and he was strong as fuck and something happened.</v>

3125
01:23:29.141 --> 01:23:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what it was,</v>

3126
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:33.130
<v Speaker 1>but I saw him pick a guy up by his neck.</v>

3127
01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:37.510
<v Speaker 1>He literally grabbed this guy by the back of his neck and picked him up like a</v>

3128
01:23:37.511 --> 01:23:38.344
<v Speaker 1>kitten.</v>

3129
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Like he had his hand on this guy's neck,</v>

3130
01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.920
<v Speaker 1>hoisted him up out of his chair,</v>

3131
01:23:41.921 --> 01:23:44.140
<v Speaker 1>grabbed his belt and just carried them out.</v>

3132
01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.940
<v Speaker 1>And the guy just went limp,</v>

3133
01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:48.010
<v Speaker 1>like feeling how strong Bobby was.</v>

3134
01:23:48.011 --> 01:23:48.491
<v Speaker 1>He's just like,</v>

3135
01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:49.480
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

3136
01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.810
<v Speaker 1>He just completely went limp and Bobby carried him outside and tossed them.</v>

3137
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:53.231
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3138
01:23:53.231 --> 01:23:54.220
<v Speaker 5>he's a legendary guy.</v>

3139
01:23:54.221 --> 01:23:54.770
<v Speaker 5>Bobby.</v>

3140
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:55.600
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3141
01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:56.500
<v Speaker 5>everyone loved him.</v>

3142
01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.520
<v Speaker 5>Whatever happened to that guy.</v>

3143
01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:58.280
<v Speaker 5>He died.</v>

3144
01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:58.910
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3145
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:59.711
<v Speaker 5>he's got a long time ago.</v>

3146
01:23:59.711 --> 01:23:59.831
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3147
01:23:59.831 --> 01:24:00.664
<v Speaker 5>he died many years ago,</v>

3148
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:01.370
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

3149
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:02.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

3150
01:24:02.861 --> 01:24:03.550
<v Speaker 5>actually.</v>

3151
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:04.061
<v Speaker 5>He was out.</v>

3152
01:24:04.061 --> 01:24:05.980
<v Speaker 5>I think Tony's son Tony,</v>

3153
01:24:05.981 --> 01:24:07.030
<v Speaker 5>who ran it with Rodney,</v>

3154
01:24:07.031 --> 01:24:09.940
<v Speaker 5>his son took over for a while and I haven't seen his son down in many years</v>

3155
01:24:09.941 --> 01:24:10.151
<v Speaker 5>either,</v>

3156
01:24:10.151 --> 01:24:10.721
<v Speaker 5>but he was the guy.</v>

3157
01:24:10.721 --> 01:24:11.800
<v Speaker 5>I kind of got to know you.</v>

3158
01:24:11.801 --> 01:24:13.740
<v Speaker 5>I knew Darren was Darren and Bobby.</v>

3159
01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.790
<v Speaker 5>I only met once when I went in there with somebody.</v>

3160
01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:16.001
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3161
01:24:16.001 --> 01:24:17.180
<v Speaker 5>that sucks that that guy died.</v>

3162
01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:17.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3163
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.861
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3164
01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:18.311
<v Speaker 5>I heard that.</v>

3165
01:24:18.311 --> 01:24:20.110
<v Speaker 5>I never got to know him and I kind of wish I did.</v>

3166
01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:20.680
<v Speaker 5>He was such</v>

3167
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:21.760
<v Speaker 1>vibrant character.</v>

3168
01:24:21.761 --> 01:24:22.810
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he died.</v>

3169
01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:23.021
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3170
01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I know him and the kid,</v>

3171
01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:25.660
<v Speaker 1>him and Darren had a falling out.</v>

3172
01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:25.920
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3173
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.271
<v Speaker 5>The kid,</v>

3174
01:24:26.271 --> 01:24:26.430
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3175
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:27.061
<v Speaker 5>That was what he called it,</v>

3176
01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:27.260
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3177
01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:27.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3178
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:28.673
<v Speaker 5>The Kid,</v>

3179
01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:30.030
<v Speaker 5>the bug of Shite.</v>

3180
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:31.441
<v Speaker 5>Everything was up.</v>

3181
01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:32.000
<v Speaker 5>I got shaken.</v>

3182
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:32.221
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

3183
01:24:32.221 --> 01:24:32.821
<v Speaker 5>Talent back.</v>

3184
01:24:32.821 --> 01:24:35.040
<v Speaker 5>I shake it up there that you're tricked them again.</v>

3185
01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:35.800
<v Speaker 5>The Rogan,</v>

3186
01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:36.900
<v Speaker 5>like every time we go home,</v>

3187
01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:38.160
<v Speaker 5>if I had a good laughs,</v>

3188
01:24:38.190 --> 01:24:38.611
<v Speaker 5>he would say,</v>

3189
01:24:38.611 --> 01:24:38.791
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3190
01:24:38.791 --> 01:24:39.624
<v Speaker 5>you tricked them again.</v>

3191
01:24:39.710 --> 01:24:42.710
<v Speaker 5>Good comedians say there's funnier than any of the comics too.</v>

3192
01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.580
<v Speaker 1>It's very funny.</v>

3193
01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:44.151
<v Speaker 1>He was very,</v>

3194
01:24:44.151 --> 01:24:44.691
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>

3195
01:24:44.691 --> 01:24:45.770
<v Speaker 1>He was a hilarious guy.</v>

3196
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed that guy very much.</v>

3197
01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:49.340
<v Speaker 1>I would go there and looking forward to seeing them.</v>

3198
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm bummed that I never got to work.</v>

3199
01:24:51.651 --> 01:24:53.750
<v Speaker 1>The old catch either with Louis friend who was there.</v>

3200
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I went in there a couple of times.</v>

3201
01:24:55.131 --> 01:24:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I might have done one set there,</v>

3202
01:24:56.301 --> 01:24:57.140
<v Speaker 1>but I never worked there.</v>

3203
01:24:57.141 --> 01:24:58.370
<v Speaker 1>The catch on Second Avenue,</v>

3204
01:24:58.730 --> 01:25:00.260
<v Speaker 1>this is my first set I ever did in New York.</v>

3205
01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:01.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3206
01:25:01.191 --> 01:25:01.491
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

3207
01:25:01.491 --> 01:25:03.200
<v Speaker 1>When I was auditioning for Sossman,</v>

3208
01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I did some sets in Boston.</v>

3209
01:25:04.801 --> 01:25:05.301
<v Speaker 1>Then he outed me,</v>

3210
01:25:05.301 --> 01:25:08.270
<v Speaker 1>come out to New York and audition out there in the first set I ever did in New</v>

3211
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.271
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

3212
01:25:08.271 --> 01:25:13.271
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking terrified out of my mind was that catch I w I got there early.</v>

3213
01:25:13.371 --> 01:25:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I drove down from Boston,</v>

3214
01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:17.210
<v Speaker 1>wandered around the neighborhood shitting my pants,</v>

3215
01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.073
<v Speaker 1>terrified.</v>

3216
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.681
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3217
01:25:18.681 --> 01:25:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I always had this thing in my head about doing standup in New York for whatever</v>

3218
01:25:22.521 --> 01:25:23.180
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

3219
01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I just thought that New York was harder.</v>

3220
01:25:24.831 --> 01:25:26.030
<v Speaker 1>The people were smarter.</v>

3221
01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:26.961
<v Speaker 1>When I got on stage,</v>

3222
01:25:26.961 --> 01:25:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I realized they were just people you know,</v>

3223
01:25:28.730 --> 01:25:29.260
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

3224
01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.680
<v Speaker 1>but up until that moment,</v>

3225
01:25:30.681 --> 01:25:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3226
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:32.660
<v Speaker 1>they're living in the city.</v>

3227
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:34.700
<v Speaker 1>These are people that live in this city.</v>

3228
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:35.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3229
01:25:35.221 --> 01:25:37.550
<v Speaker 1>in New York City it has this air about it.</v>

3230
01:25:37.551 --> 01:25:38.990
<v Speaker 1>This is very intimidating air</v>

3231
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:40.011
<v Speaker 5>because you know,</v>

3232
01:25:40.011 --> 01:25:40.820
<v Speaker 5>comedians,</v>

3233
01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.590
<v Speaker 5>they think like while New York's a big city,</v>

3234
01:25:42.591 --> 01:25:46.600
<v Speaker 5>if you worked at your s there's this illusion or this diluted nature,</v>

3235
01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:47.211
<v Speaker 5>you'll have the people,</v>

3236
01:25:47.211 --> 01:25:48.500
<v Speaker 5>the communities in New York are smarter.</v>

3237
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:49.551
<v Speaker 5>Some of them are like,</v>

3238
01:25:49.551 --> 01:25:49.701
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3239
01:25:49.701 --> 01:25:50.421
<v Speaker 5>you get a talent,</v>

3240
01:25:50.421 --> 01:25:52.370
<v Speaker 5>Collin who are geniuses and they get,</v>

3241
01:25:52.371 --> 01:25:54.500
<v Speaker 5>but you have plenty of Shitty Haqqanis,</v>

3242
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:56.450
<v Speaker 5>plenty of dumb audiences.</v>

3243
01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:57.530
<v Speaker 5>Plenty of fucking,</v>

3244
01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:01.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean the comedy cellar is my home and it's my favorite place in the world and</v>

3245
01:26:01.491 --> 01:26:02.840
<v Speaker 5>you'll still have a bachelorette party.</v>

3246
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 5>I was on stage</v>

3247
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:05.390
<v Speaker 3>maybe a few months ago,</v>

3248
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.160
<v Speaker 3>killing on a Saturday.</v>

3249
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Like really one of those sets that you just fucking hammering and right before I</v>

3250
01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:16.160
<v Speaker 3>get off these fucking middle age bachelorettes one of them go say something</v>

3251
01:26:16.161 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>

3252
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.940
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter where you are.</v>

3253
01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.980
<v Speaker 3>No matter how good your show is,</v>

3254
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.550
<v Speaker 3>you know there's always that element.</v>

3255
01:26:25.551 --> 01:26:26.450
<v Speaker 3>Thank God I was killing.</v>

3256
01:26:26.451 --> 01:26:27.620
<v Speaker 3>I really brutalized her.</v>

3257
01:26:27.621 --> 01:26:29.870
<v Speaker 3>It was all I couldn't,</v>

3258
01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't have said cunt faster.</v>

3259
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.290
<v Speaker 3>If I had been,</v>

3260
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:37.100
<v Speaker 3>if I had been programmed to say at that moment it flew out so naturally and</v>

3261
01:26:37.101 --> 01:26:37.934
<v Speaker 3>beautifully,</v>

3262
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:41.240
<v Speaker 3>which during a bad set is a bad thing because then the crowd totally agrees with</v>

3263
01:26:41.241 --> 01:26:42.074
<v Speaker 3>the person.</v>

3264
01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:43.190
<v Speaker 3>But in that moment that you know,</v>

3265
01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:46.100
<v Speaker 3>is there anything better than calling someone a cunt and fucking crowd cheers.</v>

3266
01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:46.851
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3267
01:26:46.851 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 3>The angry Bachelorette party attendance.</v>

3268
01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you record your sets?</v>

3269
01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:51.561
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

3270
01:26:51.561 --> 01:26:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Everyone I videotape on a little,</v>

3271
01:26:53.301 --> 01:26:54.134
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3272
01:26:54.170 --> 01:26:55.310
<v Speaker 3>on a little lot of Gopro.</v>

3273
01:26:55.530 --> 01:26:56.960
<v Speaker 3>You videotape them all?</v>

3274
01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:57.231
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3275
01:26:57.231 --> 01:26:57.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3276
01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Just because I'm more creative when I do that.</v>

3277
01:26:59.721 --> 01:27:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know like if I want to Improv on something I will because I'm taping it</v>

3278
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:04.160
<v Speaker 3>so I know I'll have it.</v>

3279
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:06.410
<v Speaker 3>I record everything.</v>

3280
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.130
<v Speaker 3>Audio,</v>

3281
01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:08.360
<v Speaker 3>I just use my iPhone,</v>

3282
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:09.130
<v Speaker 3>I put it on.</v>

3283
01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3284
01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:10.331
<v Speaker 3>sure I have all.</v>

3285
01:27:10.331 --> 01:27:12.890
<v Speaker 3>But it is good to see yourself too and well,</v>

3286
01:27:12.891 --> 01:27:14.390
<v Speaker 3>it's also easier to go forward.</v>

3287
01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.850
<v Speaker 3>I could zip through it a little bit easier and uh,</v>

3288
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:17.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3289
01:27:17.211 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 3>we're stuffy or they know where stuff is and my iPhone,</v>

3290
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:20.630
<v Speaker 3>like I don't trust that being out.</v>

3291
01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:24.410
<v Speaker 3>That's got to stay in the pocket because it's just too much shit on there that</v>

3292
01:27:24.411 --> 01:27:28.730
<v Speaker 3>it cannot be lost too many and explicable photos.</v>

3293
01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:31.190
<v Speaker 3>But the NSA has your photos.</v>

3294
01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:32.060
<v Speaker 3>Let them have them.</v>

3295
01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Then they're not buying tickets to see me.</v>

3296
01:27:34.710 --> 01:27:37.760
<v Speaker 3>You've seen that fucking new revelation that came out today that Edward Snowden</v>

3297
01:27:37.761 --> 01:27:38.990
<v Speaker 3>was saying that they were passing,</v>

3298
01:27:38.991 --> 01:27:42.800
<v Speaker 3>the NSA guys were passing back and forth naked photographs.</v>

3299
01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:44.750
<v Speaker 3>I heard it got through searches.</v>

3300
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:48.040
<v Speaker 3>They would also do searches on their girlfriends and,</v>

3301
01:27:48.041 --> 01:27:48.530
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3302
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3303
01:27:48.801 --> 01:27:49.730
<v Speaker 3>cause they had access.</v>

3304
01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3305
01:27:50.290 --> 01:27:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3306
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:54.380
<v Speaker 3>So they'd find compromising photos and they would share them with each other.</v>

3307
01:27:54.381 --> 01:27:55.640
<v Speaker 3>They would send them like send this one.</v>

3308
01:27:55.641 --> 01:27:57.910
<v Speaker 3>The Tom and Tom would send that one to Billy liquid.</v>

3309
01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Bobby found,</v>

3310
01:27:58.730 --> 01:27:59.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3311
01:27:59.270 --> 01:28:00.830
<v Speaker 3>and these people that they were investigating,</v>

3312
01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:01.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3313
01:28:01.191 --> 01:28:02.420
<v Speaker 3>naked terrorist shots,</v>

3314
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:03.040
<v Speaker 3>some chicken,</v>

3315
01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.340
<v Speaker 3>a burger with a big hairy beaver.</v>

3316
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:05.203
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

3317
01:28:05.370 --> 01:28:06.203
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3318
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.891
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3319
01:28:06.891 --> 01:28:07.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3320
01:28:07.031 --> 01:28:07.401
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>

3321
01:28:07.401 --> 01:28:09.950
<v Speaker 3>my views on the NSA is as bad as they are.</v>

3322
01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:10.910
<v Speaker 3>We at,</v>

3323
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:14.180
<v Speaker 3>that's what we deserve with a nosiest fucking culture.</v>

3324
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:15.940
<v Speaker 3>All we do is,</v>

3325
01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:17.600
<v Speaker 3>is mind everybody's business.</v>

3326
01:28:17.601 --> 01:28:21.050
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing an American loves more than a stick off fucking face in</v>

3327
01:28:21.051 --> 01:28:22.190
<v Speaker 3>somebody's privacy.</v>

3328
01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.120
<v Speaker 3>And it made me so happy when that shit happened because it was like,</v>

3329
01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:26.451
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

3330
01:28:26.451 --> 01:28:27.440
<v Speaker 3>you mother fuckers.</v>

3331
01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Where were you all of these years defending people's right to be assholes in</v>

3332
01:28:31.971 --> 01:28:32.570
<v Speaker 3>private.</v>

3333
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:33.171
<v Speaker 3>We're voyeurs,</v>

3334
01:28:33.171 --> 01:28:33.860
<v Speaker 3>we love it.</v>

3335
01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:34.940
<v Speaker 3>And not when it's turned on us,</v>

3336
01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:35.774
<v Speaker 3>we don't like it.</v>

3337
01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the newest one about the British spies manipulating polls?</v>

3338
01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:40.431
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3339
01:28:40.431 --> 01:28:43.280
<v Speaker 3>Online polls and youtube hits and videos.</v>

3340
01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3341
01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's literally everything that Alex Jones has been saying for years.</v>

3342
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's been calling him crazy.</v>

3343
01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:49.880
<v Speaker 3>He's vindicated.</v>

3344
01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:50.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3345
01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:52.910
<v Speaker 3>he's been saying that the propaganda machine,</v>

3346
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:53.871
<v Speaker 3>but they're really,</v>

3347
01:28:53.871 --> 01:28:54.351
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>

3348
01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:58.700
<v Speaker 3>they're using government propaganda and all sorts of hacking tools.</v>

3349
01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:00.170
<v Speaker 3>It's really a fascinating thing.</v>

3350
01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.160
<v Speaker 3>A collection of hacking,</v>

3351
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 3>some of</v>

3352
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:05.490
<v Speaker 1>which are specifically suited for spreading disinformation were exposed.</v>

3353
01:29:05.491 --> 01:29:10.491
<v Speaker 1>An elite 2012 document provided by stolen to the intercept is the online</v>

3354
01:29:10.621 --> 01:29:13.140
<v Speaker 1>publication led by Greg Glenn Greenwald,</v>

3355
01:29:13.141 --> 01:29:13.921
<v Speaker 1>the journalist's blah,</v>

3356
01:29:13.921 --> 01:29:14.071
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

3357
01:29:14.071 --> 01:29:14.251
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

3358
01:29:14.251 --> 01:29:14.431
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

3359
01:29:14.431 --> 01:29:14.611
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

3360
01:29:14.611 --> 01:29:14.761
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

3361
01:29:14.761 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

3362
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

3363
01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:17.243
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3364
01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:17.731
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3365
01:29:17.731 --> 01:29:18.001
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3366
01:29:18.001 --> 01:29:18.870
<v Speaker 1>underpass,</v>

3367
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.950
<v Speaker 1>a tool that lets government changed the outcome of online polls.</v>

3368
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.140
<v Speaker 1>They can change the outcome of online polls,</v>

3369
01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:26.850
<v Speaker 1>a bomb bay,</v>

3370
01:29:26.851 --> 01:29:31.230
<v Speaker 1>it can increase website hits and rankings so they can increase website hits,</v>

3371
01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:35.960
<v Speaker 1>change online amplifications of given for propaganda APP,</v>

3372
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.980
<v Speaker 1>amplification of a given message.</v>

3373
01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Normally video on a popular multimedia website,</v>

3374
01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:46.140
<v Speaker 1>a gateway which will artificially increased traffic to a website slip stream,</v>

3375
01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:48.990
<v Speaker 1>which will infiltrate page views in a website.</v>

3376
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.240
<v Speaker 1>So what they could do is they could put up a website,</v>

3377
01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:53.250
<v Speaker 1>make that website looks super popular,</v>

3378
01:29:53.370 --> 01:29:54.690
<v Speaker 1>make it look like it's gone viral.</v>

3379
01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:55.631
<v Speaker 5>There's something that,</v>

3380
01:29:55.631 --> 01:29:55.851
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3381
01:29:55.851 --> 01:29:57.220
<v Speaker 5>that Alex has not explained there.</v>

3382
01:29:57.221 --> 01:29:58.150
<v Speaker 5>If that's where that's from.</v>

3383
01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:58.461
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3384
01:29:58.461 --> 01:29:59.090
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

3385
01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:00.640
<v Speaker 5>It's coming from Snowden.</v>

3386
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:01.211
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>

3387
01:30:01.211 --> 01:30:02.680
<v Speaker 5>I did a um,</v>

3388
01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.120
<v Speaker 5>red idea of the night,</v>

3389
01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:04.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3390
01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:06.040
<v Speaker 5>with even having Mike Baker on your podcast.</v>

3391
01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:06.940
<v Speaker 5>He use to be in the CIA.</v>

3392
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:07.360
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3393
01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.193
<v Speaker 5>and now he's not.</v>

3394
01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:11.050
<v Speaker 5>Mike hates snowed cause he was a CIA guy.</v>

3395
01:30:11.410 --> 01:30:14.350
<v Speaker 5>But he's a really interesting that he said something about just in passing,</v>

3396
01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.170
<v Speaker 5>Mike was talking about these websites in boosting the hits up and he goes dead.</v>

3397
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:19.240
<v Speaker 5>People don't understand that.</v>

3398
01:30:19.241 --> 01:30:20.740
<v Speaker 5>We really are still engaged in,</v>

3399
01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:21.060
<v Speaker 5>in it.</v>

3400
01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:21.371
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

3401
01:30:21.371 --> 01:30:23.050
<v Speaker 5>I know it's not popular to say that there's a bad guy,</v>

3402
01:30:23.051 --> 01:30:23.884
<v Speaker 5>but there is.</v>

3403
01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:24.251
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

3404
01:30:24.251 --> 01:30:26.140
<v Speaker 5>then you build these fucking sites and you,</v>

3405
01:30:26.141 --> 01:30:26.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3406
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:28.690
<v Speaker 5>because you billed them cause you want to develop relationships.</v>

3407
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:30.160
<v Speaker 5>And that hadn't occurred to me.</v>

3408
01:30:30.370 --> 01:30:33.310
<v Speaker 5>There's certain sites are made to look more popular that the government is</v>

3409
01:30:33.311 --> 01:30:34.000
<v Speaker 5>running.</v>

3410
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.780
<v Speaker 5>And then the people that come to them who are actually involved in that type of</v>

3411
01:30:37.781 --> 01:30:38.410
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

3412
01:30:38.410 --> 01:30:41.260
<v Speaker 5>you now see who's coming to these sites and then where they're going and you</v>

3413
01:30:41.261 --> 01:30:44.680
<v Speaker 5>develop relationships with these people and you get to know them that way.</v>

3414
01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:48.870
<v Speaker 5>And it's not always just about propaganda and sell.</v>

3415
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.010
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it is stuff that we'll never find out about,</v>

3416
01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:51.701
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

3417
01:30:51.701 --> 01:30:51.870
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3418
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:53.110
<v Speaker 5>he would explain it much better.</v>

3419
01:30:53.111 --> 01:30:57.100
<v Speaker 5>Just in that little moment it made me see something that I hadn't considered.</v>

3420
01:30:57.101 --> 01:30:59.890
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm sure they're doing dirty shit with it too.</v>

3421
01:30:59.891 --> 01:31:01.490
<v Speaker 5>Like those photos and,</v>

3422
01:31:01.491 --> 01:31:02.021
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

3423
01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:03.910
<v Speaker 5>I know the government's propaganda driven,</v>

3424
01:31:03.911 --> 01:31:08.060
<v Speaker 5>but there's also legit uses for it that I think might've been conquered.</v>

3425
01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:09.860
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely legit uses for it.</v>

3426
01:31:09.861 --> 01:31:10.970
<v Speaker 1>But what Snowden's point was,</v>

3427
01:31:10.971 --> 01:31:15.020
<v Speaker 1>whether you're having these 18 to 22 year old kids and you're giving them this</v>

3428
01:31:15.021 --> 01:31:16.790
<v Speaker 1>massive amount of responsibility,</v>

3429
01:31:17.290 --> 01:31:17.540
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3430
01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:20.390
<v Speaker 1>And that it's just not cool and there's very little oversight.</v>

3431
01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:20.781
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3432
01:31:20.781 --> 01:31:22.610
<v Speaker 1>it's very little oversight in these offices.</v>

3433
01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3434
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:24.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3435
01:31:24.081 --> 01:31:24.950
<v Speaker 1>what was Baker's,</v>

3436
01:31:24.951 --> 01:31:25.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3437
01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.080
<v Speaker 1>what was his argument against Snowden?</v>

3438
01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:28.060
<v Speaker 1>What Snowden did?</v>

3439
01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:28.930
<v Speaker 5>I've only seen this,</v>

3440
01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:31.110
<v Speaker 5>he's on red I a lot and a,</v>

3441
01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.510
<v Speaker 5>he hates him because I tell,</v>

3442
01:31:32.530 --> 01:31:35.110
<v Speaker 5>I only sell a little piece of it on the episode we did together.</v>

3443
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.210
<v Speaker 5>But Mike's a really logical,</v>

3444
01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:38.321
<v Speaker 5>you'd love him.</v>

3445
01:31:38.321 --> 01:31:39.550
<v Speaker 5>Like he's a great talker.</v>

3446
01:31:39.551 --> 01:31:40.361
<v Speaker 5>He's funny.</v>

3447
01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:40.721
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3448
01:31:40.721 --> 01:31:41.554
<v Speaker 5>he's not some,</v>

3449
01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:42.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3450
01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:43.151
<v Speaker 5>he's not some,</v>

3451
01:31:43.151 --> 01:31:43.984
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3452
01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:45.600
<v Speaker 5>propaganda spewing asshole.</v>

3453
01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:46.690
<v Speaker 5>He's got his talking points,</v>

3454
01:31:46.691 --> 01:31:47.770
<v Speaker 5>but he's a really smart dude.</v>

3455
01:31:47.771 --> 01:31:48.091
<v Speaker 5>I think you'd,</v>

3456
01:31:48.091 --> 01:31:48.720
<v Speaker 5>you'd love to have it.</v>

3457
01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:49.471
<v Speaker 1>I would love to have him.</v>

3458
01:31:49.471 --> 01:31:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I would love to hear what the argument against Snowden is because in my opinion,</v>

3459
01:31:53.101 --> 01:31:54.420
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing was something,</v>

3460
01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:55.090
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3461
01:31:55.090 --> 01:32:00.090
<v Speaker 1>what he released was information that let the American people know that the</v>

3462
01:32:01.061 --> 01:32:04.540
<v Speaker 1>government was doing something that's unconstitutional and they were doing it</v>

3463
01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.420
<v Speaker 1>and they were doing it like they had the right to do it and they're going to</v>

3464
01:32:07.421 --> 01:32:08.680
<v Speaker 1>continue to have the right to do it.</v>

3465
01:32:08.681 --> 01:32:09.190
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna kill you.</v>

3466
01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:10.090
<v Speaker 1>And if they catch him,</v>

3467
01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:13.450
<v Speaker 1>they gonna lock him in jail for exposing in a way,</v>

3468
01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 1>everything that Obama said when he was running for office,</v>

3469
01:32:16.930 --> 01:32:20.520
<v Speaker 1>he said that they were going to have greater protection of whistle blowers.</v>

3470
01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3471
01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that was showing that they were doing something right,</v>

3472
01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:25.600
<v Speaker 1>that if someone was doing something that was illegal,</v>

3473
01:32:25.601 --> 01:32:26.590
<v Speaker 1>he was going to protect them.</v>

3474
01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:27.101
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

3475
01:32:27.101 --> 01:32:28.030
<v Speaker 1>they had a release,</v>

3476
01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:31.150
<v Speaker 1>they had a delete that off of his website because they kept it up until like a</v>

3477
01:32:31.151 --> 01:32:32.080
<v Speaker 1>year and a half ago.</v>

3478
01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:32.891
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>

3479
01:32:32.891 --> 01:32:33.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3480
01:32:33.071 --> 01:32:36.160
<v Speaker 1>people started pointing it out when all the Snowden shit was going down the hope</v>

3481
01:32:36.161 --> 01:32:38.800
<v Speaker 1>and change website and they finally redacted at all.</v>

3482
01:32:38.801 --> 01:32:39.200
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

3483
01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:39.501
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3484
01:32:39.501 --> 01:32:39.791
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

3485
01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:41.090
<v Speaker 3>it's a very weird cause I get,</v>

3486
01:32:41.091 --> 01:32:41.541
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

3487
01:32:41.541 --> 01:32:42.374
<v Speaker 3>I think that uh,</v>

3488
01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:43.280
<v Speaker 3>what he did in the,</v>

3489
01:32:43.281 --> 01:32:44.540
<v Speaker 3>to a certain degree is really good.</v>

3490
01:32:44.541 --> 01:32:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't want the government having that ability.</v>

3491
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:51.740
<v Speaker 3>My point of view on it as I'm so disgusted with the public and I'm so disgusted</v>

3492
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:55.760
<v Speaker 3>with what voyeurs we are and how we refuse to acknowledge that and how we sit</v>

3493
01:32:55.761 --> 01:32:57.860
<v Speaker 3>there and judge people like Donald Sterling,</v>

3494
01:32:57.890 --> 01:32:59.540
<v Speaker 3>I like the guy's a twat obviously,</v>

3495
01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:04.640
<v Speaker 3>but the way everyone sits there and fucking self righteously judges this guy and</v>

3496
01:33:04.641 --> 01:33:04.940
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

3497
01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:09.710
<v Speaker 3>I love the fact that he's a fucking miserable parrot voiced 81 year old who now</v>

3498
01:33:09.711 --> 01:33:13.290
<v Speaker 3>wants to fucking hire private investigators to go after every NBA owner and</v>

3499
01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:14.293
<v Speaker 3>uncover shit.</v>

3500
01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.051
<v Speaker 3>It's like they,</v>

3501
01:33:15.051 --> 01:33:16.220
<v Speaker 3>none of them stood tall and said,</v>

3502
01:33:16.221 --> 01:33:16.520
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3503
01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.900
<v Speaker 3>this guy is a piece of garbage.</v>

3504
01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:18.733
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>

3505
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:22.550
<v Speaker 3>I've said a lot of ugly things in my private life style and what he said was</v>

3506
01:33:22.551 --> 01:33:25.850
<v Speaker 3>mine or compared to the privacy of his own home,</v>

3507
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:27.560
<v Speaker 3>there was no racial slurs.</v>

3508
01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:28.491
<v Speaker 3>What he said is,</v>

3509
01:33:28.491 --> 01:33:30.110
<v Speaker 3>don't bring these black guys around them.</v>

3510
01:33:30.111 --> 01:33:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Take pictures with them.</v>

3511
01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Molly's trying to fuck this chick,</v>

3512
01:33:32.721 --> 01:33:33.190

3513
01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:33.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:35.780
<v Speaker 3>He's just trying to get past all this and fucker.</v>

3515
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:36.380
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:37.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's his,</v>

3517
01:33:37.041 --> 01:33:37.701
<v Speaker 3>when he said,</v>

3518
01:33:37.701 --> 01:33:38.511
<v Speaker 3>when he was talking about,</v>

3519
01:33:38.511 --> 01:33:38.691
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

3520

<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3521
01:33:38.811 --> 01:33:39.830

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:40.591
<v Speaker 3>I was telling me,</v>

3524
01:33:40.761 --> 01:33:41.750
<v Speaker 3>don't bring these guys around.</v>

3525
01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:42.860
<v Speaker 3>He even said to her,</v>

3526
01:33:42.861 --> 01:33:43.700
<v Speaker 3>if you want to fuck him,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's my favorite person.</v>

3530
01:33:45.471 --> 01:33:46.070
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3531
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.903
<v Speaker 3>Is he a racist?</v>

3532
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Probably Z.</v>

3533
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:50.060
<v Speaker 3>A piece of shit by all accounts.</v>

3534
01:33:50.061 --> 01:33:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

3535
01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:51.530
<v Speaker 3>but so what?</v>

3536
01:33:51.710 --> 01:33:56.600
<v Speaker 3>How do you find a guy two point $5 million for telling his girlfriend not to</v>

3537
01:33:56.601 --> 01:33:58.100
<v Speaker 3>bring black guys around the games.</v>

3538
01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.330
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:03.590
<v Speaker 3>He's not saying you don't associate with those people because they are below</v>

3542
01:34:03.591 --> 01:34:04.130
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

3543
01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:05.810
<v Speaker 3>He's not saying anything crazy and racist.</v>

3544
01:34:05.811 --> 01:34:06.410
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3547
01:34:09.951 --> 01:34:10.550
<v Speaker 3>look bad.</v>

3548
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3549
01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.860
<v Speaker 3>That's the only slowly it's always saying,</v>

3550
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:14.930
<v Speaker 3>and even if he was being a creepy racist,</v>

3551
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:18.320
<v Speaker 3>even if he was the fact that it was in private and bay,</v>

3552
01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:18.951
<v Speaker 3>they got the,</v>

3553
01:34:18.951 --> 01:34:21.980
<v Speaker 3>I think in California there's only two states,</v>

3554
01:34:21.981 --> 01:34:22.680
<v Speaker 3>one party,</v>

3555
01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.750
<v Speaker 3>a notification states.</v>

3556
01:34:23.751 --> 01:34:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking they're into New York is one.</v>

3557
01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3558
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:28.610
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] and I think that uh,</v>

3559
01:34:28.850 --> 01:34:30.860
<v Speaker 3>the fact that was illegally obtained information.</v>

3560
01:34:30.861 --> 01:34:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3561
01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:31.730
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

3562
01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:36.730
<v Speaker 3>I think the guy I told Jabar wrote a fucking genius article on why this guy</v>

3563
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:38.930
<v Speaker 3>should have been God after,</v>

3564
01:34:38.931 --> 01:34:41.580
<v Speaker 3>before for a lot of the housing discrimination and stuff,</v>

3565
01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:42.650
<v Speaker 3>but not for this.</v>

3566
01:34:42.650 --> 01:34:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3567
01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:44.240
<v Speaker 3>And no one gave a fuck when it was that,</v>

3568
01:34:44.241 --> 01:34:45.170
<v Speaker 3>but now that it's language,</v>

3569
01:34:45.171 --> 01:34:45.901
<v Speaker 3>they're going after him.</v>

3570
01:34:45.901 --> 01:34:46.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3571
01:34:46.001 --> 01:34:49.340
<v Speaker 3>And then they're using the housing discrimination stuff to justify their going</v>

3572
01:34:49.341 --> 01:34:50.360
<v Speaker 3>after I'm about this.</v>

3573
01:34:50.361 --> 01:34:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3574
01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:50.811
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3575
01:34:50.811 --> 01:34:51.021
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3576
01:34:51.021 --> 01:34:53.120
<v Speaker 3>the housing discrimination stuff is fucked.</v>

3577
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:54.103
<v Speaker 3>Your right.</v>

3578
01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:55.790
<v Speaker 3>If you want to find them for that,</v>

3579
01:34:55.791 --> 01:34:57.150
<v Speaker 3>then it should be some sort of another,</v>

3580
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>not the</v>

3581
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:58.880
<v Speaker 5>NBA.</v>

3582
01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.770
<v Speaker 5>NBA just reacted again.</v>

3583
01:35:00.771 --> 01:35:01.520
<v Speaker 5>They panicked,</v>

3584
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:05.930
<v Speaker 5>they reacted quickly and not one of these owners has a clean fucking backyard.</v>

3585
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:06.501
<v Speaker 5>None of,</v>

3586
01:35:06.501 --> 01:35:07.850
<v Speaker 5>maybe they haven't said racist stuff,</v>

3587
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:10.760
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of them are probably fucked around on their wives.</v>

3588
01:35:10.761 --> 01:35:12.710
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them have probably said sexist stuff.</v>

3589
01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:15.710
<v Speaker 5>So I love the fact of sterling's going to hire a,</v>

3590
01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:16.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3591
01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:16.570
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3592
01:35:16.570 --> 01:35:20.240
<v Speaker 5>but this is like how dirty it gets when people aren't honest about our own</v>

3593
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:21.100
<v Speaker 5>ugliness.</v>

3594
01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:21.381
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3595
01:35:21.381 --> 01:35:23.810
<v Speaker 5>and that's why when a guy likes Snowden does what he does,</v>

3596
01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:25.640
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

3597
01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:26.420
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

3598
01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:26.700
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3599
01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:27.200
<v Speaker 5>the NSA,</v>

3600
01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:27.981
<v Speaker 5>the NSA.</v>

3601
01:35:27.981 --> 01:35:28.191
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3602
01:35:28.191 --> 01:35:29.024
<v Speaker 5>there's Shitty,</v>

3603
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.530
<v Speaker 5>but fuck the public.</v>

3604
01:35:30.650 --> 01:35:32.540
<v Speaker 5>Because the public didn't stand up in,</v>

3605
01:35:32.541 --> 01:35:32.741
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

3606
01:35:32.741 --> 01:35:32.971
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

3607
01:35:32.971 --> 01:35:36.050
<v Speaker 5>in the fucking defensive privacy when it was Donald Sterling.</v>

3608
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:38.360
<v Speaker 5>We only care about it when it's ourselves.</v>

3609
01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:41.660
<v Speaker 5>And if we were a public that would never have tolerated that from the</v>

3610
01:35:41.661 --> 01:35:42.290
<v Speaker 5>government,</v>

3611
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:43.123
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't do it.</v>

3612
01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:43.461
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3613
01:35:43.461 --> 01:35:43.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3614
01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:44.230
<v Speaker 5>or they would,</v>

3615
01:35:44.230 --> 01:35:47.450
<v Speaker 5>they would do it and be terrified to do it knowing that we were going to revolt,</v>

3616
01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:50.930
<v Speaker 5>but they know that we'll just take it because we're nosy cons and we don't</v>

3617
01:35:50.931 --> 01:35:51.390
<v Speaker 5>really bother.</v>

3618
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:51.890
<v Speaker 5>We liked,</v>

3619
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:54.590
<v Speaker 5>we like invading people's privacy and tiger woods,</v>

3620
01:35:54.591 --> 01:35:55.490
<v Speaker 5>his text messages,</v>

3621
01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:55.851
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3622
01:35:55.851 --> 01:35:56.541
<v Speaker 5>we can't get enough.</v>

3623
01:35:56.541 --> 01:36:00.770
<v Speaker 5>A Mel Gibson's voicemails but fucking scumbags just sitting home wringing our</v>

3624
01:36:00.771 --> 01:36:01.310
<v Speaker 5>hands.</v>

3625
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:02.140
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever heard</v>

3626
01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:05.590
<v Speaker 1>with sociologists say about that when it comes to gossip and things along those</v>

3627
01:36:05.591 --> 01:36:06.340
<v Speaker 1>lines?</v>

3628
01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:07.420
<v Speaker 1>They believe that we,</v>

3629
01:36:07.421 --> 01:36:11.440
<v Speaker 1>we no longer have communities like we used to have when we were tribal</v>

3630
01:36:11.441 --> 01:36:12.251
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

3631
01:36:12.251 --> 01:36:15.400
<v Speaker 1>When were groups of 50 to 150 200 people,</v>

3632
01:36:15.401 --> 01:36:16.300
<v Speaker 1>small groups.</v>

3633
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:19.690
<v Speaker 1>And then we used to know each other's business cause we had to be aware.</v>

3634
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:21.700
<v Speaker 1>We had to know who was a good guy,</v>

3635
01:36:21.701 --> 01:36:22.720
<v Speaker 1>who was a bad guy.</v>

3636
01:36:22.721 --> 01:36:26.590
<v Speaker 1>We had to talk and exchange and we also had to figure out what other people</v>

3637
01:36:26.650 --> 01:36:30.250
<v Speaker 1>liked and tolerated what was accepted on our community.</v>

3638
01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:33.700
<v Speaker 1>And now we don't really have the sort of relationships with our neighbors</v>

3639
01:36:33.701 --> 01:36:34.534
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

3640
01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:36.370
<v Speaker 1>And so celebrity gossip,</v>

3641
01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:36.941
<v Speaker 1>gossip,</v>

3642
01:36:36.941 --> 01:36:37.600
<v Speaker 1>it's in the news.</v>

3643
01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Whenever someone is doing something,</v>

3644
01:36:39.221 --> 01:36:42.370
<v Speaker 1>it becomes extra juicy to us because we don't,</v>

3645
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:46.390
<v Speaker 1>we don't have this normal communication amongst the people that,</v>

3646
01:36:46.391 --> 01:36:46.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3647
01:36:46.721 --> 01:36:47.001
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3648
01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:50.500
<v Speaker 1>we have in our local community that,</v>

3649
01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:50.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3650
01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:51.670
<v Speaker 1>that is true.</v>

3651
01:36:51.670 --> 01:36:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do.</v>

3652
01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you know in your building?</v>

3653
01:36:53.850 --> 01:36:55.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm almost numb.</v>

3654
01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.010
<v Speaker 5>It's funny as we speak,</v>

3655
01:36:56.011 --> 01:36:58.320
<v Speaker 5>Obama's in my building in New York doing a fundraiser.</v>

3656
01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.490
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't leave the building.</v>

3657
01:36:59.520 --> 01:36:59.881
<v Speaker 5>He's in my,</v>

3658
01:36:59.881 --> 01:37:00.611
<v Speaker 5>in my apartment building.</v>

3659
01:37:00.611 --> 01:37:03.810
<v Speaker 5>And you get in there while he's there or is it for some fucking pain that Dick,</v>

3660
01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.441
<v Speaker 5>I probably could,</v>

3661
01:37:04.441 --> 01:37:06.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean he might be gone already.</v>

3662
01:37:06.061 --> 01:37:07.920
<v Speaker 5>He was some Democratic fundraiser,</v>

3663
01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:08.460
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know.</v>

3664
01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:08.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3665
01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:09.630
<v Speaker 5>The point is,</v>

3666
01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:10.021
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3667
01:37:10.021 --> 01:37:10.890
<v Speaker 5>The neighbor he's seeing,</v>

3668
01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:11.970
<v Speaker 5>he's probably seeing something,</v>

3669
01:37:11.971 --> 01:37:13.890
<v Speaker 5>one of the neighbors for a fundraiser and I have no idea who it is.</v>

3670
01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:14.760
<v Speaker 5>How annoying.</v>

3671
01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:15.870
<v Speaker 5>I would love to be there though.</v>

3672
01:37:15.871 --> 01:37:18.300
<v Speaker 5>It's be kind of fun just to be in the elevator with him.</v>

3673
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:20.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't think male meet you a Kakou together.</v>

3674
01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:22.350
<v Speaker 5>I'll meet you a calculus fucking who I saw the other day,</v>

3675
01:37:22.351 --> 01:37:22.611
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

3676
01:37:22.611 --> 01:37:24.000
<v Speaker 5>walking into the building and I'm like,</v>

3677
01:37:24.001 --> 01:37:25.160
<v Speaker 5>hi Ha.</v>

3678
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:26.020
<v Speaker 5>He literally,</v>

3679
01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:27.870
<v Speaker 5>if a fucking rabbit ran by,</v>

3680
01:37:27.871 --> 01:37:29.850
<v Speaker 5>he would have recognized it more than me,</v>

3681
01:37:29.851 --> 01:37:30.021
<v Speaker 5>who?</v>

3682
01:37:30.021 --> 01:37:31.680
<v Speaker 5>He sat as close as we are and talked.</v>

3683
01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:33.000
<v Speaker 5>He's a genius,</v>

3684
01:37:33.001 --> 01:37:34.140
<v Speaker 5>but he's a fucking weird dude.</v>

3685
01:37:34.141 --> 01:37:34.974
<v Speaker 5>He's a very weird,</v>

3686
01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:35.291
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3687
01:37:35.291 --> 01:37:35.620
<v Speaker 5>hi.</v>

3688
01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:36.270

<v Speaker 5>and Neil degrasse Tyson yells because they simplify it because we are dumbbells</v>

3706
01:37:58.770 --> 01:37:59.760
<v Speaker 5>in comparison to them,</v>

3707
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:02.460

3847
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:41.890

3857
01:41:54.370 --> 01:41:57.430
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that I had to say about anything that was funny at all was sex</v>

<v Speaker 3>like the lack of connection to who I am as a person.</v>

3872
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.731
<v Speaker 3>That just,</v>

3873

<v Speaker 3>it makes you want to fucking it.</v>

3874

<v Speaker 3>I want to smash my face when I watched that,</v>

3875
01:42:25.991 --> 01:42:27.970
<v Speaker 3>like how did you allow yourself to do this?</v>

3886
01:42:50.651 --> 01:42:53.800
<v Speaker 3>with each other and we all knew each other back in those days.</v>

3901
01:43:30.150 --> 01:43:32.500
<v Speaker 3>And he would get girls to just come in the closet and look at my Dick,</v>

3954
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:37.880
<v Speaker 5>And I had to keep crawling over him.</v>

3955
01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:39.410
<v Speaker 5>And Patrice who was diabetic,</v>

3956
01:44:39.411 --> 01:44:39.711

<v Speaker 1>Remember when we were kids it was really hard to find anything even remotely</v>

4260
01:51:51.941 --> 01:51:52.690
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

4261
01:51:52.690 --> 01:51:53.141
<v Speaker 1>Like did you,</v>

4262
01:51:53.141 --> 01:51:53.741
<v Speaker 1>when you were a kid,</v>

4263
01:51:53.741 --> 01:51:54.600
<v Speaker 1>did you see we're about,</v>

4264
01:51:54.630 --> 01:51:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm 46,</v>

4265
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:57.400
<v Speaker 1>45 I'll be 46 in two days.</v>

4266
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll be 47 in August.</v>

4267
01:51:59.770 --> 01:52:00.401
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

4268
01:52:00.401 --> 01:52:01.234
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4269
01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:04.240
<v Speaker 1>did you see barnyard Betty and any of those things?</v>

4270
01:52:04.570 --> 01:52:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4271
01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:05.920
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

4272
01:52:05.921 --> 01:52:07.180
<v Speaker 1>the animal fucking stuff.</v>

4273
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4274
01:52:07.690 --> 01:52:08.430
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

4275
01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:13.430
<v Speaker 1>It was a video and a buddy had it and we went over to his house and watched it</v>

4276
01:52:14.050 --> 01:52:17.380
<v Speaker 1>and like one of us had to watch the door cause it was in the basement.</v>

4277
01:52:17.381 --> 01:52:21.640
<v Speaker 1>We were hovering over the v one person at the watch the door to let us know if</v>

4278
01:52:21.641 --> 01:52:22.474
<v Speaker 1>anybody was coming.</v>

4279
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:25.060
<v Speaker 1>And then we were standing in front of this VCR,</v>

4280
01:52:25.061 --> 01:52:29.200
<v Speaker 1>this TV with a VCR attach to watch this really grainy video of this chick.</v>

4281
01:52:29.201 --> 01:52:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4282
01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:30.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4283
01:52:30.161 --> 01:52:31.270
<v Speaker 1>very mild.</v>

4284
01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:32.213
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

4285
01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Beastiality very mild,</v>

4286
01:52:34.001 --> 01:52:35.080
<v Speaker 1>like blowing a donkey.</v>

4287
01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Not aggressively.</v>

4288
01:52:36.071 --> 01:52:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Not really that into it.</v>

4289
01:52:37.181 --> 01:52:37.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4290
01:52:37.630 --> 01:52:42.490
<v Speaker 1>she was having sex with a pig in some weird way and a German shepherd and it was</v>

4291
01:52:42.491 --> 01:52:43.301
<v Speaker 1>kind of fucked,</v>

4292
01:52:43.301 --> 01:52:46.310
<v Speaker 1>but it was so mild in comparison</v>

4293
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 5>to what kids see today.</v>

4294
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:51.320
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever wonder what kind of an impact that's having on them?</v>

4295
01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:53.270
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be freaking you out.</v>

4296
01:52:53.271 --> 01:52:53.401
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>

4297
01:52:53.401 --> 01:52:53.641
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>

4298
01:52:53.641 --> 01:52:54.120
<v Speaker 5>if you're a,</v>

4299
01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:56.360
<v Speaker 5>like when I saw some hardcore porn pictures,</v>

4300
01:52:56.361 --> 01:52:57.260
<v Speaker 5>the dirty movie,</v>

4301
01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.760
<v Speaker 5>but if you're just seeing a beheading video or,</v>

4302
01:52:59.830 --> 01:53:01.790
<v Speaker 5>or legitimate car crash stuff,</v>

4303
01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:06.050
<v Speaker 5>or were hardcore fucking is just the normalist thing you're going to see online.</v>

4304
01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:06.680
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4305
01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:06.891
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4306
01:53:06.891 --> 01:53:07.610
<v Speaker 5>it's got a jade.</v>

4307
01:53:07.610 --> 01:53:09.250
<v Speaker 5>I think that's why maybe school shooting that's,</v>

4308
01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:10.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm not blaming video game,</v>

4309
01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:14.540
<v Speaker 5>but when people be do become a certain desensitized to things,</v>

4310
01:53:14.580 --> 01:53:15.170
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4311
01:53:15.170 --> 01:53:17.960
<v Speaker 5>I probably sound like I'm criticizing every message if ever given.</v>

4312
01:53:17.961 --> 01:53:20.480
<v Speaker 5>But I do think that that has something to do with desensitizing you</v>

4313
01:53:21.010 --> 01:53:22.180
<v Speaker 1>to have something to do with it.</v>

4314
01:53:22.181 --> 01:53:25.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that that's the cause or someone doing something,</v>

4315
01:53:25.341 --> 01:53:28.570
<v Speaker 1>a born some doing something horrible and violent,</v>

4316
01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:33.070
<v Speaker 1>but you see so much violence and it becomes an option.</v>

4317
01:53:33.190 --> 01:53:33.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4318
01:53:33.490 --> 01:53:34.840
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't know what a gun was,</v>

4319
01:53:34.841 --> 01:53:35.800
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know what,</v>

4320
01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:36.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4321
01:53:36.101 --> 01:53:37.150
<v Speaker 1>a school shooting was.</v>

4322
01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:38.030
<v Speaker 1>If it didn't exist,</v>

4323
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:39.040
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't on the table.</v>

4324
01:53:39.250 --> 01:53:40.960
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be something that people considered,</v>

4325
01:53:41.050 --> 01:53:41.381
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

4326
01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:43.390
<v Speaker 1>But because the fact we have guns,</v>

4327
01:53:43.391 --> 01:53:45.910
<v Speaker 1>we know about guns because of the fact that we know about school shootings,</v>

4328
01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:46.541
<v Speaker 1>people think,</v>

4329
01:53:46.541 --> 01:53:46.991
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

4330
01:53:46.991 --> 01:53:48.790
<v Speaker 1>my fucking life is terrible.</v>

4331
01:53:49.170 --> 01:53:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm all fucked up on antidepressants.</v>

4332
01:53:50.891 --> 01:53:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go shoot up my school.</v>

4333
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:53.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4334
01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:57.250
<v Speaker 1>it is all those things do factor into the possibility of someone doing</v>

4335
01:53:57.251 --> 01:53:57.611
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

4336
01:53:57.611 --> 01:53:59.860
<v Speaker 1>But you can't blame those things.</v>

4337
01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:04.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like I've said that I think that we have a gun problem,</v>

4338
01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.040
<v Speaker 1>a mental health problem,</v>

4339
01:54:06.041 --> 01:54:07.760
<v Speaker 1>rather disguise as a gun problem.</v>

4340
01:54:08.110 --> 01:54:10.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think it is more than anything because you can give a lot of</v>

4341
01:54:10.571 --> 01:54:12.400
<v Speaker 1>people guns and they would never do anything wrong.</v>

4342
01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:13.231
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4343
01:54:13.231 --> 01:54:13.921
<v Speaker 5>But then he gave her that,</v>

4344
01:54:13.921 --> 01:54:14.101
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4345
01:54:14.101 --> 01:54:16.800
<v Speaker 5>one fucking one one like what was the kid that Alonza,</v>

4346
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:17.881
<v Speaker 5>Alonza,</v>

4347
01:54:17.881 --> 01:54:21.560
<v Speaker 5>Adam Lanza Lanza would affect his name was his mother had they got around the,</v>

4348
01:54:21.610 --> 01:54:22.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4349
01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:23.730
<v Speaker 5>so even if you're not the crazy person,</v>

4350
01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:26.250
<v Speaker 5>even if your kid is the fucking wide eyed,</v>

4351
01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:27.620
<v Speaker 5>you know me,</v>

4352
01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:27.901

4353
01:54:27.901 --> 01:54:31.950

4354
01:54:31.951 --> 01:54:34.890
<v Speaker 5>I hate the pupil in the middle of the eye with white all around it.</v>

4355
01:54:34.891 --> 01:54:36.030
<v Speaker 5>And I know some people get mad at me,</v>

4356
01:54:36.031 --> 01:54:37.230
<v Speaker 5>but it's a real condition.</v>

4357
01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:38.093
<v Speaker 5>Got Up.</v>

4358

<v Speaker 5>So sick of people getting upset there.</v>

4359
01:54:40.171 --> 01:54:41.290
<v Speaker 5>Shouldn't Jen move?</v>

4360
01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:43.380

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:43.890
<v Speaker 5>Oh you,</v>

01:54:43.890 --> 01:54:44.041
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4363
01:54:44.041 --> 01:54:45.630
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying a lot of the look in their eyes,</v>

4364
01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:47.080
<v Speaker 5>Adderall ice.</v>

4365
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:49.730
<v Speaker 5>I know somebody is on Adderall is when you look at,</v>

4366
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:51.270
<v Speaker 5>you can see the white around their Ibo.</v>

4367
01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:51.840
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4368
01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:53.280
<v Speaker 5>that's cause they're just like this.</v>

4369

4373
01:55:00.110 --> 01:55:00.661
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4374
01:55:00.661 --> 01:55:03.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure plenty of people don't have that aren't mentally ill who have that.</v>

4375
01:55:03.661 --> 01:55:03.961
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

4376
01:55:03.961 --> 01:55:05.490
<v Speaker 5>the nuts I've seen all have that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well Wa being wide eyed,</v>

4378

<v Speaker 5>being</v>

4379
01:55:07.690 --> 01:55:08.560
<v Speaker 1>accelerated,</v>

4380
01:55:08.561 --> 01:55:10.390
<v Speaker 1>being on amphetamines or you know,</v>

4381
01:55:10.391 --> 01:55:10.750
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

4382
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:14.290
<v Speaker 1>when you're putting kids on Ritalin and you're putting kids on Adderall and all</v>

4383
01:55:14.291 --> 01:55:14.741
<v Speaker 1>these different,</v>

4384
01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:15.700
<v Speaker 1>those are stimulants.</v>

4385
01:55:16.090 --> 01:55:16.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4386
01:55:16.391 --> 01:55:19.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that they use to treat ADHD and add,</v>

4387
01:55:19.181 --> 01:55:20.170
<v Speaker 1>those are stimulants.</v>

4388
01:55:20.710 --> 01:55:20.921
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4389
01:55:20.921 --> 01:55:21.131
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4391
01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:23.890
<v Speaker 1>you're jacking kids up on all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

4392
01:55:23.891 --> 01:55:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's just,</v>

4393
01:55:24.610 --> 01:55:25.810
<v Speaker 1>that's just those things.</v>

4394
01:55:25.811 --> 01:55:29.200
<v Speaker 1>What about the things that they put him on that or antidepressants and all these</v>

4395
01:55:29.201 --> 01:55:33.910
<v Speaker 1>things that don't have a long history of where you're radically altering human</v>

4396
01:55:33.911 --> 01:55:34.744
<v Speaker 1>neurochemistry,</v>

4397
01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:38.530
<v Speaker 1>radically altering it on a daily basis with really hardcore chemicals.</v>

4398
01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:41.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing that nobody likes to talk about when it comes to these</v>

4399
01:55:41.251 --> 01:55:42.250
<v Speaker 1>schools shootings,</v>

4400
01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:43.233
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

4401
01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:44.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4402
01:55:44.191 --> 01:55:48.400
<v Speaker 1>not meet correlation of causation or whatever the fuck that term is that that</v>

4403
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:50.100
<v Speaker 1>you can't necessarily connect them.</v>

4404
01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:50.700
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

4405
01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:54.210
<v Speaker 1>you can necessarily connect them you that you can't say it's the a hundred</v>

4406
01:55:54.210 --> 01:55:54.960
<v Speaker 1>percent of the cause,</v>

4407
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.340
<v Speaker 1>but when 90% of all the people that are school shooters are on antidepressants</v>

4408
01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:02.760
<v Speaker 1>or are coming off of antidepressants suffering when withdrawal of</v>

4409
01:56:02.761 --> 01:56:03.594
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>

4410
01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:06.750
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't point in time that they start looking at these chemicals that</v>

4411
01:56:06.751 --> 01:56:10.260
<v Speaker 1>radically altered the way people react to stress,</v>

4412
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:12.810
<v Speaker 1>the way people react to life itself,</v>

4413
01:56:12.811 --> 01:56:15.120
<v Speaker 1>the way people react to negative influences.</v>

4414
01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4415
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend that was on Zoloft and she said that when she was on it,</v>

4416
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:21.030
<v Speaker 1>she didn't care about anything.</v>

4417
01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Like she was going to write a book called,</v>

4418
01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I lost a year of my life about being on Zoloft cause for a year nothing bothered</v>

4419
01:56:27.271 --> 01:56:27.361
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

4420
01:56:27.361 --> 01:56:28.194
<v Speaker 1>nothing bothered her.</v>

4421
01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And you would think that someone who's a fucking psycho,</v>

4422
01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:31.330
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4423
01:56:31.330 --> 01:56:32.370
<v Speaker 1>You put them on that shit.</v>

4424
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:34.740
<v Speaker 1>It's also not going to bother them to kill people.</v>

4425
01:56:34.890 --> 01:56:35.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4426
01:56:35.101 --> 01:56:36.390
<v Speaker 1>just totally makes sense.</v>

4427
01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4428
01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:38.760
<v Speaker 1>They went to [inaudible] as a kid,</v>

4429
01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:42.060
<v Speaker 1>but my parents I think said no thank God,</v>

4430
01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:43.560
<v Speaker 1>they like me being creative.</v>

4431
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:44.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4432
01:56:44.161 --> 01:56:48.390
<v Speaker 1>And the funny Mandy having a lot of extra energy and anxiety that people can</v>

4433
01:56:48.391 --> 01:56:49.410
<v Speaker 1>misinterpret that as like,</v>

4434
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.591
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4435
01:56:49.591 --> 01:56:52.110
<v Speaker 1>we got to medicate this kid to make them quote unquote normal.</v>

4436
01:56:52.170 --> 01:56:52.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4437
01:56:52.321 --> 01:56:52.921
<v Speaker 1>Always a Weirdo.</v>

4438
01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4439
01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:53.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4440
01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I was a little fucking Weirdo and,</v>

4441
01:56:55.610 --> 01:56:57.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's how you make a comedian.</v>

4442
01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.150
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>

4443
01:56:58.150 --> 01:56:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4444
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>

4445
01:56:58.890 --> 01:56:59.850
<v Speaker 1>nobody brings that up,</v>

4446
01:56:59.851 --> 01:57:00.151
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4447
01:57:00.151 --> 01:57:00.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4448
01:57:00.431 --> 01:57:01.740
<v Speaker 1>no one ever brings that up in school.</v>

4449
01:57:01.741 --> 01:57:01.891
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4450
01:57:01.891 --> 01:57:02.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4451
01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:02.790

4458
01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:10.910
<v Speaker 1>So I asked her to,</v>

4478
01:57:25.081 --> 01:57:25.914
<v Speaker 1>She's very funny.</v>

4479
01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:26.281
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4480
01:57:26.281 --> 01:57:26.730

4482
01:57:27.731 --> 01:57:28.590

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4485
01:57:29.491 --> 01:57:30.324
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4486
01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:31.351
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

4487
01:57:31.351 --> 01:57:31.860
<v Speaker 1>How old is she?</v>

4488
01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:33.720
<v Speaker 1>28 not too late.</v>

4489
01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.180
<v Speaker 1>You were 38 I'll tell you to give it up.</v>

4490
01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:36.810

<v Speaker 1>28 you can still to kill Tony.</v>

4492
01:57:38.671 --> 01:57:39.504
<v Speaker 1>I'll put her up.</v>

4493
01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she's ready.</v>

4494
01:57:41.130 --> 01:57:41.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4495
01:57:41.441 --> 01:57:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean you plant seeds like that and someone said and who knows what they're</v>

4496
01:57:43.981 --> 01:57:44.814
<v Speaker 1>going to take.</v>

4497
01:57:44.850 --> 01:57:49.440
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of people out there that that is what they could do and they</v>

4498
01:57:49.441 --> 01:57:50.730
<v Speaker 1>probably have a skill.</v>

4499
01:57:50.731 --> 01:57:52.140
<v Speaker 1>They probably have a talent rather,</v>

4500
01:57:52.141 --> 01:57:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and they just never been a encouraged don't when he encourages you to do that.</v>

4501
01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4502
01:57:55.670 --> 01:57:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Cause any guidance counselor ever said to a kid he should be a standup comic.</v>

4503
01:57:59.270 --> 01:58:00.180
<v Speaker 1>You like doing drugs.</v>

4504
01:58:00.330 --> 01:58:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

4505
01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:01.800
<v Speaker 1>you'd never show up on time.</v>

4506
01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:03.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't do your homework.</v>

4507
01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:04.763
<v Speaker 1>You're funny.</v>

4508
01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Go be a comic.</v>

4509
01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:05.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4510
01:58:05.851 --> 01:58:07.650
<v Speaker 1>They never encourage you to get in the city.</v>

4511
01:58:07.651 --> 01:58:07.951
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4512
01:58:07.951 --> 01:58:08.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4513
01:58:08.101 --> 01:58:08.641
<v Speaker 1>if your music,</v>

4514
01:58:08.641 --> 01:58:10.010
<v Speaker 1>they encourage you to take me as a class.</v>

4515
01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Well they probably gets here to that part of the arts and drama alone.</v>

4516
01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Take a class and see if your standup comedy is one of the least respected art</v>

4517
01:58:17.401 --> 01:58:18.570
<v Speaker 1>forms that's most loved.</v>

4518
01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4519
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:22.800
<v Speaker 1>As far as like the process of becoming a standup comedian,</v>

4520
01:58:22.801 --> 01:58:27.801
<v Speaker 1>the option of becoming a standup convenient is so often like my own parents.</v>

4521
01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:31.590
<v Speaker 1>My parents didn't have a hard time with me kickboxing,</v>

4522
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:35.970
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't want me to do comedy doing comedy.</v>

4523
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not funny.</v>

4524
01:58:37.111 --> 01:58:38.100
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be terrible.</v>

4525
01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4526
01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:41.010
<v Speaker 1>There's something intangible about a comment that just scares people.</v>

4527
01:58:41.110 --> 01:58:41.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4528
01:58:41.261 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 1>they feel like you're going to be</v>

4529
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.490
<v Speaker 3>a loser,</v>

4530
01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:43.600
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be a loser,</v>

4531
01:58:43.601 --> 01:58:44.030
<v Speaker 3>you're acting.</v>

4532
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Cause no one wants to be the one who bombs.</v>

4533
01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:50.020
<v Speaker 3>And just to see someone you love up there making an ass out of themselves and</v>

4534
01:58:50.021 --> 01:58:51.790
<v Speaker 3>not be in funny like,</v>

4535
01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:52.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4536
01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:56.140
<v Speaker 3>how awful it did for a girl to go out with a guy she's dating who consistently</v>

4537
01:58:56.141 --> 01:58:57.400
<v Speaker 3>sucks on stage.</v>

4538
01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:58.540
<v Speaker 3>That's gotta be,</v>

4539
01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:00.490
<v Speaker 3>that's just kind of make her not want to fuck him.</v>

4540
01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:01.630
<v Speaker 3>I'll for sure awful.</v>

4541
01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:01.811
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4542
01:59:01.811 --> 01:59:03.640
<v Speaker 3>I've brought dates to shows and I bombed.</v>

4543
01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:04.150
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4544
01:59:04.150 --> 01:59:04.601
<v Speaker 3>Feel it.</v>

4545
01:59:04.601 --> 01:59:06.160
<v Speaker 3>They just didn't want to have nothing to do with me.</v>

4546
01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Can feel it.</v>

4547
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.861
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4548
01:59:08.861 --> 01:59:10.140
<v Speaker 3>back in the day when,</v>

4549
01:59:10.141 --> 01:59:11.110
<v Speaker 3>when I first started,</v>

4550
01:59:11.111 --> 01:59:11.950
<v Speaker 3>I could have bombed,</v>

4551
01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:13.360
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have a good set,</v>

4552
01:59:13.690 --> 01:59:14.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4553
01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:18.460
<v Speaker 3>maybe three to three sets in a row and then every fourth or fifth set easily can</v>

4554
01:59:18.461 --> 01:59:20.030
<v Speaker 3>go into the toilet easily.</v>

4555
01:59:20.410 --> 01:59:23.620
<v Speaker 3>So you take a girl with you to a show boy that was taking a risk.</v>

4556
01:59:23.650 --> 01:59:24.401
<v Speaker 3>I never do it.</v>

4557
01:59:24.401 --> 01:59:25.234
<v Speaker 3>I mean now I'll do it,</v>

4558
01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:26.201
<v Speaker 3>come see you to sell it,</v>

4559
01:59:26.201 --> 01:59:28.570
<v Speaker 3>but I'm working on stuff or whatever on the nights that I'm there.</v>

4560
01:59:28.571 --> 01:59:30.490
<v Speaker 3>I hate bringing people to shows,</v>

4561
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:33.610
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're working on stuff because when you working on stuff,</v>

4562
01:59:33.611 --> 01:59:37.360
<v Speaker 3>you're not trying to do the best show as much as you're trying to get material</v>

4563
01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:40.480
<v Speaker 3>and like format and get it to get and you'll sacrifice a few minutes.</v>

4564
01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4565
01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:41.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

4566
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:44.510
<v Speaker 3>I worked on a new bit last night and I just,</v>

4567
01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I knew,</v>

4568
01:59:45.250 --> 01:59:45.611
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4569
01:59:45.611 --> 01:59:46.391
<v Speaker 3>while I'm doing this,</v>

4570
01:59:46.391 --> 01:59:46.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4571
01:59:46.810 --> 01:59:49.660
<v Speaker 3>this is virgin territory is completely new bit.</v>

4572
01:59:49.810 --> 01:59:51.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where it's going.</v>

4573
01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:53.230
<v Speaker 3>And if someone was there to see you,</v>

4574
01:59:53.231 --> 01:59:54.700
<v Speaker 3>who knows how you're going to pull out of that,</v>

4575
01:59:54.701 --> 01:59:55.630
<v Speaker 3>you might not pull out.</v>

4576
01:59:55.630 --> 01:59:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4577
01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:56.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4578
01:59:56.710 --> 01:59:56.951
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

4579
01:59:56.951 --> 01:59:58.150
<v Speaker 3>I warned them though and I'm like,</v>

4580
01:59:58.151 --> 02:00:00.400
<v Speaker 3>it's going to by that clear my throat because the butter,</v>

4581
02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:01.031
<v Speaker 3>it's fuck,</v>

4582
02:00:01.031 --> 02:00:01.451
<v Speaker 3>I love it,</v>

4583
02:00:01.451 --> 02:00:04.900
<v Speaker 3>but it makes me fucking sound like fucking Ian Watkins on the stand.</v>

4584
02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:05.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4585
02:00:05.111 --> 02:00:07.340
<v Speaker 3>It's probably not the best thing to serve people a show.</v>

4586
02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:08.260
<v Speaker 3>They talk for three hours.</v>

4587
02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:08.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4588
02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:09.940
<v Speaker 3>he'd have some cottage cheese.</v>

4589
02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:10.421
<v Speaker 3>Goggle it,</v>

4590
02:00:10.421 --> 02:00:11.740
<v Speaker 3>this and then talk for three hours.</v>

4591
02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:13.600
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

4592
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:13.720
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

4593
02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:14.291
<v Speaker 3>can I be fun?</v>

4594
02:00:14.291 --> 02:00:14.981
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to forget.</v>

4595
02:00:14.981 --> 02:00:15.814
<v Speaker 3>Can I plug my show?</v>

4596
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:16.540
<v Speaker 3>But I keep it,</v>

4597
02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:17.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm really bad at that.</v>

4598
02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:18.071
<v Speaker 3>Please plugs.</v>

4599
02:00:18.071 --> 02:00:19.060
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it naturally,</v>

4600
02:00:19.061 --> 02:00:20.500
<v Speaker 3>so I have to just stop the flow of everything.</v>

4601
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Plug whore.</v>

4602
02:00:22.150 --> 02:00:22.983
<v Speaker 3>People want to hear it.</v>

4603
02:00:23.410 --> 02:00:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing a talk show and vice,</v>

4604
02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:25.230
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

4605
02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:26.760
<v Speaker 3>which is why I'm out in Los Angeles right now.</v>

4606
02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:28.870
<v Speaker 3>And it comes out next Wednesday,</v>

4607
02:00:28.871 --> 02:00:30.280
<v Speaker 3>the 23rd.</v>

4608
02:00:30.730 --> 02:00:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4609
02:00:31.450 --> 02:00:31.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4610
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:33.640
<v Speaker 3>it's a talk show that I host and what is it?</v>

4611
02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:38.850
<v Speaker 3>It's just me doing a monologue and a little sketch and then interviewing guests.</v>

4612
02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:41.890
<v Speaker 3>And my first guests were actually Dana and Mike Tyson together.</v>

4613
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.903
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4614
02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:44.200
<v Speaker 3>What a fucking favor.</v>

4615
02:00:44.210 --> 02:00:45.031
<v Speaker 3>Dana did me mad.</v>

4616
02:00:45.031 --> 02:00:45.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's a Tyson.</v>

4617
02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:46.031
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4618
02:00:46.031 --> 02:00:46.690
<v Speaker 3>they were great.</v>

4619
02:00:46.690 --> 02:00:48.940
<v Speaker 3>They were really great.</v>

4620
02:00:48.941 --> 02:00:50.080
<v Speaker 3>And just do it in front of an audience.</v>

4621
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Live audience where I'm in New York.</v>

4622
02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:53.020
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4623
02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:55.330
<v Speaker 3>We did four pilot episodes and uh,</v>

4624
02:00:55.331 --> 02:00:55.780
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

4625
02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:58.840
<v Speaker 3>it was a very odd thing because I wanted the crowd on top of me like they're lay</v>

4626
02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:01.450
<v Speaker 3>audiences like from where you are to me on top.</v>

4627
02:01:01.451 --> 02:01:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Like I wanted it like comedian style.</v>

4628
02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:04.380
<v Speaker 3>So uh,</v>

4629
02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:05.560
<v Speaker 3>the camera angles where they had to,</v>

4630
02:01:05.561 --> 02:01:05.641
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

4631
02:01:05.641 --> 02:01:08.620
<v Speaker 3>it was hard for us to edit anything because it was supposed to be a 30 minute</v>

4632
02:01:08.621 --> 02:01:09.430
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

4633
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:12.670
<v Speaker 3>but I want to talk to these guys who wouldn't like an hour and 20 so we had to</v>

4634
02:01:12.671 --> 02:01:13.630
<v Speaker 3>chop down to an hour.</v>

4635
02:01:13.630 --> 02:01:18.630
<v Speaker 3>They let me make it an hour pilot episode for vice.com or is it vice.com so it's</v>

4636
02:01:19.331 --> 02:01:20.290
<v Speaker 3>all going to be online.</v>

4637
02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4638
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4639
02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:21.221
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

4640
02:01:21.221 --> 02:01:24.460
<v Speaker 3>It comes out to the 23rd and then there's going to be one a week for four weeks</v>

4641
02:01:24.461 --> 02:01:27.890
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully people like the different shows and you know,</v>

4642
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:29.950
<v Speaker 3>the monologues I'm allowed to kind of say what I want to say.</v>

4643
02:01:29.951 --> 02:01:31.810
<v Speaker 3>They didn't creatively fuck with me at all.</v>

4644
02:01:31.811 --> 02:01:32.890
<v Speaker 3>Like that's awesome man.</v>

4645
02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:33.940
<v Speaker 3>They were great.</v>

4646
02:01:33.941 --> 02:01:35.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean everywhere you go,</v>

4647
02:01:35.231 --> 02:01:37.660
<v Speaker 3>they're telling you don't say this and you know he's afraid of frustrating for a</v>

4648
02:01:37.661 --> 02:01:38.260
<v Speaker 3>comedian.</v>

4649
02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:38.411
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4650
02:01:38.411 --> 02:01:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Shane Smith is one of my favorite people ever.</v>

4651
02:01:41.010 --> 02:01:41.841

4655
02:01:46.131 --> 02:01:46.761
<v Speaker 3>He was texting me,</v>

4656
02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:48.230
<v Speaker 3>trying to get me to go to Africa with him.</v>

4657
02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:49.131
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4658
02:01:49.131 --> 02:01:49.401
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

4659

4660
02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:55.040
<v Speaker 3>He wants me to go to some new island that some island rather that they have</v>

4661
02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 3>where they've taken all these monkeys and apes.</v>

4662
02:01:57.950 --> 02:02:02.150
<v Speaker 3>They experimented with and shot up with diseases and aids and all this stuff and</v>

4663
02:02:02.151 --> 02:02:04.450
<v Speaker 3>they've dropped them off when they're done with their experiment and they,</v>

4664
02:02:04.530 --> 02:02:06.050
<v Speaker 3>they bring them to some island.</v>

4665
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:07.310
<v Speaker 3>So there's an island,</v>

4666
02:02:07.311 --> 02:02:11.600
<v Speaker 3>like a planet of the apes island that's filled with all these monkeys and apes</v>

4667

<v Speaker 3>that have gone through all these medical experiments.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4755
02:03:59.130 --> 02:04:02.670
<v Speaker 3>it's whenever I sit down on a radio show like they used to do it on k rock,</v>

4756
02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:04.280
<v Speaker 3>every time I would do it I would sit down,</v>

4757
02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:08.370
<v Speaker 3>they would play this whole thing of a bunch of clips in my stand up and then add</v>

4758
02:04:08.371 --> 02:04:09.121
<v Speaker 3>a context.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That made me feel a lot sacral naked in the background.</v>

4777
02:04:35.581 --> 02:04:36.570
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to say cause the TVS,</v>

4778
02:04:36.630 --> 02:04:36.810

<v Speaker 3>she a Bra.</v>

4780
02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Our connection is we have to fix that and make it sticky to the TV color</v>

4781
02:04:42.721 --> 02:04:43.061
<v Speaker 3>broadly.</v>

4782
02:04:43.061 --> 02:04:43.800
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda hard to say.</v>

4783
02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:44.780
<v Speaker 3>It looks like she's naked.</v>

4784
02:04:44.781 --> 02:04:45.240
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>

4785
02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:45.601
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

4786
02:04:45.601 --> 02:04:46.910
<v Speaker 3>It is fucking hilarious.</v>

4787
02:04:46.930 --> 02:04:50.270
<v Speaker 3>I made me feel a lot better if I was really genuinely panicked.</v>

4788
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.641
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

4789
02:04:50.641 --> 02:04:51.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm a child,</v>

4790
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:53.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan of people throwing up.</v>

4791
02:04:53.490 --> 02:04:55.170
<v Speaker 3>I hosted fear factor for six years.</v>

4792
02:04:55.171 --> 02:04:56.670
<v Speaker 3>Throwing up to me was always funny.</v>

4793
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:57.570
<v Speaker 3>It is right?</v>

4794
02:04:57.570 --> 02:04:58.890
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of for me.</v>

4795
02:04:59.040 --> 02:04:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4796
02:04:59.490 --> 02:04:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

4797
02:04:59.850 --> 02:05:01.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean just the ridiculousness of it all.</v>

4798
02:05:01.891 --> 02:05:03.150
<v Speaker 3>You sitting on the edge of the bed,</v>

4799
02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:07.110
<v Speaker 3>her throwing up in a bucket I'm in and I'll say this,</v>

4800
02:05:07.170 --> 02:05:09.240
<v Speaker 3>they eddy Moretti and knows and he's like,</v>

4801
02:05:09.241 --> 02:05:09.361
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4802
02:05:09.361 --> 02:05:10.830
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the best one we should lead with.</v>

4803
02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:11.821
<v Speaker 3>And I was against it.</v>

4804
02:05:11.821 --> 02:05:12.031
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4805
02:05:12.031 --> 02:05:12.301
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4806
02:05:12.301 --> 02:05:12.901
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

4807
02:05:12.901 --> 02:05:14.070
<v Speaker 3>And it's like sometimes people just,</v>

4808
02:05:14.071 --> 02:05:17.370
<v Speaker 3>I have to remember that there are people that see things from the outside that</v>

4809
02:05:17.371 --> 02:05:17.520
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

4810
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:21.390
<v Speaker 3>that are no shit that I don't know and have a better eye than I do.</v>

4811
02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:22.321
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

4812
02:05:22.321 --> 02:05:23.610
<v Speaker 3>you know how you're married to your stuff,</v>

4813
02:05:23.611 --> 02:05:23.851
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4814
02:05:23.851 --> 02:05:25.080
<v Speaker 3>when you're performing or whatever.</v>

4815
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:28.740
<v Speaker 3>And it's like there's people that can just see things and detach from the</v>

4816
02:05:28.741 --> 02:05:30.910
<v Speaker 3>emotion of it and go to clearly like now though,</v>

4817
02:05:30.930 --> 02:05:32.010
<v Speaker 3>this is the way to start.</v>

4818
02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Like I was wrong about that and he was right and it's like,</v>

4819
02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:37.470
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard for me to think in those terms that I don't know what the fuck</v>

4820
02:05:37.471 --> 02:05:38.304
<v Speaker 3>I'm always talking about.</v>

4821
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:39.180
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to,</v>

4822
02:05:39.181 --> 02:05:40.990
<v Speaker 3>when you're going over your material,</v>

4823
02:05:40.991 --> 02:05:42.750
<v Speaker 3>when you're editing like a special,</v>

4824
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:45.540
<v Speaker 3>you lose the idea of what's funny and what's not funny.</v>

4825
02:05:45.541 --> 02:05:47.340
<v Speaker 3>You see the bits too many times and could get,</v>

4826
02:05:47.610 --> 02:05:52.200
<v Speaker 3>they get really blurry sometimes it gets real confusing and you get a fan.</v>

4827
02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very bad collaborator.</v>

4828
02:05:54.030 --> 02:05:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Like we had to edit the,</v>

4829
02:05:54.931 --> 02:05:55.141
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4830
02:05:55.141 --> 02:05:55.920
<v Speaker 3>the interview with,</v>

4831
02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:59.760
<v Speaker 3>with Dana and Mike and I loved all of it cause it was honest and funny and free</v>

4832
02:05:59.761 --> 02:06:00.511
<v Speaker 3>flowing and you know,</v>

4833
02:06:00.511 --> 02:06:05.040
<v Speaker 3>Tyson was hilarious and Dana was fucking great and it was like we had to chop,</v>

4834
02:06:05.041 --> 02:06:06.990
<v Speaker 3>it just cannot 40 minute cause I went 40 minutes.</v>

4835
02:06:06.991 --> 02:06:08.250
<v Speaker 3>So it's the internet,</v>

4836
02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:11.460
<v Speaker 3>but they way that they're letting me do it was they've already doubled how long</v>

4837
02:06:11.461 --> 02:06:12.240
<v Speaker 3>they'll let me do it.</v>

4838
02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay with that and a lot and some that was just literally we were throwing</v>

4839
02:06:15.571 --> 02:06:15.841
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

4840
02:06:15.841 --> 02:06:19.080
<v Speaker 3>We had to do a couple of throws cause the way vice releases a video is they'll</v>

4841
02:06:19.081 --> 02:06:20.340
<v Speaker 3>have more than one part to it.</v>

4842
02:06:20.690 --> 02:06:22.200
<v Speaker 3>They just masters at that shit.</v>

4843
02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:23.940
<v Speaker 3>So I forgot to do that.</v>

4844
02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:26.340
<v Speaker 3>I during the interview I didn't do that.</v>

4845
02:06:26.341 --> 02:06:26.930
<v Speaker 3>So we had to guard,</v>

4846
02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:29.100
<v Speaker 3>we just got to get a couple of pickups which we needed.</v>

4847
02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:30.991
<v Speaker 3>So we had to get like,</v>

4848
02:06:30.991 --> 02:06:31.201
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

4849
02:06:31.201 --> 02:06:31.741
<v Speaker 3>we'll be right back,</v>

4850
02:06:31.741 --> 02:06:32.490
<v Speaker 3>watch this.</v>

4851
02:06:32.490 --> 02:06:35.760
<v Speaker 3>So we had to tape them at the end and they were doing that and we're talking</v>

4852
02:06:35.761 --> 02:06:36.301
<v Speaker 3>about something.</v>

4853
02:06:36.301 --> 02:06:37.470
<v Speaker 3>But the one we're talking about,</v>

4854
02:06:38.150 --> 02:06:38.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4855
02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.330
<v Speaker 3>I had to take this pickup and put it in the middle.</v>

4856
02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Just a couple of minor things.</v>

4857
02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:44.010
<v Speaker 3>But I got so fucking territorial about stuff.</v>

4858
02:06:44.011 --> 02:06:45.090
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to cut any of it.</v>

4859
02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:47.610
<v Speaker 3>But they were actually great when they didn't bust my balls about any of the</v>

4860
02:06:47.611 --> 02:06:48.450
<v Speaker 3>content at all.</v>

4861
02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:52.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand wanting to edit things that are on the Internet if it,</v>

4862
02:06:52.621 --> 02:06:54.060
<v Speaker 3>unless it's some insane length.</v>

4863
02:06:54.450 --> 02:06:56.010
<v Speaker 3>This was just the,</v>

4864
02:06:56.070 --> 02:06:56.791
<v Speaker 3>the cuts we made,</v>

4865
02:06:56.791 --> 02:06:59.010
<v Speaker 3>there was very little in the content area.</v>

4866
02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:01.950
<v Speaker 3>It was only because I didn't know how they did videos.</v>

4867
02:07:02.190 --> 02:07:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't realize that we have to do it in more than one part.</v>

4868
02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:05.990
<v Speaker 3>And they probably had told me that,</v>

4869
02:07:05.991 --> 02:07:08.640
<v Speaker 3>and I just forgot in that moment because it was my first episode.</v>

4870
02:07:09.090 --> 02:07:12.600
<v Speaker 3>So I should have said like what I should have done was to keep in pace with the</v>

4871
02:07:12.601 --> 02:07:14.850
<v Speaker 3>way they do is because every series they do is really,</v>

4872
02:07:14.851 --> 02:07:15.720
<v Speaker 3>I've watched a million up,</v>

4873
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:17.040
<v Speaker 3>they're all released in a few parts.</v>

4874
02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:18.300
<v Speaker 3>So if I'm going along,</v>

4875
02:07:18.301 --> 02:07:18.781
<v Speaker 3>I should have said,</v>

4876
02:07:18.781 --> 02:07:19.081
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

4877
02:07:19.081 --> 02:07:20.040
<v Speaker 3>it's about x amount of time,</v>

4878
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:21.780
<v Speaker 3>we'll be right back or go to the next,</v>

4879
02:07:21.781 --> 02:07:24.390
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck I should have said and then done it that way.</v>

4880
02:07:24.690 --> 02:07:26.430
<v Speaker 3>But I just didn't know to do that.</v>

4881
02:07:26.431 --> 02:07:27.580
<v Speaker 3>So you know what I think,</v>

4882
02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:29.220
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the wrong way to do it.</v>

4883
02:07:29.221 --> 02:07:31.380
<v Speaker 3>I think the way you did it as the right way,</v>

4884
02:07:31.590 --> 02:07:31.921
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4885
02:07:31.921 --> 02:07:36.460
<v Speaker 3>organically have a conversation and then have all the throws in post.</v>

4886
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:39.010
<v Speaker 3>What do you have to fucking be there when you do it?</v>

4887
02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:40.150
<v Speaker 3>Just say you know,</v>

4888
02:07:40.151 --> 02:07:41.430
<v Speaker 3>having the middle of the coffee,</v>

4889
02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.850
<v Speaker 3>like the conversations have pauses.</v>

4890
02:07:42.970 --> 02:07:47.020
<v Speaker 3>Say we'll be back with episode two next week and we can do that.</v>

4891
02:07:47.050 --> 02:07:47.711
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

4892
02:07:47.711 --> 02:07:52.600
<v Speaker 3>Why would you want to make someone have some nonorganic throw in the middle of a</v>

4893
02:07:52.601 --> 02:07:53.470
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

4894
02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Like that's goofy.</v>

4895
02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:58.810
<v Speaker 3>That's just chops up the flow of the conversation in the thought process.</v>

4896
02:07:58.811 --> 02:08:01.090
<v Speaker 3>That may have been my mistake.</v>

4897
02:08:01.091 --> 02:08:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Then you don't need to like they know how to,</v>

4898
02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.810
<v Speaker 3>the thing that they do is they release video.</v>

4899
02:08:05.811 --> 02:08:07.070
<v Speaker 3>They know what gets the views.</v>

4900
02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:08.440
<v Speaker 3>The part one's the part two.</v>

4901
02:08:08.441 --> 02:08:11.260
<v Speaker 3>He's like they tried to explaining it to me like how it works as a business</v>

4902
02:08:11.261 --> 02:08:14.260
<v Speaker 3>model and you know I'm looking at it from like,</v>

4903
02:08:14.290 --> 02:08:14.951
<v Speaker 3>like you just said,</v>

4904
02:08:14.951 --> 02:08:19.630
<v Speaker 3>I want to have the conversation and they were like things don't normally go</v>

4905
02:08:19.631 --> 02:08:21.100
<v Speaker 3>cause my set's very plain.</v>

4906
02:08:21.101 --> 02:08:21.401
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

4907
02:08:21.401 --> 02:08:23.020
<v Speaker 3>I like the Dick Cavett Mike Douglas,</v>

4908
02:08:23.021 --> 02:08:24.070
<v Speaker 3>like those fucking guys.</v>

4909
02:08:24.850 --> 02:08:26.320
<v Speaker 3>So I did it because I,</v>

4910
02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:26.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4911
02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:27.780
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to just,</v>

4912
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:28.391
<v Speaker 3>I should have just said,</v>

4913
02:08:28.391 --> 02:08:28.691
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>

4914
02:08:28.691 --> 02:08:31.030
<v Speaker 3>we'll be right back or maybe done it in post,</v>

4915
02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:33.090
<v Speaker 3>but I just didn't think to do that at the moment.</v>

4916
02:08:33.091 --> 02:08:33.311
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

4917
02:08:33.311 --> 02:08:34.510
<v Speaker 3>we just got to get a couple of pickups.</v>

4918
02:08:34.511 --> 02:08:35.610
<v Speaker 3>That was the stage manager.</v>

4919
02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:35.861
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4920
02:08:35.861 --> 02:08:36.190
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4921
02:08:36.190 --> 02:08:39.580
<v Speaker 3>like maybe I could have said to him now do it in post.</v>

4922
02:08:39.581 --> 02:08:40.690
<v Speaker 3>And he might've been fine with it,</v>

4923
02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:41.531
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

4924
02:08:41.531 --> 02:08:42.580
<v Speaker 3>it was such a learning,</v>

4925
02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:44.290
<v Speaker 3>and I hate to 60 sound like such a Douche,</v>

4926
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:45.460
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

4927
02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:50.200
<v Speaker 3>they gave me so much ability to do what I want without fucking with me.</v>

4928
02:08:50.530 --> 02:08:52.690
<v Speaker 3>That I might've made a couple of like,</v>

4929
02:08:52.691 --> 02:08:52.961
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

4930
02:08:52.961 --> 02:08:54.280
<v Speaker 3>I should've done this instead of that.</v>

4931
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:54.761
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4932
02:08:54.761 --> 02:08:57.180
<v Speaker 3>Well it seems like you could probably figure that out as you go along.</v>

4933
02:08:57.230 --> 02:08:58.570
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you start something out.</v>

4934
02:08:58.571 --> 02:08:59.141
<v Speaker 3>It always has.</v>

4935
02:08:59.141 --> 02:08:59.380
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4936
02:08:59.380 --> 02:08:59.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4937
02:08:59.651 --> 02:09:00.730
<v Speaker 3>there's always this bumps.</v>

4938
02:09:00.731 --> 02:09:01.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4939
02:09:01.031 --> 02:09:02.320
<v Speaker 3>and they gave me an extra episode.</v>

4940
02:09:02.530 --> 02:09:04.690
<v Speaker 3>We were supposed to do three and then they were like,</v>

4941
02:09:04.691 --> 02:09:06.400
<v Speaker 3>we might do two because of scheduling.</v>

4942
02:09:06.401 --> 02:09:07.390
<v Speaker 3>And then I sat down with editing.</v>

4943
02:09:07.391 --> 02:09:07.571
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

4944
02:09:07.571 --> 02:09:07.661
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4945
02:09:07.661 --> 02:09:07.881
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

4946
02:09:07.881 --> 02:09:08.790
<v Speaker 3>why don't we just try for,</v>

4947
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:10.051
<v Speaker 3>and they just threw it up.</v>

4948
02:09:10.051 --> 02:09:11.170
<v Speaker 3>But like that's how they do things.</v>

4949
02:09:11.171 --> 02:09:12.400
<v Speaker 3>They throw an extra episode.</v>

4950
02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:16.600
<v Speaker 3>So I had David tells the guest and I had does Shirad small in Boston a pace for</v>

4951
02:09:16.601 --> 02:09:20.230
<v Speaker 3>me and it was just fucking funny hanging with three other Comedians,</v>

4952
02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:20.921
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4953
02:09:20.921 --> 02:09:23.890
<v Speaker 3>And that kind of felt like a much different one than Tyson and data.</v>

4954
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:24.783
<v Speaker 3>Do you think,</v>

4955
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:28.790
<v Speaker 3>what do you think is going to go down with September when your contract is up?</v>

4956
02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:30.190
<v Speaker 3>October 4th I don't know.</v>

4957
02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:34.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean like I love the Gig,</v>

4958
02:09:34.090 --> 02:09:35.410
<v Speaker 3>I love performing.</v>

4959
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:36.251
<v Speaker 3>But you love the Gig.</v>

4960
02:09:36.251 --> 02:09:37.061
<v Speaker 3>The same with Anthony.</v>

4961
02:09:37.061 --> 02:09:38.260
<v Speaker 3>Not of course not.</v>

4962
02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:38.501
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4963
02:09:38.501 --> 02:09:38.591
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4964
02:09:38.591 --> 02:09:38.861
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4965
02:09:38.861 --> 02:09:41.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean the idea of performing either alone or with other people.</v>

4966
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4967
02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:45.190
<v Speaker 3>I want this thing to work because I want my own thing.</v>

4968
02:09:45.191 --> 02:09:46.370
<v Speaker 3>Like I've done so many things.</v>

4969
02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:47.350
<v Speaker 3>The vice thing.</v>

4970
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4971
02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Jim Norton show.</v>

4972
02:09:48.551 --> 02:09:50.350
<v Speaker 3>I want to have my own thing too,</v>

4973
02:09:50.351 --> 02:09:53.380
<v Speaker 3>because you feel like a more complete performer when you're not always with Opie</v>

4974
02:09:53.381 --> 02:09:57.070
<v Speaker 3>and Anthony Are Collin Quinn or Louis C K or Amy Schumer's put me on her show.</v>

4975
02:09:57.390 --> 02:10:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't always want to be on somebody else's thing.</v>

4976
02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4977
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:04.960
<v Speaker 3>so I love the idea of performing on the radio.</v>

4978
02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:06.250
<v Speaker 3>I love doing it with,</v>

4979
02:10:06.251 --> 02:10:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Oop,</v>

4980
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:09.190
<v Speaker 3>I love doing it with opie and Anthony Moore because,</v>

4981
02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:10.660
<v Speaker 3>and I like to say the same thing of Opie left.</v>

4982
02:10:10.661 --> 02:10:14.830
<v Speaker 3>Like I honestly do love being a part of that radio show.</v>

4983
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Being without Anthony is difficult and it would say the same thing.</v>

4984
02:10:18.881 --> 02:10:20.910
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

4985
02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:21.090
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4986
02:10:21.090 --> 02:10:26.090
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to realize how much space a person fills in your life until they're</v>

4987
02:10:26.321 --> 02:10:27.154
<v Speaker 3>not there.</v>

4988
02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:27.521
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4989
02:10:27.521 --> 02:10:27.821
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4990
02:10:27.821 --> 02:10:29.410
<v Speaker 3>we all know Anthony's a comic gene,</v>

4991
02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:30.520
<v Speaker 3>that's easy to say,</v>

4992
02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:32.020
<v Speaker 3>but it's like the little moments,</v>

4993
02:10:32.021 --> 02:10:33.340
<v Speaker 3>like when there's that chair,</v>

4994
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:33.711
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4995
02:10:33.711 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

4996
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:34.280
<v Speaker 5>close.</v>

4997
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:35.720
<v Speaker 5>I said closer to,</v>

4998
02:10:35.721 --> 02:10:36.110
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4999
02:10:36.110 --> 02:10:38.660
<v Speaker 5>to Anthony that I do to you every day,</v>

5000
02:10:38.661 --> 02:10:39.920
<v Speaker 5>five days a week for 10 years.</v>

5001
02:10:40.190 --> 02:10:41.120
<v Speaker 5>And now he's just gone.</v>

5002
02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:44.390
<v Speaker 5>And it's really hard to get used to that empty seat.</v>

5003
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:48.410
<v Speaker 5>Whether he's saying something funny or whether he's just doing a stupid Iraq</v>

5004
02:10:48.411 --> 02:10:50.900
<v Speaker 5>joke or a little aside or just pie.</v>

5005
02:10:50.930 --> 02:10:53.150
<v Speaker 5>It's like this whole fucking vacuum of this,</v>

5006
02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:55.850
<v Speaker 5>this great powerful brain that used to be,</v>

5007
02:10:55.851 --> 02:10:56.181
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5008
02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:58.670
<v Speaker 5>a foot away from it or just talking about things.</v>

5009
02:10:58.671 --> 02:10:59.870
<v Speaker 5>He's a fascinating guy.</v>

5010
02:10:59.871 --> 02:11:01.640
<v Speaker 5>He's got a lot of information in his head.</v>

5011
02:11:01.730 --> 02:11:04.610
<v Speaker 5>He can talk about anything for any length of time,</v>

5012
02:11:05.010 --> 02:11:06.050
<v Speaker 5>anything he could be.</v>

5013
02:11:06.051 --> 02:11:07.610
<v Speaker 5>And we've said that like he porter,</v>

5014
02:11:07.690 --> 02:11:08.750
<v Speaker 5>and I've said this before,</v>

5015
02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:12.920
<v Speaker 5>but Patrice said that Anthony can access funny faster than anybody he'd ever</v>

5016
02:11:12.921 --> 02:11:13.580
<v Speaker 5>known.</v>

5017
02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:18.580
<v Speaker 5>Like he just had the ability to access being funny immediately on any subject.</v>

5018
02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:21.260
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're talking like you know,</v>

5019
02:11:21.261 --> 02:11:22.400
<v Speaker 5>he was a tin knocker,</v>

5020
02:11:22.401 --> 02:11:26.780
<v Speaker 5>he would put in air conditioning vents and he can walk you through that in a</v>

5021
02:11:26.781 --> 02:11:31.400
<v Speaker 5>fascinating way and be funny about it and be captivating with it.</v>

5022
02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:32.331
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>

5023
02:11:32.331 --> 02:11:32.871
<v Speaker 5>I and I,</v>

5024
02:11:32.871 --> 02:11:35.210
<v Speaker 5>I just die telling a story.</v>

5025
02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:37.520
<v Speaker 5>I lose people in me.</v>

5026
02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:39.140
<v Speaker 5>It's a joke I've done,</v>

5027
02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:43.130
<v Speaker 5>but I meant this sincerity of it that if I was on nine 11 on the,</v>

5028
02:11:43.131 --> 02:11:45.050
<v Speaker 5>if I made it out of the first tower,</v>

5029
02:11:45.051 --> 02:11:46.940
<v Speaker 5>I would lose people halfway through the story.</v>

5030
02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:51.320
<v Speaker 5>Like I just have no ability to go from the beginning to the middle to the end</v>

5031
02:11:51.410 --> 02:11:52.970
<v Speaker 5>and keep people locked in.</v>

5032
02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Did you guys have a meeting with serious after this is over?</v>

5033
02:11:56.061 --> 02:11:57.740
<v Speaker 5>I know we talked to Scott,</v>

5034
02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:00.050
<v Speaker 5>I talked to Scott on the phone and he goes,</v>

5035
02:12:00.051 --> 02:12:00.171
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5036
02:12:00.171 --> 02:12:02.870
<v Speaker 5>we're going to try to move forward with you and opie and see how it happens.</v>

5037
02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:03.831
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

5038
02:12:03.831 --> 02:12:05.600
<v Speaker 5>work through it organically on the air.</v>

5039
02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:07.550
<v Speaker 5>They didn't tell us how to do it.</v>

5040
02:12:07.551 --> 02:12:09.320
<v Speaker 5>They didn't say don't bad mouth the company don't.</v>

5041
02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:11.840
<v Speaker 5>He said worked through it organically on the air and what we'll see what</v>

5042
02:12:11.841 --> 02:12:12.674
<v Speaker 5>happens.</v>

5043
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:13.221
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>

5044
02:12:13.221 --> 02:12:14.054
<v Speaker 5>see what happens.</v>

5045
02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:16.850
<v Speaker 5>They completely closed the idea of Anthony ever coming back.</v>

5046
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:17.691
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

5047
02:12:17.691 --> 02:12:18.280
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5048
02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:18.460
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

5049
02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:20.030
<v Speaker 5>and they've given me no indication.</v>

5050
02:12:20.031 --> 02:12:23.120
<v Speaker 5>So I'm careful how I say that because I don't want the fans getting like I'm</v>

5051
02:12:23.121 --> 02:12:24.590
<v Speaker 5>putting false hope out there,</v>

5052
02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:25.061
<v Speaker 5>but I'm,</v>

5053
02:12:25.061 --> 02:12:27.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm just being truthful is they,</v>

5054
02:12:27.261 --> 02:12:32.261
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't feel final to me and maybe that's my own denial or my own lack of</v>

5055
02:12:32.841 --> 02:12:35.210
<v Speaker 5>willingness to admit that this thing could be over.</v>

5056
02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:36.760
<v Speaker 5>Like it was really sad man.</v>

5057
02:12:36.770 --> 02:12:37.230
<v Speaker 5>Last time I saw,</v>

5058
02:12:37.230 --> 02:12:39.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I went to his fucking 4th of July party and I was very depressed</v>

5059
02:12:39.981 --> 02:12:40.814
<v Speaker 5>driving home.</v>

5060
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:43.610
<v Speaker 5>Like I know I'm going to be okay financially and I know like,</v>

5061
02:12:43.611 --> 02:12:44.840
<v Speaker 5>hey there's other show could take off.</v>

5062
02:12:44.841 --> 02:12:45.830
<v Speaker 5>Hey you got stand up.</v>

5063
02:12:45.831 --> 02:12:46.664
<v Speaker 5>Hey you got,</v>

5064
02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:50.470
<v Speaker 5>but just the idea that this thing you love to do like art,</v>

5065
02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:52.340
<v Speaker 5>this chapter is closed.</v>

5066
02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.830
<v Speaker 5>Like just fucking depresses me,</v>

5067
02:12:55.090 --> 02:12:56.870
<v Speaker 5>depresses me to listen to it.</v>

5068
02:12:56.871 --> 02:12:59.120
<v Speaker 5>I can imagine if it was me every day,</v>

5069
02:12:59.270 --> 02:13:02.090
<v Speaker 5>day in day out being a part of it,</v>

5070
02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:02.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5071
02:13:02.730 --> 02:13:04.490
<v Speaker 5>every time I did it I loved it.</v>

5072
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:06.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean I had a great time doing your show.</v>

5073
02:13:06.531 --> 02:13:08.990
<v Speaker 5>So my favorite radio show of all time without a doubt,</v>

5074
02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:10.280
<v Speaker 5>it's a real conversation.</v>

5075
02:13:10.281 --> 02:13:13.460
<v Speaker 5>You have real moments and the laughs somebody played for me recently are,</v>

5076
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:16.730
<v Speaker 5>they sent me a link to Jim Norton's laugh compilation.</v>

5077
02:13:16.731 --> 02:13:19.850
<v Speaker 5>There's just times where people have made me laugh on the shell and I listened</v>

5078
02:13:19.851 --> 02:13:22.850
<v Speaker 5>to part one and two because a point is not me laughing.</v>

5079
02:13:22.851 --> 02:13:23.690
<v Speaker 5>It's the things,</v>

5080
02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:25.001
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

5081
02:13:25.001 --> 02:13:28.550
<v Speaker 5>most of those labs have come from Anthony more than any gas or anybody.</v>

5082
02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:29.880
<v Speaker 5>And some of the things that,</v>

5083
02:13:29.881 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 5>if he did a thing recently or years ago</v>

5084
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.580
<v Speaker 1>that I heard two days ago when we were talking about people who have shot</v>

5085
02:13:35.581 --> 02:13:40.581
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the head and survived and Anthony did the voice of the guy who</v>

5086
02:13:41.341 --> 02:13:42.780
<v Speaker 1>survived and he just wanted to,</v>

5087
02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.520
<v Speaker 1>it was an immediate,</v>

5088
02:13:44.970 --> 02:13:49.290
<v Speaker 1>he became the guy who had shot himself in the fucking head and survived there.</v>

5089
02:13:49.291 --> 02:13:53.160
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about how he just has a more positive outlook and I'm howling</v>

5090
02:13:53.161 --> 02:13:54.050
<v Speaker 1>listening to it in,</v>

5091
02:13:54.070 --> 02:13:56.970
<v Speaker 1>in the clip and I'm listening to it like,</v>

5092
02:13:57.680 --> 02:13:57.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5093
02:13:57.930 --> 02:14:00.090
<v Speaker 1>two days ago and I'm laughing all over again.</v>

5094
02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Like I forgot that bit ever existed,</v>

5095
02:14:01.801 --> 02:14:02.161
<v Speaker 1>but God,</v>

5096
02:14:02.161 --> 02:14:04.590
<v Speaker 1>this cocksucker made me fucking laugh.</v>

5097
02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:06.450
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about him like he's dead,</v>

5098
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:09.720
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that's how valuable a thing he is.</v>

5099
02:14:09.721 --> 02:14:10.311
<v Speaker 1>Like I can,</v>

5100
02:14:10.311 --> 02:14:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't listen to two radio bits.</v>

5101
02:14:12.510 --> 02:14:13.740
<v Speaker 1>They made a big mistake.</v>

5102
02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I think they made a big steak for a couple reasons.</v>

5103
02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:16.291
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

5104
02:14:16.291 --> 02:14:18.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that they made a big mistake because I think it's,</v>

5105
02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:21.210
<v Speaker 1>it's going to open the door more to the Internet because people are going to</v>

5106
02:14:21.211 --> 02:14:26.211
<v Speaker 1>look at that as the only last remaining true free speech option.</v>

5107
02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

5108
02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what it is.</v>

5109
02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:28.561
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

5110
02:14:28.561 --> 02:14:29.394
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

5111
02:14:29.670 --> 02:14:32.280
<v Speaker 1>you could say you don't like this podcast.</v>

5112
02:14:32.281 --> 02:14:34.020
<v Speaker 1>You can decide that I'm offensive.</v>

5113
02:14:34.021 --> 02:14:34.770
<v Speaker 1>You can do it,</v>

5114
02:14:34.770 --> 02:14:36.330
<v Speaker 1>but you can't stop it.</v>

5115
02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:37.493
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might,</v>

5116
02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:39.000
<v Speaker 1>even though the host might say,</v>

5117
02:14:39.001 --> 02:14:39.960
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to host you anymore,</v>

5118
02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:40.853
<v Speaker 1>I'll find another host.</v>

5119
02:14:41.170 --> 02:14:42.360
<v Speaker 1>You know those sponsors might say,</v>

5120
02:14:42.361 --> 02:14:43.650
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to be your sponsor anymore.</v>

5121
02:14:43.710 --> 02:14:44.311
<v Speaker 1>Well guess what?</v>

5122
02:14:44.311 --> 02:14:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it with no sponsor.</v>

5123
02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.460
<v Speaker 1>We did it with no sponsors for years.</v>

5124
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:52.710
<v Speaker 1>This is the only real option where you're your own producer,</v>

5125
02:14:52.711 --> 02:14:53.790
<v Speaker 1>your own director,</v>

5126
02:14:53.791 --> 02:14:54.624
<v Speaker 1>your own,</v>

5127
02:14:54.810 --> 02:14:55.890
<v Speaker 1>you're the whole thing.</v>

5128
02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:57.030
<v Speaker 1>You're the performer.</v>

5129
02:14:57.031 --> 02:14:57.900
<v Speaker 1>You're the whole thing.</v>

5130
02:14:58.290 --> 02:15:03.290
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's sad because just like a standup is entirely responsible for</v>

5131
02:15:03.481 --> 02:15:04.860
<v Speaker 1>your act that you put on stage.</v>

5132
02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:08.310
<v Speaker 1>If you had some producer hovering over your fucking shoulder every time you</v>

5133
02:15:08.311 --> 02:15:09.144
<v Speaker 1>wrote a bit,</v>

5134
02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:11.490
<v Speaker 1>every time you were thinking about putting together a set list,</v>

5135
02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:13.740
<v Speaker 1>every time you are going up and doing a show,</v>

5136
02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:13.950
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

5137
02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:15.450
<v Speaker 1>they would review it afterwards.</v>

5138
02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:16.860
<v Speaker 1>That would be gross.</v>

5139
02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:19.050
<v Speaker 1>That would take all the fun out of being a comic.</v>

5140
02:15:19.410 --> 02:15:19.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5141
02:15:19.681 --> 02:15:20.491
<v Speaker 1>it would be awful.</v>

5142
02:15:20.491 --> 02:15:20.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5143
02:15:20.701 --> 02:15:24.090
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm a bad collaborator because you're so used to having absolute and</v>

5144
02:15:24.150 --> 02:15:26.670
<v Speaker 1>ultimate control of things.</v>

5145
02:15:26.671 --> 02:15:28.050
<v Speaker 1>So you're a perfect example.</v>

5146
02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Think about you and you as a successful performer and personality.</v>

5147
02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck would have ever thought you could have made a mainstream career out</v>

5148
02:15:37.501 --> 02:15:39.270
<v Speaker 1>of talking about your love of trannies,</v>

5149
02:15:39.450 --> 02:15:44.450
<v Speaker 1>talking about shit and Piss and shit in in each other's mouths and p and on</v>

5150
02:15:44.581 --> 02:15:45.031
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

5151
02:15:45.031 --> 02:15:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Monster Rain.</v>

5152
02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Just look at the honest things that you've tackled and because you're honest,</v>

5153
02:15:50.251 --> 02:15:51.150
<v Speaker 1>because you're funny.</v>

5154
02:15:51.450 --> 02:15:53.940
<v Speaker 1>If you had to vet that through somebody else,</v>

5155
02:15:53.941 --> 02:15:58.500
<v Speaker 1>if you had to have that filter through some sort of a mainstream producer,</v>

5156
02:15:58.770 --> 02:16:00.330
<v Speaker 1>it would've never happened.</v>

5157
02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Never work.</v>

5158
02:16:02.010 --> 02:16:03.330
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right.</v>

5159
02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why you're right.</v>

5160
02:16:04.570 --> 02:16:07.410
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is the last place where at least,</v>

5161
02:16:07.411 --> 02:16:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean for now,</v>

5162
02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:10.140
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows what happens with that?</v>

5163
02:16:10.170 --> 02:16:11.340
<v Speaker 1>But all that stuff you did,</v>

5164
02:16:11.341 --> 02:16:12.300
<v Speaker 1>you did on serious,</v>

5165
02:16:12.301 --> 02:16:14.580
<v Speaker 1>serious had a different approach when they first came out.</v>

5166
02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:19.140
<v Speaker 1>They've slowly but surely clamped down from that Condoleezza Rice incident.</v>

5167
02:16:19.290 --> 02:16:20.123
<v Speaker 1>That's where it was like,</v>

5168
02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

5169
02:16:20.610 --> 02:16:24.420
<v Speaker 1>you could get in trouble for something that someone says on a radio show that</v>

5170
02:16:24.421 --> 02:16:27.420
<v Speaker 1>isn't even like a guest.</v>

5171
02:16:27.570 --> 02:16:28.111
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean,</v>

5172
02:16:28.111 --> 02:16:28.820
<v Speaker 1>isn't even one,</v>

5173
02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:29.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the hosts,</v>

5174
02:16:29.770 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5175
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.420
<v Speaker 3>He was at your show could get canceled.</v>

5176
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:32.290
<v Speaker 3>The homeless guy.</v>

5177
02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:33.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5178
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:36.030
<v Speaker 3>and they were going to fire us that Eric Logan say that was XM wasn't this year.</v>

5179
02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:36.730
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

5180
02:16:36.730 --> 02:16:37.340
<v Speaker 3>and this is how,</v>

5181
02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:37.960
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

5182
02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:39.430
<v Speaker 3>The fucking the NAB,</v>

5183
02:16:39.940 --> 02:16:41.410
<v Speaker 3>the National Association of broadcasters.</v>

5184
02:16:41.430 --> 02:16:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Somebody on that side,</v>

5185
02:16:42.731 --> 02:16:43.780
<v Speaker 3>I think was what was pushing it.</v>

5186
02:16:44.050 --> 02:16:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Could the story went on drudge and Brietbart will this hurt the merger?</v>

5187
02:16:47.860 --> 02:16:48.550
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

5188
02:16:48.550 --> 02:16:50.920
<v Speaker 3>the guys who ran the this when they're about to merge,</v>

5189
02:16:51.250 --> 02:16:53.050
<v Speaker 3>will this injure the merger?</v>

5190
02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:56.860
<v Speaker 3>And man it was $1 billion at stake and it wasn't going to hurt the merger,</v>

5191
02:16:57.130 --> 02:16:58.570
<v Speaker 3>but they fucking panicked.</v>

5192
02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:00.880
<v Speaker 3>And these are all different people that are in charge now.</v>

5193
02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:01.360
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5194
02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:04.870
<v Speaker 3>but they're like well all and they don't know how to deal with stuff.</v>

5195
02:17:04.871 --> 02:17:05.980
<v Speaker 3>So they get the phone call.</v>

5196
02:17:05.981 --> 02:17:08.710
<v Speaker 3>The Guy Nate I think was running XM at the time or coupon narrow.</v>

5197
02:17:09.550 --> 02:17:10.600
<v Speaker 3>What do you think of this thing?</v>

5198
02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:14.460
<v Speaker 3>They said a homeless guy said he wants to rape Condoleezza Rice and felt why?</v>

5199
02:17:14.510 --> 02:17:15.640
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

5200
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:17.850
<v Speaker 3>he's worried about a billion dollar merger and he,</v>

5201
02:17:17.851 --> 02:17:18.191
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

5202
02:17:18.191 --> 02:17:18.610
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not,</v>

5203
02:17:18.610 --> 02:17:20.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not defending them suspending us,</v>

5204
02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:25.480
<v Speaker 3>but I try to put myself in there like the,</v>

5205
02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:26.840
<v Speaker 3>and this is a guy I mentioned Louis,</v>

5206
02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:27.521
<v Speaker 3>cause he's a good,</v>

5207
02:17:27.521 --> 02:17:32.521
<v Speaker 3>he's a good nonemotional reactor to things and he'll look at things and go,</v>

5208
02:17:32.981 --> 02:17:34.750
<v Speaker 3>well they're just trying to do this.</v>

5209
02:17:34.751 --> 02:17:38.380
<v Speaker 3>And like Louie will give you a very logical reason as to why something's</v>

5210
02:17:38.381 --> 02:17:39.214
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

5211
02:17:39.490 --> 02:17:39.851
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

5212
02:17:39.851 --> 02:17:40.061
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5213
02:17:40.061 --> 02:17:41.050
<v Speaker 3>I wish I would've seen that.</v>

5214
02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:43.130
<v Speaker 3>I get too angry and emotional and you're like,</v>

5215
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:43.661
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>

5216
02:17:43.661 --> 02:17:44.410
<v Speaker 3>And they're saying,</v>

5217
02:17:44.410 --> 02:17:45.041
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll go like,</v>

5218
02:17:45.041 --> 02:17:45.311
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

5219
02:17:45.311 --> 02:17:46.720
<v Speaker 3>that's $1 billion company.</v>

5220
02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:47.770
<v Speaker 3>They're not used to this.</v>

5221
02:17:47.771 --> 02:17:52.771
<v Speaker 3>And they hear this guy wants to fucking first lady raped Bush or George Bush and</v>

5222
02:17:52.811 --> 02:17:53.690
<v Speaker 3>they're laughing about it.</v>

5223
02:17:54.130 --> 02:17:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Merger might be threatened to pipe the fuck 'em get rid of him.</v>

5224
02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:57.160
<v Speaker 3>And He'd just panics.</v>

5225
02:17:57.460 --> 02:18:01.030
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it fascinating though that you're talking about a billion dollar company?</v>

5226
02:18:01.150 --> 02:18:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5227
02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Sirius XM billion dollar company.</v>

5228
02:18:04.690 --> 02:18:05.523
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5229
02:18:05.590 --> 02:18:07.300
<v Speaker 3>What exactly are they selling?</v>

5230
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:09.820
<v Speaker 3>What they're selling is content.</v>

5231
02:18:09.850 --> 02:18:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Who delivers that content?</v>

5232
02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Guys like opie and Anthony,</v>

5233
02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:13.600
<v Speaker 3>guys like Jim Norton.</v>

5234
02:18:13.810 --> 02:18:16.900
<v Speaker 3>There's selling your ability to be entertaining.</v>

5235
02:18:17.230 --> 02:18:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>

5236
02:18:18.730 --> 02:18:19.810
<v Speaker 3>it's just music.</v>

5237
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:23.440
<v Speaker 3>How do you have $1 billion company that's just selling music?</v>

5238
02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:23.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5239
02:18:23.930 --> 02:18:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

5240
02:18:24.490 --> 02:18:27.460
<v Speaker 3>that's where my argument would be to it looked the talk thing is the last,</v>

5241
02:18:28.770 --> 02:18:31.180
<v Speaker 3>like the last thing you guys have,</v>

5242
02:18:31.181 --> 02:18:32.014
<v Speaker 3>and this is for any,</v>

5243
02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:33.850
<v Speaker 3>a terrestrial radio to the last thing.</v>

5244
02:18:33.851 --> 02:18:37.330
<v Speaker 3>You have his original talk content and their point back would be,</v>

5245
02:18:37.570 --> 02:18:39.040
<v Speaker 3>well that's a great thing that we have,</v>

5246
02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:40.570
<v Speaker 3>but we also have,</v>

5247
02:18:40.930 --> 02:18:41.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5248
02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:43.060
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a celebrity,</v>

5249
02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:47.140
<v Speaker 3>people doing shit or we have sports that you can't get across.</v>

5250
02:18:47.141 --> 02:18:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Let's say we have the MBA,</v>

5251
02:18:48.041 --> 02:18:48.970
<v Speaker 3>we have a major league baseball,</v>

5252
02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:50.320
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying that's what they would say.</v>

5253
02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5254
02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:51.480
<v Speaker 3>But nobody's paying for that.</v>

5255
02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:52.061
<v Speaker 3>Let's be honest.</v>

5256
02:18:52.061 --> 02:18:54.040
<v Speaker 3>They're paying for stern and they're paying for opiate.</v>

5257
02:18:54.041 --> 02:18:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Anthony.</v>

5258
02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:55.600
<v Speaker 3>I hope so man.</v>

5259
02:18:55.690 --> 02:18:58.540
<v Speaker 4>It's cause you said Spotify and like those like Pandora,</v>

5260
02:18:58.690 --> 02:18:59.141
<v Speaker 4>they used to be,</v>

5261
02:18:59.141 --> 02:19:02.350
<v Speaker 4>I like Sirius radio cause they had like the 30s to forties to 50s,</v>

5262
02:19:02.351 --> 02:19:03.700
<v Speaker 4>whatever and all the different radio stations.</v>

5263
02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:06.550
<v Speaker 4>Now did you just put Spotify put anything you wanted as the,</v>

5264
02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:07.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5265
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.391
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5266
02:19:07.391 --> 02:19:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

5267
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:10.120
<v Speaker 3>I get almost all my shit from iTunes.</v>

5268
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:13.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever listen to music in my car anymore unless it's coming off of my</v>

5269
02:19:13.541 --> 02:19:14.260
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

5270
02:19:14.260 --> 02:19:15.093
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

5271
02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:16.390
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

5272
02:19:16.390 --> 02:19:17.223
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to,</v>

5273
02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:18.191
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to anymore.</v>

5274
02:19:18.191 --> 02:19:19.210
<v Speaker 3>You don't need them anymore.</v>

5275
02:19:19.470 --> 02:19:24.470
<v Speaker 3>And what the last thing that the exciting is things like stern and things like</v>

5276
02:19:24.611 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 3>opion Anthony where you can have a guy who is</v>

5277
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:29.330
<v Speaker 1>just freewheeling,</v>

5278
02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:30.380
<v Speaker 1>same whatever he wants,</v>

5279
02:19:30.381 --> 02:19:32.000
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to worry about language restrictions,</v>

5280
02:19:32.001 --> 02:19:35.600
<v Speaker 1>does it have to worry about anything and the fact that he can get fired for</v>

5281
02:19:35.601 --> 02:19:39.020
<v Speaker 1>saying the same things that he's always said on his show,</v>

5282
02:19:39.470 --> 02:19:42.710
<v Speaker 1>the sang them in a text message that they're so ignorant that they can't</v>

5283
02:19:42.711 --> 02:19:43.970
<v Speaker 1>recognize that this is,</v>

5284
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you're taking it out of context.</v>

5285
02:19:45.681 --> 02:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>You're taking it from a guy who has just recently been assaulted.</v>

5286
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:49.550
<v Speaker 1>You're taking it from a guy,</v>

5287
02:19:49.551 --> 02:19:53.150
<v Speaker 1>probably had a couple of drinks and then when he said it and he shouldn't have</v>

5288
02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:53.630
<v Speaker 1>done it,</v>

5289
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:54.463
<v Speaker 1>he fucked up.</v>

5290
02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:56.390
<v Speaker 1>He definitely shouldn't have gone on that Twitter rampage.</v>

5291
02:19:56.580 --> 02:19:57.620
<v Speaker 1>He should have said it on a video</v>

5292
02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:59.830
<v Speaker 5>and you know what podcast or I'm the show,</v>

5293
02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.080
<v Speaker 5>the show on the show.</v>

5294
02:20:02.081 --> 02:20:03.000
<v Speaker 5>It would have been perfect,</v>

5295
02:20:03.130 --> 02:20:04.620
<v Speaker 5>but have been a great episode.</v>

5296
02:20:04.621 --> 02:20:05.640
<v Speaker 5>All of that would have been fun.</v>

5297
02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:05.771
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5298
02:20:05.771 --> 02:20:07.140
<v Speaker 5>and Keith Robinson pointed out,</v>

5299
02:20:07.141 --> 02:20:08.250
<v Speaker 5>he's like the teasing.</v>

5300
02:20:08.251 --> 02:20:09.800
<v Speaker 5>We could've given him a,</v>

5301
02:20:09.850 --> 02:20:11.350
<v Speaker 5>the teasing.</v>

5302
02:20:11.370 --> 02:20:12.180
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful.</v>

5303
02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:12.470
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

5304
02:20:12.470 --> 02:20:14.880
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if that's something that will ever change.</v>

5305
02:20:14.881 --> 02:20:16.710
<v Speaker 5>Like they may at one point,</v>

5306
02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:19.500
<v Speaker 5>we do kind of understand that maybe he's,</v>

5307
02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:19.801
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5308
02:20:19.801 --> 02:20:21.450
<v Speaker 5>he's a valuable asset to the like,</v>

5309
02:20:21.451 --> 02:20:21.661
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5310
02:20:21.661 --> 02:20:21.990
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

5311
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

5312
02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:25.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why I don't get that feeling cause they haven't said to me we'll</v>

5313
02:20:25.531 --> 02:20:26.290
<v Speaker 5>bring him back.</v>

5314
02:20:26.290 --> 02:20:27.123
<v Speaker 5>They really haven't.</v>

5315
02:20:27.390 --> 02:20:28.530
<v Speaker 5>And I never want to give fans,</v>

5316
02:20:28.531 --> 02:20:30.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to keep fans from Caribou.</v>

5317
02:20:30.780 --> 02:20:32.130
<v Speaker 5>It literally is just a feeling,</v>

5318
02:20:32.131 --> 02:20:33.150
<v Speaker 5>a gut feeling.</v>

5319
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:34.860
<v Speaker 5>He didn't drop any bombs.</v>

5320
02:20:34.861 --> 02:20:35.760
<v Speaker 5>He didn't go on this.</v>

5321
02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:39.880
<v Speaker 5>And I've talked to him enough to know what his intent was and maybe I'm just</v>

5322
02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:40.980
<v Speaker 5>naive dummy in me,</v>

5323
02:20:40.981 --> 02:20:41.701
<v Speaker 5>but I keep thinking,</v>

5324
02:20:41.701 --> 02:20:41.881
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

5325
02:20:41.881 --> 02:20:42.870
<v Speaker 5>he should come back.</v>

5326
02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:44.280
<v Speaker 5>He can come back.</v>

5327
02:20:44.281 --> 02:20:45.300
<v Speaker 5>Just give it some time.</v>

5328
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:46.650
<v Speaker 5>I just keep hoping for that.</v>

5329
02:20:47.170 --> 02:20:47.801
<v Speaker 1>You can come back.</v>

5330
02:20:47.801 --> 02:20:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I think if they gave it some time,</v>

5331
02:20:48.941 --> 02:20:51.280
<v Speaker 1>he definitely can come back in the context of what he said.</v>

5332
02:20:51.310 --> 02:20:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5333
02:20:51.450 --> 02:20:52.330
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that bad.</v>

5334
02:20:53.350 --> 02:20:53.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5335
02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have been happy if it was my company and I had shareholders and all</v>

5336
02:20:57.491 --> 02:20:57.881
<v Speaker 1>that jazz,</v>

5337
02:20:57.881 --> 02:21:00.460
<v Speaker 1>but I obviously I would never be that guy anyway.</v>

5338
02:21:00.461 --> 02:21:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I would never be a fucking head of a big company.</v>

5339
02:21:03.461 --> 02:21:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not built for it.</v>

5340
02:21:04.541 --> 02:21:08.320
<v Speaker 1>But you got to recognize the entertainment quality,</v>

5341
02:21:08.470 --> 02:21:10.720
<v Speaker 1>you know the entertainment aspect of that guy,</v>

5342
02:21:10.721 --> 02:21:13.480
<v Speaker 1>the head of the entertainment possibilities of keeping the show together.</v>

5343
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:14.500
<v Speaker 1>It's because without that,</v>

5344
02:21:14.530 --> 02:21:15.520
<v Speaker 1>all you have is stern.</v>

5345
02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:16.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5346
02:21:16.330 --> 02:21:18.910
<v Speaker 1>you mean obviously you guys are still together and they'll still be a great</v>

5347
02:21:18.911 --> 02:21:19.211
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

5348
02:21:19.211 --> 02:21:20.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same show.</v>

5349
02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:20.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5350
02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:21.813
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

5351
02:21:22.060 --> 02:21:23.230
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

5352
02:21:23.231 --> 02:21:25.630
<v Speaker 1>you leave open the door for Anthony's starting his own thing,</v>

5353
02:21:25.631 --> 02:21:27.010
<v Speaker 1>some wildly successful thing.</v>

5354
02:21:27.010 --> 02:21:27.843
<v Speaker 1>And the Internet,</v>

5355
02:21:27.850 --> 02:21:29.320
<v Speaker 1>which also look,</v>

5356
02:21:29.321 --> 02:21:32.620
<v Speaker 1>if someone comes along and they put together some sort of an advertising budget</v>

5357
02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:33.221

<v Speaker 3>It's going to be great being a how it is man.</v>

5484
02:24:19.350 --> 02:24:19.530
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5485
02:24:19.530 --> 02:24:21.100
<v Speaker 3>I the fucking like,</v>

5486
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:22.290
<v Speaker 3>I know intellectually,</v>

5487
02:24:22.291 --> 02:24:22.411
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5488
02:24:22.411 --> 02:24:23.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm a funny guy and I think it's,</v>

5489
02:24:24.030 --> 02:24:25.560
<v Speaker 3>there's things that will be fixed in the show.</v>

5490
02:24:25.561 --> 02:24:26.251
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

5491
02:24:26.251 --> 02:24:26.671
<v Speaker 3>cause again,</v>

5492
02:24:26.671 --> 02:24:28.140
<v Speaker 3>it's a new thing.</v>

5493
02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:30.030
<v Speaker 3>But I also think like it came out funny,</v>

5494
02:24:30.031 --> 02:24:31.290
<v Speaker 3>like I'm happy with how it came out.</v>

5495
02:24:31.291 --> 02:24:32.670
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of really funny lines.</v>

5496
02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:35.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh cow would fix this and fix that and you live in your learn.</v>

5497
02:24:35.730 --> 02:24:36.690
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be great,</v>

5498
02:24:36.930 --> 02:24:39.600
<v Speaker 3>but I know that that part of you that's never happy,</v>

5499
02:24:39.601 --> 02:24:41.070
<v Speaker 3>always going to have issues about things.</v>

5500
02:24:41.071 --> 02:24:43.860
<v Speaker 3>That's also what makes you good because it keeps you,</v>

5501
02:24:43.861 --> 02:24:48.240
<v Speaker 3>keeps you like checking and second guessing and working on things and keeps you</v>

5502
02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:49.860
<v Speaker 3>striving for a high standard.</v>

5503
02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:50.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

5504
02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:51.491
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

5505
02:24:51.491 --> 02:24:55.740
<v Speaker 3>the dark inner secret of all comedians that were never really happy with what we</v>

5506
02:24:55.741 --> 02:24:56.070
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

5507
02:24:56.070 --> 02:24:57.930
<v Speaker 3>I obsess like that prom all,</v>

5508
02:24:57.940 --> 02:24:58.430
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5509
02:24:58.430 --> 02:25:00.390
<v Speaker 3>I was out in the parking lot with my luggage,</v>

5510
02:25:00.750 --> 02:25:02.400
<v Speaker 3>talking to my fucking manager on the phone.</v>

5511
02:25:02.401 --> 02:25:02.611
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5512
02:25:02.611 --> 02:25:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why they're there.</v>

5513
02:25:03.850 --> 02:25:05.010
<v Speaker 3>The no one's gonna like that one.</v>

5514
02:25:05.011 --> 02:25:05.281
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

5515
02:25:05.281 --> 02:25:05.611
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

5516
02:25:05.611 --> 02:25:07.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a fucking panic attack.</v>

5517
02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:09.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's moments like that though,</v>

5518
02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:12.690
<v Speaker 3>if they'd say Tarantino would fight all his editor who passed away,</v>

5519
02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:16.830
<v Speaker 3>but they said that she was such a big piece of his great success because she was</v>

5520
02:25:16.831 --> 02:25:21.150
<v Speaker 3>so good at editing his stuff and I heard they would have screaming matches</v>

5521
02:25:21.151 --> 02:25:22.230
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

5522
02:25:22.231 --> 02:25:23.950
<v Speaker 3>or she didn't agree with her,</v>

5523
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:29.160
<v Speaker 5>but she in a detached way could see what worked from the outside and I certainly</v>

5524
02:25:29.291 --> 02:25:30.400
<v Speaker 5>didn't have a yelling match with anyone,</v>

5525
02:25:30.401 --> 02:25:34.900
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of times I'm too close to it to see what works and I would have been</v>

5526
02:25:34.901 --> 02:25:39.100
<v Speaker 5>totally wrong about this and I would have thrown that promo out and not used it</v>

5527
02:25:39.250 --> 02:25:40.630
<v Speaker 5>because I am mostly in it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5529

5560
02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:23.690
<v Speaker 5>I jerk off looking@eros.com for nine hours.</v>

5561
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:26.180
<v Speaker 5>I do a spot at the cellar and I get a massage.</v>

5562
02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:26.301
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

5570
02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:34.850
<v Speaker 5>I think about while I'm doing it,</v>

5571
02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:36.860
<v Speaker 5>while I'm tugging my Prek,</v>

5572
02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:39.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking this could be your green screen fixed,</v>

5573
02:26:39.530 --> 02:26:39.861
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

5578
02:26:42.171 --> 02:26:43.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm just real lucky that I found out a</v>

5579
02:26:43.770 --> 02:26:45.270
<v Speaker 1>bunch of things that I like doing.</v>

5580
02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:46.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5581
02:26:46.290 --> 02:26:47.820
<v Speaker 1>all the things that I'm interested in,</v>

5582
02:26:47.821 --> 02:26:49.440
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the links that I put up on Twitter,</v>

5583
02:26:49.441 --> 02:26:50.221
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the articles,</v>

5584
02:26:50.221 --> 02:26:50.641
<v Speaker 1>I read,</v>

5585
02:26:50.641 --> 02:26:51.241
<v Speaker 1>documentaries,</v>

5586
02:26:51.241 --> 02:26:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I watched martial arts,</v>

5587
02:26:52.441 --> 02:26:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I do whatever I'm doing,</v>

5588
02:26:54.001 --> 02:26:54.960
<v Speaker 1>bow hunting,</v>

5589
02:26:55.770 --> 02:26:56.640
<v Speaker 1>whatever I'm doing,</v>

5590
02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in it.</v>

5591
02:26:57.780 --> 02:26:58.201
<v Speaker 1>So I'll just,</v>

5592
02:26:58.201 --> 02:26:59.160
<v Speaker 1>things I'm interested in.</v>

5593
02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that's like a big part of what life would keeps life fun.</v>

5594
02:27:02.370 --> 02:27:05.130
<v Speaker 1>It just be interested in a bunch of different things and pursue those things</v>

5595
02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:06.780
<v Speaker 1>with most people.</v>

5596
02:27:06.900 --> 02:27:10.590
<v Speaker 1>You can't pursue your real interest because you have a job that's usually not</v>

5597
02:27:10.591 --> 02:27:11.424
<v Speaker 1>your real interest.</v>

5598
02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I've been there too when I was doing fear factor and I'm no,</v>

5599
02:27:14.371 --> 02:27:14.641
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5600
02:27:14.641 --> 02:27:15.271
<v Speaker 1>woe is me.</v>

5601
02:27:15.271 --> 02:27:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It was a great gig.</v>

5602
02:27:16.350 --> 02:27:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Paid a lot of money's a lot of exposure and all that good stuff,</v>

5603
02:27:18.961 --> 02:27:19.980
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to do it.</v>

5604
02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I only did it because they wanted to pay me.</v>

5605
02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:22.231
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5606
02:27:22.231 --> 02:27:22.710
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

5607
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:26.130
<v Speaker 1>And there's a big difference between living like that and living like I live</v>

5608
02:27:26.131 --> 02:27:26.670
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

5609
02:27:26.670 --> 02:27:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Whereas everything I do,</v>

5610
02:27:27.841 --> 02:27:28.591
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy doing.</v>

5611
02:27:28.591 --> 02:27:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Whether I do the UFC or whether I do a podcast or stand up or anything,</v>

5612
02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy all my things.</v>

5613
02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:36.180
<v Speaker 1>So in that way,</v>

5614
02:27:36.181 --> 02:27:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I figured out a way to harmoniously manage my life.</v>

5615
02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:40.680
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to not hate it.</v>

5616
02:27:40.681 --> 02:27:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5617
02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:42.180
<v Speaker 1>It's fantastic.</v>

5618
02:27:42.181 --> 02:27:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

5619
02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:43.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5620
02:27:43.081 --> 02:27:45.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I love everything I do and there's always,</v>

5621
02:27:45.750 --> 02:27:45.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5622
02:27:45.991 --> 02:27:50.190
<v Speaker 1>even with podcasters podcast that don't go well or I don't like moments in them</v>

5623
02:27:50.191 --> 02:27:52.090
<v Speaker 1>and those they will fuck with me and,</v>

5624
02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:52.830
<v Speaker 1>and I'll try to,</v>

5625
02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:56.100
<v Speaker 1>but they fuck with me because I care because I'm trying to make it better.</v>

5626
02:27:56.101 --> 02:27:56.461
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

5627
02:27:56.461 --> 02:27:57.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying,</v>

5628
02:27:57.270 --> 02:27:58.800
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing anything where it's,</v>

5629
02:27:59.070 --> 02:28:01.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a flowing sort of living thing,</v>

5630
02:28:01.681 --> 02:28:05.280
<v Speaker 1>you're ad libbing and maybe I added too much or maybe I didn't add enough or</v>

5631
02:28:05.281 --> 02:28:07.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe I was too low energy or maybe are too high energy.</v>

5632
02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:08.270
<v Speaker 1>This Matt,</v>

5633
02:28:08.270 --> 02:28:08.491
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

5634
02:28:08.491 --> 02:28:08.911
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

5635
02:28:08.911 --> 02:28:13.440
<v Speaker 1>it's just because you care and if you care and if you're constantly trying to</v>

5636
02:28:13.441 --> 02:28:18.120
<v Speaker 1>improve things and you're also taking chances and you're also trying to innovate</v>

5637
02:28:18.121 --> 02:28:18.954
<v Speaker 1>and trying to,</v>

5638
02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5639
02:28:19.650 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 1>trying to be as loose and open as possible.</v>

5640
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:23.990
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be things that don't go great.</v>

5641
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:24.471
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5642
02:28:24.471 --> 02:28:25.730
<v Speaker 1>And you have to kind of,</v>

5643
02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:26.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5644
02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you have to kind of leave the flaws in sometime.</v>

5645
02:28:29.470 --> 02:28:29.770
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

5646
02:28:29.770 --> 02:28:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5647
02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:33.620
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I love so much about Mike Douglas,</v>

5648
02:28:33.621 --> 02:28:34.130
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

5649
02:28:34.130 --> 02:28:35.570
<v Speaker 1>it was such an imperfect thing.</v>

5650
02:28:35.571 --> 02:28:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Those shows he's going to be in the Jackson five one time.</v>

5651
02:28:38.270 --> 02:28:39.103
<v Speaker 1>And it was all of them.</v>

5652
02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:42.830
<v Speaker 1>It was just a very slow interview because they were kids at the time and he said</v>

5653
02:28:42.831 --> 02:28:43.281
<v Speaker 1>to one of them,</v>

5654
02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:43.431
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

5655
02:28:43.431 --> 02:28:45.140
<v Speaker 1>so I understand you're the prankster.</v>

5656
02:28:45.470 --> 02:28:45.921
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

5657
02:28:45.921 --> 02:28:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Yanik playing pranks.</v>

5658
02:28:47.810 --> 02:28:48.643
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

5659
02:28:48.830 --> 02:28:50.690
<v Speaker 1>it was such a fucking shit moment,</v>

5660
02:28:51.170 --> 02:28:55.070
<v Speaker 1>but I love the fact that it was real and they left it in and they didn't fuck</v>

5661
02:28:55.071 --> 02:28:55.371
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

5662
02:28:55.371 --> 02:28:59.330
<v Speaker 1>And nowadays they would go back and they would chop that out to him.</v>

5663
02:28:59.331 --> 02:29:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Gallen Prank cry.</v>

5664
02:29:00.351 --> 02:29:00.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5665
02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm Pragar right back.</v>

5666
02:29:01.970 --> 02:29:04.010
<v Speaker 1>And it would be jazzed up and fixed.</v>

5667
02:29:04.460 --> 02:29:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And in that moment it was kind of like just this is what it is.</v>

5668
02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:10.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural flow.</v>

5669
02:29:10.610 --> 02:29:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Great moments,</v>

5670
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.980
<v Speaker 1>slow moments,</v>

5671
02:29:12.981 --> 02:29:14.420
<v Speaker 1>but they're all real moments.</v>

5672
02:29:14.421 --> 02:29:16.310
<v Speaker 1>And I kind of like what you're saying,</v>

5673
02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:19.250
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be little things that bother you because they're real moments</v>

5674
02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:22.100
<v Speaker 1>and there are a lot of little things that bother you because you care because</v>

5675
02:29:22.101 --> 02:29:22.730
<v Speaker 1>you want to make it,</v>

5676
02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:23.990
<v Speaker 1>you want it to be great.</v>

5677
02:29:23.991 --> 02:29:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm way better at doing podcasts now than it was when I first started doing</v>

5678
02:29:27.801 --> 02:29:29.240
<v Speaker 1>it will bother you in a podcast.</v>

5679
02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:29.491
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

5680
02:29:29.491 --> 02:29:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not saying for like who did a bad one,</v>

5681
02:29:31.730 --> 02:29:33.740
<v Speaker 1>but like what will be a podcast thing that you're like,</v>

5682
02:29:33.741 --> 02:29:34.281
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

5683
02:29:34.281 --> 02:29:35.390
<v Speaker 1>that was a bad episode.</v>

5684
02:29:35.391 --> 02:29:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Will be the other person didn't talk or you didn't get out of them what you</v>

5685
02:29:38.601 --> 02:29:39.230
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>

5686
02:29:39.230 --> 02:29:41.390
<v Speaker 1>It could be a mistake having them on the first place.</v>

5687
02:29:41.450 --> 02:29:42.220
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

5688
02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:42.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5689
02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:44.600
<v Speaker 1>they're born as interesting as I thought they were going to be.</v>

5690
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Or we don't see eye to eye on things and he gets weird,</v>

5691
02:29:47.751 --> 02:29:48.740
<v Speaker 1>which is sometimes fun.</v>

5692
02:29:49.150 --> 02:29:49.930
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

5693
02:29:49.930 --> 02:29:50.810
<v Speaker 1>sometimes some,</v>

5694
02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:51.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5695
02:29:51.321 --> 02:29:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I've one of my favorite ones,</v>

5696
02:29:53.380 --> 02:29:54.260
<v Speaker 1>that skeptic guy,</v>

5697
02:29:54.261 --> 02:29:54.831
<v Speaker 1>Brian Dining,</v>

5698
02:29:54.831 --> 02:29:57.350
<v Speaker 1>just cause it was so ridiculously off.</v>

5699
02:29:57.770 --> 02:29:58.790
<v Speaker 1>It was so off.</v>

5700
02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's such a goofy guy.</v>

5701
02:30:00.511 --> 02:30:01.850
<v Speaker 1>He was so fucked in the head.</v>

5702
02:30:01.851 --> 02:30:02.390
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

5703
02:30:02.390 --> 02:30:06.230
<v Speaker 1>it's just his mind was just so like he would go,</v>

5704
02:30:06.350 --> 02:30:07.240
<v Speaker 1>he would think he was gonna.</v>

5705
02:30:07.250 --> 02:30:12.190
<v Speaker 1>He had a long road ahead of him and he was just kept going off cliffs and Woo</v>

5706
02:30:12.190 --> 02:30:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Hoo.</v>

5707
02:30:12.210 --> 02:30:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Just something wrong with the way the guy thinks,</v>

5708
02:30:14.660 --> 02:30:19.660
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you'll have a podcast and the guy's just not interesting and I</v>

5709
02:30:19.881 --> 02:30:20.960
<v Speaker 1>just don't connect with them.</v>

5710
02:30:21.260 --> 02:30:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's me.</v>

5711
02:30:22.221 --> 02:30:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm just low energy.</v>

5712
02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I've had podcasts where I just,</v>

5713
02:30:25.881 --> 02:30:26.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5714
02:30:26.181 --> 02:30:27.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe I was just too exhausted.</v>

5715
02:30:27.790 --> 02:30:29.390
<v Speaker 1>They had been doing too many things.</v>

5716
02:30:29.391 --> 02:30:30.440
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely,</v>

5717
02:30:30.890 --> 02:30:33.920
<v Speaker 1>you have to always manage your energy and if you're doing too many different</v>

5718
02:30:33.921 --> 02:30:35.090
<v Speaker 1>things at the same time,</v>

5719
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:36.620
<v Speaker 1>like I do a lot of different things.</v>

5720
02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:37.610
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

5721
02:30:37.610 --> 02:30:40.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of making sure that you have enough.</v>

5722
02:30:40.910 --> 02:30:41.743
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever go back,</v>

5723
02:30:41.930 --> 02:30:42.890
<v Speaker 1>because one of the guys I interviewed,</v>

5724
02:30:42.891 --> 02:30:46.850
<v Speaker 1>one of the episodes is freeway Rick and I know you and he's fucking fascinating.</v>

5725
02:30:46.851 --> 02:30:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

5726
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.930
<v Speaker 1>But all I think is,</v>

5727
02:30:47.930 --> 02:30:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I should have asked him this.</v>

5728
02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I should.</v>

5729
02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:52.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's never enough time to ask everything you want to ask.</v>

5730
02:30:52.950 --> 02:30:53.960
<v Speaker 1>If you ask good questions,</v>

5731
02:30:53.961 --> 02:30:54.561
<v Speaker 1>you're like fuck,</v>

5732
02:30:54.561 --> 02:30:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I had to do was that one and that one and that one and I missed it.</v>

5733
02:30:56.661 --> 02:30:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I missed it.</v>

5734
02:30:57.440 --> 02:30:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I did two podcasts with them,</v>

5735
02:30:58.761 --> 02:31:01.040
<v Speaker 1>so I did like six hours where they're talking to him.</v>

5736
02:31:01.490 --> 02:31:01.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5737
02:31:01.791 --> 02:31:01.931
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

5738
02:31:01.931 --> 02:31:02.810
<v Speaker 1>the first one though,</v>

5739
02:31:02.811 --> 02:31:06.350
<v Speaker 1>I think we really got to the heart of everything because it was three hours long</v>

5740
02:31:06.351 --> 02:31:06.711
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

5741
02:31:06.711 --> 02:31:07.970
<v Speaker 1>he told everything,</v>

5742
02:31:07.971 --> 02:31:12.320
<v Speaker 1>the whole CIA connection to the Iran Contra affair.</v>

5743
02:31:12.321 --> 02:31:15.650
<v Speaker 1>And notice I said Contra corner that cause I know how to speak.</v>

5744
02:31:15.651 --> 02:31:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm very eloquent.</v>

5745
02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:18.493
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>

5746
02:31:18.600 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>he was a fascinating guy and</v>

5747
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:21.060
<v Speaker 3>a very positive guy,</v>

5748
02:31:21.061 --> 02:31:21.691
<v Speaker 3>man for God.</v>

5749
02:31:21.691 --> 02:31:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I spent that much time in jail and yeah,</v>

5750
02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:28.760
<v Speaker 3>very peaceful and very interesting dude and really earnestly working to help</v>

5751
02:31:29.821 --> 02:31:31.800
<v Speaker 3>people not make the same mistakes that he made.</v>

5752
02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:34.200
<v Speaker 3>He said he was a nice man.</v>

5753
02:31:34.250 --> 02:31:34.610
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5754
02:31:34.610 --> 02:31:39.420
<v Speaker 3>And so it was hard to me to picture that guy in the,</v>

5755
02:31:39.421 --> 02:31:40.254
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5756
02:31:40.290 --> 02:31:41.850
<v Speaker 3>in the role of kingpin.</v>

5757
02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:43.500
<v Speaker 3>And then as we were,</v>

5758
02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:45.900
<v Speaker 3>we were editing and we weren't chopping content on this one.</v>

5759
02:31:45.901 --> 02:31:49.050
<v Speaker 3>It was just camera angles because of the way that I demanded the audience be set</v>

5760
02:31:49.051 --> 02:31:49.530
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

5761
02:31:49.530 --> 02:31:50.460
<v Speaker 3>You know you have to,</v>

5762
02:31:50.490 --> 02:31:53.070
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't just get a two shot because I didn't know that because I'm a fucking</v>

5763
02:31:53.071 --> 02:31:53.904
<v Speaker 3>now this cunt.</v>

5764
02:31:53.970 --> 02:31:57.090
<v Speaker 3>So we had to just fix a couple of camera angles and there's a couple of moments</v>

5765
02:31:57.091 --> 02:31:57.871
<v Speaker 3>for Rick's talking.</v>

5766
02:31:57.871 --> 02:32:00.000
<v Speaker 3>I just saw his face and he was being pleasant,</v>

5767
02:32:00.450 --> 02:32:01.080
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

5768
02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:05.520
<v Speaker 3>oh that's the guy who the king pin,</v>

5769
02:32:05.580 --> 02:32:06.413
<v Speaker 3>that's the guy.</v>

5770
02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:06.900
<v Speaker 3>And then that,</v>

5771
02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:07.980
<v Speaker 3>and then in those moments,</v>

5772
02:32:08.010 --> 02:32:09.570
<v Speaker 3>I actually told the editor a couple of times,</v>

5773
02:32:09.571 --> 02:32:12.990
<v Speaker 3>rewind that and [inaudible] on his face and he was just listening and he wasn't</v>

5774
02:32:12.991 --> 02:32:13.800
<v Speaker 3>angry,</v>

5775
02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:16.350
<v Speaker 3>but I saw in that moment that face,</v>

5776
02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:16.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5777
02:32:16.650 --> 02:32:19.260
<v Speaker 3>that's the guy that fucking gave the order like in that,</v>

5778
02:32:19.290 --> 02:32:19.741
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

5779
02:32:19.741 --> 02:32:22.140
<v Speaker 3>Like this nice pleasant man is who he really is.</v>

5780
02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:23.850
<v Speaker 3>But you can't be this nice,</v>

5781
02:32:23.851 --> 02:32:28.320
<v Speaker 3>pleasant man and fucking make $900 million selling cocaine.</v>

5782
02:32:28.321 --> 02:32:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it crazy how much you made?</v>

5783
02:32:29.611 --> 02:32:31.110
<v Speaker 3>He made $900 million.</v>

5784
02:32:31.140 --> 02:32:31.973
<v Speaker 3>You can't do it.</v>

5785
02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:33.840
<v Speaker 3>You can't be Mr. Nice Guy.</v>

5786
02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:38.070
<v Speaker 3>You can't operate with the bloods and the crips together and be a nice fucking</v>

5787
02:32:38.071 --> 02:32:39.120
<v Speaker 3>fellow all the time.</v>

5788
02:32:39.121 --> 02:32:40.550
<v Speaker 3>There has to be that other part of you.</v>

5789
02:32:40.650 --> 02:32:42.210
<v Speaker 3>I hope he's making money now.</v>

5790
02:32:42.300 --> 02:32:43.470
<v Speaker 3>I hope he's doing well.</v>

5791
02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:48.500
<v Speaker 3>You know how hard must it be when you've made $900 million selling drugs to not</v>

5792
02:32:48.871 --> 02:32:50.100
<v Speaker 3>go back to selling drugs?</v>

5793
02:32:50.310 --> 02:32:51.000
<v Speaker 3>So not go,</v>

5794
02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.580
<v Speaker 3>I got to figure out a way to do this and not get caught.</v>

5795
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:55.580
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it is that I should again,</v>

5796
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:57.480
<v Speaker 3>I should have asked him that but I wonder is also,</v>

5797
02:32:57.481 --> 02:32:59.670
<v Speaker 3>is it cause he got life without parole learn,</v>

5798
02:32:59.671 --> 02:33:00.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5799
02:33:00.060 --> 02:33:01.140
<v Speaker 3>learn to read and now he's out.</v>

5800
02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:02.213
<v Speaker 3>So is it,</v>

5801
02:33:02.250 --> 02:33:05.340
<v Speaker 3>is that overpowered by the fucking fact that you like you know what,</v>

5802
02:33:05.341 --> 02:33:06.780
<v Speaker 3>I can fuck a woman if I want to.</v>

5803
02:33:07.160 --> 02:33:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I can go get a piece of pizza if I want to.</v>

5804
02:33:09.121 --> 02:33:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Like this is the gratitude for being out override the loss of material stuff.</v>

5805
02:33:13.890 --> 02:33:15.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh I'm sure it does.</v>

5806
02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:16.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it does.</v>

5807
02:33:16.410 --> 02:33:18.750
<v Speaker 3>Cause the loss of material stuff was already out the window anyway.</v>

5808
02:33:18.751 --> 02:33:20.280
<v Speaker 3>He was in jail and I,</v>

5809
02:33:20.310 --> 02:33:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

5810
02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:21.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he,</v>

5811
02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:21.781
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5812
02:33:21.781 --> 02:33:23.430
<v Speaker 3>he's also a changed person,</v>

5813
02:33:23.610 --> 02:33:25.650
<v Speaker 3>like a real legitimately changed person,</v>

5814
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:26.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5815
02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:30.030
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that he didn't even know how to read before he got into jail and</v>

5816
02:33:30.031 --> 02:33:30.990
<v Speaker 3>then he got to jail,</v>

5817
02:33:30.991 --> 02:33:35.130
<v Speaker 3>learned how to read and then found the legal flaws in the argument against him.</v>

5818
02:33:35.130 --> 02:33:36.270
<v Speaker 3>And that's what got him released.</v>

5819
02:33:36.271 --> 02:33:36.451
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5820
02:33:36.451 --> 02:33:37.290
<v Speaker 3>that's incredible.</v>

5821
02:33:37.470 --> 02:33:38.610
<v Speaker 3>What happened was lawyers,</v>

5822
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:43.260
<v Speaker 3>how many like these be paying lawyers all that money and they don't catch the</v>

5823
02:33:43.261 --> 02:33:43.531
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

5824
02:33:43.531 --> 02:33:43.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5825
02:33:43.801 --> 02:33:44.910
<v Speaker 3>it was a three strikes,</v>

5826
02:33:44.911 --> 02:33:46.060
<v Speaker 3>you're out law thing.</v>

5827
02:33:46.390 --> 02:33:47.520
<v Speaker 3>It was a double jeopardy thing.</v>

5828
02:33:48.030 --> 02:33:48.241
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5829
02:33:48.241 --> 02:33:50.430
<v Speaker 3>They counted one of them was two strikes but was only you,</v>

5830
02:33:50.510 --> 02:33:51.620
<v Speaker 3>it was the same thing twice or something.</v>

5831
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:53.430
<v Speaker 3>Something along those lines.</v>

5832
02:33:53.470 --> 02:33:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5833
02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:54.540
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>

5834
02:33:54.540 --> 02:33:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I know he doesn't want to be that guy anymore,</v>

5835
02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:58.800
<v Speaker 3>which is why he doesn't sell drugs anymore.</v>

5836
02:33:59.100 --> 02:33:59.401
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

5837
02:33:59.401 --> 02:33:59.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5838
02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:03.870
<v Speaker 3>that's gotta be a weird thing to go from like Mc Hammer style from having</v>

5839
02:34:03.871 --> 02:34:06.660
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions of dollars to how do I pay my bills?</v>

5840
02:34:07.050 --> 02:34:07.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5841
02:34:07.321 --> 02:34:08.700
<v Speaker 3>And what do I do from here?</v>

5842
02:34:08.830 --> 02:34:10.990
<v Speaker 3>I bigger than MCM or really what's that?</v>

5843
02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Even bigger.</v>

5844
02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:12.091
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5845
02:34:12.091 --> 02:34:13.410
<v Speaker 3>Cause MC hammer didn't go to,</v>

5846
02:34:13.530 --> 02:34:15.870
<v Speaker 3>although I think it would mc hammer went through was harder because he didn't go</v>

5847
02:34:15.871 --> 02:34:17.010
<v Speaker 3>to prison for 20 years.</v>

5848
02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:19.930
<v Speaker 3>He's have a 20 year cooling off period with no women.</v>

5849
02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Like you know Mc Hammer just went from fucking from a private plane with 30</v>

5850
02:34:24.521 --> 02:34:27.070
<v Speaker 3>people to what the fuck do I do now?</v>

5851
02:34:27.071 --> 02:34:30.160
<v Speaker 3>I owe tax money and nothing that he did it on the outside.</v>

5852
02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Rick Ross had a lot of years of like this sucks to kind of get his life</v>

5853
02:34:34.271 --> 02:34:35.410
<v Speaker 3>and then then be grateful.</v>

5854
02:34:35.470 --> 02:34:37.480
<v Speaker 3>What does it Galaxy Mc Hammer do for money?</v>

5855
02:34:37.570 --> 02:34:38.403
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5856
02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:39.430
<v Speaker 3>With Google,</v>

5857
02:34:39.430 --> 02:34:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5858
02:34:40.030 --> 02:34:40.801
<v Speaker 3>What do I mean what?</v>

5859
02:34:40.801 --> 02:34:43.900
<v Speaker 3>What would you do if you were a guy like mc hammer and all of a sudden the</v>

5860
02:34:43.901 --> 02:34:45.070
<v Speaker 3>fucking the Gig is up.</v>

5861
02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:47.100
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even do the religious thing for awhile.</v>

5862
02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:48.573
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5863
02:34:48.580 --> 02:34:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Going to be a pastor of a church or something like that.</v>

5864
02:34:50.741 --> 02:34:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5865
02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:54.400
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's got a block of money that way or something.</v>

5866
02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:57.790
<v Speaker 3>It's got a blog but he hasn't updated it since 2013 November.</v>

5867
02:34:57.850 --> 02:35:00.640
<v Speaker 3>That's not good for blogging on the surreal life.</v>

5868
02:35:00.730 --> 02:35:00.971
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5869
02:35:00.971 --> 02:35:01.804
<v Speaker 3>was he really?</v>

5870
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:03.063
<v Speaker 3>Three,</v>

5871
02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:04.360
<v Speaker 3>he was managing,</v>

5872
02:35:04.580 --> 02:35:05.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5873
02:35:05.050 --> 02:35:06.540
<v Speaker 3>martial artists for a while.</v>

5874
02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:10.990
<v Speaker 3>He had some company that he was managing martial artists.</v>

5875
02:35:11.230 --> 02:35:13.540
<v Speaker 3>What's it think it was called in Alchemy or something like that?</v>

5876
02:35:14.730 --> 02:35:15.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5877
02:35:15.130 --> 02:35:16.420
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't trust him with my money.</v>

5878
02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5879
02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:22.120
<v Speaker 3>If you go through fucking 30 million and I get broke or whatever the amount was,</v>

5880
02:35:22.121 --> 02:35:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to trust you with my financial decisions.</v>

5881
02:35:24.990 --> 02:35:26.830
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't an even crazier than that.</v>

5882
02:35:26.831 --> 02:35:31.831
<v Speaker 3>Like he was spending like ungodly amounts of money to like refurbish this house</v>

5883
02:35:32.561 --> 02:35:35.650
<v Speaker 3>and then they had to stop halfway through it cause he ran out of money.</v>

5884
02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:38.170
<v Speaker 3>But it was just some insane thing.</v>

5885
02:35:38.171 --> 02:35:43.171
<v Speaker 3>Like the marble alone was like $8 million worth of Italian marble or something.</v>

5886
02:35:43.481 --> 02:35:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crazy.</v>

5887
02:35:44.410 --> 02:35:44.651
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5888
02:35:44.651 --> 02:35:49.651
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy how people like how fast expense I had shelves built recently.</v>

5889
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:52.240
<v Speaker 3>And why wouldn't they be problems with them?</v>

5890
02:35:52.241 --> 02:35:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Because whatever fucking cunt face does something cultured,</v>

5891
02:35:54.851 --> 02:35:55.684
<v Speaker 3>it falls apart.</v>

5892
02:35:56.050 --> 02:35:57.450
<v Speaker 3>So now the shelves are not there.</v>

5893
02:35:57.490 --> 02:35:58.301
<v Speaker 3>They're being rewritten,</v>

5894
02:35:58.301 --> 02:35:59.134
<v Speaker 3>spared.</v>

5895
02:35:59.290 --> 02:36:00.123
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5896
02:36:00.490 --> 02:36:00.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5897
02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:01.421
<v Speaker 3>and it's like you,</v>

5898
02:36:01.421 --> 02:36:04.000
<v Speaker 3>you just realize that they give you an estimate and he always goes more,</v>

5899
02:36:04.010 --> 02:36:04.120
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5900
02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:05.260
<v Speaker 3>he gets to be more and you're like,</v>

5901
02:36:05.261 --> 02:36:05.590
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5902
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:06.490
<v Speaker 3>you're already in a little bit.</v>

5903
02:36:06.491 --> 02:36:07.540
<v Speaker 3>You can't just stop.</v>

5904
02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5905
02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:09.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5906
02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing they do to you.</v>

5907
02:36:11.530 --> 02:36:12.101
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

5908
02:36:12.101 --> 02:36:12.521
<v Speaker 3>If a,</v>

5909
02:36:12.521 --> 02:36:14.300
<v Speaker 3>especially unscrupulous contractor,</v>

5910
02:36:14.301 --> 02:36:15.134
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's just,</v>

5911
02:36:15.220 --> 02:36:15.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5912
02:36:15.551 --> 02:36:16.181
<v Speaker 3>hidden costs,</v>

5913
02:36:16.181 --> 02:36:16.931
<v Speaker 3>they don't see comment.</v>

5914
02:36:16.931 --> 02:36:18.280
<v Speaker 3>But some of them they just,</v>

5915
02:36:18.281 --> 02:36:20.650
<v Speaker 3>they get you hooked and then once they got you hooked,</v>

5916
02:36:20.651 --> 02:36:21.790
<v Speaker 3>they just keep the bills coming.</v>

5917
02:36:21.940 --> 02:36:25.240
<v Speaker 3>They do that with car builds to when you're getting a car built.</v>

5918
02:36:25.270 --> 02:36:28.450
<v Speaker 3>They did that to me when I was on that show rides where had that Barracuda</v>

5919
02:36:28.451 --> 02:36:29.200
<v Speaker 3>built.</v>

5920
02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:30.670
<v Speaker 3>It was infuriating,</v>

5921
02:36:30.671 --> 02:36:30.970
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5922
02:36:30.970 --> 02:36:32.710
<v Speaker 3>They treat you like you're a sucker.</v>

5923
02:36:32.740 --> 02:36:33.521
<v Speaker 3>Keep adding to it,</v>

5924
02:36:33.521 --> 02:36:33.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5925
02:36:33.790 --> 02:36:34.031
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5926
02:36:34.031 --> 02:36:35.200
<v Speaker 3>they treat you like you're a sucker.</v>

5927
02:36:35.430 --> 02:36:37.360
<v Speaker 3>They give you a low ball figure.</v>

5928
02:36:37.361 --> 02:36:41.200
<v Speaker 3>And then we were past that low ball figure quick and the car was nowhere near</v>

5929
02:36:41.201 --> 02:36:42.034
<v Speaker 3>being finished.</v>

5930
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.461
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

5931
02:36:42.461 --> 02:36:42.701
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

5932
02:36:42.701 --> 02:36:43.451

5933
02:36:43.451 --> 02:36:43.771
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

5934
02:36:43.771 --> 02:36:44.604
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

5935
02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:45.671
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

5936
02:36:45.671 --> 02:36:45.881
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

5937

02:36:46.211 --> 02:36:46.571
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

5939
02:36:46.571 --> 02:36:47.740
<v Speaker 3>it's costing a little more than we thought.</v>

5940
02:36:47.770 --> 02:36:50.140
<v Speaker 3>It's costing $100,000 more.</v>

5941
02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5944
02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:55.270
<v Speaker 3>And they started talking about,</v>

5945
02:36:55.271 --> 02:36:55.511
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

5946
02:36:55.511 --> 02:36:55.721

02:36:56.410 --> 02:36:56.621
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5951
02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:01.360
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to sell.</v>

5952
02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Because it was on the cover of popular hot rodding or one of those,</v>

5953
02:37:04.610 --> 02:37:04.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5954
02:37:04.930 --> 02:37:05.800
<v Speaker 3>hot rod magazine,</v>

5955
02:37:05.801 --> 02:37:06.640
<v Speaker 3>a couple of different magazines.</v>

5956
02:37:06.641 --> 02:37:08.320
<v Speaker 3>So they were getting offers people like,</v>

5957
02:37:08.321 --> 02:37:08.711
<v Speaker 3>hey Ya,</v>

5958
02:37:08.711 --> 02:37:08.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5959
02:37:08.890 --> 02:37:09.641
<v Speaker 3>I want to see this car.</v>

5960
02:37:09.641 --> 02:37:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I'd Bob all this car as this guy,</v>

5961
02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:12.340
<v Speaker 3>he wants to sell the car.</v>

5962
02:37:12.460 --> 02:37:13.690
<v Speaker 3>And they started getting greedy.</v>

5963
02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 3>So they started like doing all this crazy shit to the</v>

5964
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.540
<v Speaker 1>car to can make it more valuable.</v>

5965
02:37:17.690 --> 02:37:18.650
<v Speaker 1>But while they were doing that,</v>

5966
02:37:18.651 --> 02:37:20.060
<v Speaker 1>it was costing me more money.</v>

5967
02:37:20.330 --> 02:37:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I was financing the whole thing and then they were threatening to sell it and</v>

5968
02:37:23.271 --> 02:37:26.150
<v Speaker 1>just give me my money back and they were going to like make all the profit.</v>

5969
02:37:26.151 --> 02:37:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5970

5972
02:37:28.820 --> 02:37:30.890
<v Speaker 1>This is the craziest fucking scenario I'm in.</v>

5973
02:37:31.370 --> 02:37:33.800
<v Speaker 1>And it was just like they do with a house,</v>

5974
02:37:33.801 --> 02:37:35.950
<v Speaker 1>except it's different because it's your house,</v>

5975
02:37:35.951 --> 02:37:36.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5976
02:37:36.260 --> 02:37:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Like this isn't even your car.</v>

5977
02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a car that you're paying for.</v>

5978
02:37:39.201 --> 02:37:40.100
<v Speaker 1>And this guy's telling me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was a mess.</v>

5996
02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:03.171
<v Speaker 1>It was a mess,</v>

02:38:03.171 --> 02:38:06.590
<v Speaker 1>a real mess because a bunch of people got really greedy because it was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

6000
02:38:09.710 --> 02:38:10.543
<v Speaker 1>it was ugly.</v>

6011
02:38:23.391 --> 02:38:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6012
02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:24.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

6013
02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:24.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6014
02:38:24.831 --> 02:38:28.340
<v Speaker 1>he was all these dollar bill signs are in his head because it was on these</v>

6015
02:38:28.341 --> 02:38:30.950
<v Speaker 1>magazine covers and we had this conversation on the phone.</v>

6016
02:38:30.951 --> 02:38:31.191
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

6020
02:38:33.050 --> 02:38:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Cars on today.</v>

6021
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:34.101
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

6022
02:38:34.101 --> 02:38:34.251
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

02:38:34.251 --> 02:38:34.821
<v Speaker 1>fuck head.</v>

6024
02:38:34.821 --> 02:38:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think this car is so much more popular than any car you ever built?</v>

6025
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:40.220
<v Speaker 1>You ever think it's maybe because you're building it for a famous person,</v>

6026
02:38:40.430 --> 02:38:41.600
<v Speaker 1>you fucking dolt.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You think that you're the famous person?</v>

<v Speaker 1>do you understand this?</v>

6031
02:38:45.771 --> 02:38:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Like this is getting you more attention,</v>

6032
02:38:47.901 --> 02:38:50.510
<v Speaker 1>that more attention will generate more business for you,</v>

6033
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:52.760
<v Speaker 1>but we have a deal and you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're fucking me out of my deal because someone's going to offer you an extra</v>

6035
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:58.730

6036
02:38:59.210 --> 02:39:00.770
<v Speaker 1>But that's what they do with cars.</v>

6037
02:39:00.771 --> 02:39:01.770
<v Speaker 1>They start you off this,</v>

6038
02:39:01.771 --> 02:39:02.031
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

6039
02:39:02.031 --> 02:39:02.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6040
02:39:02.271 --> 02:39:03.230
<v Speaker 1>we'll build the car for you,</v>

6041
02:39:03.231 --> 02:39:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>

6042
02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:04.141
<v Speaker 1>Kashi,</v>

6043
02:39:04.141 --> 02:39:04.971
<v Speaker 1>she about 20,</v>

6044
02:39:04.971 --> 02:39:05.750
<v Speaker 1>30 grand,</v>

02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:06.211
<v Speaker 1>but prepare,</v>

6046
02:39:06.211 --> 02:39:06.860
<v Speaker 1>prepare,</v>

6047
02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:07.401
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

6048
02:39:07.401 --> 02:39:08.240
<v Speaker 1>you've got the car.</v>

6049
02:39:08.241 --> 02:39:09.011
<v Speaker 1>And then like Jim,</v>

6050
02:39:09.011 --> 02:39:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm the trainees,</v>

6051
02:39:09.980 --> 02:39:10.850
<v Speaker 1>a little more expensive.</v>

6052
02:39:10.850 --> 02:39:13.850
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to adjust the housing and the rear end's not good.</v>

6053
02:39:13.851 --> 02:39:14.870
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna have to add a new rear end.</v>

6054
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:16.340
<v Speaker 1>And some of that stuff's legitimate,</v>

6055
02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:18.090
<v Speaker 1>but some of it is like a Hee Hee.</v>

6056
02:39:18.091 --> 02:39:18.621
<v Speaker 1>Ha Ha.</v>

6057
02:39:18.621 --> 02:39:19.370
<v Speaker 1>We gotcha.</v>

6058
02:39:19.370 --> 02:39:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Excellent example by the way,</v>

6059
02:39:21.170 --> 02:39:22.640
<v Speaker 1>training and the training.</v>

6060
02:39:23.130 --> 02:39:23.963
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

6061
02:39:24.510 --> 02:39:24.831
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

6062
02:39:24.831 --> 02:39:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even mean that those things.</v>

6063
02:39:26.391 --> 02:39:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And in that way it wasn't meant to be a double entendre,</v>

6064
02:39:29.390 --> 02:39:29.631
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

6065
02:39:29.631 --> 02:39:29.811
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6066
02:39:29.811 --> 02:39:31.190
<v Speaker 1>it fell into place correctly.</v>

6067
02:39:31.370 --> 02:39:32.181
