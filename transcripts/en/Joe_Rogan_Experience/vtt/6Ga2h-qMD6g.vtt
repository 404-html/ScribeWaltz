<v Speaker 1>Oh I saw something on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

57
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:31.950

<v Speaker 1>you get a bunch of different versions of</v>

58
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I went down and Internet rabbit hole</v>
<v Speaker 1>last night.</v>

60
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very disturbing one.</v>

61
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you know anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on in Boyle Heights?</v>

62
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boyle Heights.</v>

63
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>East la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>east La.</v>

64
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently the hipsters are starting to</v>

65
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:52.191
<v Speaker 1>open up our teas and old coffee shops</v>
<v Speaker 1>and art galleries there and they're not</v>

66
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>having it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

67
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>the gayborhood is pushing back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more than that.</v>

68
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like straight</v>

69
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>up racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's anti white racism,</v>

70
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 2>which is apparently co totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable.</v>

71
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't have cameras are blaring in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your face.</v>

72
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll boil heights,</v>

73
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 2>be ruined by one coffee shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just one coffee shop.</v>

74
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.590
<v Speaker 2>They forced a gallery under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this an older story from June's?</v>

75
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they forced a gallery out just through</v>

76
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 2>constant harassment and they broke the</v>
<v Speaker 2>windows of this coffee shop and,</v>

77
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 2>but what I watched last night there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing was these air quote activists</v>

78
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 2>standing in front of this gallery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking art gallery.</v>

79
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.413
<v Speaker 2>And they're screaming,</v>

<v Speaker 2>him like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like one of those guys identify as a</v>

86
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:45.551
<v Speaker 2>feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

87
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:47.610
<v Speaker 2>one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

88

<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to support.</v>

92
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.100

<v Speaker 2>It's a great chance to put up a sign</v>

93
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:01.580
<v Speaker 2>that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck white art,</v>

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>white fuck white art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The coffee shop,</v>

95
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 2>they broke the windows here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The coffee shop was even more fucked up</v>

96
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:11.000
<v Speaker 2>cause one of the guys is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexican slopper.</v>

97
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fucked up proper.</v>

98
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:12.551
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

99
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the guys who were in the coffee</v>

100
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 2>shop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were calling it,</v>

101
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they called it like weird coffee or</v>

102
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 2>something like that and neither they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put a sign on a calling it white</v>

103
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 2>coffee and they broke the window.</v>

104
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 2>But one of the guys who owns it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latino.</v>

105
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's definitely,</v>

106
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 2>it'd be funny to open up a spot called</v>
<v Speaker 2>white coffee.</v>

107
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White people come and people just called</v>

108
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 2>white people problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

109
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 2>a new generation of anti gentrification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radicals are on the march in Los Angeles</v>

110
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 2>and around the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a diet is not an accurate</v>

111
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 2>way to frame what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

112
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not anti gentrification</v>

113
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 2>radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>

114
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 2>these are rioters and then writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people have fire in their hands or</v>

115
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 2>walking on the street and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling at a bunch of racist shit and</v>

116
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 2>they covered their faces up.</v>

123
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't work that way.</v>

124
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 2>You can't save anything forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

<v Speaker 3>going to dynamically shape and,</v>

134
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:35.290

<v Speaker 3>it'll take 15 more.</v>

135
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll take 15 more years,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but it's a nightmare.</v>

167
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:00.030
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you think about,</v>

168
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh the drainage.</v>

169
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I went to a super rich dudes house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does that one take?</v>

170
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:06.140
<v Speaker 1>A guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$2 million.</v>

171
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>A little more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2.2 well you know why?</v>

172
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's a Duplo they split it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

173
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are two apartments they rent,</v>

174
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

175
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's to one side is a door or the</v>

176
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>right and left or doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

177
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 1>So what La does is they take these old</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings,</v>

179
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.610
<v Speaker 1>split them like that so then they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make twice the money.</v>

180
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 1>The property is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the property can't be worth that much.</v>

181
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just the fact that they can rent it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to two people.</v>

182
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

183
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is 1.5 0.5 how big is it?</v>

184
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.760
<v Speaker 1>A thousand square feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Square feet one.</v>

185
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the size of this studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

186
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the size of where the mics are</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of here.</v>

187
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.430
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A thousand square feet is really,</v>

188
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one dude living by yourself,</v>

189
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.990

<v Speaker 1>rent?</v>

191
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.880
<v Speaker 1>He probably should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless he's just real simple.</v>

192
00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Like there's those people that buy those</v>
<v Speaker 1>miniature houses.</v>

264
00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 2>the dog polled and the guy comically</v>
<v Speaker 2>fell to his ass,</v>

265
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 2>feet up in the air from a dog and meets</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 70 pound dog.</v>

266
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not a big dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yankton right out.</v>

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.110
<v Speaker 2>He said like the dog is a problem and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>bites things and tries to bite people.</v>

268

<v Speaker 2>or figure it out,</v>

270
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.630
<v Speaker 2>but he can't even hold the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's people that have animals</v>

271
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 2>that they're just hoping nothing goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and this thing pulled and this guy like</v>

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.250
<v Speaker 2>he tried to pull the dog back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't pull the dog back.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>

276
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.810
<v Speaker 2>like you shouldn't have this dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even a big dog.</v>

277
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.230
<v Speaker 2>You should have a fucking Chihuahua</v>
<v Speaker 2>emasculating moment for a guy to like</v>

<v Speaker 2>but the dog is biting my dog.</v>

281
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.200
<v Speaker 2>You have to stop it in some ways to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something in some way.</v>

282
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.330
<v Speaker 2>So if it takes two instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instinct number one is like kick it and</v>

283
00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 2>knock it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Push it away.</v>

284
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Instinct number two is grab a rock and</v>
<v Speaker 2>smash this fucking thing.</v>

285
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.070

<v Speaker 1>that instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

287
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 1>because that dog is like my little</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

288
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.400
<v Speaker 1>You have to protect yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Well he's a sweetie too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't,</v>

290
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.850
<v Speaker 1>he's not grounded in anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any time ever.</v>

291
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

292
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:07.990
<v Speaker 1>just got attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happy dog and this dog's biting onto his</v>

<v Speaker 1>figure out what to do and this fucking</v>

<v Speaker 1>When was the last time you had a dog?</v>

353
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have crates to keep being</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.740

<v Speaker 1>well even when she,</v>

360
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.990
<v Speaker 1>even when she shits she finds a thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that feels like it's covering her.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

407
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 1>And then the taxes come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be down to four,</v>

408
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.081
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

409
00:16:07.081 --> 00:16:07.914
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

410
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.750
<v Speaker 1>You're paying $1,200 and you make it 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

411
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 1>you're living off of $400 a week to walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and take cabs and get food.</v>

412
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.420
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all.</v>

413
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 1>That's literally why I moved to La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started comedy,</v>

414
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I was going to go to New York and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought buddy was like,</v>

415
00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:24.970
<v Speaker 1>you can be broken la and get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

416
00:16:24.971 --> 00:16:25.521
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

417
00:16:25.521 --> 00:16:27.240
<v Speaker 1>you can't be broke in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

418
00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 1>When I lived in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing road gigs and I couldn't</v>

419
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 1>afford to live in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I lived in new Rochelle.</v>

420
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.280
<v Speaker 1>I got a place in new Rochelle with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little driveway.</v>

421
00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I went to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a bottom half of a house and um,</v>

422
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.983
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

423
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.240
<v Speaker 1>there's like a little driveway and</v>
<v Speaker 1>parked the car right in front of my</v>

424
00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:42.680
<v Speaker 1>bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if someone fucked with it,</v>

425
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:43.514
<v Speaker 1>I could hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it.</v>

426
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the only option that wasn't cheap</v>

427
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like living in the city was just</v>

428
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.070
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like hundreds of dollars a month</v>

429
00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 1>just for a parking spot.</v>

430
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Ever afford that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I moved to La because I saw</v>

431
00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone was telling me they were like,</v>

432
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.870
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with paying 400 a month</v>
<v Speaker 1>in La to have a room in a place with</v>

433
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:03.631
<v Speaker 1>roommates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

434
00:17:03.631 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Speaker 1>God is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think comics are doing it right.</v>

435
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of like Tony</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hinchcliffe when he lived out here,</v>

436
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.980
<v Speaker 1>when he first moved here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived with like three other guys and</v>

437
00:17:13.981 --> 00:17:17.360
<v Speaker 1>like they all split the rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small one bedroom apartment or two</v>

438
00:17:17.361 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 1>bedroom apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get away with that and it's fun.</v>

439
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like it is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

440
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:25.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one guy who doesn't make it no shit.</v>

441
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:30.340
<v Speaker 1>He still calls you guys up to hey you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think are good to spoke Doritos Dave and</v>

442
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 1>you're breaking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go.</v>

443
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the hill on the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

444
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's always funny cause I was out</v>

445
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:41.800
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always one,</v>

446
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 1>the guys that I moved out here or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy when I lived with,</v>

447
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:45.950
<v Speaker 1>when I moved out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all doing good stuff,</v>

448
00:17:45.951 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>not comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all doing this stuff,</v>

449
00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 1>which is wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is good.</v>

450
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:50.880
<v Speaker 1>If they're not that they weren't common</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

451
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.650
<v Speaker 1>It was easier for me cause I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

452
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think competition in those places</v>

453
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:56.490
<v Speaker 1>gets kind of thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it could,</v>

454
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.530
<v Speaker 1>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guy gets on some guy,</v>

455
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 1>you know as you watch one dude get a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like rise and then everyone else is</v>

456
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:04.530

<v Speaker 1>why the fuck is he getting so much?</v>

457
00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

462
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it might not even been six months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the neighborhood of six</v>

463
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:15.540
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never lived with a comic.</v>

464
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I think you got booted out of his house</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

465
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.160
<v Speaker 1>He was living with a gal and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a little gut of a struggle and you</v>

466
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.830
<v Speaker 1>called me up from a motel and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

467
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:24.060

470
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 1>And he actually used my isolation tank</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get over his breakup.</v>

471
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

472
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:37.020
<v Speaker 1>He gotten their tank every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would smoke weed and get in the tank</v>

473
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:41.640
<v Speaker 1>and think about life and just let it</v>
<v Speaker 1>size and wrote a journal and then left</v>

474
00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 1>it behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've read every page of it.</v>

475
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Call them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

478
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.290
<v Speaker 1>First couple of pages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love angel.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't mind if I put it online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right page for page.</v>

482
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might have got lost in one of my</v>

483
00:18:57.691 --> 00:18:59.550
<v Speaker 1>moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might just turn up somewhere.</v>

484
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say you should do a time</v>
<v Speaker 1>release.</v>

485
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Like every day a new page gets released</v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

486
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.130
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just him,</v>

487
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like getting out of the tank and just</v>

488
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.170
<v Speaker 1>sweat sortings head out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the first thing you think of when</v>

489
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:11.370
<v Speaker 1>you get out of the tank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

490
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 1>it's very different every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

491
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:16.020
<v Speaker 1>most of the time when I get an attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to chill out.</v>

492
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I've always had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always have so many plates spinning.</v>

493
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like so many different things.</v>

494
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm always thinking about like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>

495
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Who's the future guests?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When am I doing stand up?</v>

496
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:28.400
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what bit am I working on?</v>

497
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>

498
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.520
<v Speaker 1>The UFC is coming up like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh have I watched this guy fight before?</v>

499
00:19:32.521 --> 00:19:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I got to make sure that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.990
<v Speaker 1>get my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

501
00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.810
<v Speaker 1>my views in on different styles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and have my ideas about what I</v>

502
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 1>think about these match ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't sleep,</v>

503
00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 1>you don't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sleep.</v>

504
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.210
<v Speaker 1>You're sleeping there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No in the tank.</v>

505
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

506
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't sleep in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can people save saving the tech?</v>

507
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

508
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:52.350
<v Speaker 1>You definitely can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that your own snores.</v>

509
00:19:52.351 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Doe would echo off the walls a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and maybe that will wake you up,</v>

510
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.120
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure I've passed out in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

511
00:19:57.121 --> 00:19:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I have many years that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been doing it.</v>

512
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I first got one 16 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

513
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I first got a tank.</v>

514
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I've got one in 2002 that's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

515
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Do you do the cryo freeze too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that too.</v>

516
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really prefer sauna.</v>

517
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It takes more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

518
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:18.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really like how Saunas make me feel.</v>

519
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:22.140
<v Speaker 1>But cryo gives you a for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say I prefer it.</v>

520
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a sauna here,</v>

521
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.740
<v Speaker 1>so like I'm biased so I could just turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on and I'll do it way more often.</v>

522
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I have to drive to the cryo place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Park my car.</v>

523
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole clothes off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climbing a cryo machine here.</v>

524
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:34.881
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

525
00:20:34.881 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated.</v>

526
00:20:35.941 --> 00:20:39.400
<v Speaker 1>And you have to have a license and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're carrying for nitrogen here.</v>

527
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a cryo dude.</v>

528
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Jamie would like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to cry?</v>

529
00:20:43.281 --> 00:20:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hanging around.</v>

530
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that one girl that</v>
<v Speaker 1>died vegas cause she was doing it</v>

531
00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:49.960
<v Speaker 1>without supervision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

532
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:52.270
<v Speaker 1>How long was she in a four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did a different kind.</v>

533
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 1>See there's two different kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the kind that uses liquid</v>

534
00:20:55.601 --> 00:21:00.580
<v Speaker 1>nitrogen and then you stand in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid nitrogen and in that kind it's</v>

535
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:03.910
<v Speaker 1>only from the neck down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your head is not being frozen.</v>

536
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 1>That's not as effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's effective.</v>

537
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.550
<v Speaker 1>It definitely does something but it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do as much as the one where</v>

538
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:12.340
<v Speaker 1>you're standing at 250 degree below zero</v>
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

539
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that I go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Cryo healthcare.</v>

540
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 1>They're in La on La Cienega and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are about five miles away from</v>

541
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:21.700
<v Speaker 1>here in woodland hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just getting like a chamber?</v>

542
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Under wearing gloves.</v>

543
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to where you were like crocs on</v>

544
00:21:28.181 --> 00:21:29.590
<v Speaker 1>your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something rubber on your feet,</v>

545
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 1>like rubber clogs rather.</v>

546
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>

547
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.340
<v Speaker 1>you're going to wear socks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socks go up to your ankles are up to</v>

548
00:21:36.341 --> 00:21:39.490
<v Speaker 1>your calves rather like because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin can freeze.</v>

549
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you can get frostbite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know people that have been in</v>

550
00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:45.400
<v Speaker 1>there too long and they've got a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of burning sensation on their is too</v>

551
00:21:45.401 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most I've ever done is three minutes</v>

552
00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:51.280
<v Speaker 1>and 40 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't let you do more than I think</v>

553
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 1>a minute and a half on your first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want want to make sure that you</v>

554
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 1>don't freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

555
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:57.880
<v Speaker 1>too sensitive and then you build your</v>
<v Speaker 1>way up to three minutes is the Max.</v>

556
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why I went further than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because there was a guy worked</v>

557
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:03.610
<v Speaker 1>there and we were just trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what you can take.</v>

558
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to save you.</v>

559
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.040
<v Speaker 1>You did it because you want it to.</v>

560
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see if I have court I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

561
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 1>did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done twice.</v>

562
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I think vent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two minutes Max.</v>

563
00:22:11.511 --> 00:22:14.140
<v Speaker 1>This for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like at full I felt like it.</v>

564
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Four minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have had real problems.</v>

565
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the door of real problems at</v>

566
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:20.230
<v Speaker 1>three minutes and 40 seconds your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

567
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:21.011
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like,</v>

568
00:22:21.011 --> 00:22:23.800
<v Speaker 1>does your head start getting fucked up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to concentrate.</v>

569
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.070
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to stay cool like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal is just like,</v>

570
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:28.350
<v Speaker 1>stay chill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

571
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Kill your you to keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to freak out.</v>

572
00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:37.110
<v Speaker 1>But then my legs started involuntary</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucking.</v>

573
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.660
<v Speaker 1>They were doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your body saying this.</v>

574
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.740
<v Speaker 1>This isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to,</v>

575
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Speaker 1>it was not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

576
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:46.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my rational brain was still like 30%</v>

577
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:47.470
<v Speaker 1>operational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe at that point,</v>

578
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe 40% you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

579
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.670
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you couldn't do math</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

580
00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:52.504
<v Speaker 1>you're not thinking clearly.</v>

581
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 1>You could do math problems for the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 seconds and then you'd be like,</v>

582
00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck.</v>

583
00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:01.480
<v Speaker 1>What if you just thought about one math</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem over and over in your brain and</v>

584
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:05.910
<v Speaker 1>circulated that shit until the end and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be focused on it so hard then.</v>

585
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Then when you started to forget how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

586
00:23:07.691 --> 00:23:09.460
<v Speaker 1>then you know you're out and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it anymore.</v>

587
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Well one thing I do do is I do that Wim</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hof breathing method or I take these</v>

588
00:23:13.151 --> 00:23:18.151
<v Speaker 1>gigantic breaths and then I let out 20%</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I take another breath like as</v>

589
00:23:18.611 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>deep as I can get my lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let out 20% and I concentrate on doing</v>

590
00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:23.680
<v Speaker 1>that and time flies by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>

591
00:23:23.681 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 1>That's what those deep divers to write</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>

592
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:26.110
<v Speaker 1>they go to those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

593
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.100
<v Speaker 1>don't they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they?</v>

594
00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause they learn how to store breath.</v>

595
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were seeing those videos with those</v>

596
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:31.370
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dive like,</v>

597
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those dive tanks that they have set</v>

598
00:23:33.581 --> 00:23:34.301
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way they do it,</v>

599
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:36.560
<v Speaker 1>it looks like they in tons of breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let a little bit,</v>

600
00:23:36.561 --> 00:23:39.220
<v Speaker 1>they keep taking it in and sit there</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just storing it in there and you</v>

601
00:23:39.221 --> 00:23:39.851
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sax,</v>

602
00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.710
<v Speaker 1>in their lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that that's not just</v>

603
00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:44.350
<v Speaker 1>storing oxygen to that you'd be storing</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon dioxide.</v>

604
00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're not breathing out.</v>

605
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they'd breathe out a little bit at a</v>

606
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

607
00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you convert oxygen to carbon dioxide?</v>

608
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I've always just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just uh,</v>

609
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:55.580
<v Speaker 1>accepted that I never thought of about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that air goes in.</v>

610
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't air going out without fuck is</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and it's only going right</v>

611
00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how's it turned into carbon</v>

612
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 1>dioxide?</v>

613
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.410
<v Speaker 1>A little dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just going in there and then it</v>

614
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:03.801
<v Speaker 1>comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

615
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I converted.</v>

616
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now that's ridiculous.</v>

617
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Mushy or conversion machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we all are.</v>

618
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Big Conversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon dioxide conversion machines.</v>

619
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.660
<v Speaker 1>You learn that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like of,</v>

620
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:18.290
<v Speaker 1>of how quickly things happen when like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my college roommate had gout.</v>

621
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.170
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like blood turns around front jeff</v>

622
00:24:21.171 --> 00:24:22.070
<v Speaker 1>at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

623
00:24:22.071 --> 00:24:23.960
<v Speaker 1>So like it's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like your fingers or your hand.</v>

624
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Anything we're blood has like a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

625
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fee.</v>

626
00:24:26.021 --> 00:24:28.760
<v Speaker 1>It's usually legs and feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never understood until I looked it</v>

627
00:24:28.761 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 1>up when he had it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get gout?</v>

628
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And everything online is like 50 plus is</v>
<v Speaker 1>at risk.</v>

629
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:36.430
<v Speaker 1>You know like high blood pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to music.</v>

630
00:24:36.431 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 1>It was 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus shouldn't had it.</v>

631
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.010
<v Speaker 1>You know they call it King's disease.</v>

632
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they were fat and ate and drank</v>

633
00:24:41.841 --> 00:24:43.040
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just drink wine,</v>

634
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.880
<v Speaker 1>their feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

635
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:46.820
<v Speaker 1>fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

636
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Especially when everybody else is</v>
<v Speaker 1>starving.</v>

637
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.410
<v Speaker 1>If you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please sir,</v>

638
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:55.010
<v Speaker 1>let me rest my swollen dead feed on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

639
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching biking's I get into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that show vikings.</v>

640
00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:00.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've never seen him pretty God</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn good.</v>

641
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:02.360
<v Speaker 1>She's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was super skeptical.</v>

642
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:03.860
<v Speaker 1>People telling me it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

643
00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:05.510
<v Speaker 1>it's unregular TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck could it be?</v>

644
00:25:05.511 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 1>And he was on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on history channel.</v>

645
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is another one.</v>

646
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It's on history channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

647
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's a drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck it's based on historical</v>

648
00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 1>facts apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

649
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Ragnar Ragnar Loft Brooke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his name,</v>

650
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking Badass show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the thing that's crazy about</v>

651
00:25:21.891 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 1>the shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really stopped thinking,</v>

652
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.470
<v Speaker 1>well this is really how it worked.</v>

653
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Like how king's treated regular people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

654
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.350
<v Speaker 1>They really got away with that and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were was just a regular guy.</v>

655
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have super powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

656
00:25:32.311 --> 00:25:33.980
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody would just bow down to</v>

657
00:25:33.981 --> 00:25:36.080
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sire and they would kiss the rings and</v>

658
00:25:36.081 --> 00:25:38.180
<v Speaker 1>they would just let them do whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck they wanted.</v>

659
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear of death,</v>

660
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:42.680
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that even the army would</v>

661
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:45.460
<v Speaker 1>listen to this guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody would let it and it catches guys</v>

662
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.270
<v Speaker 1>weird or that the army listened to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

663
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally they will go fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'd killed the guy and then a new</v>

664
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 1>guy would rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we should be doing.</v>

665
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:53.030
<v Speaker 1>We should do all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

666
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

675
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.310
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many fakes and phoneys and</v>

676
00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:22.850
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous career politicians that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to watch this guy.</v>

677

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 1>really saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the stuff that they would say</v>

682
00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:34.430
<v Speaker 1>to if they didn't have any reservations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's maybe,</v>

683
00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of those guys are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's still ridiculous.</v>

704
00:27:39.421 --> 00:27:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm so tired of being yelled at by like</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

711
00:27:51.391 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm so tired of you telling me your</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>

712
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.640
<v Speaker 2>It's all the same to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also what annoys me is when someone goes</v>

713
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.040
<v Speaker 2>fucking moron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

714
00:27:59.100 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

715
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:00.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

716
00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:01.321
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:03.570
<v Speaker 2>you put like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not doing anything by going,</v>

<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump shuck my dick.</v>

00:28:06.361 --> 00:28:06.991
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got 'em.</v>

721
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Here's my take on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's that,</v>

722
00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:11.280
<v Speaker 2>if it's fucking moron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even supposed to listen.</v>

723
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 2>That's supposed to not even go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know because there's not a,</v>

724
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:17.100
<v Speaker 2>this is not effective communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you engage that guy,</v>

725
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.440
<v Speaker 2>don't I just completely waste your time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you get upset at you completely</v>

726
00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.920
<v Speaker 2>waste your time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wipe it away,</v>

727
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.000
<v Speaker 2>but I see it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

00:28:24.001 --> 00:28:26.310
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They really don't even know what the</v>

00:28:32.821 --> 00:28:35.080
<v Speaker 2>fuck they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you really think that everybody</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're missing.</v>

734
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.230
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're missing a giant point.</v>

735
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.820
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking up everything.</v>

736
00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:44.970
<v Speaker 2>You're ruining this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right about a lot of the shitty</v>

737
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:47.370

<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you say he's a Nazi,</v>

738
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.980
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that there's Nazi,</v>

739
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 2>everyone's a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then when real Nazis come around,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

742
00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:57.990
<v Speaker 2>You can't with the court call Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't fucking take the word Nazi and</v>

743
00:28:57.991 --> 00:28:59.580
<v Speaker 2>apply it to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not Nazis.</v>

744
00:28:59.581 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 2>That's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a sale.</v>

745
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Like call someone a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you call him a murderer?</v>

746
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Because he yelled and insult at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

747
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a murderer.</v>

748
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't do that same thing.</v>

749
00:29:10.861 --> 00:29:12.640
<v Speaker 2>We call someone a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a nonsense.</v>

750
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.360
<v Speaker 2>He might be a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be a fool.</v>

751
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.990
<v Speaker 2>He might be a into trump just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a dumb guy and he likes the fact</v>

752
00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:21.720
<v Speaker 2>there's a white guy in office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean he's a Nazi.</v>

753
00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.380
<v Speaker 2>But it's also like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest problem that I have is like</v>

754
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.990
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still illegal to be an asshole.</v>

755
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not illegal to be a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

756
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:31.380
<v Speaker 2>If someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone says something you don't</v>

757
00:29:31.381 --> 00:29:32.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

758
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not against the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

759
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.360
<v Speaker 2>So like this idea of you tagging someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

760
00:29:35.361 --> 00:29:37.320
<v Speaker 2>the biggest criminal in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they said something you don't</v>

761
00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:39.000
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy to me like,</v>

762
00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are allowed to not fucking think</v>

763
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 2>what you think is right.</v>

764
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.210
<v Speaker 3>Right Brian?</v>

765
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.810
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to redefine what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable by calling words violence.</v>

766
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Like they're calling saying hang speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hate speech is real.</v>

767
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.911
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know though.</v>

768
00:29:51.911 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>

770
00:29:53.231 --> 00:29:55.150
<v Speaker 2>If you say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck the Jews,</v>

771
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I hate all Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews should die.</v>

772
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 2>That's hate speech.</v>

773
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's to me it's this.</v>

774
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 3>If you set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a guy said,</v>

775
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:04.030

<v Speaker 3>Well you should say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you fuck them?</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's just a big,</v>

784
00:30:18.431 --> 00:30:20.920
<v Speaker 3>huge term that can encompass so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

785
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

786
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It incite violence.</v>

787
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.280
<v Speaker 3>The devices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jews does that inside violence.</v>

788
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.720
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the way you said shirt,</v>

792
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:36.780

<v Speaker 2>what.</v>

798
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's not going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't say it then.</v>

799
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.580
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you suppress it?</v>

800
00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem with stopping hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech is like who's to decide because</v>

801
00:31:01.591 --> 00:31:04.140
<v Speaker 2>they're pushing the boundary of what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hate speech so far.</v>

802
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you call a trans woman,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's just an accident.</v>

805
00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still accidental hate speech.</v>

806
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

807
00:31:15.781 --> 00:31:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Because we live in a new world now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

808
00:31:17.581 --> 00:31:19.380
<v Speaker 2>I can't accept that you don't go online</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now</v>

809
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.130
<v Speaker 3>if you do it out of malice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're,</v>

810
00:31:22.131 --> 00:31:23.120
<v Speaker 3>if someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

811
00:31:23.121 --> 00:31:25.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm Margaret and a guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

812
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.010
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to call you that good</v>

813
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:31.820
<v Speaker 3>there I that then that's them being</v>
<v Speaker 3>proactively prejudice,</v>

814
00:31:31.821 --> 00:31:33.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Them being a dick,</v>

815
00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:34.250
<v Speaker 3>they're being an asshole.</v>

816
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.390
<v Speaker 2>But some people are of the opinion that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all nonsense.</v>

817
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.400
<v Speaker 2>But if it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking,</v>

818
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 2>taking their point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do want to play devil's advocate</v>

819
00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:44.350
<v Speaker 2>because I've had conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are pretty intelligent people</v>

820
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.540
<v Speaker 2>than to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all nonsense.</v>

821
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.970
<v Speaker 2>And then this trans stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

822
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:52.170
<v Speaker 2>this is a trendy thing that people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>really getting into in summary Bore</v>

823
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.240
<v Speaker 2>really distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their perceptions of reality is really</v>

824
00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:58.750
<v Speaker 2>distorted and they're being talked into</v>
<v Speaker 2>this because it's a thing that a lot of</v>

825
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:00.100
<v Speaker 2>people are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're getting,</v>

826
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.960
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear that and I go,</v>

827
00:32:01.961 --> 00:32:04.300
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I believe that people</v>

828
00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:07.960
<v Speaker 2>are willing to transition to another sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're confused.</v>

829
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.360
<v Speaker 2>That's a big leap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant ass leap.</v>

830
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.950
<v Speaker 2>But here's the other leap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The leap is you telling someone whether</v>

831
00:32:14.951 --> 00:32:18.130
<v Speaker 2>or not they feel a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other leap,</v>

832
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.290
<v Speaker 2>here's the other leap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you give a fuck if Bruce Jenner</v>

833
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.250
<v Speaker 2>wants to become Caitlyn Jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll call our Kaitlin.</v>

834
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if she thinks I'm gonna stop making</v>

835
00:32:26.231 --> 00:32:27.920
<v Speaker 2>fun of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's out of her fucking mind.</v>

836
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:29.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I mean.</v>

837
00:32:29.131 --> 00:32:32.160
<v Speaker 3>So you should be allowed to just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be allowed to mock at a</v>

838
00:32:32.161 --> 00:32:33.690
<v Speaker 3>freedom that you would anyway.</v>

839
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Every six foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three person would size 14 high heels</v>

840
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.730
<v Speaker 2>gets mocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just listen around clock because</v>

841
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.160
<v Speaker 3>anybody would get made fun of for any of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in any other way.</v>

842
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you used to be a girl or you used to</v>

843
00:32:45.891 --> 00:32:48.200
<v Speaker 3>be a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now you're a girl and someone's</v>

844
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 3>gonna make fun of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's just the price you pay for</v>

845
00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:52.640
<v Speaker 3>being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people make fun of everyone for</v>

846
00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:53.660
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

847
00:32:53.661 --> 00:32:54.590
<v Speaker 3>You have red hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

848
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Is My whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your whole life.</v>

849
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.250
<v Speaker 3>But what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't start a group against it being</v>

850
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:00.190
<v Speaker 3>like people trying enough of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

851
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.760
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just it is what it is.</v>

852
00:33:01.761 --> 00:33:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has these flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kick of Ginger Ginger Day.</v>

853
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.950
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

854
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.520
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what's so funny about that?</v>

855
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 3>Those guys were so subversive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing is showing how</v>

856
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 3>quickly people jump onto things and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

857
00:33:13.161 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 3>fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck them all.</v>

858
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.630
<v Speaker 3>So they're so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that episode because it was like</v>

859
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.420
<v Speaker 3>that could be a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's how dumb people are.</v>

860
00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.480
<v Speaker 3>People in the real world have told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been through it.</v>

861
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 3>I wonder when we kick of Ginger Day is</v>
<v Speaker 3>they buy that's real to them.</v>

862
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.030
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's by the way I played,</v>

863
00:33:28.031 --> 00:33:29.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played golf with a buddy at the</v>

864
00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:31.530
<v Speaker 3>country club that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

865
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:35.600

<v Speaker 3>My first question does,</v>

866
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.620
<v Speaker 3>does she hit from the women's season,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the men's tees and the guy with me goes,</v>

867

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

868
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Bull Shit.</v>

869
00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.670
<v Speaker 3>that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it bullshit?</v>

870
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.881
<v Speaker 3>Because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

871
00:33:44.881 --> 00:33:46.220
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking Olympian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

872
00:33:46.221 --> 00:33:48.240
<v Speaker 3>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still the difference between teasing</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean like distance 30,</v>

<v Speaker 3>knees.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

882
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.290
<v Speaker 3>she has man structured muscle and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>go away.</v>

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.680
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muscle.</v>

885
00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.570
<v Speaker 3>There's no muscle while she's still</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty fucking jam.</v>

886
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Not Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be honest.</v>

888
00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:15.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she works out at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's old already,</v>

889
00:34:15.201 --> 00:34:17.930

<v Speaker 3>but she still has a Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

891
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had the operation.</v>

892
00:34:21.171 --> 00:34:22.110
<v Speaker 3>Cut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hot.</v>

893
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:25.130
<v Speaker 3>Is it gone now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're okay now you get women's tees</v>

894
00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.710
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick was there.</v>

895
00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:29.450
<v Speaker 3>You gotta go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta go back to the black.</v>

896
00:34:29.451 --> 00:34:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of fence riders out there</v>

897
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:32.930
<v Speaker 3>in the Trans World.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pick it.</v>

898
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:34.360
<v Speaker 3>You gotta pick dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta come,</v>

899
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.380
<v Speaker 3>you gotta come or go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing they're saying,</v>

900
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.030
<v Speaker 3>this is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with this,</v>

901
00:34:38.031 --> 00:34:42.500
<v Speaker 3>is they're saying that if you are a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person who is male and likes women,</v>

902
00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.620
<v Speaker 3>if you are unwilling to date a trans</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

903
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.190
<v Speaker 3>it's because you are a transphobic</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigot,</v>

904
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.460
<v Speaker 3>including if that Trans Woman's still</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a penis.</v>

905
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.650
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's of no regard.</v>

906
00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:58.010
<v Speaker 3>You know the funny thing of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all this is I'm so happy to just be a</v>

907

<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

909
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to call me a bigot for</v>

910
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:09.050
<v Speaker 3>not liking a subset of a kind of a thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I like.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Samsung always been like,</v>

1235
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>2011 when Penn state coordinator,</v>

1236
00:47:02.191 --> 00:47:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Sandusky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got arrested in charge of sexually</v>

1238
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Dzhokhar who decided notch charged</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sandusky when his first victim came</v>

1239
00:47:09.751 --> 00:47:13.440
<v Speaker 2>forward in 1998 Dzhokhar cited a lack of</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

1240
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.650
<v Speaker 2>The intrigue already simmering and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dzhokhar's case exploded.</v>

1241
00:47:16.651 --> 00:47:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Sluice desperately trying to find a link</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the two cases,</v>

1242
00:47:19.081 --> 00:47:21.870
<v Speaker 2>but investigators said there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that your car's appearance</v>

1243
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:24.390
<v Speaker 2>disappearance had anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>sending Dusky crimes.</v>

1244
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I've read in another</v>

1245
00:47:25.981 --> 00:47:27.630
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cis Guy Saying,</v>

1246
00:47:27.631 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was a great stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was one of those guys have very</v>

1247
00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:32.170
<v Speaker 2>strong sense of justice and professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

1248
00:47:32.171 --> 00:47:34.960
<v Speaker 2>In light of what evolved and came to</v>
<v Speaker 2>beats closed,</v>

1249
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 2>I speak as a forensic pathologist who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>done some so many suicides over the</v>

1250
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 2>years and what can bring someone to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1251
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:43.510
<v Speaker 2>It's pure conjecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>factual knowledge.</v>

1252
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back up.</v>

1253
00:47:45.281 --> 00:47:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Still Stop scrolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

1254
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:50.470
<v Speaker 2>the forensic pathologist said he</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered writing a book about your</v>

1255
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:52.690
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ties to the Sandusky case and</v>

1256
00:47:52.691 --> 00:47:56.830
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it lead to suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he said it was not enough evidence</v>

1257
00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:57.460
<v Speaker 2>you'd have found him.</v>

1258
00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.960
<v Speaker 2>When people kill themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to be found.</v>

1259
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.870
<v Speaker 2>That's why they killed himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes most of the time,</v>

1260
00:48:01.871 --> 00:48:03.950
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they just go in the woods and</v>
<v Speaker 2>blow their brains out,</v>

1261
00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.550
<v Speaker 2>but in the fucking woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you don't,</v>

<v Speaker 2>lesson on every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1272
00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:33.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like ever,</v>

1273
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I've been reading people at Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 2>method.</v>

1274
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:39.040
<v Speaker 2>It's about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this happens a lot or was it,</v>

1275
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:41.710
<v Speaker 2>but that one was saying 1600 people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>missing.</v>

1276
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.930
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm getting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's where I'm getting my,</v>

1277
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.460
<v Speaker 2>how many people killed themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside?</v>

1278
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I'm getting my information</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Bobcat goldthwait movie about big</v>

1279
00:48:49.011 --> 00:48:51.880
<v Speaker 2>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just realized where I'm getting my</v>

1280
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:56.400
<v Speaker 2>numbers from because he has a movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Willow Creek and it's all about a</v>

1281
00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:58.690
<v Speaker 2>big foot size that people are creeped</v>
<v Speaker 2>out with a growing number of missing</v>

<v Speaker 2>persons international park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1283
00:48:59.711 --> 00:49:01.270
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of these people go fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>hiking.</v>

1284
00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:03.460
<v Speaker 2>They don't go to kill themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just people being foolish.</v>

1285
00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

1286
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:06.100
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have buddy of mine found a</v>

1287
00:49:06.101 --> 00:49:10.930
<v Speaker 2>skull when he was elk hunting humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goldman skull while elk on how long has</v>

1288
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:13.000
<v Speaker 2>that has to be dead for to be fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>deteriorate like that.</v>

1289
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.690
<v Speaker 2>She was mean.</v>

1290
00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:15.610
<v Speaker 2>It was deteriorated like at first of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1291
00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 2>animals would get to it almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

1292
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:18.760
<v Speaker 2>They smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Birds come down.</v>

1293
00:49:18.761 --> 00:49:20.860
<v Speaker 2>They started taking it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes find it.</v>

1294
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Everything finds to be clean down to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>skull.</v>

1295
00:49:22.901 --> 00:49:24.670
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1296
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:25.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be,</v>

1297
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:28.510
<v Speaker 2>you'd be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll clean you down to nothing in a</v>

1298
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:29.320
<v Speaker 2>couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1299
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.560
<v Speaker 2>You'd be down to bones and day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that happens all,</v>

1300
00:49:31.561 --> 00:49:34.840
<v Speaker 2>it's if there's a population of animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are scavengers that are near your</v>

1301
00:49:34.841 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1302
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.410
<v Speaker 2>a buddy of mine shot a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1303
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:41.890
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't the best shot in the world.</v>

1304
00:49:41.891 --> 00:49:45.010
<v Speaker 2>So he decided to let the deer bed down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to die.</v>

1305
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes you'll hit the deer like</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one long or something like that.</v>

1306
00:49:47.981 --> 00:49:50.920
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the best shot and the deer bed</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and it was dark.</v>

1307
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:55.060
<v Speaker 2>It was getting dark like he shot at last</v>
<v Speaker 2>light where you legally allowed shoot.</v>

1308
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.210
<v Speaker 2>So they said we're going to come back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning cause it's 30 degrees</v>

1309
00:49:58.211 --> 00:49:59.860
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The meat would be fine.</v>

1310
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.740
<v Speaker 2>They go back in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing gone.</v>

1311
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.280
<v Speaker 2>The coyotes ate everything except the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking head.</v>

1312
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything.</v>

1313
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Like he didn't get any of the rib meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the organs were gone.</v>

1314
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:15.040
<v Speaker 2>The legs were gone to down to the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he'd never seen anything like</v>

1315
00:50:15.041 --> 00:50:16.990
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 pound mule deer.</v>

1316
00:50:16.991 --> 00:50:21.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a big animal gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he saw like six or seven coyotes</v>

1317
00:50:21.761 --> 00:50:23.530
<v Speaker 2>that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he knew that coyotes were in the</v>

1318
00:50:23.531 --> 00:50:25.180
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you just take a chance.</v>

1319
00:50:25.181 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 2>He just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do one of two things.</v>

1320
00:50:26.831 --> 00:50:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Either bumped the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means you,</v>

1321
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.460
<v Speaker 2>you go and it gets filled up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline because it knows you're</v>

1322
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:34.430
<v Speaker 2>coming close to it and then it runs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can run for a mile before they</v>

1323
00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:37.070
<v Speaker 2>expire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you just let it bed down there</v>

1324
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:38.780
<v Speaker 2>peacefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll just lay down and die.</v>

1325
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's what he chose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His choice was just let it lay down and</v>

1326
00:50:41.631 --> 00:50:42.770
<v Speaker 2>die with the coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got to it.</v>

1327
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 pound animal to seven,</v>

1328
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 2>eight coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was that did it.</v>

1329
00:50:48.051 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe other ones came from fucking half</v>

1330
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.680
<v Speaker 2>a mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Yo,</v>

1331
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 2>this is deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

1332
00:50:53.121 --> 00:50:55.610
<v Speaker 2>this guy left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fucking fresh,</v>

1333
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:59.060
<v Speaker 2>it's Mike from the westwoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1334
00:50:59.061 --> 00:51:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I think he was in an area with no</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>

1335
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:03.700
<v Speaker 3>so I think it was just all coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coyotes.</v>

1336
00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:08.650
<v Speaker 3>The coyotes out here in la are so small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like little tiny house dogs.</v>

1337
00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.300
<v Speaker 3>They're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a little like bitch,</v>

1338
00:51:10.301 --> 00:51:11.140
<v Speaker 3>frail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

1339
00:51:11.141 --> 00:51:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Like where I golf up in the mountain up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1340
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:16.840
<v Speaker 3>We there all the time and they sit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wait for you to pass before they</v>

1341
00:51:16.841 --> 00:51:18.070
<v Speaker 3>can go across,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1342
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:20.290
<v Speaker 3>through the fairway and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're like little house dogs.</v>

1343
00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.690
<v Speaker 3>They're like 15 pound house dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are lucky.</v>

1344
00:51:22.691 --> 00:51:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Those things are here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the sort of the truth because</v>

1345
00:51:25.241 --> 00:51:27.310
<v Speaker 3>totally they weren't here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be rats everywhere.</v>

1346
00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat every throws.</v>

1347
00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Motherfuckers keep the rats in check to</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep the rabbits and check.</v>

1348
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.000
<v Speaker 3>There's a system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an ecological system and it</v>

1349
00:51:35.001 --> 00:51:37.810
<v Speaker 3>makes us uncomfortable because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to think about our own mortality</v>

1350
00:51:37.811 --> 00:51:40.810
<v Speaker 3>and something that wants to eat us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I like coyotes.</v>

1351
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:43.190
<v Speaker 3>I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a chance to kill a coyote.</v>

1352
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:46.160
<v Speaker 3>They killed one of my chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty sure that she had,</v>

1353
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:49.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure she had puppies or cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess they would cubs.</v>

1354
00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:50.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1355
00:51:50.421 --> 00:51:52.930

<v Speaker 3>Could have had it come into,</v>

1356
00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't could've run its mouth and</v>

1357
00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:56.160
<v Speaker 3>chicken has a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

1362
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:07.580
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna play with those things</v>

1363
00:52:07.581 --> 00:52:08.960
<v Speaker 3>twice and then you're going to leave him</v>
<v Speaker 3>alone.</v>

1364
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:09.651
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1365
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:12.200

<v Speaker 3>Of course they don't take care of it.</v>

1366
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give a fuck about those rabbits</v>

1367
00:52:13.741 --> 00:52:14.980
<v Speaker 2>because they have a dog,</v>

<v Speaker 2>cause kisses.</v>

1371
00:52:22.561 --> 00:52:24.930
<v Speaker 2>He runs around in circles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You throw something,</v>

1372
00:52:24.931 --> 00:52:26.700
<v Speaker 2>he chases it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way better.</v>

1373
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Nothing grab it just sits there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go near it,</v>

1374
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:30.211
<v Speaker 2>bite your finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1375
00:52:30.211 --> 00:52:32.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't throw that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1376
00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:33.670
<v Speaker 2>the rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1377
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:37.530
<v Speaker 2>they live in the chicken coops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big ass chicken coop and they follow the</v>

1378
00:52:37.531 --> 00:52:40.380
<v Speaker 2>chickens around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And today one of the rabbits was trying</v>

1379
00:52:40.381 --> 00:52:43.530
<v Speaker 2>to eat the other chickens ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's just falling around</v>

1380
00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:47.550
<v Speaker 2>literally with his little rabbit face</v>
<v Speaker 2>buried in this chicken's asshole.</v>

1381
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:49.260
<v Speaker 2>And just in this chicken is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away.</v>

1382
00:52:49.261 --> 00:52:53.280
<v Speaker 2>But I kind of liken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just bouncing around.</v>

1383
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean knows to asshole all around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire chicky case for like five</v>

1384
00:52:59.101 --> 00:53:01.320
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so rigid.</v>

1385
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.510
<v Speaker 3>There's a sub category on porn hub for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1386
00:53:03.511 --> 00:53:05.100
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be chicken rabbit porn on</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1387
00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1388
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Probably animate though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1389
00:53:08.031 --> 00:53:09.480
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like enemies,</v>

1390
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.990
<v Speaker 3>subcategories of porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the anime shit that I stumbled</v>

1391
00:53:12.991 --> 00:53:16.170
<v Speaker 3>upon is so fucking like the technical</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff is this stuff that freaks me out</v>

1392
00:53:16.171 --> 00:53:17.640
<v Speaker 3>the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

1393
00:53:17.641 --> 00:53:20.390
<v Speaker 3>People love people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who likes watching a girl</v>

1394
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:24.390
<v Speaker 3>get fucked by like 19 technicals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like jamming her eyeballs or mouth and</v>

1395
00:53:24.391 --> 00:53:25.990
<v Speaker 3>her butthole and her and she had people</v>

1396
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:28.950
<v Speaker 2>jerk off to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started off with with Japanese.</v>

1397
00:53:28.951 --> 00:53:33.150
<v Speaker 2>For some reason somebody gave me an</v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation why Japanese dude like that.</v>

1398
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the explanation is that Japanese</v>

1399
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:38.650
<v Speaker 2>porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to show insertion</v>

1400
00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.980
<v Speaker 2>penetration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1401
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 2>it blurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even show cartoon Dick's going</v>

1402
00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:46.080
<v Speaker 2>into Vaginas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can show tentacles.</v>

1403
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:47.011
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1404
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:49.260
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that technicals look</v>

1405
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:53.610
<v Speaker 2>remotely similar to Dick's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've decided to just go with</v>

1406
00:53:53.611 --> 00:53:57.920
<v Speaker 2>tentacles and your mouth and spit flying</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of your mouth and,</v>

1407
00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.340
<v Speaker 2>and they can't show jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can do,</v>

1408
00:53:59.341 --> 00:54:01.410
<v Speaker 2>but they can show technical juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1409
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:04.020
<v Speaker 2>They can show where the ges is all</v>
<v Speaker 2>pixelated.</v>

1410
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Like you can see the ges through a prism</v>
<v Speaker 2>dancing,</v>

1411
00:54:06.361 --> 00:54:10.200
<v Speaker 2>jazz pixelation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't see the actual like hd four k</v>

1412
00:54:10.201 --> 00:54:14.460
<v Speaker 2>ages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody like that would be too much for</v>

1413
00:54:14.461 --> 00:54:16.290
<v Speaker 2>cages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>

1414
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.050
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't have hard ons in porn</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazines.</v>

1415
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.320
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have hard ons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the dudes had to have like limp</v>

1416
00:54:22.321 --> 00:54:23.490
<v Speaker 2>dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1417
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:25.770
<v Speaker 2>It was a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a federal law.</v>

1418
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.980
<v Speaker 2>You better put that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better get that dead serious.</v>

1419
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Like these guys had half hard Dick's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always like half hard and it was</v>

1420
00:54:32.911 --> 00:54:35.190
<v Speaker 2>so confusing because you'd be a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

1421
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:38.400
<v Speaker 2>You Dick would be like a fucking total.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with mine and you?</v>

1422
00:54:38.401 --> 00:54:41.640
<v Speaker 2>You'd be so horny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he'd be looking at this magazine</v>

1423
00:54:41.641 --> 00:54:44.490
<v Speaker 2>like this guy's right there and he's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>even horny.</v>

1424
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:47.100
<v Speaker 2>He's right next to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like barely interested.</v>

1425
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.910
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot they had to have good</v>
<v Speaker 2>limp dicks.</v>

1426
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:51.820
<v Speaker 2>That's the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1427
00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.580
<v Speaker 2>See that's what's fun inside lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't have a mushroom Kaplan.</v>

1428
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a grower.</v>

1429
00:54:55.921 --> 00:54:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Not show her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1430
00:54:56.791 --> 00:54:59.370
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to have a real hog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a heavy one.</v>

1431
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm nice when I'm thick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I'm soft I can't be in the</v>

1432
00:55:01.441 --> 00:55:02.790
<v Speaker 2>magazine side a bit about it.</v>

1433
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Before that the girl would be like her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her mouth be open lipstick and her lips</v>

1434
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:11.370
<v Speaker 2>purse and her tongue hanging out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude would have his limp Dick rested on</v>

1435
00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:13.980
<v Speaker 2>her back like a drowning victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pulled from a lake.</v>

1436
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:19.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you just take the time to get a</v>

1437
00:55:19.651 --> 00:55:21.570
<v Speaker 2>hard on before we took these pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1438
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:23.100
<v Speaker 2>the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird that that's a law.</v>

1439
00:55:23.101 --> 00:55:25.050
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all crazy standards and</v>

1440
00:55:25.051 --> 00:55:26.670
<v Speaker 2>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A certain companies are as like,</v>

1441
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:28.380
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll let you show penises,</v>

1442
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.440
<v Speaker 2>but they can't be filled with blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it's standards and</v>

1443
00:55:31.441 --> 00:55:33.960
<v Speaker 2>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a federal law,</v>

1444
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.200
<v Speaker 2>but why would will be the difference of</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing pre vhs tapes.</v>

1445
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Once vhs tapes came along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people got to watch actual hard</v>

1446
00:55:40.811 --> 00:55:44.220
<v Speaker 2>porno and there was like a loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a loophole that existed</v>

1447
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:48.240
<v Speaker 2>because the pornographic magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't allowed to show insertion</v>

1448
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:50.100
<v Speaker 2>and they weren't allowed to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>erections.</v>

1449
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:53.310
<v Speaker 2>So there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was as weird and it wasn't that they</v>

1450
00:55:53.311 --> 00:55:56.340
<v Speaker 2>couldn't show the lips of the vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to be covered up by like hair.</v>

1451
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:57.171
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was something like that.</v>

1452
00:55:57.171 --> 00:55:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Like they couldn't show hustler always</v>
<v Speaker 2>did though.</v>

1453
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:00.331
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1454
00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:02.040
<v Speaker 2>they were the first one to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Playboy never did.</v>

1455
00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I know I always had bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Playboy would have like bear,</v>

1456
00:56:04.981 --> 00:56:06.540
<v Speaker 2>you'd barely see Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1457
00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:09.960
<v Speaker 2>you'd see like a shadow of a Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like girls looking pretty.</v>

1458
00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas hostler was like,</v>

1459
00:56:11.431 --> 00:56:14.310
<v Speaker 2>let me watch you piss shit on his guy's</v>
<v Speaker 2>chest.</v>

1460
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Page one Pfister asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on with.</v>

1461
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.970
<v Speaker 2>It was a different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1462
00:56:20.971 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we would find these magazines like,</v>

1463
00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:26.293
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in the woods.</v>

1464
00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:26.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1465
00:56:26.841 --> 00:56:27.674
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1466
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole bit that's based on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>true story about fun and that what Larry</v>

1467
00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Flint's like trials are kind of about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1468
00:56:33.551 --> 00:56:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I think some of them were about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1469
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:38.950
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obscenity is one of those weird things.</v>

1470
00:56:38.951 --> 00:56:40.400
<v Speaker 1>And I know we attributed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1471
00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Vincent Scalia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people corrected me.</v>

1472
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Judge Scalia is that his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not him that says Scalia,</v>

1473
00:56:46.871 --> 00:56:48.940
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not him that said this.</v>

1474
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.490
<v Speaker 1>It's another guy who said this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what pornography is,</v>

1475
00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:54.180
<v Speaker 1>but I know when I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1476
00:56:54.181 --> 00:56:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what blank is,</v>

1478
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:58.330
<v Speaker 1>but I know it when I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:59.380

1480
00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:01.930
<v Speaker 1>probably the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a few of those that erroneously</v>

1481
00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:02.980
<v Speaker 1>attributed to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

<v Speaker 1>actor?</v>

1484

<v Speaker 1>That guy went to jail for obscenity and</v>

<v Speaker 1>he did hard time and he had some hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a straw and made her drink his piss out</v>

<v Speaker 1>They would just mock it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he would be a monster.</v>

1685
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy was talking about a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>poster.</v>

1686
01:05:09.591 --> 01:05:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Yo Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a breakup with her.</v>

1687
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:13.560

<v Speaker 1>I'd be strapping a two by four to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

1689
01:05:15.571 --> 01:05:16.950

<v Speaker 1>See I was lacking from getting sucked</v>

1690
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>into the boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four questions about the life of the</v>

1691
01:05:19.931 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>micro penis reveals about the folding</v>
<v Speaker 1>0.6% of the population to see.</v>

1692
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's enough.</v>

1693
01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>That's dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's if you have a hundred people that</v>

1694
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>means what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people is that less than one?</v>

1695
01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Not even one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No wait 6.6 so 200 people.</v>

1696
01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:36.180
<v Speaker 1>You have one two to 1.2 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1697
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 people.</v>

1698
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.010
<v Speaker 1>So if you at the comedy store six out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand that's right.</v>

1699
01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>If you're the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just two people in the room on a full</v>

1700
01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>house on Saturday night that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my one guy has a micro tech,</v>

1701
01:05:47.261 --> 01:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>well you gotta think it's 50 50 men</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

1702
01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>So one guy in that room was a micro</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

1703
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you make a joke about a micro</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick,</v>

1704
01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:53.014
<v Speaker 1>one guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1705
01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:53.853
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1706
01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:56.580
<v Speaker 1>the joke before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loves so much,</v>

1707
01:05:56.581 --> 01:05:58.210
<v Speaker 1>he's still laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in his head he's like,</v>

1708
01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you agree when you're shitting on</v>

1709
01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:03.300
<v Speaker 1>giant pussies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's the best.</v>

1710
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I love the major pussy joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're too big because these are just</v>

1711
01:06:06.961 --> 01:06:10.200
<v Speaker 1>too big and they are too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get in the way.</v>

1712
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If want to have to urinate,</v>

1713
01:06:12.271 --> 01:06:14.850
<v Speaker 1>it's there from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's crazy to think if a girl</v>

1714
01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:18.480
<v Speaker 1>dates a guy with a micro penis and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sticks around because she was like,</v>

1715
01:06:18.481 --> 01:06:19.314
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good dude.</v>

1716
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1717
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I know a lady who had a few children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had three children with a</v>

1718
01:06:25.561 --> 01:06:28.020
<v Speaker 1>microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided no with a regular peanuts guy.</v>

1719
01:06:28.021 --> 01:06:30.090
<v Speaker 1>He's a handsome fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was quite a sturdy cock.</v>

1720
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an ax handle hefty.</v>

1721
01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.220
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he's of Viking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1722
01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:36.540
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1723
01:06:36.541 --> 01:06:41.010
<v Speaker 1>those kids had a blown a hole through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old car port and so she decided to</v>

1724
01:06:41.011 --> 01:06:44.310
<v Speaker 1>get everything all stitched up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said it was the most painful thing</v>

1725
01:06:44.311 --> 01:06:47.160
<v Speaker 1>that she'd ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally more painful than childbirth</v>

1726
01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:50.520
<v Speaker 1>because they go in there and cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say that again.</v>

1727
01:06:55.230 --> 01:07:00.060
<v Speaker 1>They cut and then they stitch that bitch</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to like a finger gets broken when you</v>

1728
01:07:00.061 --> 01:07:04.200
<v Speaker 1>put it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like tighter than anal and I'm</v>

1729
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:08.100
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably painful and I can't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>strap yourself in.</v>

1730
01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Num Num num goes numb because like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever have surgery when they cut all</v>

1731
01:07:14.581 --> 01:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>those nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times that nerve damage.</v>

1732
01:07:16.761 --> 01:07:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my knee,</v>

1733
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I had a acl reconstruction on one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees with what's called a Patella</v>

1734
01:07:22.861 --> 01:07:24.810
<v Speaker 1>tendon graft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They open you up,</v>

1735
01:07:24.811 --> 01:07:27.060
<v Speaker 1>they'd take a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like foreign slice.</v>

1736
01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.840
<v Speaker 1>They open you up and they take a piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your patella tendon,</v>

1737
01:07:30.841 --> 01:07:32.760
<v Speaker 1>screw all these things and stitch it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>

1738

<v Speaker 1>That whole area.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like we'll do these guys.</v>

1835
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Are they blurring out that guy's hog?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like that it was a hog butt ass</v>

1836
01:11:25.471 --> 01:11:26.011
<v Speaker 2>naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1837
01:11:26.011 --> 01:11:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I originally got in the right light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a little pixelation.</v>

1838
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I originally got into this because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>jerking off to it.</v>

1839
01:11:30.181 --> 01:11:32.880
<v Speaker 2>That's why I wanted to see this stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought they had their hand.</v>

1840
01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:35.010
<v Speaker 2>So they're holding on holding on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

1841
01:11:35.011 --> 01:11:35.351
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1842
01:11:35.351 --> 01:11:38.160
<v Speaker 2>like the guy on the left is winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's all arms.</v>

1843
01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Look at his little bitch ass legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my money on the guy on the right.</v>

1844
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the way the guy on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right or the left rather has</v>

1845
01:11:44.611 --> 01:11:47.490
<v Speaker 2>overdeveloped his arms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>underdeveloped his legs.</v>

1846
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.550
<v Speaker 2>That guy's going to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got in the left.</v>

1847
01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got no legs down.</v>

1848
01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:54.150
<v Speaker 2>That's going to give out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy on the right is Russian.</v>

1849
01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.690
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he's from a hut in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of Siberia.</v>

1850
01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.310
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his whole family lives in a yurt.</v>

1851
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:01.920
<v Speaker 2>You have to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left did not run.</v>

1852
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Look at his legs like he'll get his</v>
<v Speaker 2>calves.</v>

1853
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.880
<v Speaker 2>That guy's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not fit.</v>

1854
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:06.840
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told you.</v>

1855
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.780
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm a good mma commentator</v>
<v Speaker 2>called it.</v>

1856
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I know when I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1857
01:12:11.611 --> 01:12:15.510
<v Speaker 2>it's just like he's jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at his upper body and his</v>

1858
01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:18.420
<v Speaker 2>forearms and shit and his biceps and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders.</v>

1859
01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys jacked.</v>

1860
01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.770
<v Speaker 2>There's no leg strength there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got zero in his legs,</v>

1861
01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:26.520
<v Speaker 2>which means his mind is weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means.</v>

1862
01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:29.370
<v Speaker 2>His mind his week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants everybody to think he's strong,</v>

1863
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.230
<v Speaker 2>but he's not doing the real hard work.</v>

1864
01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're doing squats,</v>

<v Speaker 2>This doesn't even seem real.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I first moved to La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first moved to La,</v>

2145
01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved from La,</v>

2146
01:24:31.810 --> 01:24:34.390
<v Speaker 1>from New York to La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know anyone out here didn't have</v>

<v Speaker 1>any friends.</v>

2148
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:39.340
<v Speaker 1>And I was on this set and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this TV show and I was there</v>

2149
01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:43.570
<v Speaker 1>for like a couple of weeks and I guess I</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't hugged anybody or done,</v>

2150
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.860
<v Speaker 1>touched anybody in a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this girl and set gave me a hug,</v>

2151
01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.740
<v Speaker 1>just gave me a hug and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

2152
01:24:50.741 --> 01:24:53.950
<v Speaker 1>It was like I got filled up with like</v>
<v Speaker 1>affection and love.</v>

2153
01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just real.</v>

2154
01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.250
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the weirdest,</v>

2155
01:24:57.450 --> 01:24:59.620
<v Speaker 1>like I had never experienced that before</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

2156
01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:01.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always had a girlfriend or always had</v>

2157
01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:04.480
<v Speaker 1>friends that it was always some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical contact.</v>

2158
01:25:04.481 --> 01:25:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But out here you were alone.</v>

2159
01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I was alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when this girl hugged me,</v>

2160
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember never forgetting and I'm</v>

2161
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:10.391
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2162
01:25:10.391 --> 01:25:11.910
<v Speaker 1>that was a weird moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a,</v>

2163
01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:16.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a physical requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when that girl hugged me,</v>

2164
01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:17.620
<v Speaker 1>my body was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2165
01:25:17.621 --> 01:25:18.360
<v Speaker 1>this is what we need.</v>

2166
01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.150
<v Speaker 1>It like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2167
01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:21.040
<v Speaker 1>like when you're thirsty and you get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass of water,</v>

2168
01:25:21.041 --> 01:25:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

2169
01:25:22.330 --> 01:25:25.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was like when she hugged</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and it wasn't even the sexual thing.</v>

2170
01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:27.860
<v Speaker 1>It was just a human affection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2171
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they say kids that don't get</v>

2172
01:25:29.711 --> 01:25:30.940
<v Speaker 1>touched when they're young get like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2173
01:25:30.941 --> 01:25:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't get hugged or any affection that</v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up so fucked up mentally.</v>

2174
01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:35.530
<v Speaker 1>It the part of your brain doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop that,</v>

2175
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:36.700
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that meeting,</v>

2176
01:25:36.701 --> 01:25:39.640
<v Speaker 1>that chemical react cause the transfer</v>
<v Speaker 1>of chemicals skin to skin.</v>

2177
01:25:39.641 --> 01:25:41.740
<v Speaker 1>That's like such a big deal for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of your brain.</v>

2178
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:43.990
<v Speaker 1>So when kids don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fucking ruins then.</v>

2179
01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that about babies and</v>

2180
01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.640
<v Speaker 1>orphanages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The babies in orphanages,</v>

2181
01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:49.503
<v Speaker 1>they don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get it.</v>

2182
01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:52.750
<v Speaker 1>They die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can literally die from not being</v>

2183
01:25:52.751 --> 01:25:53.710
<v Speaker 1>held.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a trip.</v>

2184
01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals just fucking put their kids out</v>

2185
01:25:56.681 --> 01:25:58.180
<v Speaker 1>in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get the fuck outta here.</v>

2186
01:25:58.210 --> 01:26:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Get the kick them out of their nest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the fuck face learning to fly.</v>

2187
01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:05.810
<v Speaker 1>He ever seen those birds that fall off</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliffs who showed us that was at</v>

2188
01:26:05.811 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 1>sturgeon now I think I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was last time I was here.</v>

2189
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it was you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 1>The birds that fall just to see if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can stay alive.</v>

2191
01:26:11.961 --> 01:26:14.930
<v Speaker 1>The rocks and half of them die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before I came on,</v>

2192
01:26:14.931 --> 01:26:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I saw that class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2193
01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:19.430
<v Speaker 1>That was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a lot of like dark shit in the,</v>

2194
01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:23.030
<v Speaker 1>in the animal community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about the survival of these</v>

2195
01:26:23.031 --> 01:26:24.560
<v Speaker 1>little beasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absurd.</v>

2196
01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading about how many deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year freeze to death in Idaho.</v>

2197
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Don't ask me why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was,</v>

2198
01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I was reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's thousands.</v>

2199
01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:36.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like sometimes these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd lose thousands of animals.</v>

2200
01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Even tried to migrate somewhere else</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you may have made up.</v>

2201
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Those numbers might be hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like six.</v>

2202
01:26:41.361 --> 01:26:42.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>

2203
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:45.590
<v Speaker 1>They call it winter kill and when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a hard winter,</v>

2204
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:49.100
<v Speaker 1>like a real hard winter and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and hundreds animals this dead</v>

2205
01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:52.670
<v Speaker 1>frozen to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like imagine living in a place where you</v>

2206
01:26:52.671 --> 01:26:55.130
<v Speaker 1>barely make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like cryogenics right?</v>

2207
01:26:55.131 --> 01:26:57.740
<v Speaker 1>When you go to crowd healthcare in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your legs are shaking and you get out of</v>

2208
01:26:57.741 --> 01:27:00.800
<v Speaker 1>there at three minutes and 40 seconds to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone stays in there to six and they</v>

2209
01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:02.990
<v Speaker 1>just become an ice cube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking insane.</v>

2210
01:27:02.991 --> 01:27:04.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what you live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a house,</v>

2211
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:06.680
<v Speaker 1>your stupid fucking deer wandering</v>
<v Speaker 1>around through the woods.</v>

2212
01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:08.030
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your life to get eaten.</v>

2213
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:09.620
<v Speaker 1>That's like back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the Midwest.</v>

2214
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would send out those flyers all the</v>

2215
01:27:11.631 --> 01:27:14.900
<v Speaker 1>time for a registered gun owners to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt.</v>

2216
01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Cause the overpopulation of the deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so bad that they would die or</v>

2217
01:27:18.411 --> 01:27:19.940
<v Speaker 1>that they would try to eat each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

2218
01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It's turning the cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2219
01:27:21.691 --> 01:27:22.890
<v Speaker 1>cause there wasn't a food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2220
01:27:22.891 --> 01:27:25.810
<v Speaker 1>so there was overpopulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a food down enough landmass.</v>

2221
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:29.120
<v Speaker 1>They would try to eat each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

2222
01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:30.950
<v Speaker 1>I'd never heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they'd get,</v>

2223
01:27:30.951 --> 01:27:32.450
<v Speaker 1>they'd get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd pay,</v>

2224
01:27:32.451 --> 01:27:33.284
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2225
01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.080
<v Speaker 1>they would give you incentive to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go hunt if you were,</v>

2226
01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hunter to go take care of some of the</v>

2227
01:27:38.031 --> 01:27:39.560
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's two options.</v>

2228
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Either you hunt them or you bring in</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

2229
01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:44.000
<v Speaker 1>That anthem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that second option is always a bigger</v>

2230
01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:45.230
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way bigger problem.</v>

2231
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Then you change the change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole makeup of it.</v>

2232
01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2233
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:50.840
<v Speaker 1>California is kind of done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>California has done a weird thing</v>

2234
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:54.530
<v Speaker 1>because every other state manages their</v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator population.</v>

2235
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:57.830
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can bear hunt in California,</v>

2236
01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:00.260
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do it in any effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2237
01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:03.380
<v Speaker 1>What that means is like there's two ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really effective ways to hunt</v>

2238
01:28:03.381 --> 01:28:05.300
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is over bait,</v>

2239
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:10.250
<v Speaker 1>so you would like leave some food down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd wait in like a blind and hide</v>

2240
01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:13.820
<v Speaker 1>in the bear would come to get the food</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise the places where bears</v>

2241
01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:15.290
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't live in a open country.</v>

2242
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:20.060
<v Speaker 1>They hide and they smell everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They smell you miles away,</v>

2243
01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:24.050
<v Speaker 1>like literally miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the wind is at your back and the wind</v>

2244
01:28:24.051 --> 01:28:26.720
<v Speaker 1>blows across a valley in a is two miles</v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

2245
01:28:26.721 --> 01:28:29.440
<v Speaker 1>he'll go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll know you there.</v>

2246
01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's not even a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a different kind of thing.</v>

2247
01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.030
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the here way better than you can</v>

2248
01:28:35.031 --> 01:28:36.800
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they see pretty good too.</v>

2249
01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.920
<v Speaker 1>So you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not going to find right.</v>

2250
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.720
<v Speaker 1>So they have a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd have bear hunting and California,</v>

2251
01:28:41.721 --> 01:28:44.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's very ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most people don't,</v>

2252
01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.070
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't put bait,</v>

2253
01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just had to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance that you found.</v>

2254
01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only other place is where,</v>

2255
01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:53.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hunt bears effectively and it's</v>

2256
01:28:53.691 --> 01:28:58.691
<v Speaker 1>not over bait are areas where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wide open spaces or um,</v>

2257
01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>these cut blocks would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cut block is where a lumber</v>

2258
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.480
<v Speaker 2>company comes in and chops down trees</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then these little roots grow up and</v>

2259
01:29:06.481 --> 01:29:09.480
<v Speaker 2>he's little tiny saplings and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bears like to come in and eat</v>

2260
01:29:09.481 --> 01:29:11.160
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And meadows like peep.</v>

2261
01:29:11.161 --> 01:29:13.890
<v Speaker 2>So people go to meadows and occasionally</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll spot a bear there,</v>

2262
01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:19.370
<v Speaker 2>but the does its Predator control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing is I'm with</v>

2263
01:29:19.411 --> 01:29:22.260
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dog one is very problematic because</v>

2264
01:29:22.261 --> 01:29:23.940
<v Speaker 2>people don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2265
01:29:23.941 --> 01:29:27.630
<v Speaker 2>the idea of dogs bang up a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tree and then you shoot it out of a</v>

2266
01:29:27.631 --> 01:29:29.130
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems really fucked up.</v>

2267
01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense to me.</v>

2268
01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mount line one is another one.</v>

2269
01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Like they stopped all mountain lion</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting in this state and I just</v>

2270
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.970
<v Speaker 2>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2271
01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:39.240
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going extinct.</v>

2272
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a lot of mountain lions.</v>

2273
01:29:40.930 --> 01:29:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Why they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they want to get rid of it?</v>

2274
01:29:42.570 --> 01:29:44.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a political thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing is a,</v>

2275
01:29:44.971 --> 01:29:49.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a grizzly bear ban in British</v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia that you can't hunt grizzly</v>

2276
01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:52.090
<v Speaker 2>bears in British Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have a lot of grizzly bears.</v>

2277
01:29:52.091 --> 01:29:53.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

2278
01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:57.270
<v Speaker 2>there was a ban that was put together by</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal rights activists and then signed</v>

2279
01:29:57.271 --> 01:29:59.250
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really just a few thousand people</v>

2280
01:29:59.251 --> 01:30:03.930
<v Speaker 2>that took like an email poll and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pass this 75% of them and now now</v>

2281
01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:06.480
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have a real problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>with grizzly bears because the people</v>

2282
01:30:06.481 --> 01:30:08.810
<v Speaker 2>that passed this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all live in Vancouver.</v>

2283
01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Vancouver is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2284
01:30:10.151 --> 01:30:13.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a city metro area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no grizzly bears,</v>

2285
01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.810
<v Speaker 2>but those other people that live like</v>
<v Speaker 2>north,</v>

2286
01:30:15.811 --> 01:30:19.740
<v Speaker 2>you go like four hours past Vancouver</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these people live in the forest.</v>

2287
01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:25.100
<v Speaker 2>They have giant 10 foot monsters that</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat cows that live in their fucking</v>

2288
01:30:25.231 --> 01:30:26.880
<v Speaker 2>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just said,</v>

2289
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:29.040
<v Speaker 2>you just made it illegal to shoot the</v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>

2290
01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't even live around the</v>

2291
01:30:30.451 --> 01:30:31.860
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know what the fuck you're</v>

2292
01:30:31.861 --> 01:30:33.090
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in a high rise.</v>

2293
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where those people live,</v>

2294
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.200
<v Speaker 2>you can shoot as many wolves as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

2295
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:39.660
<v Speaker 2>so it's gotten so bad up there with</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>

2296
01:30:39.661 --> 01:30:42.810
<v Speaker 2>You could shoot a hundred wolves a day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and every day we need,</v>

2297
01:30:42.811 --> 01:30:44.560
<v Speaker 2>the more they want you to give you money</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>

2298
01:30:44.561 --> 01:30:47.820
<v Speaker 2>and some cases get up and shoot Wolfe's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2299
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Let's go shoot some fucking Wolfe's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

2300
01:30:50.941 --> 01:30:53.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be around wolves that</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to be shot.</v>

2301
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:55.500
<v Speaker 2>I want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I want to be around wolves where</v>

2302
01:30:55.501 --> 01:30:57.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a healthy population where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to do anything.</v>

2303
01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last thing you want to do is be</v>

2304
01:30:59.141 --> 01:31:00.690
<v Speaker 2>around wolves where there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>

2305
01:31:00.691 --> 01:31:03.290
<v Speaker 2>they have to shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when shit gets sketch.</v>

2306
01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when it gets,</v>

2307
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:05.940
<v Speaker 2>when they come after you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2308
01:31:05.941 --> 01:31:06.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2309
01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:08.460
<v Speaker 2>That's when there's a fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a balance.</v>

2310
01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:12.120
<v Speaker 2>There's an issue and that that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens if everybody's like,</v>

2311
01:31:12.121 --> 01:31:12.661
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>

2312
01:31:12.661 --> 01:31:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Landon was Lou and they control their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own population.</v>

2313
01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're correct,</v>

2314
01:31:16.021 --> 01:31:19.230
<v Speaker 2>but it'll take 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you willing to see this</v>

2315
01:31:19.231 --> 01:31:22.710
<v Speaker 2>overpopulation of grizzly pairs</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking wildlife,</v>

2316
01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:25.380
<v Speaker 2>attacking people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking dogs,</v>

2317
01:31:25.381 --> 01:31:27.510
<v Speaker 2>and breaking into people's houses</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that will happen.</v>

2318
01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.820
<v Speaker 2>And will we include coaching in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>land?</v>

2319
01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But guess what?</v>

2320
01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:35.220
<v Speaker 2>If they find out where our food is there</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to encroach into land tissue like</v>

2321
01:31:35.221 --> 01:31:37.800
<v Speaker 2>there's no do we have no land and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>give up.</v>

2322
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Give up your house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2323
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:41.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this like?</v>

2324
01:31:41.201 --> 01:31:44.730
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing when people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a realistic idea of what animal</v>

2325
01:31:44.731 --> 01:31:46.680
<v Speaker 2>life is like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animal Life is beautiful,</v>

2326
01:31:46.681 --> 01:31:50.910
<v Speaker 2>but it's also life with its own ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>about survival and what he wants to do.</v>

2327
01:31:50.911 --> 01:31:53.700
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't manage the predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to have the other</v>

2328
01:31:53.701 --> 01:31:55.070
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to have the deer.</v>

2329
01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.280
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to have the moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

2330
01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:59.110
<v Speaker 2>You've got to manage everything and</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologists know how to do it.</v>

2331
01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 2>But then we get</v>

2332
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.701
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2333
01:32:00.701 --> 01:32:03.630
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2335
01:32:06.011 --> 01:32:07.600
<v Speaker 1>back to California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Flag.</v>

2340
01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:13.480

<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2399
01:34:54.131 --> 01:34:56.590
<v Speaker 1>baby [inaudible].</v>

2400
01:34:57.530 --> 01:35:00.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they did when they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>these bears in California.</v>

2401
01:35:00.411 --> 01:35:02.720
<v Speaker 1>They were just jacking people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they killed them all.</v>

2402
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Like they literally have no bears left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just in California,</v>

2403
01:35:06.710 --> 01:35:08.690
<v Speaker 1>but there's brown bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

2404
01:35:08.691 --> 01:35:10.790
<v Speaker 1>no grizzly bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown bears are much smaller.</v>

2405
01:35:10.791 --> 01:35:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Bare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not only are they not in</v>

2406
01:35:12.771 --> 01:35:14.570
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't even think they're close to</v>

2407
01:35:14.571 --> 01:35:18.890
<v Speaker 1>California kid hair along its back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders appeared to form an ex.</v>

2408
01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a common exper what,</v>

2409
01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:23.950
<v Speaker 1>where's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's all the grizzlies and the candor</v>

2410
01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:24.860
<v Speaker 1>all north?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2411
01:35:24.861 --> 01:35:27.800
<v Speaker 1>You got to go to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I'm correct,</v>

2412
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can find them until</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to like British Columbia.</v>

2413
01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're even in Washington</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

2414
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I think they have them in Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have them in Wyoming.</v>

2415
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:40.700
<v Speaker 1>They're starting to find them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>

2416
01:35:40.701 --> 01:35:42.410
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Adam Green tree,</v>

2417
01:35:42.411 --> 01:35:47.411
<v Speaker 1>the guy was shot that bull up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that giant buffalo water buffalo and the</v>

2418
01:35:47.511 --> 01:35:52.511
<v Speaker 1>top of the flag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude for spotted and filmed them</v>

2419
01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.460
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the San Juan Mountains.</v>

2420
01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the name of the range in</v>

2421
01:35:58.311 --> 01:36:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Colorado where people are saying there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no grizzly bears.</v>

2422
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:02.210
<v Speaker 1>But he found one hit a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2423
01:36:02.211 --> 01:36:05.480
<v Speaker 1>that is all fucking grizzly bear because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's from Australia.</v>

2424
01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Fuck King.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how he talks.</v>

2425
01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Which state has the most grizzly bears?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2426
01:36:11.271 --> 01:36:16.271
<v Speaker 1>600 more live of 1500 left in the lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>48 states that you have about 800 live</v>

2427
01:36:17.061 --> 01:36:20.150
<v Speaker 1>in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She say they gotta be up there 600 more</v>

2428
01:36:20.151 --> 01:36:22.730
<v Speaker 1>live in Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had left and there's an estimated 70</v>

2429
01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:25.310
<v Speaker 1>a hundred living in northern and eastern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idaho.</v>

2430
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was right.</v>

2431
01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.580
<v Speaker 1>And two of them in Texas for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

2432
01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:31.280
<v Speaker 1>but they're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in Colorado now.</v>

2433
01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Adam is right a guarantees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2434
01:36:33.831 --> 01:36:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado borders Wyoming and it borders</v>

2435
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:39.470
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what that area is like.</v>

2436
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.811
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2437
01:36:39.811 --> 01:36:42.740
<v Speaker 1>what's on the edges of Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Wyoming's on one side,</v>

2438
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:45.080
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you they've crossed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

2439
01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utah Biologists or they're questioning</v>

2440
01:36:47.581 --> 01:36:48.740
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the validity of this.</v>

2441
01:36:48.741 --> 01:36:51.830
<v Speaker 1>But Adam has been around bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only is he been around bears,</v>

2442
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:55.610
<v Speaker 1>he's filmed himself getting charged with</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears while he's holding up a pistol and</v>

2443
01:36:55.611 --> 01:36:59.810
<v Speaker 1>put it on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on a 28 day back country hunt in</v>

2444
01:36:59.811 --> 01:37:01.250
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do we got here?</v>

2445
01:37:01.251 --> 01:37:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's off to the left as Utah,</v>

2446
01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one side,</v>

2447
01:37:04.731 --> 01:37:06.620
<v Speaker 1>there's no bearing on the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2448
01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:09.650
<v Speaker 1>So they come down from the top man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guarantee you.</v>

2449
01:37:09.651 --> 01:37:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fort Collins is right there.</v>

2450
01:37:11.211 --> 01:37:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you there's some grizzly</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears there.</v>

2451
01:37:13.190 --> 01:37:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Adam knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

2452
01:37:14.541 --> 01:37:17.660
<v Speaker 1>this is not like a like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I went into the woods and other dude</v>

2453
01:37:17.670 --> 01:37:18.470
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh grizzly bear,</v>

2454
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:19.303
<v Speaker 1>don't listen to me.</v>

2455
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:20.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2456
01:37:20.970 --> 01:37:22.430
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows,</v>

2457
01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:25.850
<v Speaker 1>he knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's sure he can see one.</v>

2458
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:28.310
<v Speaker 1>You know a mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it through a spotting scope and</v>

2459
01:37:28.311 --> 01:37:29.450
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a grizzly bear,</v>

2460
01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:30.590
<v Speaker 1>right where I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2461
01:37:30.591 --> 01:37:32.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's big ass to pick.</v>

2462
01:37:32.511 --> 01:37:35.060
<v Speaker 1>There might be a big brown bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was positive.</v>

2463
01:37:35.061 --> 01:37:38.180
<v Speaker 1>It was a grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said about big fucking Grizzly,</v>

2464
01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Ken Baisley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people have other people spotted</v>

2465
01:37:41.061 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 1>them too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people have called bullshit on him,</v>

2466
01:37:42.531 --> 01:37:44.660
<v Speaker 1>but there he is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is him.</v>

2467
01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Hold up the pistol and you see bite by</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tree to the left of that train.</v>

2468
01:37:48.650 --> 01:37:50.360
<v Speaker 1>The fog in the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking bear.</v>

2469
01:37:50.361 --> 01:37:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Standing at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legs.</v>

2470
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it.</v>

2471
01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 1>See it standing in the fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

2472
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.780
<v Speaker 2>The thing rushed him three or four</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

2473
01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Now here's where it gets crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a gun but the gun had the wrong</v>

2474
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:06.150
<v Speaker 2>size bullets and he didn't even know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was jammed.</v>

2475
01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:10.200
<v Speaker 2>So even though he thinks that he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to shoot that bear,</v>

2476
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:13.260
<v Speaker 2>he really wouldn't be able to because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bullet isn't even in the fucking</v>

2477
01:38:13.261 --> 01:38:15.090
<v Speaker 2>chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that 300,</v>

2478
01:38:15.091 --> 01:38:20.091
<v Speaker 2>4,000 views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was in uh,</v>

2479
01:38:20.251 --> 01:38:22.680
<v Speaker 2>believe that was an Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2480
01:38:22.681 --> 01:38:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Youdo you think that was an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's where he was.</v>

2481
01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.210
<v Speaker 2>And then here's the other big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shoot that fucking thing and you</v>

2482
01:38:30.211 --> 01:38:33.090
<v Speaker 2>know you're in real big trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to prove that that thing was</v>

2483
01:38:33.091 --> 01:38:34.590
<v Speaker 2>trying to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had video,</v>

2484
01:38:34.591 --> 01:38:36.060
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2485
01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.310
<v Speaker 2>he did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why I filmed it,</v>

2486
01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.110
<v Speaker 2>to let it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he had been charged,</v>

2487
01:38:40.111 --> 01:38:41.430
<v Speaker 2>bluff charged a few times.</v>

2488
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:45.180
<v Speaker 2>I'd run up to within stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always a woman with her babies.</v>

2489
01:38:45.181 --> 01:38:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Like she's just trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a woman,</v>

2490
01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:49.710
<v Speaker 2>female bear with their babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's trying to protect these bitches.</v>

01:38:49.711 --> 01:38:54.711
<v Speaker 2>Are Bears fucking charging me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mama trying to protect her cubs.</v>

2492

<v Speaker 2>I get it that the dudes don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't charge now.</v>

2493
01:38:58.621 --> 01:39:00.240
<v Speaker 2>They just hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll fuck you up.</v>

2494
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a dude is charging you,</v>

2495
01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:04.230
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really hungry.</v>

2496
01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:07.170

<v Speaker 2>Most of the time the males are just run</v>

2497
01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:09.670
<v Speaker 2>away in the less and less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2498
01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:12.780
<v Speaker 2>you kill something and then it decides</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take it from you.</v>

2499
01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Like if you kill a deer and it's wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2500
01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:16.620
<v Speaker 2>yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better let it fucking have it.</v>

2501
01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:18.810
<v Speaker 2>You have to fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2502
01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.870
<v Speaker 2>in certain places you have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even allowed to scare them</v>

2503
01:39:21.871 --> 01:39:23.610
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2504
01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would let them dates.</v>

2505
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:29.550
<v Speaker 2>There's some states it might be Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2506
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:31.440
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be Wyoming,</v>

2507
01:39:31.650 --> 01:39:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's one state where once you</v>

2508
01:39:35.131 --> 01:39:37.410
<v Speaker 2>shoot something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it might be Idaho,</v>

2509
01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.890
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those states we just keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping and keep jumping.</v>

2510
01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:43.050
<v Speaker 2>They could be North Dakota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a bear finds your your meat,</v>

2511
01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.810
<v Speaker 2>you have to leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to leave the bear with your</v>

01:39:45.811 --> 01:39:46.680
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to give up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>wouldn't let you scare off a prison.</v>

2529
01:40:19.351 --> 01:40:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go to a place that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:22.081
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2533
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:26.700
<v Speaker 2>I only bird on him when I was a kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>burden directly.</v>

2534
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I did dear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a bird hunted a lot when I was a</v>

2535
01:40:28.381 --> 01:40:29.430
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad loved bird hunting.</v>

2536
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.730
<v Speaker 2>The thing about deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean even bird hunting,</v>

2537
01:40:32.731 --> 01:40:36.230
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you're in the right place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could run into a wolf or a bear.</v>

2538
01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.910
<v Speaker 2>You could if you kill a bear in</v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive license,</v>

2539
01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:41.670
<v Speaker 2>life and property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barris killed in defensive life and</v>

2540
01:40:41.671 --> 01:40:43.740
<v Speaker 2>property belonged to the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you kill a bear,</v>

2541
01:40:43.741 --> 01:40:46.650
<v Speaker 2>you must remove the hide from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>carcass and also salvage the skull.</v>

2542
01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:49.620
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened to my friend Cam Haynes.</v>

2543
01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:51.840
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a crazy bears are bro.</v>

2544
01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 2>He shot a bear with a bow</v>

2545
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:59.020
<v Speaker 1>and Arrow killed it and then another</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear claimed the body and start a</v>

2546
01:40:59.030 --> 01:41:01.270
<v Speaker 1>burring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this female bear.</v>

2547
01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit just decided as mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna eat this.</v>

2548
01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.790
<v Speaker 1>And because they cannibalize each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

2549
01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% of all bears are cannibals.</v>

2550
01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:11.470
<v Speaker 1>They just all kind of one bears dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other ones to start eating it,</v>

2551
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:13.390
<v Speaker 1>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start eating it.</v>

2552
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:17.320
<v Speaker 1>This is how fucked up it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Buddy lives in Alberta and uh,</v>

2553
01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:22.321
<v Speaker 1>his son watched a bear kill a cub and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then watched the mom eat the baby.</v>

2554
01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2555
01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Like the mom chased the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bear off that killed the cub and</v>

2556
01:41:27.191 --> 01:41:28.840
<v Speaker 1>then she ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2557
01:41:28.841 --> 01:41:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Well cause it's dead at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was she going to do?</v>

2558
01:41:30.490 --> 01:41:34.180
<v Speaker 1>But it's just what patrician yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what it is.</v>

01:41:34.181 --> 01:41:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's literally how they,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2561
01:41:36.401 --> 01:41:37.420
<v Speaker 1>that's how they roll up there.</v>

2562
01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:38.670
<v Speaker 1>You've never looked at your kid and been</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pop the legs off.</v>

2567
01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:48.760

<v Speaker 1>when you're down to that point,</v>

2568
01:41:48.761 --> 01:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in like one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2569
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:52.150

<v Speaker 1>off first?</v>

2574
01:42:01.050 --> 01:42:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Like once you get to the point where</v>

2626
01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:03.200
<v Speaker 3>So boner pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boner pills.</v>

2627
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.900
<v Speaker 3>They want to get hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you just don't get it.</v>

2628
01:44:04.901 --> 01:44:06.310
<v Speaker 3>Models,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boner pills.</v>

2629
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:08.600
<v Speaker 3>They give you a bottle of skiing down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hill,</v>

2630
01:44:08.601 --> 01:44:12.530
<v Speaker 3>which is a fucking hard dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2631
01:44:12.531 --> 01:44:15.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what those things do is dilate.</v>

2632
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:19.850
<v Speaker 3>They dilate your muscles and apparently</v>
<v Speaker 3>that helps you breathe easier when</v>

2633
01:44:19.851 --> 01:44:22.610
<v Speaker 3>you're at high altitude it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it definitely does because they</v>

2634
01:44:22.611 --> 01:44:24.350
<v Speaker 3>have like we go to breckenridge every</v>
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

2635
01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:29.350

<v Speaker 3>halfway up the side mountain we sleep at</v>

2637
01:44:32.031 --> 01:44:33.920
<v Speaker 3>about 11 to 11,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 feet.</v>

2638
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.850
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that takes a while to adapt to not easy.</v>

2639
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:39.680
<v Speaker 3>Well if we go to Denver for three or</v>
<v Speaker 3>four days,</v>

2640
01:44:39.681 --> 01:44:42.200
<v Speaker 3>but three days beforehand you get it a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little easier,</v>

2641
01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:43.640
<v Speaker 3>you get a little bump easier.</v>

2642
01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:48.260
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else is not just there's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>one of the highest out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2645
01:44:52.281 --> 01:44:55.240

<v Speaker 3>It's like anywhere from 10,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right near like near the house and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>till like 11,</v>

2648
01:44:58.011 --> 01:45:01.040
<v Speaker 3>two is where it usually ends up cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got my altimeter on my phone.</v>

2649
01:45:01.041 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how high.</v>

2650
01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use one of those two.</v>

2651
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:06.260
<v Speaker 3>I just want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like no one and doesn't have work.</v>

2652
01:45:06.261 --> 01:45:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Even if you don't have service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.870
<v Speaker 3>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2654
01:45:08.871 --> 01:45:11.870
<v Speaker 3>do the things are still sending data</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't have service GPS?</v>

2655
01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2656
01:45:12.801 --> 01:45:14.780
<v Speaker 3>We've just accepted that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government's tracking us.</v>

2657
01:45:14.781 --> 01:45:15.710
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine with it.</v>

2658
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:16.491
<v Speaker 3>We'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When this thing,</v>

2659
01:45:16.491 --> 01:45:18.530
<v Speaker 3>when I first got to Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing that I did,</v>

2660
01:45:18.531 --> 01:45:19.364
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hello?</v>

2661
01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It flips over and it tells you exactly</v>

2662
01:45:22.611 --> 01:45:24.800
<v Speaker 3>where you are without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no service on it.</v>

2663
01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:26.740
<v Speaker 3>It was like poop pinpoint that Google</v>
<v Speaker 3>maps was like,</v>

2664
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:27.783
<v Speaker 3>oop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right there.</v>

2665
01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a trip,</v>

2666
01:45:28.971 --> 01:45:31.130
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never not sending and receiving</v>

2667
01:45:31.131 --> 01:45:31.964
<v Speaker 3>data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2668
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Constantly been on airplane mode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still sending and receiving data.</v>

2669
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:36.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew this lady used to work for CNN</v>

2670
01:45:36.771 --> 01:45:38.610
<v Speaker 3>and when she would go to places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2671
01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:40.280
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had an iphone,</v>

2672
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:42.140
<v Speaker 3>like she would go to these Middle</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eastern places.</v>

2673
01:45:42.141 --> 01:45:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Do they have to talk to people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>interview them?</v>

2674
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:45.530
<v Speaker 3>They would take your phone away if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>had an iphone,</v>

2675
01:45:45.710 --> 01:45:47.640
<v Speaker 3>if you had an android phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take the battery out.</v>

2676
01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:48.860
<v Speaker 3>And the olden days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2677
01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:50.450
<v Speaker 3>But if you had an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just say,</v>

2678
01:45:50.451 --> 01:45:51.980
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're taking that phone shit.</v>

2679
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:54.680
<v Speaker 3>You're being tracked and listened to</v>
<v Speaker 3>100% period.</v>

2680
01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:58.580
<v Speaker 3>You're in some fucking bow rain place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some weird fucking,</v>

2681
01:45:58.581 --> 01:46:00.170
<v Speaker 3>they take away your eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go with your phone.</v>

2682
01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:01.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what she would meet with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2683
01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Do you do that at shows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2684
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:06.440
<v Speaker 3>do you take away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you do now you do the pouch thing,</v>

2685
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:08.510
<v Speaker 3>the yonder patches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>patches rather.</v>

2686
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:11.120
<v Speaker 3>It's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard changes the game.</v>

2687
01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:14.240
<v Speaker 3>It changes the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like first of all you could always,</v>

2688
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:16.550
<v Speaker 3>if you have important phone calls I have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do is just leave the room.</v>

2689
01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.890
<v Speaker 3>The phone will ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you leave the room,</v>

2690
01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:21.110
<v Speaker 3>you open the pouch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you get out of the room and you can</v>

2691
01:46:21.111 --> 01:46:22.520
<v Speaker 3>come back in and put it back in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pouch,</v>

2692
01:46:22.521 --> 01:46:23.560
<v Speaker 3>you come back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we did.</v>

2693
01:46:23.561 --> 01:46:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Touches are not with them that their</v>
<v Speaker 3>stretches with you.</v>

2694
01:46:25.670 --> 01:46:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh you saved the pocs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have the key.</v>

2695
01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fronts all locked up.</v>

2696
01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you go out,</v>

2697
01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:32.090
<v Speaker 3>they opened it up like people will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not giving my phone up.</v>

2698
01:46:32.091 --> 01:46:33.950
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to give your phone using</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hands,</v>

2699
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:36.650
<v Speaker 3>but you're in this pouch and when you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>out they open,</v>

2700
01:46:36.651 --> 01:46:38.900
<v Speaker 3>the pouch takes three seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it opens up,</v>

2701
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:40.400
<v Speaker 3>you get the phone out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you'd like,</v>

2702
01:46:40.401 --> 01:46:44.390
<v Speaker 3>say if you have a babysitter at your</v>
<v Speaker 3>house or something like that issue you</v>

2703
01:46:44.391 --> 01:46:47.150
<v Speaker 3>can check it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the pouch it doesn't disable the</v>

2704
01:46:47.151 --> 01:46:48.890
<v Speaker 3>phone from not getting service or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2705
01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:50.790
<v Speaker 3>See that's what I think they should</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out.</v>

2706
01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.350
<v Speaker 3>Well cause it's a public service to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

2707
01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:55.200
<v Speaker 3>If there was an urgency though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that would,</v>

2708
01:46:55.230 --> 01:46:57.090
<v Speaker 3>that would prevent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see what the thing is that's good about</v>

2709
01:46:57.091 --> 01:47:00.930
<v Speaker 3>the pouch is that if you really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's some critical issue that you</v>

2710
01:47:00.931 --> 01:47:03.690
<v Speaker 3>think could come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know your phone's ringing like okay</v>

2711
01:47:03.691 --> 01:47:04.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to leave the drain.</v>

2712
01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:06.870
<v Speaker 3>But then it gives people incentive to</v>
<v Speaker 3>still have their phone on to ring.</v>

2713
01:47:06.930 --> 01:47:08.370
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is true.</v>

2714
01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:12.540
<v Speaker 3>That is true to me is saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what's true.</v>

2715
01:47:12.570 --> 01:47:16.650
<v Speaker 3>How often did the emergent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the show is two hours in an emergency</v>

2716
01:47:16.651 --> 01:47:18.540
<v Speaker 3>happens within that gap of time of two</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

2717
01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the University of Spain like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is life.</v>

2718
01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:22.650
<v Speaker 3>The fuck the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

2719
01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:24.660
<v Speaker 3>You have kids that nobody wants to hear</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2720
01:47:24.690 --> 01:47:25.291
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

2721
01:47:25.291 --> 01:47:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like,</v>

2722
01:47:26.611 --> 01:47:27.940
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2723
01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.420
<v Speaker 3>this show is so much fucking better to</v>
<v Speaker 3>way better without the phone.</v>

2724
01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.270
<v Speaker 3>Have you done one of those shows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2725
01:47:33.570 --> 01:47:35.720
<v Speaker 3>you should come with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll do a do a gig together.</v>

2726
01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:37.410
<v Speaker 3>I would love that because the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2727
01:47:37.411 --> 01:47:39.600
<v Speaker 3>I thought when I heard it I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the most brilliant shit I've ever</v>

2728
01:47:39.601 --> 01:47:40.230
<v Speaker 3>heard in my life.</v>

2729
01:47:40.230 --> 01:47:41.790
<v Speaker 3>It's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

2730
01:47:41.791 --> 01:47:43.920
<v Speaker 3>it's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think gets people mentally in a place</v>

2731
01:47:43.921 --> 01:47:45.200
<v Speaker 3>where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna enjoy the shelf.</v>

2732
01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2733
01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:47.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to fucking think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsuit.</v>

2734
01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got their phone up</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere you go.</v>

2735
01:47:49.681 --> 01:47:51.330
<v Speaker 3>They have their phone up film and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2736
01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.700
<v Speaker 3>They want to film everything and want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take pictures of everything and it's a</v>

2737
01:47:53.701 --> 01:47:56.550
<v Speaker 3>distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just went to go see the friend of a</v>

2738
01:47:56.551 --> 01:47:57.850

2739
01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:59.000
<v Speaker 3>like abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2740
01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:02.210
<v Speaker 3>even that like small nonsense venues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people sell their fault.</v>

2741
01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:03.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2742
01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:05.280
<v Speaker 3>it's like fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2743
01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:08.610
<v Speaker 3>a massively famous like Bruno Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like every kid.</v>

2744
01:48:08.611 --> 01:48:10.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's like good the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

2745
01:48:10.651 --> 01:48:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Even like a small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny little venue where I was like 80</v>

2746
01:48:14.011 --> 01:48:17.130
<v Speaker 3>people all have their phones out too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought those would just be a little</v>

2747
01:48:17.131 --> 01:48:18.030
<v Speaker 3>bit more chill.</v>

2748
01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:20.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it's less of an issue with</v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

2749
01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:22.470
<v Speaker 3>although some people do have an issue</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

2750
01:48:22.650 --> 01:48:24.570
<v Speaker 3>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with music,</v>

2751
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:25.830
<v Speaker 3>you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the,</v>

2752
01:48:25.831 --> 01:48:27.600
<v Speaker 3>you already know the songs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2753
01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.660
<v Speaker 3>Like with jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you're working on a new</v>

2754
01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:30.930
<v Speaker 3>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2755
01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:33.990
<v Speaker 3>And you go to the laugh factory and five</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the audience are filming you</v>

2756
01:48:33.991 --> 01:48:35.840
<v Speaker 3>and they want to put it on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like your,</v>

2757
01:48:35.841 --> 01:48:37.860
<v Speaker 3>your jokes are half Kodaly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying,</v>

2758
01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:41.730
<v Speaker 3>comedy is one of the weird art forms</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to practice it in front</v>

2759
01:48:41.731 --> 01:48:43.110
<v Speaker 3>of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2760
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:45.990
<v Speaker 3>You could write it alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you really don't know how it goes</v>

2761
01:48:45.991 --> 01:48:47.670
<v Speaker 3>together until you try it in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

2762
01:48:47.671 --> 01:48:52.050
<v Speaker 3>And out of all the bits that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of them start off and they eat</v>

2763
01:48:52.051 --> 01:48:53.370
<v Speaker 3>dick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most?</v>

2764
01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:57.660
<v Speaker 3>Almost all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like one or two that you do that</v>

2765
01:48:57.661 --> 01:48:58.710
<v Speaker 3>you right away that hits and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>oh right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah.</v>

2767
01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:00.171
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

2768
01:49:00.171 --> 01:49:03.450
<v Speaker 3>From start desperately bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to try to figure out how to make it</v>

2769
01:49:03.451 --> 01:49:06.960
<v Speaker 3>work somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where the fuck is it?</v>

2770
01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:08.820
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're trying to convey that to</v>

2771
01:49:08.821 --> 01:49:09.210
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2772
01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:10.800

2773
01:49:10.890 --> 01:49:13.920
<v Speaker 3>you just haven't heard it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just you'll hear it in a year,</v>

2774
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:19.230
<v Speaker 3>come back in a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the [inaudible] and even then like even</v>

2775
01:49:19.231 --> 01:49:21.390
<v Speaker 3>when you got something down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes I'd take a chance with</v>

2776
01:49:21.391 --> 01:49:22.830
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe I'm not totally done with</v>

2777
01:49:22.831 --> 01:49:24.520
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We take it out on a left turn.</v>

2778
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:25.140
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

2779
01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:26.250
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to like stuff.</v>

2780
01:49:26.251 --> 01:49:30.090
<v Speaker 3>When I find that I tried once and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>hated it and like a year later and then</v>

2781
01:49:30.091 --> 01:49:31.110
<v Speaker 3>I tried again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it works.</v>

2782
01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:31.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

2783
01:49:31.931 --> 01:49:33.010
<v Speaker 3>That I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2784
01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Well you don't even know why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's wrong with me then?</v>

2785
01:49:36.091 --> 01:49:37.080
<v Speaker 3>And write with me now.</v>

2786
01:49:37.110 --> 01:49:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Something about the rhythm of the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>you even thought about it.</v>

2787
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.080
<v Speaker 3>Like I think sometimes when I get an</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of a joke and the rhythm of the</v>

2788
01:49:43.081 --> 01:49:44.370
<v Speaker 3>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even find,</v>

2789
01:49:44.371 --> 01:49:45.450
<v Speaker 3>like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know why.</v>

2790
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I just kinda liked the idea that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>some reason and then a year or two later</v>

2791
01:49:48.491 --> 01:49:51.460
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something else usually happens that</v>

2792
01:49:51.461 --> 01:49:54.040
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just like when I felt blank and</v>

2793
01:49:54.041 --> 01:49:55.540
<v Speaker 3>then these things kind of like Mesh</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

2794
01:49:55.541 --> 01:49:57.160
<v Speaker 3>It was just like the missing piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2795
01:49:57.161 --> 01:50:01.690
<v Speaker 3>what's in your head is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why Theo Vaughn so fucking funny.</v>

2796
01:50:01.691 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 3>It's my guy because Theo's act is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>so ridiculous.</v>

2797
01:50:05.770 --> 01:50:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you see it,</v>

2798
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:10.630
<v Speaker 3>if you saw it on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of bits that you'd see on</v>

2799
01:50:10.631 --> 01:50:11.261
<v Speaker 3>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You how,</v>

2800
01:50:11.261 --> 01:50:12.550
<v Speaker 3>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's funny.</v>

2801
01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:13.890
<v Speaker 3>And then you see him live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2802
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:15.640
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

2803
01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:18.430
<v Speaker 3>In his head he knows why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

2804
01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows why that's funny.</v>

2805
01:50:19.721 --> 01:50:23.050
<v Speaker 3>And then he tells it to you in the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's going on in his head and you</v>

2806
01:50:23.051 --> 01:50:24.600
<v Speaker 3>start fucking howling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2807
01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:27.520
<v Speaker 3>But like if you're not totally sure if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>

2808
01:50:27.521 --> 01:50:30.280
<v Speaker 3>which you usually aren't when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying something out on stage,</v>

2809
01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:32.110
<v Speaker 3>they can kind of tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

2810
01:50:32.111 --> 01:50:36.430
<v Speaker 3>You're not totally sure the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if someone films that and then puts</v>

2811
01:50:36.431 --> 01:50:38.230
<v Speaker 3>it on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's not good,</v>

2812
01:50:38.231 --> 01:50:40.450
<v Speaker 3>like say me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm an Andrew Santino fan and I go</v>

2814
01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.710
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say you haven't really seen him.</v>

2815
01:50:44.711 --> 01:50:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

2816
01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:46.890
<v Speaker 3>it's an embryo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2817
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.551
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2818
01:50:47.551 --> 01:50:50.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You saw the beginning stages of what is</v>

2819
01:50:50.141 --> 01:50:51.160
<v Speaker 3>going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2820
01:50:51.161 --> 01:50:52.950
<v Speaker 3>That's stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole filming of,</v>

2821
01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:53.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2822
01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:55.000
<v Speaker 3>of shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they still,</v>

2823
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:57.370
<v Speaker 3>they bus people at the store all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time for her trying to do that.</v>

2824
01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:59.290
<v Speaker 3>But there's still people that tried to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get away with it.</v>

2825
01:50:59.291 --> 01:51:02.890
<v Speaker 3>They UCP poking up there for just fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are just fans.</v>

2826
01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.380
<v Speaker 3>I would say most people are just a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just want to have that little</v>

2827
01:51:05.381 --> 01:51:07.570
<v Speaker 3>piece.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like in any other world that would be so</v>
<v Speaker 3>rude.</v>

2853
01:52:03.761 --> 01:52:07.740
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were just standing by</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to your friend and both of you</v>

2854
01:52:07.741 --> 01:52:10.810
<v Speaker 3>are an insurance salesman and a guy came</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and put a phone in your face,</v>

2855
01:52:10.811 --> 01:52:12.430
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this guy?</v>

2856
01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:14.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm insured by state farm so I get to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2857
01:52:15.010 --> 01:52:16.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pay,</v>

2858
01:52:16.001 --> 01:52:17.620
<v Speaker 3>you want to be in public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the film yet</v>

2859
01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:22.300
<v Speaker 3>like that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a thing that people have decided,</v>

2860
01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people in their head like this guy</v>

2861
01:52:24.461 --> 01:52:26.950
<v Speaker 3>with a camera that if you are a famous</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

2862
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:28.930
<v Speaker 3>like anything you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>

2863
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:30.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm allowed to film you everywhere you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

2864
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.970
<v Speaker 3>I'll take pictures because he does this</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's this big disconnect that</v>

2865
01:52:34.110 --> 01:52:37.300
<v Speaker 3>that people that are famous are people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this thing that's like,</v>

2866
01:52:37.301 --> 01:52:38.134
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ours now.</v>

2867
01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:41.440
<v Speaker 3>We we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we made you famous so now you're ours.</v>

2868
01:52:41.441 --> 01:52:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Whatever we want from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that idea is fucking crazy to me</v>

2869
01:52:44.381 --> 01:52:45.870
<v Speaker 3>that someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're barely human.</v>

2870
01:52:45.871 --> 01:52:47.900
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they don't treat people like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not human.</v>

2871
01:52:47.901 --> 01:52:48.950
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2872
01:52:48.951 --> 01:52:50.780
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good.</v>

2873
01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Is the TMZ guys for the most part and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come up to with the cameras,</v>

2874
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:56.060
<v Speaker 3>they're very good guys.</v>

2875
01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:57.390
<v Speaker 3>Like for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2876
01:52:57.410 --> 01:52:59.450
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them are actually comics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2877
01:52:59.451 --> 01:53:02.390
<v Speaker 3>do it as a few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew where comics that are struggling</v>

2878
01:53:02.391 --> 01:53:05.120
<v Speaker 3>and they meet people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the airport and asking weird questions</v>

2879
01:53:05.121 --> 01:53:06.950
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time it's no big deal.</v>

2880
01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.510
<v Speaker 3>I'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go cheese or Cheddar.</v>

2881
01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:12.180
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the fucking weirdest.</v>

2882
01:53:12.190 --> 01:53:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Oftentimes the questions are so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2883
01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:15.920
<v Speaker 3>well they're just trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2884
01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:18.020
<v Speaker 3>but that's how they're getting by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2885
01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's just,</v>

2886
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.210
<v Speaker 3>there's almost never a good idea to</v>
<v Speaker 3>answer those questions.</v>

2887
01:53:23.250 --> 01:53:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you look like a fucking idiot?</v>

2888
01:53:24.921 --> 01:53:26.810
<v Speaker 3>No matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2889
01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:28.910
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone got Anthony Bordain at the</v>

2890
01:53:28.911 --> 01:53:31.490
<v Speaker 3>airport and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were going to cook dinner for</v>

2891
01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump and Kim Jong Moon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you serve?</v>

2892
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:35.300
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hemlock.</v>

2893
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:38.630
<v Speaker 3>And then all the magma assholes went</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy.</v>

2894
01:53:38.690 --> 01:53:40.430
<v Speaker 3>That's a porridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's threatening to kill the</v>

2895
01:53:40.431 --> 01:53:41.440
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That said,</v>

2896
01:53:41.441 --> 01:53:45.620
<v Speaker 3>someone called the finger fair with and</v>
<v Speaker 3>juvenile arrested</v>

2897
01:53:47.690 --> 01:53:50.540
<v Speaker 3>fucking maggot hats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all filled with sweat around the brim</v>

2898
01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:55.670
<v Speaker 3>for anything like a foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His hat smells like a foot going to kill</v>

2899
01:53:55.671 --> 01:53:59.360
<v Speaker 3>the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Mr. Secret service agent.</v>

2900
01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:04.540
<v Speaker 3>I want you to rest on your birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no joking about the pregnant.</v>

2901
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:09.980
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile all he does is crack jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2902
01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:13.850
<v Speaker 3>I wish he really did say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That motherfucker line while he was</v>

2903
01:54:13.851 --> 01:54:15.440
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

2904
01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:17.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit would be hilarious if he did</v>

2905
01:54:17.781 --> 01:54:19.370
<v Speaker 3>that as president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would everybody do?</v>

2906
01:54:19.371 --> 01:54:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2907
01:54:19.710 --> 01:54:23.600
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote right now the president to not</v>

2908
01:54:24.230 --> 01:54:26.300
<v Speaker 3>to not cuss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of like a,</v>

2909
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:28.100
<v Speaker 3>but I think that like when he tweeted</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2910
01:54:28.101 --> 01:54:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Kim Jong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who to call him little rocket man.</v>

2911
01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:31.160
<v Speaker 3>That was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So funny.</v>

2912
01:54:31.190 --> 01:54:33.260
<v Speaker 3>That was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just plain funny.</v>

01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2915
01:54:34.941 --> 01:54:37.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why Kim Jong Moon said I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was old.</v>

2916
01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:42.580
<v Speaker 3>I would never say he short and fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a return to like comic.</v>

2917
01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's making the exact same thing.</v>

2919
01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so funny.</v>

2920

<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile,</v>

2923
01:54:58.250 --> 01:55:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Kim Jong Moon now wants to sign a peace</v>
<v Speaker 3>treaty.</v>

2924
01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:02.000

2943
01:55:38.511 --> 01:55:40.070
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not even close.</v>

2944
01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:43.440
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is the fucking grand champion of</v>

2945
01:55:43.441 --> 01:55:46.740
<v Speaker 3>being an entertaining for as long as he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't blow us up and he gets out</v>

2946
01:55:46.741 --> 01:55:50.370
<v Speaker 3>without getting in the box like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's highly possible.</v>

2947
01:55:50.371 --> 01:55:51.810
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make it out of this one</v>
<v Speaker 3>alive,</v>

2948
01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:54.120

<v Speaker 3>he gets through the whole thing.</v>

2949
01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:55.410
<v Speaker 3>I think he's going to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>

2950
01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I think he'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

2951
01:55:57.090 --> 01:56:00.380
<v Speaker 3>let me say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last four years or eight years and</v>

2952
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:02.010
<v Speaker 3>look at all these in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of liberals are like,</v>

2953
01:56:02.011 --> 01:56:03.060
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

2954
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:05.510
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it lasts ever trump.</v>

2955
01:56:05.610 --> 01:56:08.490
<v Speaker 3>If it lasts for eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one thing they'll that we will all</v>

2956
01:56:08.491 --> 01:56:09.720
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll look back on.</v>

2957
01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:10.531
<v Speaker 3>We'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2958
01:56:10.531 --> 01:56:13.620
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took that thing for us to talk about.</v>

2959
01:56:13.621 --> 01:56:16.110
<v Speaker 3>A lot of things like the me too movement</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have never happened.</v>

2960
01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:18.750
<v Speaker 3>If Hillary got in office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah it would have.</v>

2961
01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

2962
01:56:19.861 --> 01:56:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein got exposed.</v>

2963
01:56:21.450 --> 01:56:24.200
<v Speaker 3>That's the hardest one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think we're,</v>

2964
01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.760
<v Speaker 3>we're tumble effect of what happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>with him.</v>

2965
01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:29.580
<v Speaker 3>I agree too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it all helped in together.</v>

2966
01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2967
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:33.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying like I bet you the</v>
<v Speaker 3>harvey thing wouldn't have been so real</v>

2968
01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:37.170
<v Speaker 3>and Hillary got in cause it cause all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the liberals that condemned all the</v>

2969
01:56:37.171 --> 01:56:39.030
<v Speaker 3>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the liberals that called out,</v>

2970
01:56:39.031 --> 01:56:40.560
<v Speaker 3>people like harvey and everyone in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

2971
01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:43.200
<v Speaker 3>they would have been so gleeful of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>hillary thing.</v>

2972
01:56:43.201 --> 01:56:45.180
<v Speaker 3>I think that would've still been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2973
01:56:45.210 --> 01:56:48.130
<v Speaker 3>well we'll cover it up like we've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing for the [inaudible].</v>

2974
01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.880
<v Speaker 3>It's not like it just started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been going on.</v>

2975
01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:53.430
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not suppress stories before because</v>

2976
01:56:53.431 --> 01:56:55.170
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got these people to support.</v>

2977
01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:57.520
<v Speaker 3>I just think the power of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2978
01:56:58.020 --> 01:56:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I think the timing was perfect with</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

2979
01:56:59.670 --> 01:57:00.710
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying like I think,</v>

2980
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:02.720
<v Speaker 3>think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think those things led to it just</v>

2981
01:57:02.730 --> 01:57:03.690
<v Speaker 3>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2982
01:57:03.691 --> 01:57:04.501
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to do something.</v>

2983
01:57:04.501 --> 01:57:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it was definitely a factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I bet you it wouldn't happen so fast</v>

2984
01:57:06.961 --> 01:57:08.580
<v Speaker 3>with Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you that would have been a longer</v>

2985
01:57:08.581 --> 01:57:09.361
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2986
01:57:09.361 --> 01:57:10.170
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

2987
01:57:10.170 --> 01:57:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Because liberals would have gotten</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what they wanted.</v>

2988
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.420
<v Speaker 3>The only way it would have been a longer</v>
<v Speaker 3>rows because Weinstein supported</v>

2989
01:57:15.421 --> 01:57:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Hillary's camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2990
01:57:16.801 --> 01:57:19.590
<v Speaker 3>That is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All part of the same cause there's a lot</v>

2991
01:57:19.591 --> 01:57:22.350
<v Speaker 3>of photos of them together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put Him with Obama,</v>

2992
01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:24.210
<v Speaker 3>but he's got photos of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2993
01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:28.560
<v Speaker 3>Everybody liked him just hugging up on</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people that call him a monster</v>

2994
01:57:28.561 --> 01:57:29.394
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2995
01:57:29.530 --> 01:57:30.810
<v Speaker 3>Things out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a god.</v>

2996
01:57:30.811 --> 01:57:32.790
<v Speaker 3>Like Meryl Streep Saves a God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2997
01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.930
<v Speaker 3>a godsend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a sod sense.</v>

2998
01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:37.470
<v Speaker 3>The same thing with trump though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how many celebrities you see with</v>

2999
01:57:37.471 --> 01:57:38.730
<v Speaker 3>pictures of trump?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hysterical.</v>

3000
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Diehard liberals that are like,</v>

3001
01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:42.480
<v Speaker 3>they asked me to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have your parents buds and all that</v>

3002
01:57:42.481 --> 01:57:44.220
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked me to do the apprentice when</v>

3003
01:57:44.221 --> 01:57:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I was doing the second round of fear</v>
<v Speaker 3>factor.</v>

3004
01:57:46.081 --> 01:57:47.520
<v Speaker 3>When you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way,</v>

3005
01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to live in New York for</v>
<v Speaker 3>three months and that's it.</v>

3006
01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:52.860
<v Speaker 3>My kid was one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my youngest kid was very young.</v>

3007
01:57:52.890 --> 01:57:55.200
<v Speaker 3>Who is going to be on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3008
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:56.620
<v Speaker 3>No idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have loved to see who he</v>

3009
01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:58.020
<v Speaker 3>would've gone up with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

3010
01:57:58.021 --> 01:58:01.020
<v Speaker 3>I would've been so Dennis Rodman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>non competitive.</v>

3011
01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:03.830
<v Speaker 3>I would have been high as fuck Cindy</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lopper time.</v>

3012
01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To try to come up with a good idea.</v>

3013
01:58:05.251 --> 01:58:07.230
<v Speaker 3>And if it didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you have a two to one.</v>

3014
01:58:07.231 --> 01:58:07.590
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>

3015
01:58:07.590 --> 01:58:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Cause you didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3016
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:09.870
<v Speaker 3>The people that care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's who,</v>

3017
01:58:09.930 --> 01:58:11.550
<v Speaker 3>that's who loses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

3018
01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:15.000
<v Speaker 3>I cared so little that I probably would</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose.</v>

3019
01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:17.670
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably would barely the person</v>

3020
01:58:17.671 --> 01:58:18.271
<v Speaker 3>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3021
01:58:18.271 --> 01:58:18.690
<v Speaker 3>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3022
01:58:18.690 --> 01:58:21.330
<v Speaker 3>don't you have to be good at business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking terrible at business.</v>

3023
01:58:21.331 --> 01:58:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Like what would you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the people on that show,</v>

3024
01:58:22.831 --> 01:58:23.790
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all doing it.</v>

3025
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:25.770
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that like who they cast on it.</v>

3026
01:58:25.771 --> 01:58:27.150
<v Speaker 3>They wing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like whoever they guess.</v>

3027
01:58:27.210 --> 01:58:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I've seen literally 13 seconds of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>show and it's all clips.</v>

3028
01:58:30.481 --> 01:58:31.314
<v Speaker 3>You're fired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fired,</v>

3029
01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:33.480
<v Speaker 3>you're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best clip you're fired.</v>

3030
01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:37.460
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>

3031
01:58:38.130 --> 01:58:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I just did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just didn't seem like a fun show.</v>

3032
01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I wish she came at her</v>

3033
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.870
<v Speaker 1>fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would add McDonald's with you.</v>

3034
01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

3035
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Ali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>

3036
01:58:47.130 --> 01:58:49.210
<v Speaker 1>He eats fried chicken with a fork and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knife.</v>

3037
01:58:49.230 --> 01:58:49.811
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

3038
01:58:49.811 --> 01:58:50.590
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a cop.</v>

3039
01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:54.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a comic act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a comic that he is a cartoon.</v>

3040
01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:58.180
<v Speaker 1>He's an odd and that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he's gonna run again?</v>

3041
01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:01.720
<v Speaker 1>100% right when he was gonna win again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% he's going to win again.</v>

3042
01:59:01.721 --> 01:59:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3043
01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:04.300
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there's people that are</v>

3044
01:59:04.301 --> 01:59:07.480
<v Speaker 1>probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck dude,</v>

3045
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I just need to come to my boy hearts</v>
<v Speaker 1>gallery and same,</v>

3046
01:59:10.861 --> 01:59:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I never trump exhibited that was burned</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ground by Mexicans.</v>

3047
01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:16.720
<v Speaker 1>How ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi coffee.</v>

3048
01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:18.790
<v Speaker 1>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to win again.</v>

3049
01:59:18.791 --> 01:59:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I just do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think unless the Democrats can pull</v>

3050
01:59:20.711 --> 01:59:22.060
<v Speaker 1>something together in the next year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a half,</v>

3051
01:59:22.061 --> 01:59:24.340
<v Speaker 1>two years to someone that actually is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a formidable component.</v>

3052
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Well my activism is going to prevent</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3053
01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think he's going to go again.</v>

3054
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:37.350
<v Speaker 1>He might look if he's smart and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly is a very clever man.</v>

3055
01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:42.070
<v Speaker 1>If he's a clever man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that he's got one</v>

3056
01:59:42.071 --> 01:59:47.071
<v Speaker 1>round in the chamber for like right</v>
<v Speaker 1>around six to eight weeks out totally</v>

3057
01:59:48.131 --> 01:59:51.730
<v Speaker 1>before the election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing where he like let something</v>

3058
01:59:51.731 --> 01:59:56.020
<v Speaker 1>happen or shit goes down and he has the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect solution to put out that fire</v>

3059
01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.630
<v Speaker 1>and he's good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They plan that stuff,</v>

3060
01:59:58.631 --> 02:00:00.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3061
02:00:00.370 --> 02:00:02.830
<v Speaker 1>People working on it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment you get into office,</v>

3062
02:00:02.831 --> 02:00:07.831
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to keep you in office and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people die and it dumps all</v>

3063
02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3064
02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people die and he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3065
02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:15.550
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this President Johnson's</v>

3066
02:00:15.551 --> 02:00:17.770
<v Speaker 1>marines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd he say to soldiers in the space?</v>

3067
02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:19.840
<v Speaker 1>He wants to create a space for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3068
02:00:19.841 --> 02:00:21.280
<v Speaker 1>what dude?</v>

3069
02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did he say let's shoot up the</v>

3070
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:29.470
<v Speaker 1>strategy for space recognizes that space</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a war fighting domain.</v>

3071
02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the land,</v>

3072
02:00:32.711 --> 02:00:36.490
<v Speaker 1>air and sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the way he says this.</v>

3073
02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>He even have us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For us.</v>

3074
02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:47.440
<v Speaker 1>We have the space for us with the navy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a space for us.</v>

3075
02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>So what did he does is he has a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddies that make spaceships.</v>

3076
02:00:51.070 --> 02:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>So what he's going to do is they make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking deal,</v>

3077
02:00:53.610 --> 02:00:55.270
<v Speaker 1>mechanized deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanized deal.</v>

3078
02:00:55.271 --> 02:01:00.271
<v Speaker 1>We sat down and we got a nice deal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take another $4</v>

3079

<v Speaker 1>trillion and pump it into the space for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

<v Speaker 1>crazy space suit that looks dope and</v>

3083
02:01:09.791 --> 02:01:11.110
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be all on board.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Tight give.</v>

3085
02:01:13.210 --> 02:01:17.350

<v Speaker 1>like we're in the sky a button.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you see like a rocket ship flying back</v>

<v Speaker 1>and forth part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3088

<v Speaker 1>the tesla thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>maneuverability thing,</v>

3090
02:01:27.311 --> 02:01:32.311
<v Speaker 1>whatever that was like the last hour of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the testing experiment with showing them</v>

3091
02:01:32.651 --> 02:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>something that they could do that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really being talked about because the</v>

3092
02:01:35.970 --> 02:01:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Eli musk shooting that car in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

3093
02:01:37.571 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump must so many people nervous</v>

3094
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:44.100
<v Speaker 3>and other countries like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just have him talking about it.</v>

3095
02:01:44.101 --> 02:01:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Space war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as just talking to so flippantly.</v>

3096
02:01:47.301 --> 02:01:49.280
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people in other countries like</v>

3097
02:01:49.281 --> 02:01:49.970
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there,</v>

3098
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:54.970
<v Speaker 3>I think there are hammered by his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his just complete disregard for rules.</v>

3099
02:01:55.251 --> 02:01:57.290
<v Speaker 3>I think people love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just doesn't give a shit.</v>

3100
02:01:57.420 --> 02:01:58.770
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

3101
02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Totally choose a terrified that this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>is running America.</v>

3102
02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I think like our friends do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that the majority of the</v>

3103
02:02:05.571 --> 02:02:07.130
<v Speaker 3>other countries that don't give a shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>about us are like,</v>

3104
02:02:07.190 --> 02:02:10.670
<v Speaker 3>that guy's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think our friendly countries,</v>

3105
02:02:10.671 --> 02:02:13.340
<v Speaker 3>you know like England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's like he's a nuisance,</v>

3106
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:14.150
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>

3107
02:02:14.150 --> 02:02:15.740
<v Speaker 3>I think countries don't give a fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>about us are like,</v>

3108
02:02:15.741 --> 02:02:18.950
<v Speaker 3>that guy's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's a weirdo space war.</v>

3109
02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Imagine we had a space where we in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

3110
02:02:22.210 --> 02:02:24.170
<v Speaker 3>That would be fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be a great movie.</v>

3111
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:27.080
<v Speaker 3>Like how do we stop a war from breaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>out who?</v>

3112
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Who was going to stop a war from</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking out?</v>

3113
02:02:29.630 --> 02:02:31.790
<v Speaker 3>Nobody took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like they just keep pushing</v>

3114
02:02:31.791 --> 02:02:33.830
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone's going to throw a sucker</v>

3115
02:02:33.831 --> 02:02:34.361
<v Speaker 3>punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3116

3119
02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then finally they're in the fucking</v>

3120
02:02:40.941 --> 02:02:43.220
<v Speaker 3>hallway and they're pushing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3121
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:45.950
<v Speaker 3>No one wants to step two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep hitting one or two books out of</v>

3122
02:02:45.951 --> 02:02:47.240
<v Speaker 3>each other's hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3123
02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:50.450
<v Speaker 3>And it's always right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So always right there.</v>

3124
02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:52.950
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3125
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Then finally someone takes the hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3126
02:02:55.710 --> 02:02:56.543
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3127
02:02:56.630 --> 02:02:59.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could easily happen with some little</v>

3128
02:02:59.541 --> 02:03:00.940
<v Speaker 3>banana republic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3129
02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:04.740
<v Speaker 3>That could start it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some crazy dictator in Venezuela or some</v>

3130
02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:08.210
<v Speaker 3>shit could send a missile at some other</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3136
02:03:19.730 --> 02:03:23.600
<v Speaker 3>which were so weird about war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we accept the fact that war</v>

3137
02:03:23.601 --> 02:03:26.030
<v Speaker 3>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but only when it's not near us.</v>

3138
02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Not really interested in more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's clothes.</v>

3139
02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Can't be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we have war in Afghanistan.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But that's inevitable.</v>

3142
02:03:32.210 --> 02:03:33.260
<v Speaker 3>But war over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3143

<v Speaker 3>in boyle heights and I'm straight.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's white people coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird white coffee,</v>

3177
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:41.700

<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy that they could just</v>

3178
02:04:41.701 --> 02:04:43.500
<v Speaker 1>scream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck white people.</v>

3179
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:44.880
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3180
02:04:45.630 --> 02:04:47.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to be gentrified.</v>

3181
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:49.640
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll know some of their say and</v>

3182
02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:51.720
<v Speaker 1>somebody saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3183
02:04:51.721 --> 02:04:54.210
<v Speaker 1>they don't want white people moving in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and opening up galleries.</v>

3184
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's another part of it?</v>

3185
02:04:55.381 --> 02:04:57.810
<v Speaker 1>This is where it gets really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went into rabbit hole.</v>

3186
02:04:57.811 --> 02:05:02.811
<v Speaker 1>I started reading a lot of Isabella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I read was that part of it is being</v>

3187
02:05:03.151 --> 02:05:08.151
<v Speaker 1>hijacked by white artists that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the people that own the gallery.</v>

3188
02:05:08.431 --> 02:05:12.750
<v Speaker 1>So they get on the side of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that want no gentrification and they</v>

3189
02:05:12.751 --> 02:05:16.320
<v Speaker 1>sabotage the gallery because they have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal feud with the guy who owns the</v>

3190
02:05:16.321 --> 02:05:18.600
<v Speaker 1>gallery does so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was a lot of that.</v>

3191
02:05:18.601 --> 02:05:22.380
<v Speaker 1>It was white artists that we're teaming</v>
<v Speaker 1>up against the white people.</v>

3192
02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:25.470
<v Speaker 1>They're teaming up on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hispanics to get,</v>

3193
02:05:25.930 --> 02:05:27.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans,</v>

3194
02:05:27.361 --> 02:05:28.021
<v Speaker 1>Latinos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3195
02:05:28.021 --> 02:05:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's all Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think east side is heavy.</v>

3196
02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:35.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a Honduran is all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just that neighborhood.</v>

3197
02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:38.370
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's generally known as a Latino</v>

3198
02:05:38.371 --> 02:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

3199
02:05:39.570 --> 02:05:42.060
<v Speaker 1>And these people want to keep it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

3200
02:05:42.370 --> 02:05:44.700
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just so fucked up.</v>

3201
02:05:44.701 --> 02:05:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if that was white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Brown people were moving in and white</v>

3202
02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:52.080
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were we going to fuck brown art and fuck</v>

3203
02:05:52.081 --> 02:05:57.060
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis hate racism against white</v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

3204
02:05:57.061 --> 02:06:00.960
<v Speaker 1>We don't automatically see it as racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the people that are saying</v>

3205
02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:04.140
<v Speaker 1>fuck white art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't think of it as racism</v>

3206
02:06:04.530 --> 02:06:08.160
<v Speaker 1>because it's against the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving in that happened to be wealthy,</v>

3207
02:06:08.161 --> 02:06:10.650
<v Speaker 1>that can afford to buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally pushing people out.</v>

3208
02:06:10.651 --> 02:06:13.860
<v Speaker 1>So if you say fuck white people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not racist.</v>

3209
02:06:14.070 --> 02:06:15.450
<v Speaker 1>But the same people that agree with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3210
02:06:15.630 --> 02:06:17.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same people that are like that or</v>

3211
02:06:17.491 --> 02:06:20.820
<v Speaker 1>like that or like the same white people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that agree with the protesting,</v>

3212
02:06:21.090 --> 02:06:23.040
<v Speaker 1>they're rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're already up there anyway,</v>

3213
02:06:23.070 --> 02:06:24.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit of that and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3214
02:06:24.781 --> 02:06:27.150
<v Speaker 1>it's convenient because they're not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3215
02:06:27.151 --> 02:06:28.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3216
02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:33.690
<v Speaker 1>this one woman was tweeting that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an unpopular opinion and not at</v>

3217
02:06:33.691 --> 02:06:37.740
<v Speaker 1>all uncomfortable about the idea of men</v>
<v Speaker 1>being falsely accused of sexual assault</v>

3218
02:06:37.741 --> 02:06:42.510
<v Speaker 1>and sexual harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that is a crazy thing to say.</v>

3219
02:06:42.511 --> 02:06:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Like what if it was your son would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was your brother,</v>

3220
02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:47.430
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it was your dad and they were a</v>

3221
02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:49.470
<v Speaker 1>good person and accused of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

3222
02:06:49.471 --> 02:06:51.330
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel bad because you don't</v>

3223
02:06:51.331 --> 02:06:52.590
<v Speaker 1>like men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All men suck.</v>

3224
02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:53.453
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3225
02:06:53.610 --> 02:06:54.660
<v Speaker 1>that is sexist.</v>

3226
02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:56.490
<v Speaker 1>But they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not think it's sexist,</v>

3227
02:06:56.491 --> 02:06:57.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore sex.</v>

3228
02:06:57.961 --> 02:07:01.020
<v Speaker 1>If all men suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all men were violent monsters,</v>

3229
02:07:01.650 --> 02:07:02.670
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd all be dead.</v>

3230
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3231
02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:07.170
<v Speaker 1>You'd all be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone along the way would have done</v>

3232
02:07:07.171 --> 02:07:08.880
<v Speaker 1>something terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're not all bad.</v>

3233
02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:11.560
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of us are bad men are bad and that</v>

3234
02:07:11.570 --> 02:07:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3235
02:07:12.130 --> 02:07:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I won't even say us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some males of the species are bad.</v>

3236
02:07:14.881 --> 02:07:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Some females are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3237
02:07:16.230 --> 02:07:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not even a part of it.</v>

3238
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:19.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like people are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand this whole thing.</v>

3239
02:07:19.381 --> 02:07:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Like all people are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

3240
02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I think people are good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are good,</v>

3241
02:07:23.070 --> 02:07:25.980
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people are not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people.</v>

3242
02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:29.970
<v Speaker 1>So if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about the,</v>

3243
02:07:30.570 --> 02:07:31.890
<v Speaker 1>the number of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3244
02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that weird statistic about that.</v>

3245
02:07:35.230 --> 02:07:36.370
<v Speaker 1>We pulled up one</v>

3246
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:40.590
<v Speaker 2>out of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>0.6% what was that?</v>

3247
02:07:40.591 --> 02:07:42.790
<v Speaker 2>That we were just discussing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3248
02:07:42.791 --> 02:07:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Micro Penis people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3249
02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.780
<v Speaker 2>So if that's how many people have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>micro penis,</v>

3250
02:07:46.930 --> 02:07:49.840
<v Speaker 2>how many people are fucking assholes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3251
02:07:49.841 --> 02:07:52.120
<v Speaker 2>More than have micro penises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way More.</v>

3252
02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a hundred people right</v>

3253
02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:59.940
<v Speaker 2>and 0.6 have a micro penis to are</v>
<v Speaker 2>assholes flaming assholes.</v>

3254
02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And imagine being an asshole and having</v>
<v Speaker 2>a micro penis,</v>

3255
02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:05.650
<v Speaker 2>you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a real pro,</v>

3256
02:08:05.651 --> 02:08:08.780
<v Speaker 2>you probably never developed like real</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole tendencies cause you know,</v>

3257
02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:12.130
<v Speaker 2>it'd be so intimidated at someone in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of a ramp,</v>

3258
02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:14.950
<v Speaker 2>just pull your pants down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up.</v>

3259
02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:17.220
<v Speaker 2>And then everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3260
02:08:19.930 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 2>there's way more assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some of those assholes are women.</v>

3261
02:08:22.331 --> 02:08:24.760
<v Speaker 2>So like on national women's day the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other day,</v>

3262
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:26.800
<v Speaker 2>like a couple people that I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>retweeted this,</v>

3263
02:08:26.801 --> 02:08:28.480
<v Speaker 2>someone was like believe women.</v>

3264
02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:30.070

3265
02:08:30.071 --> 02:08:31.060
<v Speaker 2>support women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's</v>

3266
02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:34.120
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3267
02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.670
<v Speaker 2>some are great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some women are amazing,</v>

3268
02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:39.820
<v Speaker 2>some men are amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some humans are amazing.</v>

3269
02:08:39.821 --> 02:08:43.210
<v Speaker 2>It can be amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's whole like gravitating towards one</v>

3270
02:08:43.211 --> 02:08:47.020
<v Speaker 2>gender specifically just because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a vagina or specifically just</v>

3271
02:08:47.021 --> 02:08:49.060
<v Speaker 2>because they have a penis is equally</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

3272
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:54.040
<v Speaker 2>equally stupid on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it also creates divisiveness.</v>

3273
02:08:54.150 --> 02:08:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It creates conflict because you were</v>

3274
02:08:56.861 --> 02:09:00.520
<v Speaker 2>aware us on the team penis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're fully in supportive team</v>

3283
02:09:21.431 --> 02:09:23.170
<v Speaker 2>healthy relationship amongst the fans.</v>

3284

<v Speaker 2>Can they get together and share a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stadium together without any gang</v>

3289
02:09:32.081 --> 02:09:34.570
<v Speaker 2>versus team vagina.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is the real truth.</v>

3495
02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:28.110
<v Speaker 3>This is how it actually happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3496

<v Speaker 3>I have to pee so bad.</v>

3498
02:17:31.531 --> 02:17:32.364
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

3499
02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:34.230
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk shit about you while you're</v>

3500

<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes him comfortable that we talk</v>

3501
02:17:36.391 --> 02:17:37.350
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll start with that.</v>

3502
02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:40.500
<v Speaker 3>The future is masculine.</v>

3503
02:17:42.170 --> 02:17:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Just makes me sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the Sun.</v>

3504
02:17:45.470 --> 02:17:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hypocrite though because like one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my favorite fighters,</v>

3505
02:17:48.651 --> 02:17:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Cain Velasquez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got brown pride tattooed on his</v>

3506
02:17:51.501 --> 02:17:53.570
<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never bothered me for a second.</v>

3507
02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:59.020
<v Speaker 1>His Dad walked here from fucking Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know like if you're a part of a</v>

3508
02:17:59.181 --> 02:18:04.160
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchised community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you feel like you are and you have</v>

3509
02:18:04.161 --> 02:18:06.080
<v Speaker 1>that on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're taking pride in</v>

3510
02:18:06.081 --> 02:18:08.090
<v Speaker 1>something that's considered maligned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3511
02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:13.400
<v Speaker 1>But I guess women would think the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way in a more mild way that they're</v>

3512
02:18:13.430 --> 02:18:15.860
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchised to where are they going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with all their,</v>

3513
02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:17.510
<v Speaker 1>that tramp stamp thing that's done</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3514
02:18:17.930 --> 02:18:19.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some girls are still getting them now.</v>

3515
02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

3516
02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:22.340
<v Speaker 1>It's some dumb people out there bro.</v>

3517
02:18:24.860 --> 02:18:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what does the tramp stamp?</v>

3518
02:18:26.121 --> 02:18:27.980
<v Speaker 1>A tramp stamp is only when it's your</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower back.</v>

3519
02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your whole back like I know a lot of</v>

3520
02:18:31.671 --> 02:18:33.020
<v Speaker 1>people that are getting their whole back</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

3521
02:18:33.350 --> 02:18:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3522
02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:34.820
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3523
02:18:35.630 --> 02:18:37.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're getting there but done</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

3524
02:18:38.630 --> 02:18:40.460
<v Speaker 1>which I think is probably not the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

3525
02:18:40.910 --> 02:18:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Cause like acids look really good when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're well formed.</v>

3526
02:18:46.010 --> 02:18:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Like to put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like.</v>

3527
02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:50.060
<v Speaker 1>It always seems to me what he's showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

3528
02:18:50.090 --> 02:18:50.923
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

3530
02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:54.080

<v Speaker 1>go back to that.</v>

3531
02:18:54.081 --> 02:18:56.990
<v Speaker 1>A full screen like grill below goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go below.</v>

3532
02:18:57.260 --> 02:18:58.093
<v Speaker 1>Go below.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that screen.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

<v Speaker 2>when you look back you will remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>those very fondly.</v>

3858
02:32:08.370 --> 02:32:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Well I can't forget them cause a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them are painful a shit.</v>

3859
02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be rough ones.</v>

3860

<v Speaker 2>But those are fucking so critical for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the development of your APP.</v>

3862
02:32:18.320 --> 02:32:19.890
<v Speaker 3>and the other thing is the places that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have built,</v>

3863
02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:22.080
<v Speaker 3>audiences that I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Denver,</v>

3864
02:32:22.081 --> 02:32:25.070
<v Speaker 3>when I go back to comedy works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can sell that plays out because I</v>

3865
02:32:25.090 --> 02:32:26.500
<v Speaker 3>built an audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3866
02:32:26.510 --> 02:32:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Like if I build audiences in places that</v>
<v Speaker 3>really loved me,</v>

3867
02:32:28.951 --> 02:32:31.350
<v Speaker 3>that's the best part about going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>places where I'm like,</v>

3868
02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:32.341
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

3869
02:32:32.341 --> 02:32:34.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just show me so much love there</v>

3870
02:32:34.381 --> 02:32:34.891
<v Speaker 3>that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

3871
02:32:34.891 --> 02:32:36.150
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it feels good.</v>

3872
02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Think of like if you're in a place like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denver,</v>

3873
02:32:39.230 --> 02:32:42.500
<v Speaker 2>how many of those people that come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see you are actually going to leave</v>

3874
02:32:42.501 --> 02:32:45.300
<v Speaker 2>comments or tweet at you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many of them are just gonna</v>

3875
02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:47.000
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because most of the time when I go to</v>

3876
02:32:47.001 --> 02:32:49.830
<v Speaker 2>see somebody I just enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just enjoy it too.</v>

3877
02:32:50.660 --> 02:32:52.370
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that I say,</v>

<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

3880
02:32:56.721 --> 02:32:57.680
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3881
02:32:57.810 --> 02:33:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time I just enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like you think about you're doing</v>

3882
02:33:01.311 --> 02:33:02.510
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3883
02:33:02.511 --> 02:33:05.570
<v Speaker 2>You're doing 200 was at 300 seats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much just,</v>

3884
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:10.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like 300 seats you doing 1200 in the</v>

3885
02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:11.330
<v Speaker 2>two days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3886
02:33:11.331 --> 02:33:13.610
<v Speaker 2>and then you're going back again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do another 12 they'll tell their</v>

3887
02:33:13.611 --> 02:33:14.870
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people come back,</v>

3888
02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:17.750
<v Speaker 2>tickets go quicker next time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a year later.</v>

3889
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:20.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the key to building the road.</v>

3890
02:33:20.511 --> 02:33:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Like to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's places where I sell out wayne</v>

3891
02:33:22.971 --> 02:33:26.030
<v Speaker 2>advance and there's other places where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't really haven't been going that</v>

3892
02:33:26.031 --> 02:33:28.670
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's more of a difficulty to sell</v>

3893
02:33:28.671 --> 02:33:33.671
<v Speaker 2>tickets because you've built up a yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how Austin Houston's a spot where</v>

3894
02:33:34.581 --> 02:33:36.620
<v Speaker 2>I could just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sell on Houston.</v>

3895
02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I've been selling out comedy clubs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Houston since the 90s yeah.</v>

3896
02:33:40.401 --> 02:33:42.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always been a spot that I could</v>

3897
02:33:42.250 --> 02:33:44.630
<v Speaker 2>cause that was like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Houston was one of the,</v>

3898
02:33:44.631 --> 02:33:48.710
<v Speaker 2>there was a few cities where legends</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from and Houston was wearing,</v>

3899
02:33:48.711 --> 02:33:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Kennison came from and for me it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennison and Hex Bolt came out of</v>

3900
02:33:52.701 --> 02:33:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me it's like I had to get to</v>

3901
02:33:55.041 --> 02:33:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Houston and like there's this thought in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my head like I knew about the laugh stop</v>

3902
02:33:57.771 --> 02:33:59.240
<v Speaker 2>and river oaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one spot.</v>

3903
02:33:59.390 --> 02:34:01.190
<v Speaker 2>There was the nineties I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get to that club.</v>

3904
02:34:01.430 --> 02:34:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3905
02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:05.500
<v Speaker 2>There's a fucking perfect comedy club to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3906
02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:06.740
<v Speaker 2>You never worked there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3907
02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Who's gone before he came around?</v>

3908
02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:09.020
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've,</v>

3909
02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:12.430
<v Speaker 3>but I've listened to many albums where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are at the laugh stop introducing</v>

3910
02:34:12.490 --> 02:34:14.480
<v Speaker 2>comic mind from 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3911
02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be dead.</v>

3912
02:34:16.811 --> 02:34:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Some Warner brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was from the last stop.</v>

3913
02:34:19.601 --> 02:34:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I did it in Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I filmed in like a recorded it rather 98</v>

3914
02:34:22.721 --> 02:34:25.900
<v Speaker 2>or 99 and it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the perfect club.</v>

3915
02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:27.790
<v Speaker 2>It was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had an open mic night,</v>

3916
02:34:27.791 --> 02:34:29.950
<v Speaker 2>so they had a bar in the front and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had stage in the,</v>

3917
02:34:29.951 --> 02:34:32.080
<v Speaker 2>in the front and they had open Mike</v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

3918
02:34:32.081 --> 02:34:35.020
<v Speaker 2>They would start at eight and go two</v>
<v Speaker 2>o'clock in the fucking morning and no</v>

3919
02:34:35.021 --> 02:34:36.460
<v Speaker 2>hacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you know,</v>

3920
02:34:36.461 --> 02:34:40.000
<v Speaker 2>hacks and they would ostracize hacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boot him out of the community.</v>

3921
02:34:40.090 --> 02:34:42.820
<v Speaker 2>They're all artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of really good comics</v>

3922
02:34:42.821 --> 02:34:43.930
<v Speaker 2>that came out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wild.</v>

3923
02:34:43.990 --> 02:34:47.590
<v Speaker 2>And one club went under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one club went under and the whole</v>

3924
02:34:47.591 --> 02:34:51.100
<v Speaker 2>scene took a big hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently the scenes bouncing back now</v>

3925
02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:53.410
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more comics now in</v>

3926
02:34:53.411 --> 02:34:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dude,</v>

3927
02:34:54.851 --> 02:34:59.200
<v Speaker 2>when I used to work there in the 90s you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would go there and these opening acts,</v>

3928
02:34:59.201 --> 02:35:01.510
<v Speaker 2>these guys who were working there would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be fucking killers.</v>

3929
02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:03.160
<v Speaker 2>They were killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hers would rip.</v>

3930
02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:05.170
<v Speaker 2>They were great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were real comics.</v>

3931
02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.650
<v Speaker 2>There were real comics and then the open</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike night you would see funny comics</v>

3932
02:35:08.651 --> 02:35:11.380
<v Speaker 2>that were learning how to do comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people that really have shot,</v>

3933
02:35:12.010 --> 02:35:17.010
<v Speaker 2>but it was just one club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always a problem when there's one</v>

3934
02:35:17.891 --> 02:35:20.530
<v Speaker 2>club in a town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wendy's figured out how to do that in</v>

3935
02:35:20.531 --> 02:35:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's what Wendy who owns the</v>

3936
02:35:22.571 --> 02:35:24.460
<v Speaker 2>comedy works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's figured out,</v>

3937
02:35:24.461 --> 02:35:28.510
<v Speaker 2>she's created a scene like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That scene is almost primarily</v>

3938
02:35:28.511 --> 02:35:33.130
<v Speaker 2>responsible or she's almost primarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible or or or as one individual</v>

3939
02:35:33.131 --> 02:35:34.660
<v Speaker 2>for that entire comedy scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3940
02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:36.490
<v Speaker 2>she's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well she's called.</v>

3941
02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:41.560
<v Speaker 2>I give her credit because I think she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultivated such good talent that that</v>

3942
02:35:42.041 --> 02:35:43.240
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what you were saying</v>

3943
02:35:43.241 --> 02:35:44.980
<v Speaker 2>about Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone that I know that I met</v>

3944
02:35:44.981 --> 02:35:46.030
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's from there.</v>

3945
02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:49.540
<v Speaker 2>It comes out of there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fucking phenomenal comedian.</v>

3946
02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're like they're locals are</v>

3947
02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:55.810
<v Speaker 2>professionals here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To this day when I do comedy,</v>

3948
02:35:55.870 --> 02:35:57.780
<v Speaker 2>like a do theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3949
02:35:57.790 --> 02:35:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Belko,</v>

3950
02:35:59.081 --> 02:36:01.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like 5,000 seats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go through her,</v>

3951
02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I do it through her and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she also do her club,</v>

3952
02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:06.670
<v Speaker 2>so I always hang out with her when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>in town.</v>

3953
02:36:06.671 --> 02:36:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Like that lady's super important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3954
02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Like I did my special there in 2014 my</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy central special because I like,</v>

3955
02:36:14.460 --> 02:36:16.060
<v Speaker 2>it was important to me to do it at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>

3956
02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:19.510
<v Speaker 2>That club was one of the reasons why I</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved to Colorado for a brief time.</v>

3957
02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:20.501
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3958
02:36:20.501 --> 02:36:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I'll be close to this club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like I can,</v>

3959
02:36:22.481 --> 02:36:25.150
<v Speaker 2>I can survive here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I need a pay station.</v>

3960
02:36:25.390 --> 02:36:27.460
<v Speaker 2>I need a base station to fuck around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout material.</v>

3961
02:36:27.461 --> 02:36:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I could use this place like everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else is doing it.</v>

3962
02:36:29.470 --> 02:36:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Like I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>

3963
02:36:30.290 --> 02:36:32.170
<v Speaker 2>This could be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a real comedy community.</v>

3964
02:36:32.290 --> 02:36:33.520
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3965
02:36:33.521 --> 02:36:35.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a few like that that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>building so strong right now.</v>

3966
02:36:35.651 --> 02:36:39.370
<v Speaker 2>I think my only fear for the future is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of new clubs that pop up</v>

3967
02:36:39.371 --> 02:36:43.150
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of clubs that have gone so</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporatized that they're all the same.</v>

3968
02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm still a club guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

3969
02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:47.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't get to play theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3970
02:36:47.530 --> 02:36:48.970
<v Speaker 2>So when you do clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3971
02:36:49.530 --> 02:36:52.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the mercy of the club system of</v>

3972
02:36:52.451 --> 02:36:53.620
<v Speaker 2>whatever that may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3973
02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:57.040
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are so corporately</v>

3974
02:36:57.041 --> 02:36:57.821
<v Speaker 2>systematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3975
02:36:57.821 --> 02:36:58.480
<v Speaker 2>you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3976
02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:00.380
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the old joke of a musician</v>

3977
02:37:00.390 --> 02:37:01.450
<v Speaker 2>psych,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up Omaha?</v>

3978
02:37:01.451 --> 02:37:02.140
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3979
02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:03.940
<v Speaker 2>This is no Mas Missouri?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

3980
02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:06.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all feels the same.</v>

3981
02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Like some of the clubs feel the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true with a lot of the Improv's.</v>

3982
02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:14.260
<v Speaker 2>But what they've done is they figured</v>
<v Speaker 2>out a way to make it a very professional</v>

3983
02:37:14.261 --> 02:37:16.310
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere you go all over the country.</v>

3984
02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I accept what they're doing because</v>

3985
02:37:19.131 --> 02:37:21.890
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is like a blend of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the art and commerce.</v>

3986
02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:25.310
<v Speaker 1>They've done a smart thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't fuck with your act.</v>

3987
02:37:25.390 --> 02:37:27.170
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as they don't fuck with my act,</v>

3988
02:37:27.171 --> 02:37:27.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's part of their fucking culture.</v>

4140
02:42:18.270 --> 02:42:19.680
<v Speaker 3>But you don't think they're annoyed</v>

4146
02:42:26.250 --> 02:42:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Very good Italian food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have been as good at,</v>

4147
02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:29.790
<v Speaker 3>that's like Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good Italian food,</v>

4148
02:42:30.570 --> 02:42:32.250
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Boston has some of the best of</v>

4149
02:42:32.251 --> 02:42:33.210
<v Speaker 3>talent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we go to the north end,</v>

4150
02:42:33.211 --> 02:42:34.590
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4151
02:42:34.591 --> 02:42:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I have good Italian food that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck with New York.</v>

4152
02:42:37.770 --> 02:42:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I grew up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trust me.</v>

4153
02:42:39.250 --> 02:42:41.340
<v Speaker 3>One of the same New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston to me.</v>

4154
02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:43.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't think he could fuck with it.</v>

4155
02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I love Ya.</v>

4157
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:49.380
<v Speaker 3>But I think there's a smaller amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>good places.</v>

4158
02:42:49.381 --> 02:42:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Whereas New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an endless supply per capita.</v>

4159
02:42:52.591 --> 02:42:56.370
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Supply of flour on the floor and fucking</v>

<v Speaker 3>oh fucking sauce.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

4162
02:43:02.941 --> 02:43:04.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's a larger</v>

4163
02:43:04.771 --> 02:43:07.230
<v Speaker 3>concentration of guineas in like the New</v>
<v Speaker 3>York,</v>

4164
02:43:07.231 --> 02:43:09.930
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in Boston it was more of a</v>

4165
02:43:09.931 --> 02:43:12.130
<v Speaker 3>concentration of Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was more Irish,</v>

4166
02:43:12.150 --> 02:43:12.971
<v Speaker 2>Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4167
02:43:12.971 --> 02:43:16.440
<v Speaker 2>I was just a few Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were heavily out numbers like</v>

4168
02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:17.660
<v Speaker 2>East Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4169
02:43:17.661 --> 02:43:19.600
<v Speaker 2>like a few places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little Italy,</v>

4170
02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:22.360
<v Speaker 2>few places where I feel comfortable with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because I'm an orange guy.</v>

4171
02:43:22.390 --> 02:43:24.270
<v Speaker 2>When I go to Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think I'm more than just slipped</v>

4172
02:43:24.271 --> 02:43:26.060
<v Speaker 2>right in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They assume I'm there.</v>

4173
02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:27.033
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you,</v>

4174

<v Speaker 2>We'll try to this.</v>

4178
02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first moved to Boston,</v>

4179
02:43:36.701 --> 02:43:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I had an Irish last name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite,</v>

4180
02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:40.870
<v Speaker 2>but I'm mostly Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm three quarters Italian where you</v>

4181
02:43:40.890 --> 02:43:42.440
<v Speaker 2>look it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're almost all Italian.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fucking shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shame.</v>

4187
02:43:49.630 --> 02:43:54.630
<v Speaker 2>There's some real Irish versus Italian</v>
<v Speaker 2>animosity in Boston and like the in most</v>

4188
02:43:55.061 --> 02:43:57.370
<v Speaker 2>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>late seventies early eighties when I</v>

4189
02:43:57.371 --> 02:43:59.200
<v Speaker 2>first moved there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say like the history of</v>

4190
02:43:59.201 --> 02:43:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Irish and Italian.</v>

4191
02:43:59.890 --> 02:44:01.440
<v Speaker 2>They didn't fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't really get along too well.</v>

4192
02:44:01.450 --> 02:44:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I did not think I moved there in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must've been like 79 79 and then I</v>

4193
02:44:08.621 --> 02:44:11.860
<v Speaker 2>went to high school there in 81 that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first year in high school.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I lived in California from age seven to</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 and then we lived in Florida for a</v>

<v Speaker 2>going to be having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had no idea.</v>

4219
02:45:05.590 --> 02:45:06.460
<v Speaker 2>So he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

4220
02:45:06.700 --> 02:45:08.680
<v Speaker 2>what if it doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it all goes wrong?</v>

4221
02:45:09.380 --> 02:45:11.830
<v Speaker 2>You see all these people around you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's always drunk and he's doing</v>

4222
02:45:11.831 --> 02:45:12.331
<v Speaker 2>coke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I gotta get the fuck out of this town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fuck away from these people.</v>

4225
02:45:17.350 --> 02:45:19.390
<v Speaker 2>And then you go back when you're an</v>
<v Speaker 2>adult and you go,</v>

4226
02:45:19.391 --> 02:45:22.240
<v Speaker 2>this is a great place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a really nice town.</v>

4227
02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:25.640
<v Speaker 2>It was probably only because when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave it's nice to come back.</v>

4228
02:45:25.641 --> 02:45:27.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have anybody telling me it was</v>

4229
02:45:27.221 --> 02:45:28.210
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five,</v>

4230
02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:30.160
<v Speaker 2>like a smart older brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>

4231
02:45:30.161 --> 02:45:30.994
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Girls are all horny.</v>

4233
02:45:33.460 --> 02:45:35.950
<v Speaker 2>They're all right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just wait outside in front of the</v>

4234
02:45:35.951 --> 02:45:37.480
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have had strategies,</v>

4235
02:45:37.990 --> 02:45:40.570
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no one that was hornier than</v>

4236
02:45:40.571 --> 02:45:43.200
<v Speaker 2>the girls who went to Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>

4237
02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:44.590
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4238
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:48.100
<v Speaker 2>they separated those girls from boys and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were a different animal than the</v>

4239
02:45:48.101 --> 02:45:49.870
<v Speaker 2>girls I went to school with freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4240
02:45:49.871 --> 02:45:53.200
<v Speaker 2>I went to public school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Newton South and uh,</v>

4241
02:45:53.260 --> 02:45:58.150
<v Speaker 2>when we were in high school we would get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and we would meet girls that were</v>

4242
02:45:58.151 --> 02:46:00.280
<v Speaker 2>coming off of the Catholic girls school.</v>

4243
02:46:00.580 --> 02:46:05.260
<v Speaker 2>These girls would go after guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't like regular girls.</v>

4244
02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Like it's hunger games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator.</v>

4245
02:46:07.530 --> 02:46:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Like they were starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They needed water.</v>

4246
02:46:10.210 --> 02:46:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy.</v>

4247
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:14.650
<v Speaker 2>The horniest girl I ever dated when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was young,</v>

4248
02:46:14.670 --> 02:46:17.120
<v Speaker 2>went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in an all girl Catholic school.</v>

4249
02:46:17.150 --> 02:46:19.940
<v Speaker 2>She was a great gal who was a fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine cause she was like made a joke</v>

4250
02:46:19.941 --> 02:46:24.470
<v Speaker 2>about her that like you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could roll a dick passed her like a</v>

4251
02:46:24.471 --> 02:46:26.990
<v Speaker 2>kitten with a ball of yarn and she would</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

4252
02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:31.820
<v Speaker 2>she couldn't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't a bad person,</v>

4253
02:46:32.030 --> 02:46:37.030
<v Speaker 2>but she was always horny and it took me</v>
<v Speaker 2>years to figure out what was going on.</v>

4254
02:46:37.220 --> 02:46:40.820
<v Speaker 2>It was something that I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered in a very strange way.</v>

4255
02:46:40.821 --> 02:46:41.654
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

4256
02:46:41.980 --> 02:46:44.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really puzzled me because I had these</v>

4257
02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:47.000
<v Speaker 2>preconceived notions about how women</v>
<v Speaker 2>behave,</v>

4258
02:46:47.270 --> 02:46:51.050
<v Speaker 2>but these Catholic school girls through</v>
<v Speaker 2>a giant monkey wrench into this notion</v>

4259
02:46:51.051 --> 02:46:51.884
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4260
02:46:52.130 --> 02:46:53.780
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense for the regular girls.</v>

4261
02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Regular girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might let you know.</v>

4262
02:46:55.701 --> 02:46:58.160
<v Speaker 2>They think you're cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seems nice.</v>

4263
02:46:58.161 --> 02:46:59.570
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ask around,</v>

4264
02:46:59.770 --> 02:47:01.730
<v Speaker 2>you ask a friend to ask her if she likes</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

4265
02:47:01.850 --> 02:47:02.990
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like this little thing,</v>

4266
02:47:03.170 --> 02:47:05.000
<v Speaker 2>those Catholic girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would cut to the chase.</v>

4267
02:47:05.001 --> 02:47:08.110
<v Speaker 2>They were like werewolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would just charge to the room and</v>

4268
02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:09.200
<v Speaker 2>grab a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4269
02:47:09.201 --> 02:47:11.420
<v Speaker 2>how are you want to make out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

4270
02:47:11.421 --> 02:47:13.790
<v Speaker 2>you're fingering them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were crazy.</v>

4271
02:47:13.940 --> 02:47:15.780
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a totally different animal,</v>

4272
02:47:15.781 --> 02:47:18.470
<v Speaker 2>your hand and putting it down their</v>
<v Speaker 2>pants and girls didn't like it.</v>

4273
02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Other girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regular girls did not like,</v>

4274
02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:23.330
<v Speaker 2>they were like gang members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like gang members.</v>

4275
02:47:23.331 --> 02:47:25.970

4276
02:47:25.971 --> 02:47:29.690
<v Speaker 2>skirts on and just fuck everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the Tasmanian Devil.</v>

4277
02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:33.680
<v Speaker 2>They would just tornado fucking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole of the school and they prayed on</v>

4278
02:47:33.681 --> 02:47:36.620
<v Speaker 2>these boys because they didn't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had no boys.</v>

4279
02:47:36.890 --> 02:47:39.090
<v Speaker 2>They're in a whole school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hundreds of girls when you were</v>

4282

4294
02:48:05.931 --> 02:48:10.820
<v Speaker 2>these ideas about like a spectrum of</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural female sexuality,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>

02:49:39.961 --> 02:49:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Cause it ruins way guys think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like maybe some guys.</v>

4335
02:49:43.951 --> 02:49:45.870
<v Speaker 2>But isn't that the same as with</v>
<v Speaker 2>gambling?</v>

02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Like isn't gambling really bad for some</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ruins people's lives.</v>

4339
02:49:51.630 --> 02:49:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Ruins their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4340
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:55.680
<v Speaker 2>I think there's certain guys that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't fucking gamble.</v>

4341
02:49:55.681 --> 02:49:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>his dad lost their house over gambling</v>
<v Speaker 2>early podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

4345
02:50:08.820 --> 02:50:11.430
<v Speaker 2>was it Jimmy Burke?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might've been,</v>

4346
02:50:11.460 --> 02:50:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come from my grandfather's a</v>

4347
02:50:12.810 --> 02:50:14.790
<v Speaker 2>microphone that works at the dog track</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Chicago.</v>

4348
02:50:14.820 --> 02:50:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Jimmy Burke chose whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

4349
02:50:17.250 --> 02:50:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Dad was a crazy gambler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I knew a lot of guys like that from the</v>

4351
02:50:21.751 --> 02:50:24.660
<v Speaker 2>pool hall that had just every nickel</v>
<v Speaker 2>they earned,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They always owed money and they were</v>

4353
02:50:27.211 --> 02:50:30.150
<v Speaker 2>hiding from people is always gambling</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lifestyle.</v>

4354
02:50:30.151 --> 02:50:31.860
<v Speaker 2>So wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't have a problem with</v>

4355
02:50:31.861 --> 02:50:33.990
<v Speaker 2>gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I go to Vegas and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I used to bet on fights,</v>

4358

<v Speaker 2>so if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe if I'm in Vegas and just for a</v>

4365
02:50:58.470 --> 02:51:00.360
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that I shouldn't be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go gamble.</v>

4366
02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:03.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just like the same thing is if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a hotel room and I want to jerk off,</v>

4367
02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:06.510

<v Speaker 3>how crazy is that?</v>

4437
02:54:16.171 --> 02:54:19.380
<v Speaker 3>That the United States has that big of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>market and the rest of the world is just</v>

4438
02:54:19.381 --> 02:54:22.110
<v Speaker 3>four or five points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you why that's wrong because</v>

4439
02:54:22.111 --> 02:54:24.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>markets almost mashed in North America.</v>

4442
02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:32.430
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was what,</v>

4443
02:54:32.431 --> 02:54:34.830
<v Speaker 3>three years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be way higher now.</v>

4444
02:54:35.070 --> 02:54:36.180
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way Higher.</v>

4445
02:54:36.330 --> 02:54:37.740
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know they made in the,</v>

4446
02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:39.750
<v Speaker 3>in the fourth quarter last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix,</v>

4447
02:54:40.090 --> 02:54:41.850
<v Speaker 3>take a guests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't look it up and take a guess.</v>

4448
02:54:42.270 --> 02:54:45.360
<v Speaker 3>80 kazillion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4449
02:54:45.361 --> 02:54:45.661
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4450
02:54:45.661 --> 02:54:49.170
<v Speaker 3>And just the fourth quarter last year</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made 3.4 billion and just the</v>

4451
02:54:49.171 --> 02:54:51.150
<v Speaker 3>fourth court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 for the year.</v>

4452
02:54:51.151 --> 02:54:52.230
<v Speaker 3>That's probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4453
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Well death thrown it around at comics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that.</v>

4454
02:54:55.650 --> 02:54:58.410
<v Speaker 3>I wish they were thrown into me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will be santeen and first of all,</v>

4455
02:54:58.420 --> 02:55:00.690
<v Speaker 3>you would have been a little too white</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the future is dark.</v>

4456
02:55:00.970 --> 02:55:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I know the future's Brown and Meek.</v>

4457
02:55:04.730 --> 02:55:07.820
<v Speaker 2>If you had glasses and you were thin and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown,</v>

4458
02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:09.980
<v Speaker 2>you'd have a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have two shows.</v>

4459
02:55:10.100 --> 02:55:12.700
<v Speaker 2>If you were a woman and you had glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4460
02:55:13.010 --> 02:55:14.460
<v Speaker 2>And you were Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might,</v>

4461
02:55:14.990 --> 02:55:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I might transform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4462
02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:20.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that what it is right now is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they just have so many specialists</v>

4463
02:55:20.031 --> 02:55:22.040
<v Speaker 2>that they're working on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my biggest problem was trying to</v>

4464
02:55:22.041 --> 02:55:23.300
<v Speaker 2>say that they be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4465
02:55:23.301 --> 02:55:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're only going after,</v>

4466
02:55:25.101 --> 02:55:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I forget what term he used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like either hipsters or they're going</v>

4467
02:55:29.121 --> 02:55:30.350
<v Speaker 2>after a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4468
02:55:30.351 --> 02:55:32.960
<v Speaker 2>diversity and like they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to give it to a white</v>

4469
02:55:32.961 --> 02:55:33.794
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4470
02:55:33.860 --> 02:55:35.670
<v Speaker 2>John Malaney just got a special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4471
02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:39.140
<v Speaker 2>we talking about like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Craig Ferguson just got it special.</v>

4472
02:55:39.140 --> 02:55:41.240
<v Speaker 3>It's just those that have built it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to build yourself.</v>

4473
02:55:41.241 --> 02:55:42.320
<v Speaker 3>You have to be built.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4474
02:55:42.860 --> 02:55:44.270
<v Speaker 3>that's how it always was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4475
02:55:44.271 --> 02:55:45.104
<v Speaker 3>of course</v>

4476
02:55:45.490 --> 02:55:48.730
<v Speaker 2>the way it always used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the problem is there's no</v>

4477
02:55:48.731 --> 02:55:53.731
<v Speaker 2>real valid entry level show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what it used to be is you would get</v>

4478
02:55:54.641 --> 02:55:59.641
<v Speaker 2>on like young comedian special on hbo</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there would be like four of Ya.</v>

4479
02:56:00.550 --> 02:56:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would do 15 minutes or so and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's how you'd make it.</v>

4480
02:56:04.180 --> 02:56:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was the Rodney</v>

4481
02:56:05.471 --> 02:56:09.100
<v Speaker 2>dangerfield specials and that's how we</v>
<v Speaker 2>found out about Lenny Clarke and dom</v>

4482
02:56:09.101 --> 02:56:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Irrera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4483
02:56:10.300 --> 02:56:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Bill Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Kinison,</v>

4484
02:56:11.951 --> 02:56:13.570
<v Speaker 2>dice clay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all came out of the Rodney</v>

4485
02:56:13.571 --> 02:56:16.690
<v Speaker 2>dangerfield specials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a thing like that anymore.</v>

4486
02:56:16.691 --> 02:56:18.880
<v Speaker 2>So you got to go through those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he got a special,</v>

4487
02:56:18.970 --> 02:56:21.820
<v Speaker 2>it's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like you just kinda get</v>

4488
02:56:21.821 --> 02:56:22.654
<v Speaker 2>specials,</v>

4489
02:56:23.170 --> 02:56:26.020
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to find a way into the game.</v>

4490
02:56:26.380 --> 02:56:28.510
<v Speaker 3>You have to find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to find like the niche that</v>

4491
02:56:28.511 --> 02:56:30.670
<v Speaker 3>gets you to the place to get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>

4492
02:56:30.730 --> 02:56:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Will you have a showtime special?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do hepatis special up on showtime last</v>

4493
02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:35.530
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is showtimes market is</v>

4494
02:56:35.531 --> 02:56:37.060
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4495
02:56:37.430 --> 02:56:39.370
<v Speaker 3>so specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only people that subscribed.</v>

4496
02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix is fucking everybody.</v>

4497
02:56:42.250 --> 02:56:45.700
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile Sebastian became of the</v>

4498
02:56:45.701 --> 02:56:48.400
<v Speaker 3>biggest comics in the world because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just cause a showtime.</v>

02:56:48.401 --> 02:56:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4500
02:56:48.830 --> 02:56:52.050
<v Speaker 3>Sebastian is the Unicorn man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when people go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>market is clear.</v>

4506
02:57:03.611 --> 02:57:06.220

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4510
02:57:11.771 --> 02:57:12.850
<v Speaker 3>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

4511
02:57:12.870 --> 02:57:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what all that is.</v>

4512
02:57:14.321 --> 02:57:16.000
<v Speaker 3>That's all perfect timing and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4513
02:57:16.090 --> 02:57:17.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean showtimes bigger.</v>

4514
02:57:17.141 --> 02:57:19.600

<v Speaker 3>anytime soon at all,</v>

4515
02:57:19.601 --> 02:57:21.190
<v Speaker 3>but if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I did do another one,</v>

4516
02:57:21.191 --> 02:57:22.150
<v Speaker 3>I do it with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4517
02:57:22.300 --> 02:57:23.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't really care where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4518
02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I just care the content that I put on it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and someone see it online,</v>

4519
02:57:27.191 --> 02:57:29.470
<v Speaker 3>can they go and get that show time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the biggest,</v>

4520
02:57:29.471 --> 02:57:30.191
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

4521
02:57:30.191 --> 02:57:32.470
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing about Netflix that's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>great is everybody has it,</v>

4522
02:57:32.980 --> 02:57:35.170
<v Speaker 3>but showtime is like my specialist</v>
<v Speaker 3>always there.</v>

4523
02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:37.140
<v Speaker 3>It's just you have to have showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've</v>

4524
02:57:37.150 --> 02:57:41.260
<v Speaker 2>talked about doing this with podcasts</v>
<v Speaker 2>about doing the same kind of thing,</v>

4525
02:57:41.290 --> 02:57:46.290
<v Speaker 2>like coming up with a bunch of cash and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an all podcasts under one umbrella.</v>

4526
02:57:46.960 --> 02:57:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4527
02:57:48.740 --> 02:57:53.650
<v Speaker 2>w like a Netflix type deal because</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody has their own way of doing it</v>

4528
02:57:53.651 --> 02:57:55.360
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody has their own way of</v>

4529
02:57:55.361 --> 02:57:58.240
<v Speaker 2>doing it in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people have ads,</v>

4530
02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:02.240
<v Speaker 2>some people have like a go fund me or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrion page.</v>

4531
02:58:02.670 --> 02:58:03.840
<v Speaker 1>But that would fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4532
02:58:03.860 --> 02:58:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Would fuck you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4533
02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4534
02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:07.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like,</v>

4535
02:58:08.790 --> 02:58:10.920
<v Speaker 1>unless it was like a netflix thing where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody had it.</v>

4536
02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:12.480
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have to be the thing.</v>

4537
02:58:12.510 --> 02:58:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what do you like Netflix is movies</v>

4538
02:58:15.121 --> 02:58:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a shit load of money to make</v>

4539
02:58:17.400 --> 02:58:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Netflix is TV shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take a shitload of money to make</v>

4540
02:58:20.910 --> 02:58:24.240
<v Speaker 1>this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have done it on a phone.</v>

4541
02:58:24.241 --> 02:58:27.450
<v Speaker 1>We could have set our iphone on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>table right there.</v>

4542
02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Press the auto record thing and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

4543
02:58:30.490 --> 02:58:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead we've got Jamie doing all</v>

4544
02:58:33.061 --> 02:58:36.910
<v Speaker 1>these fake button pushing and pr bro and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun flat cap.</v>

4545
02:58:36.911 --> 02:58:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Apple's market cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why me and Marcus Brown market</v>

4546
02:58:40.141 --> 02:58:43.890
<v Speaker 1>cap is closing in on $1 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had got $1 trillion.</v>

4547
02:58:43.891 --> 02:58:45.900
<v Speaker 1>You could literally buy every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>NFL,</v>

4548
02:58:45.901 --> 02:58:50.901
<v Speaker 1>NBA and mls team for NASA and a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand teslas and still have money</v>

4549
02:58:51.331 --> 02:58:53.520
<v Speaker 1>leftover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you couldn't buy apple.</v>

4550
02:58:53.880 --> 02:58:54.713
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

4553
02:59:06.031 --> 02:59:07.860
<v Speaker 1>with podcasts is very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they just,</v>

4554
02:59:08.280 --> 02:59:09.870
<v Speaker 1>they're just an aggregator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4555
02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:13.020
<v Speaker 1>like you have to have your own host and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just put it up on there and,</v>

4556
02:59:13.350 --> 02:59:17.130
<v Speaker 1>but through their itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're always in this trending</v>

4557
02:59:17.131 --> 02:59:19.860
<v Speaker 1>section and we're always in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4558
02:59:19.950 --> 02:59:23.340
<v Speaker 1>like the rankings when you're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who the top podcasts are,</v>

4559
02:59:23.341 --> 02:59:26.130
<v Speaker 1>we're always in there and that helps</v>
<v Speaker 1>people find you totally.</v>

4560
02:59:26.160 --> 02:59:29.310
<v Speaker 1>So they're helping people find you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are kind of a network in a way,</v>

4561
02:59:29.490 --> 02:59:32.700
<v Speaker 1>but they're not a network in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not like a youtube where</v>

4562
02:59:32.701 --> 02:59:36.120
<v Speaker 1>they control content and not like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

4563
02:59:37.260 --> 02:59:39.420
<v Speaker 1>they're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not hosting you.</v>

4564
02:59:39.480 --> 02:59:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Well they have apple music too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but podcasts are part of that.</v>

4565
02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that so weird that they don't</v>

4566
02:59:44.101 --> 02:59:47.550
<v Speaker 1>merge those like that that podcast is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate tab,</v>

4567
02:59:47.580 --> 02:59:48.990
<v Speaker 1>which makes no fucking sense to me.</v>

4568
02:59:49.560 --> 02:59:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just to be a sub category of</v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

4569
02:59:51.540 --> 02:59:52.440
<v Speaker 1>It should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4570
02:59:52.441 --> 02:59:56.250
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a thing of if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>something on itunes,</v>

4571
02:59:56.580 --> 02:59:58.650
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like apple music,</v>

4572
02:59:58.651 --> 03:00:01.170
<v Speaker 1>is it totally different jam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4573
03:00:01.200 --> 03:00:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Like apple music is them hosting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

4574
03:00:05.340 --> 03:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>They would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have your podcast.</v>

4575
03:00:07.381 --> 03:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>So if you said something really fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

4576
03:00:09.780 --> 03:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>like maybe they would get in trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 1>having you on.</v>

4577
03:00:12.450 --> 03:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think they won't sponsor someone song.</v>

4578
03:00:14.780 --> 03:00:15.171
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4579
03:00:15.171 --> 03:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

4580
03:00:16.740 --> 03:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Like any like radical punk rock fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy to my fucking mother host it.</v>

4581
03:00:23.070 --> 03:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going into it.</v>

4582
03:00:24.361 --> 03:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I don't think but like look</v>
<v Speaker 1>up like,</v>

4583
03:00:26.570 --> 03:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>but apple music can't like what does a</v>
<v Speaker 1>spotify market versus the apple music</v>

4584
03:00:31.381 --> 03:00:31.771
<v Speaker 1>market?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like?</v>

4585
03:00:31.771 --> 03:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think apple music has does well</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

4586
03:00:33.331 --> 03:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I think she's doing way better now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not as well as spotify does.</v>

4587
03:00:38.340 --> 03:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Cause I feel like spotify just dominates</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mark.</v>

4588
03:00:40.341 --> 03:00:40.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>

4589
03:00:40.891 --> 03:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>apple music's on everyone's phone now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just find it and use it.</v>

4590
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't use spotify.</v>

4591
03:00:47.700 --> 03:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's the,</v>

4592
03:00:48.740 --> 03:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>the youngest generation loves spotify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they love soundcloud.</v>

4593
03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:53.433
<v Speaker 1>Soundcloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4594
03:00:54.060 --> 03:00:56.390
<v Speaker 1>So big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They loved they soundcloud.</v>

4595
03:00:56.460 --> 03:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were using the host</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>

4596
03:00:58.321 --> 03:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

4597
03:00:58.960 --> 03:01:00.550
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people think that it won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be around.</v>

4598
03:01:00.670 --> 03:01:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the opposite.</v>

4599
03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do I think,</v>

4600
03:01:02.951 --> 03:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>not only is it for stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's homemade podcast stuff like diy,</v>

4601
03:01:06.010 --> 03:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>it's also set to surpass spotify page</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid subscribers.</v>

4602
03:01:09.380 --> 03:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4603
03:01:09.990 --> 03:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause spotify starts off for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

4604
03:01:11.780 --> 03:01:12.940
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

4605
03:01:13.660 --> 03:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like that's my thing is like,</v>

4606
03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4607
03:01:17.531 --> 03:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>like that the future of soundcloud thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is because it's,</v>

4608
03:01:20.530 --> 03:01:22.450
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody loves diy shit.</v>

4609
03:01:22.450 --> 03:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's musicians or like all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians and artists now that are on</v>

4610
03:01:25.661 --> 03:01:27.790
<v Speaker 1>spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all people like making music in</v>

4611
03:01:27.791 --> 03:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>their fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their house.</v>

4612
03:01:29.830 --> 03:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Fucking youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4613
03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:32.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many youtube millionaires have been</v>

4614
03:01:32.501 --> 03:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>made from a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many weird shit.</v>

4615
03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Putting up videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

4616
03:01:38.470 --> 03:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I know some from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some from the beginning,</v>

4617
03:01:40.211 --> 03:01:44.440
<v Speaker 1>like I used to do a youtube sketch thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time ago and like caught fire a</v>

4618
03:01:44.441 --> 03:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>little bit on a fairly small scale and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that we kind of associated</v>

4619
03:01:47.861 --> 03:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>with when it was starting to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three of them now that I know</v>

4620
03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>have made so much money from that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just from the jump,</v>

4621
03:01:54.551 --> 03:01:56.800
<v Speaker 1>they were kind of like in right as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cusp was like beginning.</v>

4622
03:01:56.801 --> 03:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what happens with that dude who</v>
<v Speaker 1>got in trouble with the suicide?</v>

4623
03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that Jager?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan Paul.</v>

4624
03:02:02.051 --> 03:02:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Which one is he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan.</v>

4625
03:02:03.491 --> 03:02:04.324
<v Speaker 1>Paul Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul.</v>

4626
03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:05.680
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's banned.</v>

4627
03:02:05.710 --> 03:02:08.350
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they demonetize his entire channel and I</v>

4628
03:02:08.351 --> 03:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>thought he's still making videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4629
03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:13.810
<v Speaker 1>He's not making any money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took all his ad money away because</v>

4630
03:02:13.811 --> 03:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>he electrocuted a dead rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4631
03:02:16.980 --> 03:02:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a video yesterday at two and a</v>

4632
03:02:18.791 --> 03:02:19.571
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A million views.</v>

4633
03:02:19.571 --> 03:02:20.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't get paid?</v>

4634
03:02:21.650 --> 03:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were saying that it's,</v>

4635
03:02:22.741 --> 03:02:26.110
<v Speaker 1>his entire channel was demonetized</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless he got lawyers involved.</v>

4636
03:02:26.290 --> 03:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>So then he could be just using his</v>
<v Speaker 1>channel and then getting sponsored</v>

4637
03:02:29.621 --> 03:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>videos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and merge,</v>

4638
03:02:32.890 --> 03:02:34.900
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the big things to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stunning.</v>

4639
03:02:34.901 --> 03:02:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Makes more unmerge probably then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't from fucking youtube probably</v>

4640
03:02:37.721 --> 03:02:40.990
<v Speaker 1>does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it's stunning that there is not a</v>

4641
03:02:40.991 --> 03:02:43.480
<v Speaker 1>competitor to Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a real competitor.</v>

4642
03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been tried.</v>

4643
03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>They've tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

4644
03:02:46.301 --> 03:02:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Vimeo is just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not happening.</v>

4645
03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a video hosting site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

4646
03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:53.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not as user friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also,</v>

4647
03:02:53.201 --> 03:02:56.240
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't suggest things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their algorithm that youtube was totaled</v>

4648
03:02:56.260 --> 03:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>out to having what's next on the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand side,</v>

4649
03:02:58.900 --> 03:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it's like so attractive because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>always something there to click on Vimeo</v>

4650
03:03:02.651 --> 03:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>does.is that they're not as</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated in that way.</v>

4651
03:03:04.931 --> 03:03:06.510
<v Speaker 1>They want to be the artistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4652
03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

4653
03:03:08.230 --> 03:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>They want to cultivate like the sexy</v>
<v Speaker 1>little artistic thing.</v>

4654
03:03:10.391 --> 03:03:11.141
<v Speaker 1>Youtube is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

4655
03:03:11.141 --> 03:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Here's everything we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've ever wanted to see.</v>

4656
03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>And ads for Tampons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

4657
03:03:15.971 --> 03:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>W W we're putting up every video on</v>

4658
03:03:18.731 --> 03:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Vimeo as well as on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on youtube it'll have over a million</v>

4659
03:03:22.091 --> 03:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million hits.</v>

4660
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>And then you go to Vimeo and the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>video we'll have like what,</v>

4661
03:03:26.740 --> 03:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,000,</v>

4662
03:03:28.090 --> 03:03:28.923
<v Speaker 1>20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4663
03:03:29.230 --> 03:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say,</v>

4664
03:03:29.950 --> 03:03:31.020
<v Speaker 1>cause there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so sick,</v>

4665
03:03:31.030 --> 03:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>their viewer traffic is so much lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much lower.</v>

4666
03:03:33.521 --> 03:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>The only time I watch vimeo is when</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone sends me an email link.</v>

4667
03:03:37.100 --> 03:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>And you got to think that video link is</v>
<v Speaker 1>being sent to whatever million people I</v>

4668
03:03:41.711 --> 03:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>have on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

4669
03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I have like 2 million people in 2</v>
<v Speaker 1>million Russian bots.</v>

4670
03:03:48.100 --> 03:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure which one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all bought suits.</v>

4671
03:03:50.310 --> 03:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that works.</v>

<v Speaker 1>doesn't make eye contact with anybody.</v>
