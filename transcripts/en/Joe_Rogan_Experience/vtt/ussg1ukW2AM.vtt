00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with your time these days?</v>

3
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Like what's a typical day for Hixon Gracie?</v>

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>right now I back to teach in Crohn's place because I wanted to,</v>

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>to have him march dcis,</v>

7
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.490
<v Speaker 1>stress with the,</v>

8
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>how they academy goes.</v>

9
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>So I pick two times a week to teach.</v>

10
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:25.131
<v Speaker 1>They're giving defense glasses at this point.</v>

11
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:30.441
<v Speaker 1>Before that I was doing seminars once a month at the most,</v>

12
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>

13
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>twice every couple of months to to make my living.</v>

14
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>And also because I feel like the best things in life,</v>

15
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>money cannot buy.</v>

16
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like the quality of my,</v>

17
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

18
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>my meals that the way I eat,</v>

19
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>the way my relationship,</v>

20
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>my sleep,</v>

21
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>those are very,</v>

22
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>very viable.</v>

23
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:52.831
<v Speaker 1>A sets,</v>

24
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>plus the time I have to do things I love to do.</v>

26
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of when this is fuel.</v>

27
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Like when I feel like I'm everything.</v>

28
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like I'm happy enough to be my best at service because I always tried</v>

29
00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>to be at service helping somebody with Jujitsu with knowledge.</v>

30
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>We from nutrition with breathing,</v>

31
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not about the price is about the,</v>

33
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>the service,</v>

34
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.291
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

35
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And then I put my head in the and said,</v>

36
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.601
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

37
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I knew I'd have a nice day.</v>

38
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I make a good speech with Joe Hogan.</v>

39
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I have a nice talk with Bravo was great day.</v>

40
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>So somehow in a purpose for the federation.</v>

41
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>So I always try to be positive,</v>

42
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>but I have no schedule fixed.</v>

43
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Like I have to wake up vote you wouldn't know because at this point I create a</v>

44
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:44.511
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle which make me feel good to engage in different elements like this</v>

45
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:51.051
<v Speaker 1>federation now and having glasses on crowns and be here to be full of energy.</v>

46
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:52.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

47
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes you don't notice,</v>

48
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but based on your,</v>

49
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

50
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>your commitments,</v>

51
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>your obligation,</v>

52
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.840
<v Speaker 1>you'll becoming more like a Robert and you,</v>

53
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>you lose the perspective of what you need to be at your best.</v>

54
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>And if you lose that perspective,</v>

55
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>even though you still doing your routine,</v>

56
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.620
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you just minus you just 80 70 60% of what you should be.</v>

57
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>So you're not going to be the best husband,</v>

58
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be the best father,</v>

59
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>the best employer,</v>

60
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>the best employee,</v>

61
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.321
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

62
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:25.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:26.574
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

64
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>so at this point I feel like I have to be at my best physically do my,</v>

65
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>if I feel like I have to stretch,</v>

66
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>they're going to stretch,</v>

67
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:34.284
<v Speaker 1>breed,</v>

68
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>

69
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.181
<v Speaker 1>have fun,</v>

70
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>listen buddy,</v>

71
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:37.944
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

72
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

73
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>And then when I feel like,</v>

74
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.411
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

75
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy I could not eat so and then I can go and do my service,</v>

76
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:45.091
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

77
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And no,</v>

78
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>because the window of life is smaller now for me is becomes,</v>

79
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't have too much time,</v>

80
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>so I don't waste time to do what people expect from me.</v>

81
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I try to do things,</v>

82
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I read the relevant to my soul,</v>

83
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>like this federation now I use I when I dream,</v>

84
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't dream small.</v>

85
00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I dream like I make like a very space for a few days.</v>

86
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.200
<v Speaker 1>The biggest dream I can ream and I see that you know that level of of need for</v>

87
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 1>the community and the level of of position.</v>

88
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:23.671
<v Speaker 1>I have to be the reference for that shift in the direction of our culture,</v>

89
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>in our knowledge.</v>

90
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I could not be more motivated,</v>

91
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>more happy to engage on this.</v>

92
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.651
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

93
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>and that's always life is about is just do your best and,</v>

94
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:35.781
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

95
00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>and be excited to be motivated to,</v>

96
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

97
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.143
<v Speaker 1>to the next day.</v>

98
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 2>There's such a refreshing attitude,</v>

99
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.830
<v Speaker 2>your attitude,</v>

100

<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

101
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 2>your philosophy on life because I think it's very easy and I've been,</v>

102
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 2>I've trapped myself in it sometimes where you concentrate too much.</v>

103
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.101
<v Speaker 2>I'm making money,</v>

104
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:55.410
<v Speaker 2>concentrate too much on being ambitious and you forget the quality of life.</v>

105
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

106
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 2>You are focuses almost entirely on your quality of it.</v>

107
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

108
00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.581
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

109
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>because like I said man,</v>

110
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.780
<v Speaker 1>how much cost your motivation,</v>

111
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.520
<v Speaker 1>how much costs your friends,</v>

112
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.990
<v Speaker 1>how much cost your health,</v>

113
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.071
<v Speaker 1>how much cost,</v>

114
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 1>your intelligence,</v>

115
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.250
<v Speaker 1>those things is priceless.</v>

116
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you take those off your life,</v>

117
00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:13.741
<v Speaker 1>you take,</v>

118
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:15.120
<v Speaker 1>you're more vision of your life.</v>

119
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.670
<v Speaker 1>It can be Bill Gates can be the biggest.</v>

120
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.810
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

121
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>if you ask me if I want to have bill gates life,</v>

122
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.451
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

123
00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:22.284
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him.</v>

124
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.520
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a based on his bank account is based on how happy he is,</v>

125
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 1>how horny he is,</v>

126
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:28.200
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

127
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:29.180
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

129
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.013
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

130
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.460
<v Speaker 1>how motivated he is to wake up and do his thing.</v>

131
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.960
<v Speaker 1>He don't look too horny.</v>

132
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.883
<v Speaker 1>I don't think</v>

133
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.933
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

134
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.893
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

135
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a very essential thing,</v>

136
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>which sometimes sleep to people's fingers and,</v>

137
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 1>and the priorities in the daily,</v>

138
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 1>in the payments and say put you in a role where uh,</v>

140
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

141
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

142
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>if you tell me in the past what's the core age,</v>

143
00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:00.210
<v Speaker 1>what's the opposite of courage?</v>

144
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I want to say cowardness because either you tough enough to challenge and to</v>

145
00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:08.310
<v Speaker 1>fight or to or in their new car and then you chicken out.</v>

146
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:10.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's in the past was like the,</v>

147
00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:10.380
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

148
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.010
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

149
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.311
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

150
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.690
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of,</v>

151
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.070
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

152
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>of college is very high to remember this in those days.</v>

153
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 1>And I believe the opposite of it should they use conformity,</v>

154
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.520
<v Speaker 1>is people get conformed.</v>

156
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.061
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

157
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't like my wife the way I used to like,</v>

158
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.050
<v Speaker 1>but I'm never going to divorce because I'm afraid to lose my house or the</v>

159
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:33.030
<v Speaker 1>situation is so established so I got to keep,</v>

160
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.620
<v Speaker 1>so I don't like this job,</v>

161
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.540
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to keep here because better than his.</v>

162
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.830
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>

163
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:38.151
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

164
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>in all the hands of the few,</v>

165
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.520
<v Speaker 1>if you get quiet on that kind of compromise to,</v>

166
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.790
<v Speaker 1>to maintain because you afraid to risk,</v>

167
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.850
<v Speaker 1>let's keep you like one step behind from you,</v>

168
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.350
<v Speaker 1>follow your heart,</v>

169
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:50.580
<v Speaker 1>follow the ambition.</v>

170
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.020
<v Speaker 1>You should 18 years old,</v>

171
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>you don't think twice.</v>

172
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.251
<v Speaker 1>Like I say,</v>

173
00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:53.341
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

174
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>let's go to Australia.</v>

175
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:54.511
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

176
00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:54.781
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

177
00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:55.614
<v Speaker 1>let's go boom.</v>

178
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.970
<v Speaker 1>But when you fifth 50 sales,</v>

179
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.481
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

180
00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do there?</v>

181
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:59.264
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm going to,</v>

182
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 1>so it's different,</v>

183
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:01.094
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of hate or what are we going?</v>

185
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.841
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

186
00:06:04.841 --> 00:06:09.841
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of pretty much where keep you from be at your best because if you</v>

187
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>willing to sacrifice,</v>

188
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to broke new,</v>

189
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.890
<v Speaker 1>new challenges,</v>

190
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.400
<v Speaker 1>if you really chew you in the stage of liveliness and,</v>

191
00:06:21.401 --> 00:06:23.740
<v Speaker 1>and excitement and unpredictability,</v>

192
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>who make you feel like you're in heaven,</v>

193
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.700
<v Speaker 1>every time I was engaging in a compromise or a fight was something that I thank</v>

195
00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:32.841
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

196
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Like I have my routines prior to fight.</v>

197
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>One of them is edit day off my fight.</v>

198
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I wake up and I thank you.</v>

199
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Glad to be alive and I acknowledge how perfect we'll be that day.</v>

200
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 1>If I die today,</v>

201
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.730
<v Speaker 1>say fuck my wasn't,</v>

202
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>there'd be a perfect day if I die because I have,</v>

203
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>I accomplished my think I'm in my mission,</v>

205
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I representing my family.</v>

206
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 1>So I don't go that you tap,</v>

207
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I go there to die.</v>

208
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I have to kill me.</v>

209
00:06:58.791 --> 00:06:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

210
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going at that.</v>

211
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.101
<v Speaker 1>So by,</v>

212
00:07:02.101 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 1>that's not a sport like orientation,</v>

213
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 1>this is a philosophical,</v>

214
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.863
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

215
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 1>owner representation,</v>

216
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:08.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

217
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>is not something I teach.</v>

218
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:11.450
<v Speaker 1>My snow should not that,</v>

219
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

220
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.403
<v Speaker 1>it's not like that.</v>

221
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 1>It's about how I feel,</v>

222
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>how I feed my kids,</v>

223
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>how I follow my tradition.</v>

224
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 1>So in engagement,</v>

225
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I am not going to be the one who going to quit.</v>

226
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Then I have to cure me,</v>

227
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.151
<v Speaker 1>my brother,</v>

228
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 1>he can throw the Tao.</v>

229
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 1>But for me is unacceptable.</v>

230
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

231
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I do give up from my life.</v>

232
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Speaker 1>So based on that kind of spiritual guidance,</v>

233
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 1>my life is very intense.</v>

234
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 1>My life is very,</v>

235
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean directed to accomplish give up is not an option.</v>

236
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

237
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.403
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

238
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I can direct my,</v>

239
00:07:43.651 --> 00:07:43.971
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

240
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 1>my focus,</v>

241
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I can give up from something to go somewhere else,</v>

242
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 1>but I never will give up from something because I feel like I cannot reach</v>

243
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:52.814
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

244
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.391
<v Speaker 1>I may say,</v>

245
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:53.781
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

246
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:54.531
<v Speaker 1>that's not for me.</v>

247
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 1>I go somewhere else.</v>

248
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>But if I still focus,</v>

249
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I will take those falls.</v>

250
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I will take those obstacles as a motivation to just set up a new strategy to try</v>

251
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:05.684
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

252
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

253
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm very competitive in a sense.</v>

254
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I like the perfection of things.</v>

255
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 1>So this is like a,</v>

256
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 1>a situation where put you in a situation where you will have no,</v>

257
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>either you go forward or you don't,</v>

258
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 1>you don't stay in the middle.</v>

259
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Don't say just waiting for people are waiting for more.</v>

260
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Those are kinds of things going to stack you back in life and,</v>

261
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>and just make you feel like best through life.</v>

262
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:30.720
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

263
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't,</v>

264
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:31.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

265
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 1>you irrelevant,</v>

266
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:33.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

267
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 1>is is very weak.</v>

268
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.270
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

269
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
