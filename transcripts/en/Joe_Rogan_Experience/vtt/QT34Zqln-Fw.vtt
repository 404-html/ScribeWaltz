<v Speaker 2>Or something.</v>

26
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.600
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

27
00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 2>that exact same thing happened when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>did my podcast.</v>

30
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you use the calendar feature </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your phone?</v>

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I only do it for his shows.</v>

32
00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 2>It seems like by like little things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>

33
00:01:12.221 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really always,</v>

34
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 2>that's not a little thing.</v>

35
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.393
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think that people would like </v>

36
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 2>remind me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 2>like not 40 minutes before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

38
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:21.820

<v Speaker 2>I'll see you tomorrow.</v>

39
00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

40
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

41
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.793
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

42
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

43
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.923
<v Speaker 2>But then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that I had another one that I </v>

44
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.093
<v Speaker 2>completely forgot about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then I had to go to the comedy show </v>

45
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:30.934
<v Speaker 2>last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think bread is making an excellent </v>

46
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:33.394
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't write it off to other </v>

47
00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

48
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 2>it's totally me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should keep a calendar though.</v>

49
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:39.700
<v Speaker 2>It's totally me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

50
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think of podcasts is a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing at all.</v>

51
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm going to do some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>

52
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 2>that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

53
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.604
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're like at a comedy clubs </v>

54
00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 2>stoned and someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

55
00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 2>you should do my podcast next Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

56
00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 2>I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different animal.</v>

57
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 2>You got to ask people.</v>

58
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.823
<v Speaker 2>I'm like an email or a text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like asking someone in person unless </v>

59
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're both sober,</v>

60
00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.413
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And another problem I have is when </v>

61
00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:03.670
<v Speaker 2>people give me their numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't save it in my phone.</v>

62
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.710
<v Speaker 2>And they said when they text me like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month later,</v>

63
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:06.341
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

64
00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Who is this guy that's texting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do this to you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

66
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.303

67
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.133
<v Speaker 2>texts because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they got a new phone </v>

68
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.500

<v Speaker 4>Matt,</v>

98
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.970
<v Speaker 4>we had some deep conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 4>ants.</v>

99
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

100
00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 4>seriously in the ants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I am too in a way.</v>

101
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.001
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not like him.</v>

102
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:54.834
<v Speaker 4>I don't know as much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've watched quite a few </v>

103
00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:59.550
<v Speaker 4>documentaries on it and it's like when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch them and like this is amazing.</v>

104
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.540
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

105
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.523
<v Speaker 4>they just know how to go places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all like in the same row and </v>

106
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:06.690
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to figure out how they do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

107
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:07.524
<v Speaker 4>It's by pheromones and shit and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>see these super complex civilizations </v>

108
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:15.420
<v Speaker 4>that they build underground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially those leaf cutter ants.</v>

109
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.263
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen that shit dude?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leafcutter ants are so sophisticated </v>

110
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.913
<v Speaker 4>that they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've engineered some sort of like </v>

111
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:23.334
<v Speaker 4>ventilation system so they could bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaves down into their crazy house and </v>

112
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 4>they'll ferment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

113
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.753
<v Speaker 4>these leaves will ferment in these like </v>
<v Speaker 4>bowls that they've dug into the ground </v>

114
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.163
<v Speaker 4>and there's a pipe above it that's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>an air pipe that they've tunneled up </v>

115
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:43.020
<v Speaker 4>through the surface just to allow the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gases to escape.</v>

116
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 4>No explanation whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How they all know how to do this.</v>

117
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.310
<v Speaker 4>No explanation how they ever figured it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

118
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's super complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been programmed that way.</v>

119
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.021
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 4>into these things?</v>

124
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:03.594
<v Speaker 4>I want to think they pulled posy melanin</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they pull it out and it looks </v>

125
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:07.590
<v Speaker 4>like an art project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:19.770
<v Speaker 4>how were they all communicating together</v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure this out?</v>

131
00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:21.930
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not one is it?</v>

136
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:31.164
<v Speaker 4>there was a video of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you find it and they showed how </v>

137
00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:36.264
<v Speaker 4>they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they poured the water in or the </v>

138
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 4>concrete in rather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is kind of rude,</v>

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.743
<v Speaker 4>So they pour this molten aluminum in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fill the whole thing and then this </v>

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.293
<v Speaker 4>so it's an oh aunt caster.com.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a company that murders ants for </v>

164
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:01.830
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's real big.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It is one of the weirdest things,</v>

166
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could,</v>

167
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.603
<v Speaker 4>you could kill an ant on your pants and </v>
<v Speaker 4>brush it to the ground in any </v>

168
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 4>respectable office and nobody freaks </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

169
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

170
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 4>No one says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where'd you kill bees these days?</v>

171
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 4>People get pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get pissed and they should.</v>

172
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have any many bees,</v>

173
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>running out and bees and we want to keep</v>

174
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 4>our cell phones and we want to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>pesticide.</v>

175
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.370
<v Speaker 4>So we'd had a piece in pests and cell </v>
<v Speaker 4>phones and petrified connect.</v>

176
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.130
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a bee expert,</v>

177
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.053
<v Speaker 4>I should just say that off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I've read is that they're </v>

178
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:34.754
<v Speaker 4>pretty sure that bees are affected by </v>
<v Speaker 4>cell phone signals and some sort of a </v>

179
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 4>negative way.</v>

180
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.020
<v Speaker 4>And it interferes with their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate with each other up.</v>

181
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 4>Or there's another possible thought is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they might be hearing this,</v>

182
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 4>the sound of the cell phone signal all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time,</v>

183
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.153
<v Speaker 4>and it's just driving them nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just interfering or intruding in </v>

184
00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:57.240
<v Speaker 4>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cell phone service,</v>

185
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 4>the frequencies are making b's autistics</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they can't talk to each other.</v>

186
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.350
<v Speaker 4>That's why autism or up is up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

187
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 4>Big Autism epidemic interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we were on fear factor,</v>

188
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 4>we did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had this instant we were up in um,</v>

189
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 4>or they're going to say you did it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>autistic.</v>

190
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.540
<v Speaker 4>He's autistic fuckers lied to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

191
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had this um,</v>

192
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.270
<v Speaker 4>this stumbling recovering people in bees</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we're on this ranch and uh,</v>

193
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.133
<v Speaker 4>they had these people and they would </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand there like leaning up against a </v>

194
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:28.460
<v Speaker 4>pole and this guy would come over with </v>
<v Speaker 4>these and just coat them with bs,</v>

195
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:29.420
<v Speaker 4>like scoop it on them.</v>

196
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 4>They had a stand with a bs on him for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of time.</v>

197
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.473
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they had to like unlock locks or </v>

198
00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 4>something stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But while this was going on,</v>

199
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.770
<v Speaker 4>this local colony of bees showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was like a b gang meeting.</v>

200
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.840
<v Speaker 4>Like they had to have a meeting and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>had leave.</v>

201
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 4>Like the guy who's the bee guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

202
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.403
<v Speaker 4>here's the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a local colony that just came </v>

203
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 4>to investigate why my colonies here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to let them work this out.</v>

204
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.640
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

205
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we,</v>

206
00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had to all leave the set.</v>

207
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 4>So we all left the set and we went over </v>
<v Speaker 4>like by these trailers that they had set</v>

208
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:07.644
<v Speaker 4>up and we kind of watched these bees </v>
<v Speaker 4>just fly around each other should oh </v>

209
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they had to figure each other out.</v>

210
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 4>They had to figure out like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you guys doing here?</v>

211
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 4>Oh we're filming a show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh what did we watch it?</v>

212
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 4>And then they had like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had a talk,</v>

213
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 4>like they had to have a meeting and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

214
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 4>we're not moving in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't live here.</v>

215
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 4>We live like down there in that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously they didn't use English</v>

216
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.813
<v Speaker 4>but somehow or another they communicated</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they needed to and like 20 </v>

217
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:32.580
<v Speaker 4>minutes later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we were allowed to go back to work.</v>

218
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.310
<v Speaker 6>Or they're dead bees on the ground when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you got over there?</v>

219
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.121
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

220
00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:37.640
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if there were just finding a dead</v>

221
00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:39.580
<v Speaker 6>being on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean like if there were,</v>

222
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.883
<v Speaker 6>there'll be more than one you'd imagine </v>
<v Speaker 6>like maybe like 30 dead bees on the </v>

223
00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.130
<v Speaker 6>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like 300,</v>

224
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.013
<v Speaker 6>300 bees,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the movie 300 fucking xerxes victims </v>

232
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.960

<v Speaker 6>that like right off Alameda,</v>

233
00:10:05.961 --> 00:10:06.794
<v Speaker 6>that back road I was driving through one</v>
<v Speaker 6>time I had my windows down and all of a </v>

00:10:09.741 --> 00:10:14.660
<v Speaker 6>sudden thought maybe a thousand bees </v>
<v Speaker 6>just flying around and all in the car.</v>

235
00:10:14.661 --> 00:10:15.500
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mother,</v>

236
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.873
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>

237
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.520
<v Speaker 6>I just kept driving and I just sped up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

238
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.380
<v Speaker 6>and they came in and out of the car </v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty quickly,</v>

239
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.300
<v Speaker 6>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I drove right through them.</v>

240
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.370
<v Speaker 6>And that same thing happened in front of</v>
<v Speaker 6>our house.</v>

241
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.960
<v Speaker 6>In front of our house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a dead,</v>

242
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.143
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like elm tree or something or a walnut </v>

243
00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:30.980
<v Speaker 6>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a walnut grove.</v>

244
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.173
<v Speaker 6>And it's all hollowed out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there were like a thousand bees </v>

245
00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:35.534
<v Speaker 6>living inside that and my daughter's </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrified of bees and our neighbor just </v>

246
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:39.494
<v Speaker 6>went in and put like a song,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a towel in the top and just lock </v>

247
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:45.890
<v Speaker 6>them in and had them die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I mean,</v>

248
00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:47.180
<v Speaker 6>fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a dick.</v>

249
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.700

251
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:54.190
<v Speaker 6>I think it was long island that found </v>
<v Speaker 6>this mega</v>

252
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.063
<v Speaker 4>colony in his attic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went up in his attic and it was </v>

253
00:10:58.251 --> 00:11:01.280
<v Speaker 4>either aunts or I use either a bees or </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasps.</v>

254
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember which one it was,</v>

255
00:11:04.461 --> 00:11:08.930
<v Speaker 4>but what I remember is this fucking guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>was up in his attic and it was like,</v>

256
00:11:08.931 --> 00:11:09.764
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about something as big as </v>

257
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:17.021
<v Speaker 4>this table is an enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enormous bee colony in his attic.</v>

258
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.730
<v Speaker 4>They just had found a way through that </v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

259
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:20.810
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's warm in here.</v>

260
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.740
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's keep,</v>

261
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.573
<v Speaker 4>and he just never went up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they just kept building this </v>

262
00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:25.844
<v Speaker 4>goddamn thing.</v>

263
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.130
<v Speaker 6>So it was this huge shelter that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>they've got,</v>

264
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.200
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Africa is a video of a Jamie,</v>

265
00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:35.410
<v Speaker 6>if you could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are africanized bees in business.</v>

266
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 6>Oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like all over that.</v>

267
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.150
<v Speaker 6>I saw that online one time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Literally the,</v>

268
00:11:40.151 --> 00:11:41.890
<v Speaker 6>those are the killer bees.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are the bad ones.</v>

269
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.770
<v Speaker 6>And they got dudes that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was a TV show now that I said</v>

270
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.570
<v Speaker 6>that sounds like I fucking read </v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

271
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:47.523
<v Speaker 6>But it was a reality show about a guy </v>
<v Speaker 6>who would just get rid of Ackford </v>

272
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.120
<v Speaker 6>africanized bees.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are the scary ones.</v>

273
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.523
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember when you were a kid and </v>

274
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 6>everyone was scared of African killer </v>
<v Speaker 6>bees,</v>

275
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 6>quicksand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The killer bees.</v>

276
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.620
<v Speaker 6>Then we've talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think before her quicksand go,</v>

277
00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 6>they turn into porn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quicksand,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

279

<v Speaker 6>today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me tell you something.</v>

285
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:21.460
<v Speaker 6>Last night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joey Diaz is on stage at the hall.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to do is bid at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know if it's a bit or it's </v>

287
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:24.994
<v Speaker 6>him talking because quite honestly I </v>
<v Speaker 6>watched him smoke maybe 10 cup fulls of </v>

288
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:33.160
<v Speaker 6>Hash on vine before he came there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he was doing this bit,</v>

289
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:33.994
<v Speaker 6>I'm in the back just kind of watching </v>
<v Speaker 6>him and he's doing this bit about </v>

290
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 6>watching two dogs.</v>

<v Speaker 6>these two,</v>

<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

361
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't get to bear the bear face and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>says marshmallow in it.</v>

362
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.430
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You can't leave it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>what will come on joey go.</v>

420
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:42.710
<v Speaker 5>Why do you want everybody else to follow</v>
<v Speaker 5>these rules?</v>

421
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 5>These rules don't make sense if it's so </v>
<v Speaker 5>easy to just text you a message.</v>

422
00:17:46.281 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 5>Say Hey brother showed tonight is at 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>why isn't that</v>

423
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.933
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why isn't that okay because I'm </v>

424
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 6>insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to talk to you,</v>

425
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:55.284
<v Speaker 6>want to look you in the eyes like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He going to fucking tell me something </v>

<v Speaker 6>you on the phone.</v>

427
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.913
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to argue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No more voicemail APP is an APP that </v>

428
00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:04.884
<v Speaker 6>kills voicemail so cars have to text you</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm pretty sure you could just turn </v>

429
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:11.250
<v Speaker 6>off voicemail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just let it fill up fucking APP.</v>

430
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.490
<v Speaker 6>I just slipped that bitch fill up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me tell you something.</v>

433
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:25.240
<v Speaker 6>since I've known him because that </v>
<v Speaker 6>because that and that it's,</v>

434
00:18:25.241 --> 00:18:27.900
<v Speaker 6>it's interesting cause it's helped </v>
<v Speaker 6>blossom a part of my personality because</v>

438
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.093
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to bother people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just afraid people bother people </v>

439
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.320
<v Speaker 6>being considerate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But Joey is one of those guys,</v>

<v Speaker 6>didn't do it.</v>

553
00:23:16.281 --> 00:23:19.970
<v Speaker 4>on stage because Joey was always the </v>
<v Speaker 4>funniest guy in the parking lot.</v>

554
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.390
<v Speaker 4>And then he would go on stage and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know what it is man.</v>

555
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.550

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

556
00:23:25.551 --> 00:23:28.160
<v Speaker 4>those tense moments.</v>

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:32.270
<v Speaker 4>there was just starting doing comedy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>choose doing a set and I could tell like</v>

558
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.420
<v Speaker 4>she's got potential but she just can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get comfortable up there.</v>

559
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.230
<v Speaker 4>She can't be herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

560
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.440
<v Speaker 4>there's like this something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these thoughts,</v>

561
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.710
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this like compression that's holding you</v>

562
00:23:42.711 --> 00:23:43.850
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it anymore.</v>

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:48.853
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was crazy and we had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends for like a couple of years and </v>

565
00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:54.160
<v Speaker 4>he just wasn't doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

566
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.200
<v Speaker 4>cause he wasn't doing well on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then all the sudden he was murdering.</v>

567
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:02.360
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen anything like it before.</v>

568
00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:03.194
<v Speaker 4>It was like a switch flipped and as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different person out there and he was </v>

569
00:24:07.641 --> 00:24:08.474
<v Speaker 4>the same guy from the parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it matter who the fuck's in the </v>

570
00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:11.720
<v Speaker 4>crowd?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't matter.</v>

571
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:12.703

<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

573
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.600
<v Speaker 4>it was just the most ridiculous shit and</v>
<v Speaker 4>really fucking funny.</v>

574
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.400
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden I outta nowhere</v>

<v Speaker 6>Like that's what,</v>

610
00:25:29.721 --> 00:25:32.860
<v Speaker 6>when you're doing standup like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like all the fucking time you're back.</v>

611
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.070
<v Speaker 6>It's nice and tight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

612
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 6>And I'm in fucking hard core fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>standup mode.</v>

613
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.430
<v Speaker 6>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love it,</v>

614
00:25:40.431 --> 00:25:42.440
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love it so much.</v>

615
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 6>But we were talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you do that show so much that maybe</v>

616
00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:49.370
<v Speaker 6>it's reached the point where the show </v>
<v Speaker 6>was kind of getting in the way.</v>

617
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.900
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't realize it.</v>

618
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.580
<v Speaker 6>And you had said that to me at one </v>
<v Speaker 6>point.</v>

619
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.280
<v Speaker 6>You'd said a couple of things to me that</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're a little heavy that I couldn't,</v>

620
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.250
<v Speaker 6>that I couldn't wrap my head around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think it was man,</v>

621
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.411
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was,</v>

622
00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:02.480
<v Speaker 6>cause I wasn't doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't understand what I was trying to</v>

623
00:26:02.481 --> 00:26:03.390
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you,</v>

624
00:26:03.391 --> 00:26:06.140
<v Speaker 6>you get into production mode.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well what did I say that was heavy?</v>

625
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.213
<v Speaker 6>One thing you said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the two things you said is he stopped </v>

626
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.250
<v Speaker 6>doing that show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You need to get back on stage.</v>

627
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.730
<v Speaker 6>You're too good of a comic to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>not be doing standup like all the time.</v>

628
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.713
<v Speaker 6>And then the other thing you said was </v>
<v Speaker 6>you've gotta be looking at this show </v>

629
00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:18.260
<v Speaker 6>you're doing and you need to be writing </v>
<v Speaker 6>about this on stage.</v>

630
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.540
<v Speaker 6>The problem is I couldn't write about </v>
<v Speaker 6>what I was doing.</v>

631
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.493
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know how to write about these </v>
<v Speaker 6>activities because I wasn't a standup </v>

632
00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 6>mode.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was in production mode.</v>

633
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.020
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what times are called time?</v>

634

<v Speaker 4>you're all over the world.</v>

674
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.113
<v Speaker 6>but like everything looked for me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>looked a little cookie cutter where it </v>

675
00:27:56.221 --> 00:27:58.470
<v Speaker 6>was like everything was done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a certain type of thing.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Like just stack of blunt.</v>

702
00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:02.163
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I watch that.</v>

709
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:17.780
<v Speaker 6>I found that at the beach one weekend </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I watched all of them back.</v>

710
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.230
<v Speaker 6>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>food shows are great,</v>

711
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.940
<v Speaker 6>but the way he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's real.</v>

712
00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 6>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not like I'm here at the dot,</v>

713
00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:24.451
<v Speaker 6>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dot,</v>

714
00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 6>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dot.</v>

715
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.370
<v Speaker 6>And we're ready to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

716
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.690
<v Speaker 6>I did that for when we did reshot birth </v>
<v Speaker 6>to conquer.</v>

717
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:32.850
<v Speaker 6>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying I stole from action,</v>

718
00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:33.900
<v Speaker 6>John Bronson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>

719
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.000
<v Speaker 6>after watching enough content,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

720
00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:38.520
<v Speaker 6>I don't need the intros.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't need any of this shit.</v>

721
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.010
<v Speaker 6>Just give me the action.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

722
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.943
<v Speaker 6>So when we did birth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not gonna air for a little maybe </v>

723
00:29:42.641 --> 00:29:43.810
<v Speaker 6>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know until June.</v>

724
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.243
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

725
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.250
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no intros.</v>

726
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.770
<v Speaker 6>None of that's just real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the way it,</v>

727
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.040
<v Speaker 6>that's the way content should be done.</v>

728
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.020
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe a short introduction,</v>

729
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.020
<v Speaker 6>like staring at the camera like you </v>
<v Speaker 6>would if your friends were there.</v>

730
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

731
00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:00.400
<v Speaker 6>Instead of this super polished </v>
<v Speaker 6>professional thing,</v>

732
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.903
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the problem with your show is it's a </v>

733
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:05.410
<v Speaker 6>great show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You love doing it,</v>

734
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.840
<v Speaker 6>but you take months away from stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

735
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.020
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just,</v>

736
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.570
<v Speaker 6>that's just too much for guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Funny as you,</v>

737
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.920
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think I saw that until I started</v>

738
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:20.860
<v Speaker 6>getting back on stage and going like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh fuck man.</v>

739
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:21.694
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happens when you don't do it all </v>

740
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:24.640
<v Speaker 6>the time is you don't work on your </v>
<v Speaker 6>jokes.</v>

741
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.800
<v Speaker 6>You don't take that bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

742
00:30:26.801 --> 00:30:28.120
<v Speaker 6>like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

743
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:29.260
<v Speaker 6>You just do it one time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>

744
00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 6>it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm good.</v>

745
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.230
<v Speaker 6>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the only way you could really do standup</v>

746
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.113
<v Speaker 6>is it do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And to do it in front of audiences all </v>

747
00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:35.200
<v Speaker 6>the time.</v>

748
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.400
<v Speaker 6>Like that's how they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bits have to come together.</v>

749
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.550
<v Speaker 6>They can't do it on your own need.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People.</v>

750
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.110
<v Speaker 6>You gotta be in that zone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm bill.</v>

751
00:30:41.111 --> 00:30:44.290
<v Speaker 6>Bill and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bill was talking to me about it.</v>

752
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.480
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I had said something like,</v>

753
00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I gotta go,</v>

754
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.180
<v Speaker 6>I gotta go knock the rust off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

755
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:50.190
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was I telling you on stage?</v>

756
00:30:50.191 --> 00:30:51.790
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>last Sunday I went,</v>

757
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:52.624
<v Speaker 6>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've spent like months off stage and he </v>

758
00:30:55.241 --> 00:30:55.991
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was like,</v>

759
00:30:55.991 --> 00:31:00.340
<v Speaker 6>how can you do that once is rough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I take a week off,</v>

760
00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:01.930
<v Speaker 6>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I take two weeks off,</v>

761
00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 6>it feels like I can take a week off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I'm going on vacation,</v>

762
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.351
<v Speaker 6>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

763
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:08.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm going on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not thinking about shit when I go on</v>

764
00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:09.784
<v Speaker 6>vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am making a concerted effort to just </v>

765
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:13.000
<v Speaker 6>pay attention to entertainment.</v>

766
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.093
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I watch movies or I'll read a book </v>

767
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.080
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

768
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:17.913
<v Speaker 6>maybe I'll check twitter real quick to </v>
<v Speaker 6>see if anything wacky is going on the </v>

769
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:21.460
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's it.</v>

770
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.320
<v Speaker 6>Like very little,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very little.</v>

771
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.780
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to take anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to talk about business.</v>

772
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:26.643
<v Speaker 6>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just just want to hang out and chill </v>

773
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 6>so I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when I'm like,</v>

774
00:31:32.201 --> 00:31:33.034
<v Speaker 6>if I take a week off and I just haven't </v>
<v Speaker 6>done stand up and then I get back on </v>

775
00:31:36.581 --> 00:31:38.680
<v Speaker 6>stage again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I got to get the,</v>

776
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.300
<v Speaker 6>the engine cranking again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

777
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.730
<v Speaker 6>So the longest I've ever taken off from </v>
<v Speaker 6>surgery,</v>

778
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.811
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

779
00:31:43.811 --> 00:31:45.340
<v Speaker 6>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I twisted my knee,</v>

780
00:31:45.341 --> 00:31:47.110
<v Speaker 6>I took maybe a month off or something </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

781
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.353
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>After acl surgery may be a little more </v>

782
00:31:49.721 --> 00:31:51.520
<v Speaker 6>than a month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gets weird.</v>

783
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.013
<v Speaker 6>It does.</v>

784
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 6>And you lose money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For me,</v>

785
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:56.830
<v Speaker 6>I ride a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I read a lot and like onstage,</v>

786
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:57.783
<v Speaker 6>so I lose material.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So all those like tags and I lose like </v>

787
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:02.830
<v Speaker 6>big chunks where I go one day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm all of a sudden I'm like,</v>

788
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.551
<v Speaker 6>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever happened.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Is it travel channel cool with you not </v>

<v Speaker 6>doing it?</v>

793
00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:12.310
<v Speaker 6>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

795
00:32:14.231 --> 00:32:15.064
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was kind of understood I was going to </v>

796
00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:17.824
<v Speaker 6>take a little bit of a sabbatical right </v>
<v Speaker 6>to focus on stand up and my agents were </v>

797
00:32:21.161 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 6>reached out and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

799
00:32:25.091 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 6>I was just doing it because I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 6>money when they were and they were like,</v>

800
00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:28.354
<v Speaker 6>we're cool with just the base of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>deal and then give him the time to do </v>

801
00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:32.554
<v Speaker 6>stand up.</v>

802

863
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.060
<v Speaker 6>What took its place down there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 6>they always had parking issues and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if they lost their lease.</v>

866

927
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:23.720
<v Speaker 6>I think I'd be a boring as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

928
00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.610
<v Speaker 6>I think it'd be boring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just ay man.</v>

929
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.390
<v Speaker 6>Ay I read.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Makes you awesome.</v>

930
00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.540
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think the thing,</v>

931
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 6>I think the thing about like the thing I</v>
<v Speaker 6>like about my personality,</v>

932
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 6>well the thing I like about life I like </v>
<v Speaker 6>about life is just going is,</v>

933
00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 6>is impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love impulse.</v>

934
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.280
<v Speaker 6>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love,</v>

935
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 6>I know it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you're on a diet,</v>

936
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.290
<v Speaker 6>you'd be shocked when you've been </v>
<v Speaker 6>groomed on this lifestyle,</v>

937
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.540
<v Speaker 6>how often you just go to the fridge and </v>
<v Speaker 6>open it.</v>

938
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.670
<v Speaker 6>Cause that's what mpulse provides is </v>
<v Speaker 6>like how often you go to get a snack and</v>

939
00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.351
<v Speaker 6>like wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh fuck,</v>

940
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:54.940
<v Speaker 6>I can't snack like in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's,</v>

941
00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.330
<v Speaker 6>it's interesting to pull that part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>your personality back.</v>

942
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.580
<v Speaker 6>Then the last part of my personality is </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

943
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if like a good opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 6>shows up and someone wants to do a shot,</v>

944
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:03.923
<v Speaker 6>I wanna be able to do a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like I think that cutting out all </v>

945
00:38:07.171 --> 00:38:08.880
<v Speaker 6>carbs together,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll just be tough for me.</v>

946
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.640
<v Speaker 6>What about just [inaudible] out beer and</v>
<v Speaker 6>just doing like vodka or something?</v>

947
00:38:11.641 --> 00:38:13.500
<v Speaker 6>Cause this isn't a beer way worse for </v>
<v Speaker 6>you then.</v>

948
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.393
<v Speaker 6>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did that during this whole time I've </v>

949
00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.430
<v Speaker 6>cut out beer entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

950
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.230
<v Speaker 6>definitely a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of calories,</v>

951
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:20.243
<v Speaker 6>a lot of calories.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was doing like I was kinda slow roll </v>

952
00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:25.620
<v Speaker 6>in wine mostly and then do a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>rolling wine.</v>

953
00:38:25.621 --> 00:38:26.454
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that another expression that I'm not </v>

954
00:38:27.871 --> 00:38:29.790
<v Speaker 6>aware of?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see a slow wine roller.</v>

955
00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:32.730
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes when I have a box of wine that</v>

956
00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:35.690
<v Speaker 6>I carry rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a slow modeling wine is the</v>

957
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.100
<v Speaker 5>best inventions in the rooms as you buy </v>
<v Speaker 5>it from Napa drive up there.</v>

958
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.710
<v Speaker 5>When I drink wine I would always drink </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

959
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:47.900
<v Speaker 5>like as if it's a normal beverage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's,</v>

960
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:51.450
<v Speaker 5>so that's the best way to get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we were doing so on,</v>

961
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.160
<v Speaker 5>but we were doing trip flip on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

962
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.990
<v Speaker 5>the last season I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going through like a box of wine a</v>

963
00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:02.990
<v Speaker 5>night and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do we have any wine?</v>

964
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.093
<v Speaker 5>Do we see if we have any one young guy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going through a box of wine at </v>

965
00:39:10.621 --> 00:39:12.430
<v Speaker 5>night and then I told my buddy Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

966
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:13.181
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

967
00:39:13.181 --> 00:39:14.350
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta be honest with you.</v>

968
00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.990
<v Speaker 5>A box of wine at night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's my,</v>

969
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:17.980
<v Speaker 5>that's my limit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will not,</v>

970
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to try to stay under that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll be healthy.</v>

971
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 5>He goes to the store,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of wine.</v>

972
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:22.420
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

973
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.700
<v Speaker 5>like on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes to bottles is a lot.</v>

974
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 5>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are two bottles.</v>

975
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.153
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's more than to wait the </v>

976
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.651
<v Speaker 5>fucking minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

977
00:39:32.651 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 5>you really just said a box of wine at </v>
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>

978
00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:36.544
<v Speaker 5>It's not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hit was under the impression it was </v>

979
00:39:37.811 --> 00:39:38.644
<v Speaker 5>one bottle of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm sitting there going like bottle </v>

980
00:39:41.111 --> 00:39:41.944
<v Speaker 5>of wine by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't think that's a lot of alcohol </v>

981
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:45.050
<v Speaker 5>and it's not a Bach one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ivanhoe.</v>

982
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.740
<v Speaker 5>I've had this conversation with doctor </v>
<v Speaker 5>drew.</v>

983
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't see a bottle of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of alcohol.</v>

984
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:52.324
<v Speaker 5>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had this conversation with doctor </v>

985
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.580
<v Speaker 5>because everyone always says the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

986
00:39:57.581 --> 00:39:59.770
<v Speaker 5>You're fucking say prefacing it with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

987
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.023
<v Speaker 5>I look at wine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a little differently then like </v>

988
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.530
<v Speaker 5>unrealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you said,</v>

989
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.393
<v Speaker 5>if you said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would you rather have a 12 pack of </v>

990
00:40:07.871 --> 00:40:08.471
<v Speaker 5>beer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

991
00:40:08.471 --> 00:40:13.210
<v Speaker 5>bought a bottle of wine or a bottle of </v>
<v Speaker 5>vodka I got by one's grown up.</v>

992
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.043
<v Speaker 5>You sit back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

993
00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.480
<v Speaker 5>maybe like one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

994
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.860
<v Speaker 5>I like the flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the taste,</v>

995
00:40:17.861 --> 00:40:20.950
<v Speaker 5>but I can't imagine if I drank a bottle </v>
<v Speaker 5>a day,</v>

996
00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:24.580
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't be freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a big conversation to have man.</v>

997
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:29.910
<v Speaker 5>Like people get upset if one person </v>
<v Speaker 5>expects other people to be healthy.</v>

998
00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:32.883
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get upset if you try to impose your </v>

999
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:37.030
<v Speaker 5>healthiness on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if people were working out and they</v>

1000
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:38.920
<v Speaker 5>have a friend that doesn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>

1001
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.230
<v Speaker 5>let's get to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to the gym.</v>

1002
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:43.210
<v Speaker 5>Me People don't want to hear that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never do.</v>

1003
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.690
<v Speaker 5>And it's a fine line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You dance when you're on a podcast where</v>

1004
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:50.170
<v Speaker 5>you want to talk about like fitness and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fitness goals you're doing and then give</v>

1005
00:40:50.171 --> 00:40:51.004
<v Speaker 5>advice to friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe try like this because people </v>

1006
00:40:52.991 --> 00:40:53.824
<v Speaker 5>will get upset cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we all know that we probably should be </v>

1007
00:40:57.041 --> 00:41:02.020
<v Speaker 5>eating better and we all like say one </v>

<v Speaker 5>vegetables in the morning and stop </v>

1009
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 5>eating honey nut cheerios with fucking </v>

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.223
<v Speaker 5>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can I tell you there's two different </v>

1015
00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:21.844
<v Speaker 5>kinds of boxes of wine typically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's a smaller one and the more </v>

1016
00:41:26.231 --> 00:41:27.064
<v Speaker 5>normal one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like their friend Xero or whatever it's </v>

1017
00:41:28.391 --> 00:41:29.650
<v Speaker 5>called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh this is delicious.</v>

1018
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.630
<v Speaker 5>The smaller ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>smaller bottling,</v>

1019
00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 5>the smaller ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four bottles of wine.</v>

1020
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:38.390
<v Speaker 5>The typical box of wine is six and two </v>
<v Speaker 5>thirds of the bottles.</v>

1021
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.130
<v Speaker 5>I was on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in Africa.</v>

1022
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:41.103
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The road you were drinking four bottles </v>

1023
00:41:43.521 --> 00:41:44.211
<v Speaker 5>of wine at night?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1024
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:46.490
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't drinking four bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't look like a pirate.</v>

1025
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.950
<v Speaker 5>The other thing I'll say is that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>drink,</v>

1026
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.560
<v Speaker 5>usually when I have my bottle of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have it on the treadmill.</v>

1027
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.110
<v Speaker 5>So what the fuck did you just say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I drink.</v>

1028
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:56.510
<v Speaker 5>You drink a bottle of wine while you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the treadmill?</v>

1029
00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right bro.</v>

1030
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.550
<v Speaker 5>You need to go to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know this.</v>

1031
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:00.603
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't drink wine on the fucking </v>

1032
00:42:02.211 --> 00:42:05.900
<v Speaker 5>treadmill because it's you smoked pot </v>
<v Speaker 5>and go to Jujitsu.</v>

1033
00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.550
<v Speaker 5>That is a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Leaning Bullshit.</v>

1034
00:42:09.551 --> 00:42:10.384
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same Bullshit.</v>

1035
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:11.540
<v Speaker 5>Cause it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1036
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.390
<v Speaker 5>it's not alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alcohol is bad for your body.</v>

1037
00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:15.224
<v Speaker 5>Marijuana is not bad for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact it's an anti inflammatory but </v>

1038
00:42:18.171 --> 00:42:19.004
<v Speaker 5>it's cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're smoking and then what any effect </v>

1039
00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:21.620
<v Speaker 5>in your cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

1040
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:23.480
<v Speaker 5>it probably has a positive benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

1041
00:42:23.481 --> 00:42:24.314
<v Speaker 5>ultra marathon runner smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they smoke pot and eat pot and there's </v>

1042
00:42:27.201 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 5>been studies that have been done </v>
<v Speaker 5>recently.</v>

1043
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:31.840
<v Speaker 5>There's Bert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my drinking a beer on the treadmill.</v>

1044
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.130
<v Speaker 5>There's basic study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find that and by the way,</v>

1045
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:37.520
<v Speaker 5>beer not a bad thing to drink after you </v>
<v Speaker 5>work out a beer.</v>

1046
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:38.354
<v Speaker 5>It replenishes the body with glycogen </v>
<v Speaker 5>according to some people because the </v>

1047
00:42:41.541 --> 00:42:42.374
<v Speaker 5>alcohol and the hops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some people say that after a nice </v>

1048
00:42:45.471 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 5>workout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A beer is not a bad thing to have.</v>

1049
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.490
<v Speaker 5>Lance Armstrong said that on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast did it?</v>

1050
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.370
<v Speaker 5>They used to drink beer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to drink beer.</v>

1051
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:54.640
<v Speaker 5>That was their steroid back in the 20s </v>
<v Speaker 5>or the front.</v>

1052
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.483
<v Speaker 5>So the tour de France wine too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just say get fucked up cause they </v>

1053
00:42:57.981 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 5>were sore and in pain all to know it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

1054
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.610
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>

1055
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:03.080
<v Speaker 5>It would lower your blood it within your</v>
<v Speaker 5>blood out so you could,</v>

1056
00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:04.940
<v Speaker 5>it was like a dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the same thing as doping.</v>

1057
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:05.953
<v Speaker 5>Theoretically it was low grade doping if</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not mistaken because I was really </v>

1058
00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:09.020
<v Speaker 5>fascinating.</v>

1059
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.640
<v Speaker 5>Your blood out dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to do the opposite.</v>

1060
00:43:10.641 --> 00:43:13.040
<v Speaker 5>You want to thicken it a yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I was wrong.</v>

1061
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you definitely don't want to think blood</v>

1062
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.110
<v Speaker 5>out like you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>dehydrated.</v>

1063
00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 5>You want to be extra hydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just the opposite.</v>

1064
00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:22.550
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a way to drink,</v>

1065
00:43:22.551 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 5>relax at the end of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch some TV,</v>

1066
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.810
<v Speaker 5>get on my treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen to a podcast,</v>

1067
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.430
<v Speaker 5>put on Youtube and get on the treadmill </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just kinda walk in a four and have a</v>

1068
00:43:31.431 --> 00:43:32.300
<v Speaker 5>bottle of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well listen,</v>

1069
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:33.163
<v Speaker 5>it's way better than not walking on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>treadmill and just drinking the bottle </v>

1070
00:43:35.631 --> 00:43:36.231
<v Speaker 5>of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1071
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:38.000
<v Speaker 5>Then we can agree to disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1072
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:41.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think it's way better than not </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing the treadmill.</v>

1073
00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:42.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

1074
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:45.740
<v Speaker 5>But lets a lot of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not drinking it every single night.</v>

1075
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:47.090
<v Speaker 5>How many nights a week?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five.</v>

1076
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.120
<v Speaker 5>This is feels like an intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but honestly,</v>

1077
00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:51.560
<v Speaker 5>how many nights a week did I drink wine?</v>

1078
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:52.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1079
00:43:52.491 --> 00:43:54.240
<v Speaker 5>right now it's bad because I'm on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>road.</v>

1080
00:43:54.241 --> 00:43:58.550
<v Speaker 5>So it would just be Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wednesday,</v>

1081
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.550
<v Speaker 5>Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Friday,</v>

1082
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.383
<v Speaker 5>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those nights he drank several bottles </v>

1083
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:01.131
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1084
00:44:01.131 --> 00:44:01.431
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1085
00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:03.320
<v Speaker 5>but I'm doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I go on the stage.</v>

1086
00:44:03.321 --> 00:44:05.340
<v Speaker 5>I have a cocktail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1087
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.193
<v Speaker 5>I'm not as dialed in as like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm never going to be able to just tell </v>

1088
00:44:08.961 --> 00:44:11.090
<v Speaker 5>you I have one bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like a housewife.</v>

1089
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 5>I might have one bottle of wine at </v>
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>

1090
00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.420
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm on the road all the time.</v>

1091
00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:18.290
<v Speaker 5>So like I'll drink on the road sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when I'm home I don't drink,</v>

1092
00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:20.100
<v Speaker 5>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't drink last.</v>

1093
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:21.500
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I drank a little bit last night,</v>

1094
00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:23.690
<v Speaker 5>but it just seems like a stunning </v>
<v Speaker 5>number.</v>

1095
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:24.913
<v Speaker 5>Four bottles of wine at night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's the same size boxes he's </v>

1096
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:28.274
<v Speaker 5>talking about that and your blood sugar </v>
<v Speaker 5>must be out of control from all that </v>

1097
00:44:30.681 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 5>wine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blood sugar,</v>

1098
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.770
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

1099
00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 6>it's probably a little out of sync </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I noticed that,</v>

1100
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:39.563
<v Speaker 6>I noticed that if I have like a cup of </v>
<v Speaker 6>coffee the next morning I start firing </v>

1101
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:43.890
<v Speaker 6>real hot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like almost like mannequins.</v>

1102
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:44.724
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You write really good when your blood </v>

1103
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:47.910
<v Speaker 6>sugar spiking?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

1104
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:55.910
<v Speaker 6>Can we just talk about Stan hope you can</v>
<v Speaker 6>talk about anything but the fact that it</v>

1105
00:44:57.511 --> 00:45:00.690
<v Speaker 6>makes you uncomfortable talking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>your wine consent rights.</v>

1106
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I Dunno.</v>

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.710

<v Speaker 6>We want you to be healthy.</v>

1108
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:06.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've lost a ton of weight.</v>

1109
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:09.840
<v Speaker 6>My blood pressure is great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing a lot better than I was doing.</v>

1110
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:11.580
<v Speaker 6>So like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm on the right path.</v>

1111
00:45:11.581 --> 00:45:12.414
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that doing this travel </v>
<v Speaker 6>channel show where you're constantly on </v>

1112
00:45:14.341 --> 00:45:16.110
<v Speaker 6>the road all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes it worse?</v>

1113
00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would think of what,</v>

1114
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:20.910
<v Speaker 6>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't really like flying either.</v>

1115
00:45:20.911 --> 00:45:22.590
<v Speaker 6>She liked to get liquored up before </v>
<v Speaker 6>flights.</v>

1116
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:23.483
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1117
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.890
<v Speaker 6>And so those flights to Vietnam were </v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty tough.</v>

1118
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:28.913
<v Speaker 6>I wish that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish there was a guy that could eat </v>

1119
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:31.530
<v Speaker 6>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not that guy.</v>

1120
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 6>I heard Vietnam is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's Anthony Bourdain's favorite place</v>

1121
00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:35.580
<v Speaker 6>to visit.</v>

00:47:05.101 --> 00:47:08.730
<v Speaker 6>I experienced was that like if you get </v>
<v Speaker 6>in a fight with one Vietnamese dude,</v>

1159
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.100
<v Speaker 6>hundred Vietnamese guys were jumping on </v>
<v Speaker 6>top of you.</v>

1160
00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.690
<v Speaker 6>Like that was the who got in a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the x,</v>

1161
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 6>one of the ex pats that was running.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the things we did,</v>

1162
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:18.180
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

1163
00:47:18.181 --> 00:47:19.620
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to go and get these egg </v>
<v Speaker 6>sandwiches,</v>

<v Speaker 6>did the most amazing sandwiches I've </v>

1165
00:47:22.741 --> 00:47:24.420
<v Speaker 6>ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

1166
00:47:24.421 --> 00:47:25.830
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to go run out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to get 10 of them.</v>

1167
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well bring someone with you.</v>

1168
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:28.603
<v Speaker 6>Well cause it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're like 50 cents each and the lady </v>

1169
00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:31.510
<v Speaker 6>makes them in like a home,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a hot dog cart.</v>

1170
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:32.800
<v Speaker 6>And she made it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>

1171
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.570
<v Speaker 6>they're the best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I have my whole crew with me so I'll</v>

1172
00:47:34.571 --> 00:47:35.480
<v Speaker 6>get them for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1173
00:47:35.481 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was in them?</v>

1174
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.260
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>egg,</v>

1175
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.920
<v Speaker 6>shredded pork and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think cheese,</v>

1176
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 6>no cheese because Vietnamese don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>really fuck around with cheese.</v>

1177
00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:45.800
<v Speaker 6>With a hot sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.673
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there was cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the eggs were cooked perfectly and </v>

1179
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:49.894
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bread was so soft and flaky and it </v>

1180
00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:52.684
<v Speaker 6>was hollowed out and center.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when the egg fell apart all it did </v>

1181
00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:56.650
<v Speaker 6>was just kind of melts into the bread.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you had like,</v>

1182
00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:00.250
<v Speaker 6>it was just the best sandwich I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>had in my life.</v>

1183
00:48:00.251 --> 00:48:02.470
<v Speaker 6>I think they're called [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1184
00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.160
<v Speaker 6>I went out to go get 10 and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 6>goes,</v>

1185
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 6>bring someone with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

1186
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.633
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to go right across the </v>

1187
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:07.684
<v Speaker 6>street.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>

1188
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:08.643
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't matter if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say if you get into some altercation </v>

1189
00:48:09.851 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 6>cause you cutting someone in front of </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone in traffic.</v>

1190
00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:15.640
<v Speaker 6>Like the big thing with traffic there is</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't run across the street.</v>

1191
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.863
<v Speaker 6>You walk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if they're coming at you walk so </v>

1192
00:48:18.191 --> 00:48:19.060
<v Speaker 6>they can avoid you.</v>

1193
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.940
<v Speaker 6>You never change your pace.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you change your pace,</v>

1194
00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:24.100
<v Speaker 6>that's how they hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Christ.</v>

1195
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.181
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>

1196
00:48:25.181 --> 00:48:28.720
<v Speaker 6>and if you do that and you get a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you literally have 50 Vietnamese guys on</v>

1197
00:48:28.721 --> 00:48:29.920
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he was like,</v>

1198
00:48:29.921 --> 00:48:30.850
<v Speaker 6>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it happens.</v>

1199
00:48:30.851 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 6>And it happened to me like two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 6>ago.</v>

1200
00:48:32.531 --> 00:48:35.020
<v Speaker 6>I got in a fight with one guy and just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean everyone,</v>

1201
00:48:35.021 --> 00:48:37.360
<v Speaker 6>like store owners were dropping their </v>
<v Speaker 6>aprons and jumping on this guy.</v>

1202
00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:38.620
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

1203
00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:40.180
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think it's,</v>

1204
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.220
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's crime ridden,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not,</v>

1205
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.113
<v Speaker 6>it's not fucking Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing how quickly they forgave </v>

1206
00:48:47.771 --> 00:48:50.350
<v Speaker 6>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They sort of just like,</v>

1207
00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:52.660
<v Speaker 6>it probably didn't forget kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1208
00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:55.120
<v Speaker 6>I mean I don't think it's like Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1209
00:48:55.121 --> 00:48:55.954
<v Speaker 6>I think the older Japanese folks </v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently just are still pretty pissed </v>

1210
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.814
<v Speaker 6>off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The ones that were alive when they </v>

1211
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:04.090
<v Speaker 6>dropped the bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1212
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:05.290
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can see that.</v>

1213
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 6>I can see that it's fairly reasonable.</v>

1214
00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.700
<v Speaker 6>No Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1215
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:16.150
<v Speaker 6>it's a very fascinating culture because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>

1216
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.780
<v Speaker 6>they're openly nationalistic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1217
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:23.470
<v Speaker 6>like you could say it's racist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's openly nationalistic.</v>

1218
00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:26.050
<v Speaker 6>Like they just like no white people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll have bars,</v>

1219
00:49:26.051 --> 00:49:27.250
<v Speaker 6>just no white people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1220
00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.340
<v Speaker 6>you can't come in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Could you imagine if someone tried to do</v>

1221
00:49:30.341 --> 00:49:32.600
<v Speaker 6>that in America?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You had to say no foreigner.</v>

1222
00:49:32.601 --> 00:49:35.080
<v Speaker 6>She put up an like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that the Donald Trump America?</v>

1223
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:39.460
<v Speaker 6>Like they'll put up a no foreigners sign</v>
<v Speaker 6>in front of certain establishments.</v>

1224
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:41.930
<v Speaker 6>And some will argue that they have the </v>
<v Speaker 6>right to do that.</v>

1225
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:44.820
<v Speaker 6>There's a drinking club,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1226
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:48.170
<v Speaker 6>like a drinking club on once.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1227
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:50.500
<v Speaker 6>called the Soho Room or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's on sunset,</v>

1228
00:49:50.501 --> 00:49:53.560
<v Speaker 6>down near the argo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What used to be the argyle,</v>

1229
00:49:53.561 --> 00:49:55.270
<v Speaker 6>it's like a drinking club.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they were like,</v>

1230
00:49:55.271 --> 00:49:56.110
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're setting a meeting,</v>

1231

<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

1232
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:58.991

<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1233
00:49:58.991 --> 00:49:59.650
<v Speaker 6>cool.</v>

1234
00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:00.610
<v Speaker 6>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotta be a member,</v>

1235
00:50:00.611 --> 00:50:04.570
<v Speaker 6>he's a member and then he'll let you in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's meant as members only and I was</v>

1236
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:05.404
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh cool.</v>

1237
00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.710
<v Speaker 6>And I rolled up and my manager judy was </v>
<v Speaker 6>there and I go,</v>

1238
00:50:08.711 --> 00:50:10.030
<v Speaker 6>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was like,</v>

1239
00:50:10.031 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 6>I'm in the meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

1240
00:50:11.021 --> 00:50:11.854
<v Speaker 6>oh they let women in here cause I just </v>
<v Speaker 6>to zoom that was this like old men's </v>

1241
00:50:16.031 --> 00:50:17.410
<v Speaker 6>only club.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's like,</v>

1242
00:50:17.411 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 6>what fucking world have you been living </v>
<v Speaker 6>in it?</v>

1243
00:50:19.121 --> 00:50:20.920
<v Speaker 6>You just shocked that they let women in </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I was like,</v>

1244
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Speaker 6>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In my head I was like,</v>

1245
00:50:22.301 --> 00:50:24.220
<v Speaker 6>well this please place doesn't seem as </v>
<v Speaker 6>cool anymore.</v>

1246
00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 6>We shut it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let a man,</v>

1247
00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 6>is there a place where there's no</v>

1248
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.590
<v Speaker 4>place where they don't let women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's places where you don't let men.</v>

1249
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.940
<v Speaker 4>Those curves places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those places where the older ladies like</v>

1250
00:50:34.941 --> 00:50:36.410
<v Speaker 4>to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess what is,</v>

1251
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 4>it's overweight people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1252
00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.413
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh is it overweight people were all </v>

1253
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:41.290
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just all women.</v>

1254
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.070
<v Speaker 4>All women have curves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's places that are,</v>

1255
00:50:43.071 --> 00:50:44.840
<v Speaker 4>is that if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I getting the right name?</v>

1256
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.120
<v Speaker 4>Because there's places that are just all</v>
<v Speaker 4>women gyms.</v>

1257
00:50:47.121 --> 00:50:48.480
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called crow.</v>

1258
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:50.360
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't go there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1259
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:52.970
<v Speaker 4>but you can never have a Dick Swinger's </v>
<v Speaker 4>club.</v>

1260
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:56.450
<v Speaker 4>Like with only men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you have an all men,</v>

1261
00:50:56.451 --> 00:50:57.200
<v Speaker 4>Jim?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1262
00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.033
<v Speaker 4>No one ever let you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you could probably do that or </v>

1263
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:02.880
<v Speaker 4>don't think you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think the argument would be they,</v>

1264
00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:04.610
<v Speaker 4>the argument they would make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it's right,</v>

1265
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:05.683
<v Speaker 4>would be that women get sexually </v>
<v Speaker 4>harassed and our gold at a regular gym </v>

1266
00:51:10.041 --> 00:51:11.360
<v Speaker 4>and they get uncomfortable and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

1267
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>

1268
00:51:13.161 --> 00:51:14.090
<v Speaker 4>They just want to work out.</v>

1269
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.880
<v Speaker 6>They could probably add a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have it called no broads or whatever and</v>

1270
00:51:18.881 --> 00:51:21.850
<v Speaker 6>like just have like the line that most </v>
<v Speaker 6>bars have where they're like,</v>

1271
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:22.631
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1272
00:51:22.631 --> 00:51:24.430
<v Speaker 6>we were only letting the women in </v>
<v Speaker 6>tonight,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I say only lifting,</v>

1274
00:51:26.021 --> 00:51:27.880
<v Speaker 6>only let them in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they could probably easily do that.</v>

1275
00:51:27.881 --> 00:51:30.170
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's against the law.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want him there.</v>

1276
00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 6>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1277
00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.460
<v Speaker 6>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll leave it over here.</v>

1278
00:51:33.461 --> 00:51:34.540
<v Speaker 6>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Alternate Gloria.</v>

1279
00:51:34.541 --> 00:51:35.374
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would fucking come after you or one of </v>

1280
00:51:36.971 --> 00:51:39.100
<v Speaker 6>those well was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1281
00:51:39.101 --> 00:51:40.540
<v Speaker 6>they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't have anything like that.</v>

1282
00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:41.763
<v Speaker 6>I grew up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I grew up in a time when </v>

1283
00:51:43.541 --> 00:51:46.300
<v Speaker 6>you'd go to the men's locker room where </v>
<v Speaker 6>the bar was,</v>

1284
00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:47.261
<v Speaker 6>where they'd all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the men.</v>

1285
00:51:47.261 --> 00:51:48.094
<v Speaker 6>We'll play cards as a kid at like </v>
<v Speaker 6>country clubs and you'd walk in and </v>

1286
00:51:51.581 --> 00:51:52.414
<v Speaker 6>you'd be like one day and then Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was all taken away before I could </v>

1287
00:51:54.641 --> 00:51:55.474
<v Speaker 6>ever get there.</v>

1288
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.820
<v Speaker 4>There's no real place like a Bachelors </v>
<v Speaker 4>Club,</v>

1289
00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.770
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what pool halls used to be.</v>

1290
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pool halls was like what?</v>

1291
00:52:03.321 --> 00:52:04.154
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what pool halls were at the turn of the </v>

1292
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:07.460
<v Speaker 4>century in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1293
00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.513
<v Speaker 4>and then a lot of places in the country </v>
<v Speaker 4>where these places where young men who </v>

1294
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 4>didn't want family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wanted the bachelor life.</v>

1295
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:19.580
<v Speaker 4>They didn't want to have a nine to five </v>
<v Speaker 4>job and know some square life.</v>

1296
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:20.653
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to have action and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to gamble and they wanted to </v>

1297
00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:23.924
<v Speaker 4>drink and they wanted to stay together </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just be men and they would go to </v>

1298
00:52:26.751 --> 00:52:30.700
<v Speaker 4>pool halls and they would gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And pool halls were almost entirely,</v>

1299
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:32.900
<v Speaker 4>almost entirely revolved around </v>
<v Speaker 4>gambling,</v>

1300
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:34.003
<v Speaker 4>which is a like a little known secret.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the game is called billiard pocket </v>

1301
00:52:38.331 --> 00:52:39.164
<v Speaker 4>billiards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's called pool because you pool </v>

1302
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.020
<v Speaker 4>your money together for a bet.</v>

1303
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.580
<v Speaker 4>That's the original name as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>definition of the name pool.</v>

1304
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.700
<v Speaker 4>So at the turn of the century in New </v>
<v Speaker 4>York City,</v>

1306
00:52:49.701 --> 00:52:50.534
<v Speaker 4>there was something like a thousand pool</v>
<v Speaker 4>halls and there was all these guys that </v>

1307
00:52:53.061 --> 00:52:56.120
<v Speaker 4>just didn't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't want to get married,</v>

1308
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:59.360
<v Speaker 4>they didn't want a nine five job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to live the bachelor life.</v>

1309
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.040
<v Speaker 4>And today that's like disgraced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to be a bachelor,</v>

1310
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:06.320
<v Speaker 4>if you want to be a 50 year old guy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>live by yourself,</v>

1311
00:53:06.321 --> 00:53:08.660
<v Speaker 4>you never had kids and you don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>regular job.</v>

1312
00:53:08.661 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 4>You just said hang out in a pool hall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The time you're a fucking loser.</v>

1313
00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.533
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you could have the same amount of </v>

1314
00:53:14.811 --> 00:53:15.644
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a wife that you don't really like </v>

1315
00:53:17.391 --> 00:53:18.620
<v Speaker 4>being around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1316
00:53:18.621 --> 00:53:22.010

<v Speaker 4>think you're a winner.</v>

1317
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.410
<v Speaker 4>You know you'd have the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

1318
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:25.303
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have standards and one of the </v>

1319
00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:30.690
<v Speaker 4>standards is a bunch of men that don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be a part of society.</v>

1320
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:32.130
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to have a nine to five </v>
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>

1321
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:32.993

<v Speaker 4>you know you've been a camper or </v>

<v Speaker 6>She's awesome man.</v>

1451
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:29.180
<v Speaker 6>I'd might argue that she's funnier than </v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He's funny in a way that I,</v>

1454
00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.860
<v Speaker 6>this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's like Joe,</v>

1455
00:59:36.861 --> 00:59:37.694
<v Speaker 6>like Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause I remember watching Tom when he </v>

1456

<v Speaker 6>just this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know Tom's hearing this so I know,</v>

1458
00:59:44.651 --> 00:59:45.321
<v Speaker 6>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he'll admit this,</v>

1459
00:59:45.321 --> 00:59:48.320
<v Speaker 6>that he was trying to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 6>do it like a towel and,</v>

1460
00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.273
<v Speaker 6>and he would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like his pacing was off and then all of </v>

1461
00:59:51.261 --> 00:59:52.094
<v Speaker 6>a sudden something switched on him and </v>
<v Speaker 6>he's telling stories where I can't find </v>

1462
00:59:55.521 --> 00:59:57.500
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't see the setup punch,</v>

1463
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 6>but I'm howling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck Tommy.</v>

1464
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.730

<v Speaker 6>him and I'm like bucking.</v>

1465
01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.573
<v Speaker 6>He is dialed in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He is in the bees and the sweet spot of </v>

1466
01:00:07.161 --> 01:00:08.000
<v Speaker 6>his writing right now.</v>

1467
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's awesome.</v>

1468
01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:12.230
<v Speaker 4>What I was going to say was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's really fucking funny,</v>

1469
01:00:12.231 --> 01:00:14.630
<v Speaker 4>but I know what you're saying cause </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's really fucking funny.</v>

1470
01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.310
<v Speaker 4>She's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's really,</v>

1471
01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:17.144
<v Speaker 4>and they have a kid now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is going to be really interesting </v>

1472
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:22.880
<v Speaker 4>because once you have a kid you have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>solid 20 minutes new material.</v>

1473
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.953
<v Speaker 4>It's just a matter of like covering over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same ground that everybody else </v>

1474
01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:26.534
<v Speaker 4>covers over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you have a kid you have to Kinda </v>

1475
01:00:27.831 --> 01:00:32.240
<v Speaker 4>like comb through your material and make</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure none of it has been done before.</v>

1476
01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 4>It's too as as really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard with like really common shared</v>

1477
01:00:36.201 --> 01:00:37.034
<v Speaker 4>experiences that are transformative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like having a kid or something happened </v>

1478
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:41.384
<v Speaker 4>to you like guys who have cancer that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of times you have similar material </v>

1479
01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:45.074
<v Speaker 4>about getting cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember Schimmel had a bunch of </v>

1480
01:00:46.461 --> 01:00:51.461
<v Speaker 4>cancer bits after he got back from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer airplanes dose.</v>

1481
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.963
<v Speaker 4>Those bits have been beaten down so much</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you almost have to have something </v>

1482
01:00:56.781 --> 01:00:57.614
<v Speaker 4>fucking catastrophic happened on a plane</v>
<v Speaker 4>for you to do a joke about being on a </v>

1483
01:01:00.921 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 4>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that subject matter,</v>

1484
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.153
<v Speaker 4>like people's eyes sort of glaze over if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go over that because they've heard </v>

1485
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:12.560
<v Speaker 4>playing jokes and travel jokes because </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedians talk about what they do and if</v>

1486
01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:16.370
<v Speaker 4>you only travel all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing shows and then traveling.</v>

1487
01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:17.443
<v Speaker 4>So like the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's going to be able to relate to </v>

1488
01:01:18.561 --> 01:01:20.750
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're doing something weird,</v>

1489
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.340
<v Speaker 4>you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody listens.</v>

1490
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:24.710
<v Speaker 4>People pay for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck kind of job was at.</v>

1491

01:18:34.311 --> 01:18:36.300
<v Speaker 6>Your calls me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tells me Bingo ran away.</v>

1936
01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:40.770
<v Speaker 6>So a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that</v>

1937
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:41.900
<v Speaker 4>pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So sad.</v>

1938
01:18:41.901 --> 01:18:44.420
<v Speaker 4>When you see someone who you in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>

1939
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:48.230
<v Speaker 4>like you have the memory of them being </v>
<v Speaker 4>like real happy.</v>

1940
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:49.603
<v Speaker 4>Like when I think of Bingo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think of Bingo hanging out with doug </v>

1941
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:54.770
<v Speaker 4>at shows and it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're laughing.</v>

1942
01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:55.640
<v Speaker 4>We're all laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1943
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:59.840
<v Speaker 4>So that's my idea of Bingo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my idea of a depressed Bingo,</v>

1944
01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:01.910
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1945
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:03.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't have it in my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

1946
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:06.590
<v Speaker 4>my accessible memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1947
01:19:06.730 --> 01:19:08.390
<v Speaker 4>Like I've only seen her have a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1948
01:19:08.391 --> 01:19:09.224
<v Speaker 4>I've only seen her having fun and we all</v>
<v Speaker 4>accepted there's ups and downs to being </v>

1949
01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:14.893
<v Speaker 4>a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like highs and lows and you </v>

1950
01:19:16.161 --> 01:19:18.050
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get in slumps and you feel like shit</v>

1951
01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:19.460
<v Speaker 4>and then you come back and you feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

1952
01:19:19.461 --> 01:19:22.670
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of the reasons why you </v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciate those really high spots cause</v>

1953
01:19:22.671 --> 01:19:26.750
<v Speaker 4>you remember when you didn't feel so </v>
<v Speaker 4>good but you see someone like Bingo,</v>

1954
01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.673
<v Speaker 4>like when she was hanging around with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Doug and in my eyes it was always like </v>

1955
01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:32.173
<v Speaker 4>dogs.</v>

1956
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:35.600
<v Speaker 4>You got to let Doug Be Doug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

1957
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:39.860
<v Speaker 4>And Doug's always had a problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1958
01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.053
<v Speaker 4>when he was with other chicks there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>always like some sort of a different </v>

1959
01:19:44.211 --> 01:19:49.211
<v Speaker 4>kind of drama then like what Bingo </v>
<v Speaker 4>presented being presented crazy.</v>

1960
01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:51.043
<v Speaker 4>But she also presented like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>willingness to like have fun and go </v>

1961
01:19:54.651 --> 01:19:55.484
<v Speaker 4>along with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was perfect for like letting the </v>

1962
01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:03.740
<v Speaker 4>best parts of Doug just blossom because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were so cool together.</v>

1963
01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's crazy.</v>

1964
01:20:05.241 --> 01:20:08.580
<v Speaker 4>She's got blue hair and half her head </v>
<v Speaker 4>shaved and she's a mad woman.</v>

1965
01:20:08.581 --> 01:20:09.840
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>

1966
01:20:09.841 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 4>this is great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is perfect.</v>

1967
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.533
<v Speaker 4>And it was always in my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I remember is them smiling and </v>

1968
01:20:16.741 --> 01:20:19.710
<v Speaker 4>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's always weird to me.</v>

1969
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:20.783
<v Speaker 4>And even though rationally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously I know that people have their </v>

1970
01:20:22.531 --> 01:20:23.364
<v Speaker 4>ups and downs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I remember someone who's like </v>

1971
01:20:25.771 --> 01:20:29.010
<v Speaker 4>really happy and really laughing and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1972
01:20:29.011 --> 01:20:30.300
<v Speaker 4>like big open smile.</v>

1973
01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.380
<v Speaker 4>Ah Ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1974
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:33.000
<v Speaker 4>throwing her head back laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1975
01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:33.834
<v Speaker 4>that's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are the thoughts that I have when </v>

1976
01:20:35.191 --> 01:20:37.260
<v Speaker 4>I think about like her and doug hanging </v>
<v Speaker 4>out at shows.</v>

1977
01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:39.140
<v Speaker 4>I think how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

1978
01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.940
<v Speaker 4>how does someone forget how to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you,</v>

1979
01:20:41.941 --> 01:20:44.400
<v Speaker 4>how do you stay in that pocket?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>

1980
01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:45.234
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you stay as close to the fun all </v>

1981
01:20:47.131 --> 01:20:51.450
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pocket is possible without slipping in.</v>

1982
01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it a chemical thing?</v>

1983
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:54.203
<v Speaker 4>Is it a behavioral thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a life circumstances and your </v>

1984
01:20:57.961 --> 01:21:00.390
<v Speaker 4>reaction to it thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it,</v>

1985
01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:03.060
<v Speaker 4>what is it that brings those downers </v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1986
01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:06.270
<v Speaker 4>where people just feel like utter shit.</v>

1987
01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin levels and I guess she has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1988
01:21:09.211 --> 01:21:10.044
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like medicine probably that she's </v>

1989
01:21:11.671 --> 01:21:13.440
<v Speaker 2>taking mixtures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at brody,</v>

1990
01:21:13.441 --> 01:21:15.320
<v Speaker 2>he has ups and downs all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1991
01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean I did so many people that I,</v>

1992
01:21:18.421 --> 01:21:21.450
<v Speaker 2>that I ended up calling crazy almost to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a point.</v>

1993
01:21:21.451 --> 01:21:22.980
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1994
01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1995
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I feel like could be calling a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy in the future.</v>

1996
01:21:27.201 --> 01:21:29.490
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be the next tranny </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender.</v>

1997
01:21:29.491 --> 01:21:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an alternative thinking,</v>

1998
01:21:31.321 --> 01:21:32.160
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>

1999
01:21:32.490 --> 01:21:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I just nonstop and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2000
01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.051
<v Speaker 2>brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2001
01:21:37.051 --> 01:21:39.510
<v Speaker 2>And people just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have ups and downs.</v>

2002
01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 2>I had fucking ups and downs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2003
01:21:41.461 --> 01:21:46.461
<v Speaker 2>everyone has so many factors to right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be chemical man.</v>

2004
01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.000
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's life,</v>

2005
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:51.580
<v Speaker 4>there's like the curve balls life throws</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet at you.</v>

2006
01:21:51.581 --> 01:21:52.414
<v Speaker 4>Like they're undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that great moments in your life where </v>

2007
01:21:54.521 --> 01:21:55.354
<v Speaker 4>things are going great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucking feel great and then what </v>

2008
01:21:57.491 --> 01:21:59.470
<v Speaker 4>things are going shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel shitty.</v>

2009
01:21:59.650 --> 01:22:00.483
<v Speaker 4>That would kind of try to deny that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some sort of a correlation </v>

2010
01:22:02.801 --> 01:22:03.634
<v Speaker 4>between those two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But sometimes it's just shitty things </v>

2011
01:22:05.741 --> 01:22:06.880
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2012
01:22:06.881 --> 01:22:09.220
<v Speaker 4>like Ari Shaffir just broke his ankle </v>
<v Speaker 4>skin.</v>

2013
01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.230
<v Speaker 4>That's just a shitty thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

2014
01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:12.323
<v Speaker 2>And I think the stick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we don't forget about him </v>

2015
01:22:14.041 --> 01:22:14.491
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2016
01:22:14.491 --> 01:22:16.140
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you get in a relationship,</v>

2017
01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:18.120
<v Speaker 2>you break up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you got over it,</v>

2018
01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:21.210
<v Speaker 2>but that still is something in you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's taxing that you don't even know.</v>

2019
01:22:21.211 --> 01:22:24.000
<v Speaker 2>You've actually taken down a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of happiness.</v>

2020
01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:25.590
<v Speaker 2>She was something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your car,</v>

2021
01:22:25.591 --> 01:22:26.424
<v Speaker 2>you get in a car accident that adds on </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it and you don't even realize that </v>

2022
01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:30.350
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's the,</v>

2023
01:22:30.351 --> 01:22:34.260
<v Speaker 2>the level of happiness is getting pushed</v>
<v Speaker 2>down deeper and deeper almost.</v>

2024
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:35.303
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about a Bingo and doug that </v>

2025
01:22:39.241 --> 01:22:40.440
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you were saying,</v>

2026
01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:41.521
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2027
01:22:41.521 --> 01:22:45.120
<v Speaker 2>that's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really like a nuclear family.</v>

2028
01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Like they try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2029
01:22:46.621 --> 01:22:48.240
<v Speaker 2>they travel and they all stay in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

2030
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Fucking six people stay in one room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good move.</v>

2031
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.811
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

2032
01:22:51.811 --> 01:22:52.471
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2033
01:22:52.471 --> 01:22:54.810
<v Speaker 2>but like that's one of the beauties of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug.</v>

2034
01:22:54.811 --> 01:22:55.644
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

2035
01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 2>except I always look at other people is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like always glass half full.</v>

2036
01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.620
<v Speaker 2>That's the cool thing about doug is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2037
01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:02.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously Doug's shows her foot in the </v>

2038
01:23:03.691 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>bills for the tour manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the manager</v>

2039
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:08.440
<v Speaker 6>for their wives,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their girlfriends,</v>

2040
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:12.310
<v Speaker 6>and it's like this real big family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so what was really heartbreaking for</v>

2041
01:23:12.311 --> 01:23:13.144
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I hung out with them and I </v>

2042
01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:14.824
<v Speaker 6>didn't know anything was wrong at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I knew that they were going </v>

2043
01:23:15.971 --> 01:23:18.010
<v Speaker 6>through this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like we were all hanging out and,</v>

2044
01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.110
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2045
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:20.940
<v Speaker 6>and Bingo is air.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we were laughing and sing.</v>

2046
01:23:20.941 --> 01:23:24.130
<v Speaker 6>And I showed these guys have videos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a moment computer of just,</v>

2047
01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:25.450
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

2048
01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:27.790
<v Speaker 6>I'm telling you like Saint Elmos Fire </v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>

2049
01:23:27.791 --> 01:23:28.624
<v Speaker 6>like everyone holding arms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just literally having the greatest time </v>

2050
01:23:31.151 --> 01:23:31.984
<v Speaker 6>of my life and I lead how aggressively </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucked up was I at the end of that </v>

2051
01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:35.650
<v Speaker 6>video?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How'd yet you're,</v>

2052
01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.240
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't even talk on this.</v>

2053
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 6>I could not speak St Elmos fire.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was so great.</v>

2054
01:23:40.751 --> 01:23:45.130
<v Speaker 6>And so my whole hope is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that it's gotta be mads,</v>

2055
01:23:45.131 --> 01:23:45.520
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2056
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.353
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I spend an hour and a half in the car </v>

2057
01:23:46.841 --> 01:23:48.250
<v Speaker 6>with her more than x.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We had traffic,</v>

2058
01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:50.710
<v Speaker 6>but it's meds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's well,</v>

2059
01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:51.963
<v Speaker 6>it's just what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is going on in your brain versus </v>

2060
01:23:55.601 --> 01:23:58.000
<v Speaker 6>another person's brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can only speculate.</v>

2061
01:23:58.060 --> 01:23:58.871
<v Speaker 6>So wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how about no,</v>

2062
01:23:58.871 --> 01:23:59.704

<v Speaker 6>I don't know how anybody else sees the </v>

2063
01:24:00.461 --> 01:24:01.690
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but how about like,</v>

2064
01:24:01.691 --> 01:24:03.280
<v Speaker 6>tell me if you tell me what you think </v>
<v Speaker 6>about this.</v>

2065
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:05.010
<v Speaker 6>Honestly.</v>

2067
01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:08.913

<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to think of a scenario where </v>

2068
01:24:09.731 --> 01:24:12.280
<v Speaker 6>I could say this end of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we go to an island.</v>

2069
01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:14.320
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like you,</v>

2070
01:24:14.321 --> 01:24:17.470
<v Speaker 6>your wife and kids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian and some girl to,</v>

<v Speaker 6>we'll give him a rocket.</v>

2076
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:31.330
<v Speaker 6>The computer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And why haven't I fallen in love yet?</v>

2077
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:32.980
<v Speaker 6>Cause it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hear the story.</v>

2078
01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:34.990
<v Speaker 6>You're Dominic Monaghan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My point is,</v>

2079
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 6>and there's no meds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no meds.</v>

2080

<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you got all your favorite people </v>

2081
01:24:40.181 --> 01:24:41.014

<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2082
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:42.460
<v Speaker 6>And there's no meds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm saying like,</v>

2083
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:43.583
<v Speaker 6>do you believe that someone saying maybe</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was on meds that been put in a </v>

2084
01:24:46.931 --> 01:24:49.060
<v Speaker 6>perfect scenario?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2085
01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:50.860
<v Speaker 6>Apex predators on the island.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just family,</v>

2086
01:24:50.861 --> 01:24:52.150
<v Speaker 6>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 6>coconuts.</v>

2087
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:53.350
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone's feeling good.</v>

2088
01:24:53.351 --> 01:24:55.540
<v Speaker 6>They're eating healthy people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you believe,</v>

2089
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:56.583
<v Speaker 6>cause I wonder sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you believe then that all those </v>

2090
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:03.610
<v Speaker 6>problems is society slid in where you </v>
<v Speaker 6>now are on Prozac or whatever?</v>

2091
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.903
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you think that they would be pulled </v>

2092
01:25:06.431 --> 01:25:08.150
<v Speaker 6>away and that person will go like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2093
01:25:08.151 --> 01:25:09.280
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm feeling good,</v>

2094
01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm eating healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got one job.</v>

2095
01:25:11.171 --> 01:25:12.550
<v Speaker 6>It's just to go get coconuts in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>morning.</v>

2096
01:25:12.551 --> 01:25:15.550
<v Speaker 6>I get my coconut,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we all sit by the pool or by the,</v>

2097
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:16.540
<v Speaker 6>I don't know man.</v>

2098
01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:19.330
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a real danger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you hold your hand up?</v>

2099
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:21.250
<v Speaker 6>What does that say?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a Dominic Monaghan joke.</v>

2100
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:25.100
<v Speaker 6>How he was awesome and that thought too </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he was fucking amazing.</v>

2101
01:25:25.670 --> 01:25:29.680
<v Speaker 6>This is a real danger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in sand it's either or,</v>

2102
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:32.230
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever taken meds?</v>

2103
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:33.573
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think for some people they're </v>

2104
01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:36.364
<v Speaker 6>really important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But do you feel like marijuana's </v>

2105
01:25:38.290 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 6>sometimes acts like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

2106
01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.160
<v Speaker 6>like a Zoloft for you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2107
01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:43.023
<v Speaker 6>But marijuana definitely gives you a </v>
<v Speaker 6>more sensitive perspective and a calms </v>

2108
01:25:47.051 --> 01:25:50.740
<v Speaker 6>you down and it makes you more connected</v>
<v Speaker 6>to all the other people that you come in</v>

2109
01:25:50.741 --> 01:25:51.574
<v Speaker 6>contact with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It definitely does that in a lot of </v>

2110
01:25:53.651 --> 01:25:54.484
<v Speaker 6>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2111
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.473
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not what's going on with </v>

2112
01:25:57.281 --> 01:25:58.114
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're taking medication that people </v>

2113
01:25:59.441 --> 01:26:02.090
<v Speaker 6>that are taking medication like Ssri.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2114
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:04.250
<v Speaker 6>I've met,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have some friends that</v>

2115
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:07.310
<v Speaker 4>they started using them and it changed </v>
<v Speaker 4>their life.</v>

2116
01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:08.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple,</v>

2117
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 4>quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then both of them coincidentally,</v>

2118
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:11.750
<v Speaker 4>or not coincidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2119
01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:13.063
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after a while they weened off of them </v>

2120
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:18.200
<v Speaker 4>and their life got better and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>both really smart guys.</v>

2121
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:19.333
<v Speaker 4>And when their life got better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they wean themselves off the psych </v>

2122
01:26:22.041 --> 01:26:22.874
<v Speaker 4>meds and they stayed happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think everybody's got a different </v>

2123
01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:27.790
<v Speaker 4>story too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a,</v>

2124
01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 4>there's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a danger,</v>

2125
01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:34.790
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's a real prejudice that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people do well.</v>

2126
01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:35.624
<v Speaker 4>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll decide like it's one way or the </v>

2127
01:26:37.551 --> 01:26:38.384
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's either you don't need any </v>

2128
01:26:39.981 --> 01:26:40.814
<v Speaker 4>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all you need to do is diet and exercise </v>

2129
01:26:43.071 --> 01:26:47.390
<v Speaker 4>and run and you'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's other people that think</v>

2130
01:26:47.391 --> 01:26:50.840
<v Speaker 4>that it's a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way to treat it is primarily through</v>

2131
01:26:50.841 --> 01:26:54.020
<v Speaker 4>medication and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And your health and your,</v>

2132
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.771
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2133
01:26:54.771 --> 01:26:55.604
<v Speaker 4>your exercise routines and your diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>really doesn't have any bearing on it </v>

2134
01:26:58.671 --> 01:26:59.504
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some sort of a neurological </v>

2135
01:27:01.551 --> 01:27:02.150
<v Speaker 4>disorder.</v>

2136
01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:02.983
<v Speaker 4>You have an issue with your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's people that are under like </v>

2137
01:27:05.890 --> 01:27:08.600
<v Speaker 4>that school of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the real answer,</v>

2138
01:27:08.601 --> 01:27:11.090
<v Speaker 4>if you talk to a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuroscientists,</v>

2139
01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.890
<v Speaker 4>they'll tell you it's somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle.</v>

2140
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:14.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck knows?</v>

2141
01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.613
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you might be completely batshit </v>

2142
01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.300
<v Speaker 4>crazy and you need medication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

2143
01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:23.660
<v Speaker 4>you're just fucking wired wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not happening in there.</v>

2144
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:25.760
<v Speaker 4>Someone needs to go in there and rewire </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2145
01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:29.660
<v Speaker 4>Or you might be a guy who could easily </v>
<v Speaker 4>be healthy.</v>

2146
01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:31.970
<v Speaker 4>If he could get on a good roll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2147
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.070
<v Speaker 4>if you could just get some momentum </v>
<v Speaker 4>going and start,</v>

2148
01:27:34.071 --> 01:27:35.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting up in the morning,</v>

2149
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:36.223
<v Speaker 4>drinking warm water with lemon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting on the fucking treadmill for a </v>

2150
01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:42.230
<v Speaker 4>half an hour every morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put that treadmill in the garage,</v>

2151
01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:45.700
<v Speaker 4>plug that fucker in every morning just </v>
<v Speaker 4>to fucking half an hour before you go.</v>

2152
01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.170
<v Speaker 4>Once you start getting on these roles </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

2153
01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:52.040
<v Speaker 4>you start feeling better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a serotonin drip that happens.</v>

2154
01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.750
<v Speaker 4>You start feeling better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get,</v>

2155
01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:55.610
<v Speaker 4>you get more fit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get more healthy,</v>

2156
01:27:55.611 --> 01:27:57.410
<v Speaker 4>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you feel better,</v>

2157
01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.450
<v Speaker 4>your brain works better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's undeniable.</v>

2158
01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.210
<v Speaker 4>So it's not necessarily one or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>

2159
01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.793
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's going on in your </v>

2160
01:28:06.411 --> 01:28:07.244
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what's going on in my </v>

2161
01:28:07.761 --> 01:28:08.594
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's where it gets weird </v>

2162
01:28:09.531 --> 01:28:11.720
<v Speaker 4>when people like these psych meds aren't</v>
<v Speaker 4>helping anybody.</v>

2163
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.810
<v Speaker 4>I think some of them might be helping </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people,</v>

2164
01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:17.023
<v Speaker 4>some people hit a bad spot man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think the psych drugs can fucking </v>

2165
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:21.643
<v Speaker 4>pull them up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they can get accustomed to </v>

2166
01:28:23.961 --> 01:28:26.210
<v Speaker 4>being on balance and then they can get </v>
<v Speaker 4>off of him.</v>

2167
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:28.490
<v Speaker 4>I wish I knew more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always,</v>

2168
01:28:28.491 --> 01:28:31.220
<v Speaker 4>they've always told me I should go on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>something for uh,</v>

2169
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:33.390
<v Speaker 4>for anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2170
01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:34.041
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2171
01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:36.050
<v Speaker 4>to change your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might,</v>

2172
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:40.140
<v Speaker 4>I might w the wonder about it is what </v>
<v Speaker 4>adult,</v>

2173
01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:43.760
<v Speaker 4>what's awesome about your personality?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hundred percent.</v>

2174
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:47.270
<v Speaker 4>That's what everybody was crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think fucking crazy.</v>

2175
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:48.223
<v Speaker 4>Well that's part of what makes you you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it's not like you don't have a </v>

2176
01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:53.840
<v Speaker 4>handle on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just slippery.</v>

2177
01:28:53.841 --> 01:28:56.870
<v Speaker 4>The handles slippery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very slippery.</v>

2178
01:28:56.910 --> 01:29:01.910
<v Speaker 4>It's covered in mct oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that way for every one who's</v>

2179
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:04.800
<v Speaker 6>trying to do anything creatively.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2180
01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:09.240
<v Speaker 6>you can't be 100% relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not going to work that way.</v>

2181
01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.790
<v Speaker 6>Have you been to a therapist before?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm in therapy right now.</v>

2182
01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.940
<v Speaker 6>Hollow is best and I the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my favorite moment was anytime I,</v>

2183
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:19.710
<v Speaker 6>cause I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a lot of epiphanous moment,</v>

2184
01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:22.170
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I have cognitive,</v>

2185
01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:23.880
<v Speaker 6>not cognitive and emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That word.</v>

2186
01:29:23.881 --> 01:29:27.990
<v Speaker 6>I've been alive 48 years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really ever said epiphanous I have,</v>

2187
01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:31.460
<v Speaker 6>I have a lot of emotional epiphanous </v>
<v Speaker 6>moment because yeah.</v>

2188
01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.520
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a day where I,</v>

2189
01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:35.100
<v Speaker 6>where I jumped off the tallest stadium </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the world,</v>

2190
01:29:35.101 --> 01:29:37.770
<v Speaker 6>swim with great white sharks and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>rappelled up at 3000 foot mountain.</v>

2191
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:41.640
<v Speaker 6>So like at the end of that day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're sitting there going like the fuck</v>

2192
01:29:41.641 --> 01:29:43.170
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>

2193
01:29:43.230 --> 01:29:44.063
<v Speaker 6>Like what is going through my brain?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I survived three times today when </v>

2194
01:29:48.001 --> 01:29:49.980
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when in the day in deadly activities,</v>

2195
01:29:49.981 --> 01:29:51.460
<v Speaker 6>but then I knew that were safe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

2196
01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.010
<v Speaker 6>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2197
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:56.330
<v Speaker 6>and then it started happening that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>started getting a very low threshold for</v>

2198
01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:57.210
<v Speaker 6>this moment.</v>

2199
01:29:57.210 --> 01:30:00.240
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>things can just be like Stan hopes,</v>

2200
01:30:00.241 --> 01:30:00.711
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2201
01:30:00.711 --> 01:30:02.580
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was firing hot,</v>

2202
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:04.560
<v Speaker 6>I was at the airport and I was just </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2203
01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.360
<v Speaker 6>he was one of the greatest times I've </v>
<v Speaker 6>ever had in my life,</v>

2204
01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:07.931
<v Speaker 6>I would like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I,</v>

2205
01:30:07.931 --> 01:30:08.764
<v Speaker 6>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if it was the greatest time of </v>

2206
01:30:09.511 --> 01:30:10.081
<v Speaker 6>my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my life,</v>

2207
01:30:10.081 --> 01:30:13.710
<v Speaker 6>or if I'm just like so connected right </v>
<v Speaker 6>now to whatever that is.</v>

2208
01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.060
<v Speaker 6>They've got a theater there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was gonna say this.</v>

2209
01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:16.290
<v Speaker 6>They've got a theater there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think Joey,</v>

2210
01:30:16.291 --> 01:30:20.340
<v Speaker 6>Ari and I are going to do it 125 seats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stan hope presents.</v>

2211
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:24.810
<v Speaker 6>Just go down and spend it in business.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know he and I talked about that.</v>

2212
01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:25.733
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that theater sounds like the perfect </v>

2213
01:30:27.031 --> 01:30:29.160
<v Speaker 6>place it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bring in comics for a weekend.</v>

2214
01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:31.770
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever do the old cobb's?</v>

2215
01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2216
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:35.310
<v Speaker 6>Like 150 seats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2217
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:37.830
<v Speaker 6>it probably might not even been that </v>
<v Speaker 6>many seats.</v>

2218
01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:40.320
<v Speaker 6>The old cops was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did.</v>

2219
01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.050
<v Speaker 6>It was down by the wharf.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

2220
01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:43.320
<v Speaker 6>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was called the green room.</v>

2221
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:45.780
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you did it after it was cops the cops</v>

2222
01:30:45.781 --> 01:30:48.840
<v Speaker 6>and move to the new spot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was a great fucking club though.</v>

2223
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.823
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy because cobbs is like the old</v>
<v Speaker 6>cobb's was literally like the perfect </v>

2224
01:30:55.171 --> 01:30:56.004
<v Speaker 6>size club,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was almost too small to make </v>

2225
01:30:57.241 --> 01:30:59.670
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like if you worked at cobb's,</v>

2226
01:30:59.671 --> 01:31:02.250
<v Speaker 6>you got paid less than if you worked at </v>
<v Speaker 6>the punchline,</v>

2227
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:05.700
<v Speaker 6>which is also a great Rome right punch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was fantastic.</v>

2228
01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:09.120
<v Speaker 6>It was so good about that comms cause he</v>
<v Speaker 6>was so small.</v>

2229
01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:12.210
<v Speaker 6>He would go there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is like so packed in tight.</v>

2230
01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:16.170
<v Speaker 6>I would make less money to work there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but look forward to it more.</v>

2231
01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.420
<v Speaker 6>It caught on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right cy?</v>

2232
01:31:18.421 --> 01:31:19.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Something happened man.</v>

2233
01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:20.694
<v Speaker 6>There's some sort of a fire really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They moved to a new spot and the new </v>

2234
01:31:24.421 --> 01:31:28.120
<v Speaker 6>spot they moved to as a giant ass spot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to,</v>

2235
01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.930
<v Speaker 6>that was always hard to fill for me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not if you're Doug Benson,</v>

2236
01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:34.770
<v Speaker 6>but the new spot is still awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really like the new spot.</v>

2237
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:35.663
<v Speaker 6>It's really cool but it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's got a high ceiling and it's got a </v>

2238
01:31:38.671 --> 01:31:41.520
<v Speaker 6>balcony that's way in the back where you</v>
<v Speaker 6>know Doug,</v>

2239
01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:42.373
<v Speaker 6>when Doug sells tickets to those,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to that theater and he's done stuff </v>

2240
01:31:45.001 --> 01:31:45.834
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one from Bisbee has to hold like 25 </v>

2241
01:31:48.151 --> 01:31:48.984
<v Speaker 6>tickets for Bisbee residents.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all people flying into Tucson and </v>

2242
01:31:51.421 --> 01:31:54.240
<v Speaker 6>driving down to go see the show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty fucking legit.</v>

2243
01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:55.990
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

2244
01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:56.873
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

2245
01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:59.660
<v Speaker 6>that is what I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bring out.</v>

2246
01:31:59.830 --> 01:32:03.240
<v Speaker 6>I would come in in a heartbeat in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>heartbeat.</v>

2247
01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.040
<v Speaker 6>My initial idea of coming in was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go in,</v>

2248
01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:06.993
<v Speaker 6>do standup in like near Bisbee,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see if I can get stand up to look at my </v>

2249
01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:10.630
<v Speaker 6>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tell me where I'm being lazy.</v>

2250
01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then he was like,</v>

2251
01:32:11.981 --> 01:32:14.260
<v Speaker 6>just do it in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Let's take a look at it.</v>

2379
01:37:06.230 --> 01:37:07.063
<v Speaker 6>First thing is like these cock sucker </v>
<v Speaker 6>mother fuckers and I looks over and </v>

2380
01:37:10.821 --> 01:37:12.500
<v Speaker 6>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are we allowed to watch us?</v>

2381
01:37:12.501 --> 01:37:13.281
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck it.</v>

2382
01:37:13.281 --> 01:37:14.480
<v Speaker 6>Your mom's not here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's watch it.</v>

2383
01:37:15.650 --> 01:37:16.910
<v Speaker 6>Watch the pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2384
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:20.240
<v Speaker 6>Leanne comes in and says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are you guys?</v>

2385
01:37:20.241 --> 01:37:21.021
<v Speaker 6>Watch it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2386
01:37:21.021 --> 01:37:21.854
<v Speaker 6>It's got bad words in it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not like sexual or anything </v>

2387
01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:25.213
<v Speaker 6>until we show in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Leanne says she sees an article on NPR </v>

2388
01:37:27.891 --> 01:37:30.890
<v Speaker 6>that says kids being around cursing is </v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2389
01:37:30.891 --> 01:37:33.470
<v Speaker 6>It's actually very healthy for them to </v>
<v Speaker 6>hear cursing.</v>

2390
01:37:33.471 --> 01:37:36.650
<v Speaker 6>It's when kids don't hear cursing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they believe the world is different.</v>

2391
01:37:36.770 --> 01:37:38.030
<v Speaker 6>They believe the world's fucked up.</v>

2392
01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:38.953
<v Speaker 6>So like they live in this bubble and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then they do hear cursing and it fucks </v>

2393
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:44.030
<v Speaker 6>them up and in return and so low.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah.</v>

2394
01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.100
<v Speaker 6>And so leanne is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

2395
01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:49.250
<v Speaker 6>let's watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we watched an interesting concept but</v>

2396
01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.720
<v Speaker 6>totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense.</v>

2397
01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.850
<v Speaker 6>Did you hear cursing when you're a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:53.750
<v Speaker 6>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2399
01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:54.693
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2400
01:37:54.850 --> 01:37:57.180

<v Speaker 6>it's just these new age,</v>

<v Speaker 6>but like whatever,</v>

2403
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:04.470
<v Speaker 6>like they hae cursing is not around </v>
<v Speaker 6>children.</v>

2404
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:05.383
<v Speaker 6>We think as a new age Christian thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know one parent when I was a </v>

2405
01:38:08.551 --> 01:38:10.950
<v Speaker 6>kid that didn't curse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't drink,</v>

2406
01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:14.040
<v Speaker 6>smoke in front of their kids and curse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that was my whole life.</v>

2407
01:38:14.041 --> 01:38:16.060
<v Speaker 6>But I grew up in the south.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well it's,</v>

2408
01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:19.170
<v Speaker 6>I guess it's trying to preserve the </v>
<v Speaker 6>innocence of the kids.</v>

2409
01:38:19.171 --> 01:38:20.340
<v Speaker 6>Is that what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that what it is?</v>

2410
01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:24.000
<v Speaker 6>I guess it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just words,</v>

2411
01:38:24.001 --> 01:38:24.834
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just words to be able to say that </v>

2412
01:38:25.921 --> 01:38:26.491
<v Speaker 6>right away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2413
01:38:26.491 --> 01:38:27.324
<v Speaker 6>what did we give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why do we have to behave different than </v>

2414
01:38:29.341 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 6>the kids do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It teaches them boundaries.</v>

2415
01:38:31.471 --> 01:38:33.570
<v Speaker 6>It says this is what dad can do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't do that.</v>

2416
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:36.330
<v Speaker 6>When you become a certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can earn that and you can do it.</v>

2417
01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:37.700
<v Speaker 6>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how,</v>

2418
01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:38.461
<v Speaker 6>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2419
01:38:38.461 --> 01:38:42.120
<v Speaker 6>but what if like a kid says like pussy </v>
<v Speaker 6>hole that you don't want kids sank pussy</v>

2420
01:38:42.121 --> 01:38:42.954
<v Speaker 6>holes probably they'd have to live in </v>
<v Speaker 6>your house to your pussy hole like well </v>

2421
01:38:45.811 --> 01:38:46.644
<v Speaker 6>that could come up with it on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like puts you holes from a </v>

2422
01:38:49.141 --> 01:38:50.070
<v Speaker 6>single origin.</v>

2423
01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:57.870
<v Speaker 6>People all over the world said pussy </v>
<v Speaker 6>hole and a hundred fifth and languages.</v>

2424
01:38:59.370 --> 01:39:01.170
<v Speaker 6>None of them aware that somebody in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Greece,</v>

2425
01:39:01.171 --> 01:39:02.004
<v Speaker 6>it already claimed that nomenclature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but so we ended up watching it and then </v>

2426
01:39:06.991 --> 01:39:09.570
<v Speaker 6>bill came over bills and we were at </v>
<v Speaker 6>episode three.</v>

2427
01:39:09.571 --> 01:39:10.404
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you haven't let them see episode four </v>

2428
01:39:11.641 --> 01:39:12.930
<v Speaker 6>yet if you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 6>don't let them fucking tears.</v>

2431
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.613
<v Speaker 6>But what's so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like we're sitting in the kitchen </v>

2432
01:39:17.671 --> 01:39:20.130
<v Speaker 6>and my daughter walks in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She didn't give a shit about celebrity.</v>

2433
01:39:20.131 --> 01:39:20.964

<v Speaker 6>but she heard bill's voice and went </v>

<v Speaker 6>it and then we went to check on me all </v>

2709
01:51:24.650 --> 01:51:24.750
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>

2710
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:25.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see what I'm saying?</v>

2711
01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:30.920
<v Speaker 4>Like a girl would kind of be forced into</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of an environment if she had a</v>

2712
01:51:31.261 --> 01:51:32.460
<v Speaker 4>wash guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assholes.</v>

2713
01:51:32.670 --> 01:51:33.503
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gotta be a certain amount of </v>

2714
01:51:36.331 --> 01:51:39.960
<v Speaker 4>guys that want more than you did just </v>
<v Speaker 4>wash their dick and watched her asshole.</v>

2715
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:40.833
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To keep watching that.</v>

2716
01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:41.970
<v Speaker 6>It felt good though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Having a,</v>

2717
01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:43.610
<v Speaker 6>if somebody wash your luck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you collect,</v>

2718
01:51:43.611 --> 01:51:45.350
<v Speaker 6>cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I laid there and she watched me for like</v>

2719
01:51:45.351 --> 01:51:47.290
<v Speaker 6>20 minutes and it felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

2720
01:51:47.291 --> 01:51:48.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm my baby again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kind of it,</v>

2721
01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:50.930
<v Speaker 6>it was like this weird feeling I hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>felt in a while.</v>

2722
01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:51.590
<v Speaker 6>What I'm thinking</v>

2723
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:56.590
<v Speaker 4>is that like having the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the girl removed from the equation,</v>

2724
01:51:56.901 --> 01:51:59.750
<v Speaker 4>it takes out the sex aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's okay.</v>

2725
01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:00.593
<v Speaker 4>The dude does it because if the sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspect of it is there ea like there's </v>

2726
01:52:05.121 --> 01:52:05.954
<v Speaker 4>just a certain percentage of guys are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to try to fuck that girl and so </v>

2727
01:52:09.351 --> 01:52:11.660
<v Speaker 4>her jobs like hazardous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

2728
01:52:11.661 --> 01:52:12.494
<v Speaker 4>Like if you don't want to fuck every </v>
<v Speaker 4>other guy you wash all day and you're </v>

2729
01:52:14.691 --> 01:52:17.270
<v Speaker 4>grabbing their legs and washing their </v>
<v Speaker 4>balls and assholes,</v>

2730
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:19.610
<v Speaker 4>how many dudes going to try to fuck you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2731
01:52:19.611 --> 01:52:24.611
<v Speaker 4>could you imagine that kind of a work </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment where like you were like,</v>

2732
01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:26.773
<v Speaker 4>imagine if your job was being a at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>counter at a chipotle lay and you knew </v>

<v Speaker 4>what can I get you?</v>

2734
01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:38.600
<v Speaker 4>You were the first guy on the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>chain of command.</v>

2735
01:52:38.601 --> 01:52:39.600
<v Speaker 4>I'll have one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Staples.</v>

2736
01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:40.281

<v Speaker 4>White Rice or brown rice.</v>

2738
01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.770
<v Speaker 4>But if you're that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2739
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.863
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2740
01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:50.273
<v Speaker 3>Burrito completely lost my train of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought as soon as it was I saying </v>

2741
01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:04.980
<v Speaker 3>before that you were talking about women</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching you balls.</v>

2742
01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget what I said.</v>

2743
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you my theory.</v>

2744
01:53:09.951 --> 01:53:13.100
<v Speaker 3>This is going to sound racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll say it out loud anyway,</v>

2745
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:14.383
<v Speaker 3>I had a massage from a lady in Omaha who</v>
<v Speaker 3>was black and it was the best massage </v>

2746
01:53:18.411 --> 01:53:22.190
<v Speaker 3>I've ever got and the reason I thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>was she's not attracted to me at all.</v>

2747
01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:26.520
<v Speaker 3>I remember what I was going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She went to Chicago Lane.</v>

2748
01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:33.590
<v Speaker 3>You were the first guy on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first guy on the line,</v>

2749
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:34.703
<v Speaker 4>and you were the one who asks if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want steak bowl and eight out of 10 </v>

2750
01:53:37.291 --> 01:53:41.110
<v Speaker 4>people wanting to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

2751
01:53:41.970 --> 01:53:45.510
<v Speaker 4>10 people tried to fuck you while you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were at work like you matt.</v>

2752
01:53:45.511 --> 01:53:48.630
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine that kind of pressure of</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a job like that?</v>

2753
01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:53.100
<v Speaker 4>If it was a girl who was wash your </v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole and your Dick,</v>

2754
01:53:53.130 --> 01:53:57.210
<v Speaker 4>eight out of 10 guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a ridiculous job hazard.</v>

2755
01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:59.730
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had any other job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a better example.</v>

2756
01:53:59.731 --> 01:54:00.564
<v Speaker 4>If you were a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>change his tires at the local gas </v>

2757
01:54:02.641 --> 01:54:03.470
<v Speaker 4>station.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2758
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:05.850

2759
01:54:05.851 --> 01:54:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm tired of working here.</v>

2760
01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:08.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2761
01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:10.650
<v Speaker 4>I just want to change your tire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all I want to do.</v>

2762
01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:11.753
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a guy in a loin cloth and </v>

2763
01:54:14.071 --> 01:54:19.071
<v Speaker 4>that guy's washing your balls and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole maybe removes any threat of sex,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it happens quick Russian dude,</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's Russian baths.</v>

2768

01:54:36.411 --> 01:54:38.180
<v Speaker 6>and I'm telling you when I said this and</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>

2773
01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:42.260
<v Speaker 6>I agree 100% what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they're going to disappear</v>

2774
01:54:42.261 --> 01:54:45.800
<v Speaker 6>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in our country we respect,</v>

2775
01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:50.060
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to say minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we respect minorities not wanting to</v>

2776
01:54:50.061 --> 01:54:51.980
<v Speaker 6>be apart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like wanting to have their own thing.</v>

2777
01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:53.780
<v Speaker 6>We just don't respect it with white </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

2778
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:54.763
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so for forever we're going to allow </v>

2779
01:54:56.511 --> 01:54:57.344
<v Speaker 6>Russians and Koreans and Japanese and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Asians to have their own little secret </v>

2780
01:54:59.901 --> 01:55:00.734
<v Speaker 6>separate towns where like you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 6>their shit because we go as America </v>

2781

2782
01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:07.040
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

<v Speaker 6>We got that.</v>

2785
01:55:09.170 --> 01:55:10.760
<v Speaker 6>If you want to be a part of our clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can do that.</v>

2786
01:55:10.761 --> 01:55:13.370
<v Speaker 6>We don't even give a fuck about your </v>
<v Speaker 6>clubs and cause you never,</v>

2787
01:55:13.371 --> 01:55:16.370
<v Speaker 6>no one's ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a karaoke spots.</v>

2788
01:55:16.371 --> 01:55:19.130
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you've ever been in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Korea town and are fucking amazing.</v>

2789
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:20.083
<v Speaker 6>You get a private room with private,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like literally your own screen and your </v>

2790
01:55:23.271 --> 01:55:24.104
<v Speaker 6>own video where you and a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 6>families could go in and do your own </v>

2791
01:55:26.241 --> 01:55:28.250
<v Speaker 6>Karaoke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's so much fucking fun.</v>

2792
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:31.370
<v Speaker 6>I've done it in Japan and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a blast.</v>

2793
01:55:31.610 --> 01:55:33.590
<v Speaker 6>But you can't go if you're white in </v>
<v Speaker 6>America.</v>

2794
01:55:33.630 --> 01:55:36.000
<v Speaker 6>What they want to Chen man and the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they again,</v>

2795
01:55:36.170 --> 01:55:36.950
<v Speaker 6>they treat you like shit</v>

2796
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:39.450
<v Speaker 4>until you leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

2797
01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:40.370
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2798
01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:42.560
<v Speaker 6>in America will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're totally gonna allow that.</v>

2799
01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:45.480
<v Speaker 6>We're gonna allow that forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would be racist for us not to allow</v>

2800
01:55:45.481 --> 01:55:47.550
<v Speaker 6>that for us to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how dare you.</v>

2801
01:55:47.551 --> 01:55:49.590
<v Speaker 6>You need to let whites and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just shut it down.</v>

2802
01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.810
<v Speaker 6>They'd find another place to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they wouldn't tell us about it.</v>

2803
01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:53.790
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These,</v>

2804
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:55.440
<v Speaker 6>I'm telling you to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these karaoke,</v>

2805
01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:56.693
<v Speaker 6>that wasn't the case.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I liked the fact that those places </v>

2806
01:56:00.001 --> 01:56:00.834
<v Speaker 6>exist and that it's like their culture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but why not let other people go visit </v>

2807
01:56:04.621 --> 01:56:05.680
<v Speaker 6>your culture?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is it?</v>

2808
01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:06.920
<v Speaker 6>Why Get mad?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

2809
01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:08.550
<v Speaker 6>Why want to kick white people out?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Terrorists.</v>

2810
01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:10.860
<v Speaker 6>Dare I say it's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2811
01:56:11.070 --> 01:56:12.330
<v Speaker 6>Cause,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean dare you say,</v>

2812
01:56:12.331 --> 01:56:13.770
<v Speaker 6>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

2813
01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:16.770
<v Speaker 6>I picked that up from you and you say </v>
<v Speaker 6>how to do,</v>

2814
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:18.270
<v Speaker 6>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>think about it.</v>

2815
01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:20.730
<v Speaker 6>We didn't want black people to be in our</v>
<v Speaker 6>country clubs or Jews.</v>

2816
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:23.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying me personally,</v>

2817
01:56:23.071 --> 01:56:25.950
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying art my people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it was forced on them.</v>

2818
01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:27.563
<v Speaker 6>However,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Korean spas they don't want white </v>

2819
01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:33.270
<v Speaker 6>women just walking in and just getting </v>
<v Speaker 6>up and dressed with tattoos.</v>

2820
01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.253
<v Speaker 6>They'd fucking kick you out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But a lot of Korean spas that white </v>

2821
01:56:36.391 --> 01:56:40.410
<v Speaker 6>women and not with tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do Margaret Cho has a whole chunk.</v>

2822
01:56:40.411 --> 01:56:41.900
<v Speaker 6>I've heard her talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No kidding.</v>

2823
01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:42.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2824
01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:44.410
<v Speaker 6>it's shameful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

2825
01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:45.713
<v Speaker 6>I know that's the way in Japan nate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause they have those like things you </v>

2826
01:56:47.461 --> 01:56:50.160
<v Speaker 6>put over your arms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wouldn't let me work out at the gym,</v>

2827
01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.440
<v Speaker 6>see,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless I had a long sleeve shirts.</v>

2828
01:56:52.441 --> 01:56:53.161
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2829
01:56:53.161 --> 01:56:54.930
<v Speaker 6>so my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm just,</v>

2830
01:56:54.931 --> 01:56:58.320
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying this for conversation's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying it as a point of view,</v>

2831
01:56:58.590 --> 01:56:59.423
<v Speaker 6>but is it natural?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean look at like look at at black </v>

2832
01:57:01.831 --> 01:57:03.600
<v Speaker 6>churches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you walk in as a white guy.</v>

2833
01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:06.270
<v Speaker 6>A lot of times everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you doing here?</v>

2834
01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:07.493
<v Speaker 6>You're going to an all black and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>just go and I just want to praise God </v>

2835
01:57:09.241 --> 01:57:10.080
<v Speaker 6>with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then they're like,</v>

2836
01:57:10.110 --> 01:57:10.771
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2837
01:57:10.771 --> 01:57:13.200
<v Speaker 6>I mean I guess we have to let you in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can't kick you out.</v>

2838
01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:17.340
<v Speaker 6>So I think what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you go to these Russian bass plays,</v>

2839
01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:20.700
<v Speaker 6>you walk in as a white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they literally like not speaking Russian</v>

2840
01:57:21.090 --> 01:57:23.040
<v Speaker 6>and they're literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you doing here?</v>

2841
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:27.090
<v Speaker 6>Is that natural?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It exists so often.</v>

2842
01:57:27.091 --> 01:57:27.924
<v Speaker 6>It would be a hard argument to say it </v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't natural because there's so many </v>

2843
01:57:30.271 --> 01:57:31.830
<v Speaker 6>versions of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So many,</v>

2844
01:57:31.850 --> 01:57:32.683
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not that it's the right choice or </v>

2845
01:57:34.051 --> 01:57:36.690
<v Speaker 6>that it's ultimately the way people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to think and behave,</v>

2846
01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:39.180
<v Speaker 6>but to have it exist and to have it be </v>
<v Speaker 6>natural.</v>

2847
01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:40.620
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's obviously natural.</v>

2848
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:41.663
<v Speaker 6>It's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't so common if nationalism and </v>

2849
01:57:44.101 --> 01:57:46.860
<v Speaker 6>racism like on that level wasn't so </v>
<v Speaker 6>common.</v>

2850
01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:50.160
<v Speaker 6>It's more of a nationalism even than it </v>
<v Speaker 6>is a racism.</v>

2851
01:57:50.161 --> 01:57:50.994
<v Speaker 6>Like there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some countries that are like fiercely </v>

2852
01:57:52.411 --> 01:57:54.870
<v Speaker 6>loyal to their country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't want anybody else at,</v>

2853
01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:55.943
<v Speaker 6>they don't want to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Australian was like that for a long </v>

2854
01:57:57.181 --> 01:57:58.080
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wasn't really,</v>

2855
01:57:58.110 --> 01:58:00.540
<v Speaker 6>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you see Asians couldn't immigrate.</v>

2856
01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:01.513
<v Speaker 6>I only know this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wrote a paper written in high school </v>

2857
01:58:02.731 --> 01:58:04.430
<v Speaker 6>or college,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you see Asians,</v>

2858
01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.273
<v Speaker 6>they would allow Asians in has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying Australia is like that </v>

2859
01:58:07.291 --> 01:58:09.300
<v Speaker 6>now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then the second question is,</v>

2860
01:58:09.301 --> 01:58:10.080
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so we've,</v>

2861
01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:13.350
<v Speaker 6>we've said that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it's natural then.</v>

2862
01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:15.060
<v Speaker 6>Then what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is the difference?</v>

2863
01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:20.080
<v Speaker 6>Like I personally don't want those </v>
<v Speaker 6>Russian baths and there's Korean spas.</v>

2864
01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:22.140
<v Speaker 6>I don't want anyone to not have their </v>
<v Speaker 6>own shit.</v>

2865
01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.150
<v Speaker 6>If you want to have it in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you should have it.</v>

2866
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:27.180
<v Speaker 6>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now there's personally nothing I've ever</v>

2867
01:58:27.181 --> 01:58:30.960
<v Speaker 6>grown up with in my life that I have </v>
<v Speaker 6>that he's just white male.</v>

2868
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:31.920
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2869
01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:34.110
<v Speaker 6>so I don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never really had that experience.</v>

2870
01:58:34.710 --> 01:58:35.543
<v Speaker 6>Although it was a child.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would go into the country clubs and </v>

2871
01:58:36.841 --> 01:58:38.790
<v Speaker 6>you'd see just old white men playing </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>

2872
01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:41.680
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I don't think it'll go away.</v>

2873
01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:45.780
<v Speaker 6>But then in my question is why do these </v>
<v Speaker 6>liberals take away everything that is,</v>

2874
01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:46.623
<v Speaker 6>liberals take away one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then the stuff like the Korean spa </v>

2875
01:58:49.571 --> 01:58:51.910
<v Speaker 6>or the karaoke place or,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or the Russian baths,</v>

2876
01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:54.160
<v Speaker 6>why don't they go in and protest them?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2877
01:58:54.161 --> 01:58:58.420
<v Speaker 6>because the idea is that these small </v>
<v Speaker 6>communities,</v>

2878
01:58:58.510 --> 01:59:03.000
<v Speaker 6>they retain a bit of their homeland,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a bit of your,</v>

2879
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:06.370
<v Speaker 6>their past and they'd have their culture</v>
<v Speaker 6>in these areas.</v>

2880
01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:07.593
<v Speaker 6>And if you are a progressive person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea is that you're supposed to </v>

2881
01:59:10.691 --> 01:59:15.691
<v Speaker 6>allow that kind of thinking because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>preserves this unique culture.</v>

2882
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:16.833
<v Speaker 6>I agree kind of delicate and it is </v>
<v Speaker 6>delicate because the kids that are </v>

2883
01:59:19.811 --> 01:59:20.644
<v Speaker 6>assimilating into our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the children of their children that are </v>

2884
01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:24.283
<v Speaker 6>assembling into the cities,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if they're like first and second </v>

2885
01:59:26.471 --> 01:59:27.970
<v Speaker 6>generation immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2886
01:59:27.971 --> 01:59:28.804
<v Speaker 6>they eventually become Americanized and </v>
<v Speaker 6>these cool things like the Russian bath </v>

2887
01:59:32.831 --> 01:59:33.664
<v Speaker 6>houses or the Korean bath house,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bond yes' and there's a bunch of </v>

2888
01:59:36.911 --> 01:59:37.360
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2889
01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:40.060
<v Speaker 6>I think a bunch of different like cool </v>
<v Speaker 6>nick too.</v>

2890
01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:42.280
<v Speaker 6>People do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would be a show.</v>

2891
01:59:42.281 --> 01:59:44.470
<v Speaker 6>I'd watch that on Viceland on travel </v>
<v Speaker 6>channel.</v>

2892
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:45.820
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2893
01:59:45.850 --> 01:59:48.790
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting to see all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>different ways that people do things and</v>

2894
01:59:48.791 --> 01:59:49.624
<v Speaker 6>if we start putting targets and kmarts </v>
<v Speaker 6>all across the world and that becomes </v>

2895
01:59:53.201 --> 01:59:54.890
<v Speaker 6>everything in.</v>

2896
01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:55.793
<v Speaker 6>We all learn each other's language and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything slides into one set of rules </v>

2897
01:59:58.751 --> 02:00:00.420
<v Speaker 6>for the whole planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like yeah,</v>

2898
02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:01.953
<v Speaker 6>probably won't be as fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I never really had a culture so </v>

2899
02:00:03.851 --> 02:00:04.684
<v Speaker 6>to speak because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were transplants from the north in </v>

2900
02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:07.720
<v Speaker 6>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like I,</v>

2901
02:00:07.721 --> 02:00:09.610
<v Speaker 6>I never saw there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And because my parents from New York and</v>

2902
02:00:09.611 --> 02:00:10.444
<v Speaker 6>Philly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I never felt southern so I never </v>

2903
02:00:12.670 --> 02:00:15.520
<v Speaker 6>got attached to the born in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was born in Florida,</v>

2904
02:00:15.521 --> 02:00:17.890
<v Speaker 6>but I never,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I owed,</v>

2905
02:00:17.891 --> 02:00:21.700
<v Speaker 6>my parents were very liberal and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we didn't grow up saying the m word.</v>

2906
02:00:21.701 --> 02:00:23.980
<v Speaker 6>We didn't have a rebel flag in front of </v>
<v Speaker 6>our yard.</v>

2907
02:00:24.340 --> 02:00:26.050
<v Speaker 6>So I don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2908
02:00:26.530 --> 02:00:27.363
<v Speaker 6>I always feel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always say this a lot and never have </v>

2909
02:00:28.091 --> 02:00:28.924
<v Speaker 6>any civic pride,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nor do I have any culture other than </v>

2910
02:00:32.231 --> 02:00:33.520
<v Speaker 6>like Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2911
02:00:33.521 --> 02:00:36.390
<v Speaker 6>I grew up like Irish was the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2912
02:00:36.670 --> 02:00:41.670
<v Speaker 6>So I would never want to lose the </v>
<v Speaker 6>authenticity of Korea town or,</v>

2913
02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:45.010
<v Speaker 6>or ha like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

2914
02:00:45.110 --> 02:00:49.190
<v Speaker 6>or chinatown or even the exclusiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like going to a Korean restaurant might.</v>

2915
02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:51.790
<v Speaker 6>One of my buddies is Roy Choi.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't talked to him forever,</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's no big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Don't attach your whole life to this.</v>

3091
02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 6>It's just too hard to win at everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>in life.</v>

3092
02:07:45.490 --> 02:07:46.323
<v Speaker 6>You got to let some certain losses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to come your way and </v>

3093
02:07:49.151 --> 02:07:51.640
<v Speaker 6>you've got to regroup and you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 6>pick up the paces,</v>

3094
02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:53.440
<v Speaker 6>paces,</v>
<v Speaker 6>paces,</v>

3095
02:07:53.890 --> 02:07:54.723
<v Speaker 6>pick up the pieces and move on with life</v>
<v Speaker 6>for Christ or bigger fan of your </v>

3096
02:07:58.031 --> 02:08:00.250

<v Speaker 6>So Yeah,</v>

3100
02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:08.590
<v Speaker 6>David Choe found it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even think anybody named Roy has</v>

3101
02:08:08.591 --> 02:08:10.480
<v Speaker 6>been on the pod.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He came on with David Show.</v>

3103
02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:15.340
<v Speaker 6>He's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>David was been on a few times,</v>

3104
02:08:16.210 --> 02:08:17.980
<v Speaker 6>maybe came to one of the ice house </v>
<v Speaker 6>chronicles.</v>

3105
02:08:18.010 --> 02:08:19.090
<v Speaker 6>Was it an ice house?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chronical?</v>

3106
02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.830
<v Speaker 6>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going through this.</v>

3107
02:08:20.831 --> 02:08:23.470
<v Speaker 6>Was It on David's show?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did David show once.</v>

3108
02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:27.310
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was five 92 with David.</v>

3109
02:08:27.311 --> 02:08:30.330
<v Speaker 6>She was the one episode I wasn't here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Shit.</v>

3110
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:31.263
<v Speaker 6>Could have been the one episode,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but Jamie was on five 63 that can't be </v>

3111
02:08:34.001 --> 02:08:34.840
<v Speaker 6>that dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dumb,</v>

3112
02:08:34.841 --> 02:08:35.870
<v Speaker 6>dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dumb.</v>

3114
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:45.250
<v Speaker 6>could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's makes more sense.</v>

3115
02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:50.560
<v Speaker 6>Number five 92 I have horrible </v>
<v Speaker 6>podcasting and know it's done.</v>

3116
02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:54.430
<v Speaker 6>I have a hard time believing when we've </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually done 750 podcasts.</v>

3117
02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:59.460
<v Speaker 6>I was all five 90 to 769 69 I've done </v>
<v Speaker 6>769 podcasts.</v>

3118
02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:05.230
<v Speaker 6>Indeed preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's great man.</v>

3119

<v Speaker 6>Don't know.</v>

3120
02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:09.340
<v Speaker 6>I think I may have told you this one </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucked up.</v>

3123
02:09:13.241 --> 02:09:15.430
<v Speaker 6>done and only,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I only that I could not do it.</v>

3124
02:09:15.490 --> 02:09:18.100
<v Speaker 6>Begin it now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you did is you kind of took,</v>

3125
02:09:18.370 --> 02:09:19.203
<v Speaker 6>you kind of took the renaissance to </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself and you allowed people that </v>

3126
02:09:21.431 --> 02:09:22.264
<v Speaker 6>think differently than you to come to </v>
<v Speaker 6>you and talk to you and you got to kind </v>

3127
02:09:24.671 --> 02:09:27.730
<v Speaker 6>of like soak it in their information </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a sponge as a standup man.</v>

3128
02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:29.890
<v Speaker 6>That is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the fucking,</v>

3129
02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:30.753
<v Speaker 6>that's what we all should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Instead of just sitting around and </v>

3130
02:09:32.471 --> 02:09:33.304
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what does this guy think about </v>

<v Speaker 6>airplanes?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is it?</v>

3132
02:09:35.561 --> 02:09:36.394
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You really kind of broaden the spectrum </v>

3133
02:09:37.901 --> 02:09:38.734
<v Speaker 6>of what you want to talk about on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I remember hearing Chris rock say </v>

3134
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:44.223
<v Speaker 6>that he got invited to Cornell Wallace's</v>

<v Speaker 5>you'd think it was a fucking werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like one of the most powerful bites all </v>

<v Speaker 5>the mammals to so incredibly powerful </v>
<v Speaker 5>jaws and low hindquarters.</v>

3209

3210
02:13:17.421 --> 02:13:19.460
<v Speaker 5>once about this,</v>

02:13:19.550 --> 02:13:22.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember it was a guy or a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>third hand stoned version of this story?</v>

3213
02:13:27.081 --> 02:13:31.860
<v Speaker 5>But someone was training hyenas and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>rolled the ankle and had a limp</v>

3214
02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:34.800
<v Speaker 4>and as soon as the Hyena realized they </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a limp,</v>

3215
02:13:34.801 --> 02:13:35.634
<v Speaker 4>even though the a train this Hyena,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Hyena attacked him and it took a </v>

3216
02:13:38.431 --> 02:13:42.870
<v Speaker 4>chunk out of their calf just clamped </v>
<v Speaker 4>down and a bit them and they had a fight</v>

3217
02:13:42.871 --> 02:13:43.704
<v Speaker 4>it off and it couldn't help itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It saw her like limping and its </v>

<v Speaker 4>Hyena,</v>

3221
02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:59.820
<v Speaker 4>like when the shit hit the fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the Hyena saw limp.</v>

3222
02:14:00.090 --> 02:14:01.700
<v Speaker 4>It's nature.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you're going to fly across the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to take you 16 hours and then</v>

3316
02:18:12.971 --> 02:18:15.010
<v Speaker 5>you're going to kill something over </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and they get it.</v>

3317
02:18:15.011 --> 02:18:15.844
<v Speaker 5>Bring it back on a plane all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>California or the way to Michigan or </v>

3318
02:18:19.661 --> 02:18:21.150
<v Speaker 5>wherever you live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like</v>

3319
02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:24.173
<v Speaker 4>the only reason why I'd be going over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there is cause I enjoyed hunting and I </v>

3320
02:18:27.191 --> 02:18:28.510
<v Speaker 4>don't think there's anything wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3321
02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:33.430
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't crossed into that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not into it and I shouldn't even say</v>

3322
02:18:33.431 --> 02:18:36.760
<v Speaker 4>yet because I don't think I ever will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to shoot a lion.</v>

3323
02:18:37.090 --> 02:18:38.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to shoot anything I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to eat.</v>

3324
02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:40.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't,</v>

3325
02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:45.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a desire to like go and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot something that I would never bring</v>

3326
02:18:47.531 --> 02:18:49.180
<v Speaker 4>home and eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like those,</v>

3327
02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:51.850
<v Speaker 4>those things are sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't make any sense to me.</v>

3328
02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:54.040
<v Speaker 4>I get the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get how they need to happen.</v>

3329
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.903
<v Speaker 4>Like you know the Zimbabwe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is an article recently about the </v>

3330
02:18:56.381 --> 02:18:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Cecil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lion thing that's kind of fucked up.</v>

3331
02:18:58.540 --> 02:18:59.373
<v Speaker 4>They're going to call 200 lions in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Zimbabwe because hunters aren't going </v>

3332
02:19:02.591 --> 02:19:04.770
<v Speaker 4>there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have this too.</v>

3333
02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:07.990
<v Speaker 4>They have too many lions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So because they have too many lines,</v>

3334
02:19:07.991 --> 02:19:09.320
<v Speaker 4>the cows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the angeles,</v>

3335
02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:12.010
<v Speaker 4>the wild animals that they have roaming </v>
<v Speaker 4>around through the,</v>

3336
02:19:12.011 --> 02:19:14.530
<v Speaker 4>the fields,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently they're getting devastated.</v>

3337
02:19:14.770 --> 02:19:17.620
<v Speaker 4>So their solution is to go out and call </v>
<v Speaker 4>200 lines,</v>

3338
02:19:17.621 --> 02:19:18.454
<v Speaker 4>which means they're going to shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only is it not going to give them </v>

3339
02:19:20.501 --> 02:19:21.334
<v Speaker 4>any money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're going to have to pay money </v>

3340
02:19:22.661 --> 02:19:25.210
<v Speaker 4>to someone to go out there and find </v>
<v Speaker 4>these lines and shoot them.</v>

3341
02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 4>So it comes at a desk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A deficit</v>

3342
02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:32.900
<v Speaker 5>is Zimbabwe Park to call 200 lines site </v>
<v Speaker 5>lack of hunters.</v>

3343
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:36.470
<v Speaker 5>So since there's the look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

3344
02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:37.400
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3345
02:19:37.430 --> 02:19:39.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that you should go on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lion.</v>

3346
02:19:39.690 --> 02:19:40.640
<v Speaker 5>I would never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would never,</v>

3347
02:19:40.641 --> 02:19:43.010
<v Speaker 5>I have no interest in killing a lion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

3348
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:44.210
<v Speaker 5>No interest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

3349
02:19:44.211 --> 02:19:45.080
<v Speaker 5>however,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much,</v>

3350
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:47.660
<v Speaker 5>so like let's ballpark it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>$50,000</v>

3351
02:19:47.661 --> 02:19:50.060
<v Speaker 5>for each line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if they're going to do 200 lines,</v>

3352
02:19:50.061 --> 02:19:53.940
<v Speaker 5>it'd be what does that $10 million and </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is hurting my,</v>

3353
02:19:54.010 --> 02:19:55.310
<v Speaker 5>the lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3354
02:19:55.311 --> 02:19:57.260
<v Speaker 5>it's not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>$10 million.</v>

3355
02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:58.180
<v Speaker 5>It's a million,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3356
02:19:58.181 --> 02:20:00.410
<v Speaker 5>At $2 million to dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

3357
02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:01.970
<v Speaker 5>How many people is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many?</v>

3358
02:20:01.971 --> 02:20:04.550
<v Speaker 5>It was $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>and how many lions?</v>

3359
02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:09.050
<v Speaker 5>200 so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's $200 thousand lines.</v>

3360
02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:11.600
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a hundred hunters.</v>

3361
02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:17.200
<v Speaker 5>It would be our hundred thousand dollars</v>
<v Speaker 5>and $50 it's two.</v>

3362
02:20:21.250 --> 02:20:26.250
<v Speaker 5>It's 210 months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was Roy Choi is $10 million.</v>

3363
02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:31.040
<v Speaker 5>It's 200 lines at $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lion.</v>

3364
02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:33.830
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they missed out on all that money and</v>

3365
02:20:33.831 --> 02:20:37.520
<v Speaker 5>$10 million that could keep the pride </v>
<v Speaker 5>health.</v>

3366
02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:41.390
<v Speaker 5>How is it $10 million?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if it's $100,000</v>

3367
02:20:41.391 --> 02:20:46.391
<v Speaker 5>and there's a hundred lions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't that now $100,000?</v>

3368
02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:47.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's 10 million bucks.</v>

3369
02:20:48.580 --> 02:20:49.413
<v Speaker 5>Welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope they're drinking partying with </v>

3370
02:20:54.171 --> 02:20:55.220
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3371
02:20:55.221 --> 02:20:56.120
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are,</v>

3372
02:20:56.330 --> 02:21:00.440
<v Speaker 5>I just think like be the dumbest person </v>
<v Speaker 5>at math ever lived.</v>

3373
02:21:00.980 --> 02:21:02.360
<v Speaker 5>It's like sport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The top,</v>

3374
02:21:02.390 --> 02:21:04.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the top three doubles people at </v>
<v Speaker 5>math.</v>

3375
02:21:04.780 --> 02:21:06.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sports and math.</v>

3376
02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:07.760
<v Speaker 5>I just had a visual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's two.</v>

3377
02:21:07.761 --> 02:21:11.420
<v Speaker 5>This should be a sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe with his daughter doing math and her</v>

3378
02:21:11.421 --> 02:21:13.180
<v Speaker 5>going like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't fucking know her.</v>

3379
02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:15.320
<v Speaker 5>Just him just stopping to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to learn the number.</v>

3380
02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:17.473
<v Speaker 5>This is what I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what I learned when I was in </v>

3381
02:21:18.711 --> 02:21:23.711
<v Speaker 5>high school calculators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're always right and we're not going</v>

3382
02:21:24.141 --> 02:21:24.974
<v Speaker 5>to run out of batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what you'd do is you'd go to a </v>

3383
02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:30.050
<v Speaker 5>calculator and in my fucking brain I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

3384
02:21:30.051 --> 02:21:34.250
<v Speaker 5>Two numbers were not even remotely </v>
<v Speaker 5>important to me.</v>

3385
02:21:34.850 --> 02:21:37.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the quest for like to,</v>

3386
02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:41.060
<v Speaker 5>to calculate things and I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a nice little game.</v>

3387
02:21:41.061 --> 02:21:43.650
<v Speaker 5>It's a little puzzle for your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not interesting enough for you.</v>

3388
02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:45.770
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember when they told you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3389
02:21:45.771 --> 02:21:46.604
<v Speaker 5>and you'll just carry a calculator in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your pocket around all day or are you </v>

3390
02:21:48.201 --> 02:21:49.520
<v Speaker 5>going to learn how to do math and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3391
02:21:49.580 --> 02:21:54.580
<v Speaker 5>how can we calculate a stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how often does it come up?</v>

3392
02:21:57.471 --> 02:21:59.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean I knew how to like carry the </v>
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>

3393
02:21:59.961 --> 02:22:01.520
<v Speaker 5>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I worked at a register,</v>

3394
02:22:01.521 --> 02:22:02.354
<v Speaker 5>someone maybe a $27 and 50 cents due </v>
<v Speaker 5>back and change and knew how to dish </v>

3395
02:22:07.161 --> 02:22:10.470
<v Speaker 5>that I was fucked that one up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would always go see,</v>

3396
02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:11.333
<v Speaker 5>gave me 20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You paid $16 well here's four and then </v>

3397
02:22:14.121 --> 02:22:16.010
<v Speaker 5>here's the change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was given a dollar extra.</v>

3398
02:22:16.580 --> 02:22:19.500
<v Speaker 5>I never did the math of like three and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then or whatever.</v>

3399
02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 5>It's so funny mathematics or weird thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>because</v>

3400
02:22:26.430 --> 02:22:29.800
<v Speaker 4>it's a simple mathematics like </v>
<v Speaker 4>calculations like addition,</v>

3401
02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:31.830
<v Speaker 4>multiplication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>division stuff.</v>

3402
02:22:31.831 --> 02:22:32.664
<v Speaker 4>Do you have to do in your head that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody associates with math like Oh </v>

3403
02:22:35.611 --> 02:22:36.660
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so boring.</v>

3404
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:39.720
<v Speaker 4>But then you get to weird math like </v>
<v Speaker 4>math.</v>

3405
02:22:39.721 --> 02:22:40.554
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of solving equations about </v>
<v Speaker 4>like how big a black hole is trying to </v>

3406
02:22:47.071 --> 02:22:47.904
<v Speaker 4>figure out like gravity waves and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing a lot of that stuff with </v>

3407
02:22:52.171 --> 02:22:57.171
<v Speaker 4>mathematics and they're analyzing data </v>
<v Speaker 4>and measuring and calculating and trying</v>

3408
02:22:57.691 --> 02:23:01.830
<v Speaker 4>to figure out like the way the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe works.</v>

3409
02:23:02.460 --> 02:23:05.760
<v Speaker 4>And it's all with some strange math that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta go deep,</v>

3410
02:23:05.761 --> 02:23:06.181
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>

3411
02:23:06.181 --> 02:23:07.014
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep into get to that goodwill hunting </v>

3412
02:23:08.461 --> 02:23:09.294
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3413
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:10.343
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>

3414
02:23:10.970 --> 02:23:15.270
<v Speaker 6>oh someone make one video of just </v>
<v Speaker 6>explaining that kind of problem.</v>

3415
02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:16.830
<v Speaker 6>And what's the deal with remainders?</v>

3416
02:23:17.430 --> 02:23:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3417
02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:20.513
<v Speaker 3>Is saying clown possie right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's the deal with the remainder </v>

3418
02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:25.313
<v Speaker 3>magnets</v>

3419
02:23:29.820 --> 02:23:31.350
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a parallel universe,</v>

3420
02:23:31.351 --> 02:23:34.290
<v Speaker 6>everyone's drinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Doug Stan hope's house watching this.</v>

3421
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:38.040
<v Speaker 6>What a great fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is hilarious dude.</v>

3422
02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:39.690
<v Speaker 6>Fucking magnets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How they work,</v>

3423
02:23:39.691 --> 02:23:40.524
<v Speaker 6>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got a credit Brian Poo sane for </v>

3424
02:23:42.241 --> 02:23:43.074
<v Speaker 6>fucking in turning me on to that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said that somewhere and I heard him </v>

3425
02:23:45.421 --> 02:23:48.650
<v Speaker 6>say that and I fucking left dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You gotta say two days.</v>

3426
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:51.420
<v Speaker 6>Steve Agee is one of the funniest </v>
<v Speaker 6>motherfuckers alive.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Next thing.</v>

3428
02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:55.530
<v Speaker 6>Mct Oil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In your shakes.</v>

3429
02:23:55.950 --> 02:23:59.130

3431
02:24:01.770 --> 02:24:05.010
<v Speaker 6>I'm put a teaspoon in a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 6>tablespoons,</v>

02:24:05.011 --> 02:24:06.450
<v Speaker 6>you'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does it fine.</v>

3433
02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:10.860
<v Speaker 6>Do you find that it binds to you longer </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you binds to you?</v>

3434
02:24:10.861 --> 02:24:12.510
<v Speaker 6>So I do my shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my shakes,</v>

3435
02:24:12.511 --> 02:24:14.760
<v Speaker 6>our uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our um,</v>

3436
02:24:14.990 --> 02:24:15.823
<v Speaker 6>k like a little Dick Loaded Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a alma milk your protein and you pack </v>

3437
02:24:20.101 --> 02:24:20.934
<v Speaker 6>your Dick with a stick or when you get a</v>
<v Speaker 6>dick load usually happening around the </v>

3438
02:24:24.451 --> 02:24:27.900
<v Speaker 6>outside with baby powder load.</v>

3439
02:24:28.260 --> 02:24:30.390
<v Speaker 6>I feel it all the way to the top of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Kale.</v>

3440
02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:32.040
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I pushed it down a little bit.</v>

3441
02:24:32.041 --> 02:24:34.800
<v Speaker 6>I put some frozen fruit and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>usually blueberries or something.</v>

3442
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:38.370
<v Speaker 6>I do your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hemp protein.</v>

3443
02:24:38.490 --> 02:24:42.210
<v Speaker 6>And then I do mean green from trader </v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe's and that's my shake.</v>

3444
02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:43.073
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then I just heard you say somewhere </v>

3445
02:24:44.911 --> 02:24:48.240
<v Speaker 6>that mct oil helps bind the proteins </v>
<v Speaker 6>are,</v>

3446
02:24:48.241 --> 02:24:50.850
<v Speaker 6>helps bond the nutrients to your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to your fat cells.</v>

3447
02:24:51.230 --> 02:24:52.063
<v Speaker 6>And I believe Rob Wolf to told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who the fuck told me that one of those </v>

3448
02:24:55.801 --> 02:24:56.634
<v Speaker 6>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I was doing my shakes and I was </v>

3449
02:24:57.691 --> 02:25:01.680
<v Speaker 6>noticing shitting like a wolf within two</v>
<v Speaker 6>hours before,</v>

3450
02:25:01.681 --> 02:25:04.010
<v Speaker 6>before the MCT oil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I take the mic,</v>

3451
02:25:04.030 --> 02:25:06.240
<v Speaker 6>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking right out of his ass.</v>

3452
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:08.610
<v Speaker 6>Crazy like Howell's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why does it,</v>

3453
02:25:08.611 --> 02:25:10.200
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be quicker than a dog than</v>

3454
02:25:10.201 --> 02:25:11.970
<v Speaker 6>a house dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many anger involved?</v>

3455
02:25:12.060 --> 02:25:13.230
<v Speaker 6>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a wolf.</v>

3456
02:25:13.231 --> 02:25:15.720
<v Speaker 6>He's got predators.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got of pack.</v>

3457
02:25:15.721 --> 02:25:17.460
<v Speaker 6>He's got to hang with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking happens quick.</v>

3458
02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:21.030
<v Speaker 6>Why are you using Kale and mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Green is they're not the same shit.</v>

3459
02:25:21.090 --> 02:25:21.923
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would imagine on wolf would take an </v>

3460
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:23.823
<v Speaker 6>angry shit.</v>

3461
02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:25.823
<v Speaker 4>Teeth glared just just shitting out </v>
<v Speaker 4>quick because it doesn't want to feel </v>

3462
02:25:29.951 --> 02:25:30.784
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want some other wall to come </v>

3463
02:25:34.811 --> 02:25:36.970
<v Speaker 4>along and try to take the office spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

3464
02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:43.200
<v Speaker 4>What a Rudel society can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were a wolf and you just lived on</v>

3465
02:25:45.101 --> 02:25:45.934
<v Speaker 4>a mountain and all you did is run around</v>
<v Speaker 4>and bite shit chase things and you're </v>

3466
02:25:50.041 --> 02:25:53.710
<v Speaker 4>your number one instinct is chase things</v>
<v Speaker 4>and chop at their legs.</v>

3467
02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:57.280
<v Speaker 4>That's what they like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to run up behind cows,</v>

3468
02:25:57.281 --> 02:25:59.320
<v Speaker 4>run up behind elk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3469
02:25:59.321 --> 02:26:01.630
<v Speaker 4>You can get deer and they paint their </v>
<v Speaker 4>legs,</v>

3470
02:26:02.090 --> 02:26:03.280
<v Speaker 4>their legs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

3471
02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:04.133
<v Speaker 4>they'll chase them and they bite their </v>
<v Speaker 4>legs again and they'll take down a big </v>

3472
02:26:06.851 --> 02:26:09.040
<v Speaker 4>ass animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That way they'll take down a mousse.</v>

3473
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:14.110
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like social justice warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yes.</v>

3474
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:16.023
<v Speaker 4>Are you upset?</v>

3475
02:26:16.410 --> 02:26:17.970
<v Speaker 6>It was social justice warriors?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3476
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:19.700
<v Speaker 6>hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's going on?</v>

3477
02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:20.593
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when I see someone like Kurt </v>

3478
02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:22.970
<v Speaker 6>Metzger who I find to be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>hilarious,</v>

3479
02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:25.190
<v Speaker 6>when I watched people attack him based </v>
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>

3480
02:26:25.460 --> 02:26:26.293
<v Speaker 6>based on some list of fucking demands,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have like terrorists as opposed to </v>

3481
02:26:31.250 --> 02:26:32.520
<v Speaker 6>the demands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What did they do this,</v>

3482
02:26:32.570 --> 02:26:33.980
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a broad stroke.</v>

3483
02:26:33.981 --> 02:26:38.170
<v Speaker 6>I know that Kurt almost lost his job on </v>
<v Speaker 6>amy show by amy saved him.</v>

3484
02:26:38.210 --> 02:26:41.360
<v Speaker 6>Amy stood up for him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but because he did some thing,</v>

3485
02:26:41.370 --> 02:26:42.740
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kurt didn't want to talk about it,</v>

3486
02:26:42.741 --> 02:26:44.510
<v Speaker 6>so I'm not gonna talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but okay.</v>

3487
02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:45.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe he did talk about it.</v>

3488
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.570
<v Speaker 6>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure curse on the show.</v>

3489
02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:51.440
<v Speaker 6>Jamie mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

3490
02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:52.790
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know man.</v>

3491
02:26:52.791 --> 02:26:57.230
<v Speaker 6>I just find,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just find that shit bothersome and I,</v>

3492
02:26:57.231 --> 02:26:59.420
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it looks like wolves just trying to bite</v>

3493
02:26:59.421 --> 02:27:01.820
<v Speaker 6>until someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>until some corporation goes,</v>

3494
02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.430
<v Speaker 6>he's been bitten the doll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's fucking weak.</v>

3495
02:27:04.431 --> 02:27:05.264
<v Speaker 6>Let's eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is what I think we have to really </v>

3496
02:27:06.111 --> 02:27:06.300
<v Speaker 6>be</v>

3497
02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:09.530
<v Speaker 4>careful about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to really be careful about an I,</v>

3498
02:27:09.531 --> 02:27:10.364
<v Speaker 4>I mean us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean as humans we got to really be </v>

3499
02:27:13.501 --> 02:27:18.000
<v Speaker 4>careful about trying to get other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>to think and behave the way we do.</v>

3500
02:27:18.810 --> 02:27:22.260
<v Speaker 4>Like once you establish like sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3501
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:27.060
<v Speaker 4>a guideline of how we all want to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>treated with each other,</v>

3502
02:27:28.530 --> 02:27:29.363
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you believe one thing and I </v>

3503
02:27:32.251 --> 02:27:35.250
<v Speaker 4>believe something that's different than </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you believe,</v>

3504
02:27:36.330 --> 02:27:37.163
<v Speaker 4>it can become a real problem if I </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided to go after you for your belief </v>

3505
02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:45.390
<v Speaker 4>and attack you for your belief and try </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get you fired for your belief.</v>

3506
02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:46.613
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3507
02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:49.110
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3508
02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:51.360
<v Speaker 4>and especially when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like standup,</v>

3509
02:27:51.390 --> 02:27:56.250
<v Speaker 4>which requires a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>offensive thinking they requires,</v>

3510
02:27:56.251 --> 02:27:58.050
<v Speaker 4>if you want stand up that I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoy.</v>

3511
02:27:58.350 --> 02:28:00.630
<v Speaker 4>You got to take some risks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to be offensive.</v>

3512
02:28:00.650 --> 02:28:01.483
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be offensive and an honest </v>

3513
02:28:02.311 --> 02:28:03.144
<v Speaker 4>way that is undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in this era because we're </v>

3514
02:28:06.271 --> 02:28:07.104
<v Speaker 4>living in this era where we're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to pretend that certain differences </v>

3515
02:28:09.301 --> 02:28:11.820
<v Speaker 4>don't exist and diversities the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>important thing.</v>

3516
02:28:11.821 --> 02:28:12.654
<v Speaker 4>But there's some hilarious differences </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's one of the reasons why we like </v>

3517
02:28:15.511 --> 02:28:19.710
<v Speaker 4>black comics because black comics can </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit all over white people and it's just</v>

3518
02:28:19.711 --> 02:28:22.250
<v Speaker 4>the same kind of funny racial</v>

3519
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:23.083
<v Speaker 5>humor and it's totally acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 5>because white people been Dick's to </v>

3520
02:28:26.571 --> 02:28:28.910
<v Speaker 5>black people for so long that it's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

3521
02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:30.680
<v Speaker 5>it's just in the guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot.</v>

3522
02:28:30.681 --> 02:28:35.060
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you go back to old like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Murphy or Richard Pryor bits,</v>

3523
02:28:35.390 --> 02:28:37.880
<v Speaker 5>like they were great and white people </v>
<v Speaker 5>like them,</v>

3524
02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:38.990
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3525
02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:43.460
<v Speaker 5>like it relieved a little tension to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have him shit on white people,</v>

3526
02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:44.410
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3527
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:46.790
<v Speaker 5>I like Katt Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still like Katt Williams.</v>

3528
02:28:46.791 --> 02:28:47.541
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3529
02:28:47.541 --> 02:28:48.374
<v Speaker 5>I want to tour with their guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy is so the one I love when he </v>

3530
02:28:51.111 --> 02:28:53.540
<v Speaker 5>gets into a preachy mode,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do I like what he's sweating in?</v>

3531
02:28:53.541 --> 02:28:55.430
<v Speaker 5>His hair's fucked up and his shirts </v>
<v Speaker 5>soaking.</v>

3532
02:28:55.940 --> 02:28:56.773
<v Speaker 5>I love that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's wild and you know he gets crazy </v>

3533
02:28:59.631 --> 02:29:01.820
<v Speaker 5>sometimes and things go off the rails </v>
<v Speaker 5>yesterday.</v>

3534
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:03.860
<v Speaker 5>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did he go off the rails yesterday?</v>

3535
02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:05.540
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He punched some guy.</v>

3536
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:07.910
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that guy was talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3537
02:29:07.911 --> 02:29:09.670
<v Speaker 5>I got your back cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>

3538
02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:12.650

<v Speaker 5>Funny as fuck man.</v>

3539
02:29:12.651 --> 02:29:16.060

<v Speaker 6>times.</v>

3603
02:32:07.330 --> 02:32:08.163
<v Speaker 6>He could still do giant player.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's one of the best comics in the </v>

3604

<v Speaker 6>Can you google that?</v>

3614
02:32:36.581 --> 02:32:41.581
<v Speaker 6>Jamie sequoia was there like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's man,</v>

3615
02:32:42.370 --> 02:32:43.600
<v Speaker 6>he's a fascinating guy.</v>

3616
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:46.820
<v Speaker 4>When his standup is on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a sensational and who would,</v>

3617
02:32:46.821 --> 02:32:49.990
<v Speaker 4>he's sweating and pacing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just sensational.</v>

3618
02:32:50.180 --> 02:32:54.020
<v Speaker 6>What my thing was is that I worked with </v>
<v Speaker 6>my good friends with red grant,</v>

3619
02:32:54.290 --> 02:32:57.020
<v Speaker 6>which is one of his openers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3620
02:32:57.080 --> 02:32:58.850
<v Speaker 6>he always paid the comics he worked </v>
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

3621
02:32:58.851 --> 02:33:00.230
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was treated them nice.</v>

3622
02:33:00.470 --> 02:33:01.670
<v Speaker 6>That's so fucking important.</v>

3623
02:33:01.850 --> 02:33:02.683
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said something that I remember </v>

3624
02:33:03.841 --> 02:33:04.674
<v Speaker 4>reading or watching a video rather and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was talking and it made total sense </v>

3625
02:33:08.491 --> 02:33:10.650
<v Speaker 4>and I didn't really consider it that </v>
<v Speaker 4>much before.</v>

3626
02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:13.500
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never eat before I go onstage.</v>

3627
02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:16.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to have any food digesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>in my stomach.</v>

3628
02:33:17.010 --> 02:33:18.120
<v Speaker 4>And then I thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3629
02:33:18.121 --> 02:33:18.451
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3630
02:33:18.451 --> 02:33:19.284
<v Speaker 4>what is it like the like it could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like seven o'clock and the show's at </v>

3631
02:33:21.571 --> 02:33:23.290
<v Speaker 4>eight like I got to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta.</v>

3632
02:33:23.291 --> 02:33:24.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta eat.</v>

3633
02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:26.550
<v Speaker 4>Do you really like most of the time you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like,</v>

3634
02:33:26.551 --> 02:33:27.384
<v Speaker 4>we're so spoiled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like most of the time you can go like a </v>

3635
02:33:29.221 --> 02:33:32.190
<v Speaker 4>long time without actually eating and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be fine.</v>

3636
02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:34.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like you have a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>craving,</v>

3637
02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:35.393
<v Speaker 4>but it's almost too much for us to lock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got Actors on stage and he was saying </v>

3638
02:33:38.491 --> 02:33:40.680
<v Speaker 4>that like eating before you go onstage.</v>

3639
02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:41.543
<v Speaker 4>It slows you down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it slows down your thinking because you </v>

3640
02:33:42.691 --> 02:33:44.310
<v Speaker 4>body needs the energy to digest that </v>
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>

3641
02:33:44.311 --> 02:33:45.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course it does.</v>

3642
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:46.583
<v Speaker 4>Of course it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember that this is several </v>

3643
02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:50.880
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember as soon as I,</v>

3644
02:33:50.970 --> 02:33:52.380
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saw that video,</v>

3645
02:33:52.381 --> 02:33:53.214
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is how I'm going to think about </v>

3646
02:33:54.151 --> 02:33:56.310
<v Speaker 4>that from now on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because before I was just thinking about</v>

3647
02:33:56.311 --> 02:33:59.310
<v Speaker 4>the moment itself when like I could do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it even though I just ate.</v>

3648
02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:02.460
<v Speaker 4>I could be fine and you can if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat too much,</v>

3649
02:34:03.390 --> 02:34:06.630
<v Speaker 4>but eating right before you go onstage </v>
<v Speaker 4>is probably about it.</v>

3650
02:34:06.631 --> 02:34:06.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3651
02:34:06.970 --> 02:34:07.990
<v Speaker 6>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3652
02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:10.660
<v Speaker 6>when I used to work with Jay Moore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was a buddy hackett quote.</v>

3653
02:34:10.930 --> 02:34:11.763

3654
02:34:14.111 --> 02:34:15.500
<v Speaker 6>camera on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 6>On.</v>

3655
02:34:15.501 --> 02:34:18.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He worked with deb squad dipset tip set.</v>

3656
02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:24.390
<v Speaker 6>You can't say dip squad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude was that ready?</v>

3657
02:34:24.391 --> 02:34:29.391
<v Speaker 6>This dipset dipset are racist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what people love to do?</v>

3658
02:34:30.050 --> 02:34:30.883
<v Speaker 6>They love to call you a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it takes any fucking focus off of </v>

3659
02:34:33.251 --> 02:34:35.320
<v Speaker 6>their potential racism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a big one.</v>

3660
02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:40.210
<v Speaker 6>I definitely couldn't be a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what you are did dip,</v>

3661
02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:43.360
<v Speaker 6>dip squad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stip set.</v>

3662
02:34:43.390 --> 02:34:44.223
<v Speaker 6>You don't even know what it's sad is he </v>
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't be commenting on their </v>

3663
02:34:46.181 --> 02:34:50.170
<v Speaker 6>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a very big difference from being</v>

3664
02:34:50.171 --> 02:34:53.020
<v Speaker 6>called racist and doing something racist</v>
<v Speaker 6>on accident.</v>

3665
02:34:53.410 --> 02:34:54.243
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The both.</v>

3666
02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:55.780
<v Speaker 6>Both are possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I did,</v>

3667
02:34:55.781 --> 02:34:56.561
<v Speaker 6>I did something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3668
02:34:56.561 --> 02:34:58.530
<v Speaker 6>but I mean like meaning like I've been </v>
<v Speaker 6>called like I've been,</v>

3669
02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:00.720
<v Speaker 6>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've had whatever person go,</v>

3670
02:35:00.721 --> 02:35:02.350
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that jokes racist and you're like,</v>

3671
02:35:02.351 --> 02:35:04.360
<v Speaker 6>it's not racist at all at all.</v>

3672
02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:06.910
<v Speaker 6>There's no racism in that joke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3673
02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:07.913
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I've done something racist on </v>

3674
02:35:08.891 --> 02:35:09.724
<v Speaker 6>accident and then realizing you've done </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that is in fact hurtful is </v>

3675
02:35:13.511 --> 02:35:15.010
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>holy fuck,</v>

3676
02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:18.430
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're almost taking the real meaning of</v>

3677
02:35:18.431 --> 02:35:20.400
<v Speaker 6>the word away from the word.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3678
02:35:20.410 --> 02:35:21.430
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>does that make sense?</v>

3679
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:23.740
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3680
02:35:23.741 --> 02:35:26.230
<v Speaker 6>you can't change the definition.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what race has immense,</v>

3681
02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:28.250
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3682
02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:29.860
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think people lighten the load.</v>

3683
02:35:29.861 --> 02:35:31.330
<v Speaker 6>Like I though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you the two examples.</v>

3684
02:35:31.331 --> 02:35:32.164
<v Speaker 6>I used to have a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's Hackey I'm gonna just say it </v>

3685
02:35:33.461 --> 02:35:34.294
<v Speaker 6>real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or you say you want to know something </v>

3686
02:35:35.711 --> 02:35:37.240
<v Speaker 6>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was where my flaw,</v>

3687
02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:38.193
<v Speaker 6>because people would hear that and </v>
<v Speaker 6>assume I was about to say something </v>

3688
02:35:39.491 --> 02:35:40.210
<v Speaker 6>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3689
02:35:40.210 --> 02:35:42.460
<v Speaker 6>When in fact I'm about to say a joke and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

3690
02:35:42.610 --> 02:35:44.410
<v Speaker 6>they don't make baby powder for black </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

3691
02:35:44.650 --> 02:35:45.820
<v Speaker 6>Like how racist is that?</v>

3692
02:35:45.850 --> 02:35:46.683
<v Speaker 6>They should make eight different colors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Call it magic Johnson and Johnson's </v>

3693
02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:51.190
<v Speaker 6>stupid joke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Black woman got upset,</v>

3694
02:35:51.191 --> 02:35:53.500
<v Speaker 6>stormed out of the date and funny bone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Literally,</v>

3695
02:35:53.501 --> 02:35:54.334
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to protest now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did something racist one time where I </v>

3696
02:35:57.071 --> 02:35:59.620
<v Speaker 6>walked into a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't mean to do it.</v>

3697
02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:01.300
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a big fan of opiate anthony.</v>

3698
02:36:01.690 --> 02:36:04.210
<v Speaker 6>I think this will attest to anyone </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's listened to opiate anthony.</v>

3699
02:36:04.900 --> 02:36:05.733
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the sayings they used to say on </v>

3700
02:36:07.781 --> 02:36:09.490
<v Speaker 6>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hello boys.</v>

3701
02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:11.950
<v Speaker 6>Like it was like a saying from the show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3702
02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:17.320
<v Speaker 6>and I rolled into a all black club in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the eighth,</v>

3703
02:36:17.321 --> 02:36:18.850
<v Speaker 6>I think the eighth ward,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's called bullets.</v>

3704
02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:21.970
<v Speaker 6>And I walked into the bathroom was all </v>
<v Speaker 6>black men and I was a little buzz.</v>

3705
02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.320
<v Speaker 6>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I just wrote it was,</v>

3706
02:36:23.321 --> 02:36:26.230
<v Speaker 6>but it was all old black men.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was all old black man.</v>

3707
02:36:26.350 --> 02:36:27.400
<v Speaker 6>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

3708
02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:29.530
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I just walked in one hello boys.</v>

3709
02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:33.690
<v Speaker 6>But now you gotta understand my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

3710
02:36:33.730 --> 02:36:34.563
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my usage of that is based on Opie and </v>

3711
02:36:36.131 --> 02:36:36.964
<v Speaker 6>Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was just to show that they had </v>

3712
02:36:38.621 --> 02:36:41.180
<v Speaker 6>that line in their opening trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3713
02:36:41.530 --> 02:36:43.120
<v Speaker 6>And so I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I definitely didn't,</v>

3714
02:36:43.150 --> 02:36:46.750
<v Speaker 6>I would never my ever in a million years</v>
<v Speaker 6>ever do something like that.</v>

3715
02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:50.350
<v Speaker 6>However black man grabbed me and pulled </v>
<v Speaker 6>me aside.</v>

3716
02:36:50.351 --> 02:36:51.184
<v Speaker 6>So you don't say that word in here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I realized I did something racist </v>

3717
02:36:53.591 --> 02:36:56.230
<v Speaker 6>and I went that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that feeling,</v>

3718
02:36:56.231 --> 02:36:57.970
<v Speaker 6>that heartfelt feeling I had where I </v>
<v Speaker 6>went,</v>

3719
02:36:58.090 --> 02:37:01.060
<v Speaker 6>I am like literally almost in tears.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I am so sorry.</v>

3720
02:37:01.061 --> 02:37:02.500
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea what that brings up in </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

3721
02:37:02.501 --> 02:37:05.290
<v Speaker 6>And I didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I had no intention.</v>

3722
02:37:05.390 --> 02:37:08.380
<v Speaker 6>And that is the two differences where I </v>
<v Speaker 6>go,</v>

3723
02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:12.110
<v Speaker 6>don't don't throw that word around </v>
<v Speaker 6>unless you're,</v>

3724
02:37:12.180 --> 02:37:14.290
<v Speaker 6>unless you're ready to throw the glass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Rock in the glass house,</v>

3725
02:37:14.291 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 6>that's a word you could easily throw</v>

3726
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:20.630
<v Speaker 4>around in a room full of white guys and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were thinking in a non racist way.</v>

3727
02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:21.673
<v Speaker 4>Just let it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You let it out because you would let it </v>

3728
02:37:23.421 --> 02:37:25.370
<v Speaker 4>out all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

3729
02:37:25.430 --> 02:37:27.980
<v Speaker 4>it's a perfect way to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's accidental racism.</v>

3730
02:37:28.340 --> 02:37:29.173
<v Speaker 4>100% I think we've got a real problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>with people looking for stuff that's </v>

3731
02:37:32.241 --> 02:37:33.410
<v Speaker 4>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't though.</v>

3732
02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:36.110
<v Speaker 4>You know like tea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a thing like that.</v>

3733
02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:39.440
<v Speaker 4>You would have to find out who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like who is this guy?</v>

3734
02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:42.290
<v Speaker 4>Why is Bert Kreischer Guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3735
02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:45.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like has he done stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this funny for him?</v>

3736
02:37:45.231 --> 02:37:47.570
<v Speaker 4>Does he think it's a boundary pusher </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy?</v>

3737
02:37:47.850 --> 02:37:50.990
<v Speaker 4>We want to go into a room full of black </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in say some racist is just like,</v>

3738
02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:53.450
<v Speaker 4>like Ari when he was doing the amazing </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist.</v>

3739
02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:54.280
<v Speaker 4>Remember that</v>

3740
02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:55.113
<v Speaker 6>dude?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the reason I know Ari is so </v>

3741
02:37:57.431 --> 02:37:59.380
<v Speaker 6>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the reason I know Ari.</v>

3742
02:37:59.381 --> 02:38:00.850
<v Speaker 6>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a sketch.</v>

3743
02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:01.713
<v Speaker 6>You know that and I look and I've showed</v>
<v Speaker 6>it to people since maybe times have </v>

3744
02:38:05.231 --> 02:38:10.231
<v Speaker 6>changed from when I first saw that to </v>
<v Speaker 6>went now when I saw the one Negro one.</v>

3745
02:38:12.220 --> 02:38:13.320

<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you what.</v>

3747

<v Speaker 6>was sitting up in my house,</v>

3748
02:38:18.450 --> 02:38:19.283
<v Speaker 6>my house having a bottle of Jameson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was working with Jameson at the time </v>

3749
02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:25.390
<v Speaker 6>and I saw it and I had seen already </v>
<v Speaker 6>before and I giggled.</v>

<v Speaker 6>funny.</v>

3752
02:38:30.161 --> 02:38:31.930
<v Speaker 6>If it's not funny now and people hate </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

3755
02:38:37.270 --> 02:38:39.970
<v Speaker 6>It's definitely fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's still kind of funny.</v>

<v Speaker 4>if they did know you and they knew you </v>

3767
02:39:13.581 --> 02:39:15.830
<v Speaker 4>said the wrong words and you knew they </v>
<v Speaker 4>knew that,</v>

3768
02:39:15.860 --> 02:39:16.693
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy genuinely would have said this </v>

3769
02:39:18.021 --> 02:39:21.320
<v Speaker 4>to a bunch of white people and he just </v>
<v Speaker 4>slip of the tongue and it just was,</v>

3770
02:39:21.470 --> 02:39:22.303
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ben Opie and Anthony and it was in my </v>

3771
02:39:23.211 --> 02:39:25.700
<v Speaker 6>fucking repertoire of words to say when </v>
<v Speaker 6>I walk in a room.</v>

3772
02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:26.653
<v Speaker 4>But there's a giant difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and someone who walks in that </v>

3773
02:39:29.451 --> 02:39:33.740
<v Speaker 4>bathroom with a decided intention to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make those black men uncomfortable.</v>

3774
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:35.380
<v Speaker 4>There's sharks in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3775
02:39:35.390 --> 02:39:37.070
<v Speaker 4>And he says difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

3776
02:39:37.250 --> 02:39:38.083
<v Speaker 4>however,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no distinction between what we </v>

3777
02:39:40.011 --> 02:39:42.710
<v Speaker 4>did to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if they're like you.</v>

3778
02:39:42.711 --> 02:39:44.270
<v Speaker 4>They've had a couple of drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3779
02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:45.980
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were all at a bar.</v>

3780
02:39:45.981 --> 02:39:46.814
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe they could be a little tipsy </v>

3781
02:39:48.051 --> 02:39:49.070
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3782
02:39:49.071 --> 02:39:49.904
<v Speaker 4>sometimes people are a little drunk and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they misinterpret things where they're </v>

3783
02:39:51.981 --> 02:39:54.440
<v Speaker 4>quick to a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to quick to look for an altercation.</v>

3784
02:39:54.441 --> 02:39:55.830
<v Speaker 4>That could be a problem too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3785
02:39:56.430 --> 02:39:59.670
<v Speaker 6>name of the bar was bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was there to see kermit ruffins.</v>

3786
02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:03.650
<v Speaker 6>I was hanging out with him and his car </v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

3787
02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:06.150
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just thinking,</v>

3788
02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:07.350
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go ahead.</v>

3789
02:40:07.350 --> 02:40:07.961
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

3790
02:40:07.961 --> 02:40:09.420
<v Speaker 6>and I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I bought that,</v>

3791
02:40:10.150 --> 02:40:13.380
<v Speaker 4>that is in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I remember,</v>

3792
02:40:13.381 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 4>I remember just the</v>

3793
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:16.080
<v Speaker 5>guy pulling me aside and literally </v>
<v Speaker 5>grabbing me,</v>

3794
02:40:16.081 --> 02:40:17.130
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not be a nice about it,</v>

3795
02:40:17.131 --> 02:40:19.350
<v Speaker 5>but grabbing me so you don't say those </v>
<v Speaker 5>words here.</v>

3796
02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:20.453
<v Speaker 5>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

3797
02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:23.640
<v Speaker 5>Like I didn't grow up racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't like to say,</v>

3798
02:40:23.641 --> 02:40:25.320
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's a trunk mistake?</v>

3799
02:40:25.321 --> 02:40:26.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did drop any</v>

3800
02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:27.173
<v Speaker 2>exact thing when I moved here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the first six months I was at </v>

3801
02:40:29.281 --> 02:40:32.670
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came up to a guy that I knew and I go,</v>

3802
02:40:32.671 --> 02:40:34.830
<v Speaker 2>hey boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

3803
02:40:34.831 --> 02:40:36.390
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck she is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

3804
02:40:36.391 --> 02:40:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard of the boy thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know where he got it from.</v>

3805
02:40:39.900 --> 02:40:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Boy in Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3806
02:40:41.521 --> 02:40:42.354
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just didn't have racism in my </v>

3807
02:40:44.491 --> 02:40:45.324
<v Speaker 2>family or anything really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I never read them was raised as some </v>

3808
02:40:48.031 --> 02:40:49.700
<v Speaker 2>sort of a preserve religion.</v>

3809
02:40:49.980 --> 02:40:52.260
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing that the fence was up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was like,</v>

3810
02:40:52.261 --> 02:40:53.640
<v Speaker 5>it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>

3811
02:40:53.641 --> 02:40:55.770
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was it.</v>

3812
02:40:55.771 --> 02:40:56.604
<v Speaker 5>Joaquin Phoenix that had that fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the m nine Shama Lama Ding Dong </v>

3813
02:41:01.260 --> 02:41:04.710
<v Speaker 5>movie about those people don't want the </v>
<v Speaker 5>village,</v>

3814
02:41:04.711 --> 02:41:05.544
<v Speaker 5>the village.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there was planes that were flying </v>

3815
02:41:07.231 --> 02:41:08.760
<v Speaker 5>overhead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know about the planes.</v>

3816
02:41:09.090 --> 02:41:09.923
<v Speaker 5>Remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those movies where you at </v>

3817
02:41:11.521 --> 02:41:12.354
<v Speaker 5>the end of the movie like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to find him and I'm going to </v>

3818
02:41:13.951 --> 02:41:14.784
<v Speaker 5>fucking choke him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to find you and I'm going to </v>

3819
02:41:18.321 --> 02:41:20.310
<v Speaker 5>choke you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3820
02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:21.451
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3821
02:41:21.451 --> 02:41:22.284
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is not a movie idea to do that son </v>

3822
02:41:25.651 --> 02:41:28.410
<v Speaker 5>of a bitch who let you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who let you spend so much money on this.</v>

3823
02:41:28.411 --> 02:41:32.190
<v Speaker 5>You fucker New Hampshire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what?</v>

3824
02:41:32.191 --> 02:41:34.170
<v Speaker 5>No planes fly over them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get the fight.</v>

3825
02:41:34.171 --> 02:41:36.480
<v Speaker 5>I've ever seen a plane the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

3826
02:41:36.490 --> 02:41:41.490
<v Speaker 5>They just made it to the road in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They walked to the road in a day.</v>

3827
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:47.850
<v Speaker 5>It's some fucking hippies aren't going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to find you decades ago.</v>

3828
02:41:47.851 --> 02:41:48.684
<v Speaker 5>Shut your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one day and one day they're on the </v>

3829
02:41:52.251 --> 02:41:55.320
<v Speaker 5>road the same day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not far.</v>

3830
02:41:55.321 --> 02:41:59.160
<v Speaker 5>How fast are you walk in there in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cherokee within 24 hours.</v>

3831
02:41:59.190 --> 02:42:02.460
<v Speaker 5>So you're telling me you didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 5>hear harleys when Harley's ride down the</v>

3832
02:42:02.461 --> 02:42:05.850
<v Speaker 5>road do you didn't hear that the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of here?</v>

3833
02:42:06.690 --> 02:42:07.523
<v Speaker 5>This whole face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's sort of what my compound to be </v>

3834
02:42:09.211 --> 02:42:11.100
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Standups,</v>

3835
02:42:11.130 --> 02:42:14.160
<v Speaker 5>compounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like that guy knocked it out of the</v>

3836
02:42:14.161 --> 02:42:16.620
<v Speaker 5>park with his first movie though the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sixth sense,</v>

3837
02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:19.850
<v Speaker 5>which was another like twist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think those two,</v>

3838
02:42:19.890 --> 02:42:22.700
<v Speaker 5>the twist was so good at that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might've ruined him.</v>

3839
02:42:23.010 --> 02:42:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Ariana are talking about storytelling </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

3840
02:42:24.961 --> 02:42:28.140
<v Speaker 5>The best stories you ever list to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when did you realize he was dead?</v>

3841
02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:29.430
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>spoiler alert.</v>

3842
02:42:29.730 --> 02:42:30.990
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you son of a bitch.</v>

3843
02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:34.860
<v Speaker 5>I never figured it out until now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean he was dead?</v>

3844
02:42:35.130 --> 02:42:36.960
<v Speaker 5>The kid was dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3845
02:42:36.990 --> 02:42:38.520
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy was dead.</v>

3846
02:42:38.521 --> 02:42:41.400
<v Speaker 5>Who is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait.</v>

3847
02:42:41.470 --> 02:42:43.370
<v Speaker 5>When did you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when did you figure it out?</v>

3848
02:42:43.390 --> 02:42:46.800
<v Speaker 5>He said it like when the kid and him </v>
<v Speaker 5>were having the conversation towards the</v>

3849
02:42:46.801 --> 02:42:47.634
<v Speaker 5>end of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was getting suspicious somewhere in </v>

3850
02:42:49.801 --> 02:42:50.311
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3851
02:42:50.311 --> 02:42:51.144
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is like 2004 when did that movie </v>

3852
02:42:54.331 --> 02:42:55.111
<v Speaker 5>come out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

3853
02:42:55.111 --> 02:42:58.800
<v Speaker 5>it was not 2004 was probably in 1998.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] 99.</v>

3854
02:42:59.050 --> 02:43:01.400
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was it?</v>

3855
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:03.390
<v Speaker 5>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roy Choi was on this show.</v>

3856
02:43:04.530 --> 02:43:05.780
<v Speaker 5>Careful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3857
02:43:05.790 --> 02:43:07.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't remember.</v>

3858
02:43:07.501 --> 02:43:08.334
<v Speaker 5>I think it was towards the end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they were having a conversation </v>

3859
02:43:10.081 --> 02:43:12.070
<v Speaker 5>together and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was trying to figure out what</v>

3860
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:15.630
<v Speaker 6>the fuck was going on before that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I can tell you in the moment,</v>

3861
02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:19.180
<v Speaker 6>part of the moment of the movie when he </v>
<v Speaker 6>finds blood on his shirt,</v>

3862
02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:20.343
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what I realized because I was </v>

3863
02:43:22.030 --> 02:43:23.800
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when he grabbed the red door handle,</v>

3864
02:43:23.801 --> 02:43:24.880
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3865
02:43:24.881 --> 02:43:27.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what that fucking means.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why did she lock him out of that room?</v>

3866
02:43:28.210 --> 02:43:30.760
<v Speaker 6>Is he not have an office anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he need to get an office.</v>

3867
02:43:32.020 --> 02:43:33.490
<v Speaker 6>That was a great movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3868
02:43:34.050 --> 02:43:37.940
<v Speaker 6>But then the twist was so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so much of a part of the movie that the,</v>

3869
02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:40.300
<v Speaker 6>in his movies you would wait for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>twist.</v>

3870
02:43:40.830 --> 02:43:41.663
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he tried to figure out when is this </v>

3871
02:43:42.281 --> 02:43:43.780
<v Speaker 6>twist coming?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's better?</v>

3872
02:43:44.050 --> 02:43:45.610
<v Speaker 6>That or usual suspects.</v>

3873
02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3874
02:43:47.910 --> 02:43:50.730
<v Speaker 6>I think usual suspects is the goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 6>classic.</v>

3875
02:43:50.731 --> 02:43:52.410
<v Speaker 6>It's best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a classic.</v>

3876
02:43:52.411 --> 02:43:53.244
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's,</v>

3877
02:43:53.310 --> 02:43:58.200
<v Speaker 6>which one's better to six sense or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>single slit in the reveal though the two</v>

3878
02:43:58.201 --> 02:44:00.030
<v Speaker 6>best reveals in movie probably,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3879
02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:01.710
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the reveal.</v>

3880
02:44:01.711 --> 02:44:03.290
<v Speaker 6>I thought you mentioned it in the movie </v>
<v Speaker 6>itself.</v>

3881
02:44:03.330 --> 02:44:04.300
<v Speaker 6>In the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the butt.</v>

3882
02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:06.930
<v Speaker 6>But then the real voc cents is better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3883
02:44:06.931 --> 02:44:07.764
<v Speaker 6>the movie is the reveal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The keyser soze a reveal is like a </v>

3884
02:44:11.281 --> 02:44:12.470
<v Speaker 6>little,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what?</v>

3885
02:44:12.750 --> 02:44:14.280
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden he's on limping.</v>

3886
02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3887
02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.340
<v Speaker 6>What about in the final reveal?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's walks away.</v>

3888
02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:19.320
<v Speaker 6>That was the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it was worst.</v>

3889
02:44:19.370 --> 02:44:20.250
<v Speaker 6>I di,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3890
02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:21.113
<v Speaker 6>I did not like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and people get mad at me for saying </v>

3891
02:44:22.171 --> 02:44:23.610
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't even understand fight club,</v>

3892
02:44:23.611 --> 02:44:24.900
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't understand.</v>

3893
02:44:25.020 --> 02:44:27.150
<v Speaker 6>You understand what it stands for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3894
02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:28.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What about memento?</v>

3895
02:44:30.770 --> 02:44:33.170
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was good.</v>

3896
02:44:33.710 --> 02:44:38.140
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you what butterfly effects </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably the movie that butterfly.</v>

3897
02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:40.540
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ashton Kutcher.</v>

3898
02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.380
<v Speaker 6>Did you actually watch that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3899
02:44:42.430 --> 02:44:43.850
<v Speaker 6>due to kind of fucked me up for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 6>of days.</v>

3900
02:44:43.851 --> 02:44:45.650
<v Speaker 6>The pants on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why did you,</v>

3901
02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:50.990
<v Speaker 6>why did you watch that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who says what time travel you are Joe?</v>

3902
02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:51.913
<v Speaker 6>Like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you ever have a time travel </v>

3903
02:44:53.241 --> 02:44:55.600
<v Speaker 6>person in here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just want to hang out and just listen.</v>

3904
02:44:55.690 --> 02:44:57.140
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm obsessed with time travel.</v>

3905
02:44:57.230 --> 02:45:00.470
<v Speaker 6>Is there a time traveler person?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like the big foot guide I think.</v>

3906
02:45:00.471 --> 02:45:02.140
<v Speaker 6>Does it offset well there was this one.</v>

3907
02:45:02.420 --> 02:45:04.850
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the universe.</v>

3908
02:45:05.090 --> 02:45:10.090
<v Speaker 4>University of Connecticut Raw Roy Mallet</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom Ronald [inaudible].</v>

3909
02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:12.680
<v Speaker 4>Ronald Mallet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3910
02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:16.790
<v Speaker 4>Ronald Mallet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a scientist out of the University</v>

3911
02:45:16.791 --> 02:45:20.090
<v Speaker 4>of Connecticut and this is a crazy like </v>
<v Speaker 4>spiderman story.</v>

3912
02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:25.540
<v Speaker 4>His Dad died when he was young and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>became obsessed with figuring out Ronald</v>

3913
02:45:27.150 --> 02:45:28.110
<v Speaker 4>Mallet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3914
02:45:28.430 --> 02:45:32.780
<v Speaker 4>he became obsessed with figuring out a </v>
<v Speaker 4>time machine so he could go back in time</v>

3915
02:45:32.781 --> 02:45:33.614
<v Speaker 4>and save his father and flaps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what led him on this path to </v>

3916
02:45:37.941 --> 02:45:42.941
<v Speaker 4>become like the world specialist in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's like a legit credentialed,</v>

3917
02:45:44.810 --> 02:45:48.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>respected intellectual and scientist and</v>

3918
02:45:48.891 --> 02:45:50.780
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his accomplishments.</v>

3919
02:45:50.781 --> 02:45:53.930
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's been able to like try to keep track</v>

3920
02:45:53.931 --> 02:45:54.764
<v Speaker 4>of and study time in a way that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really thinking that there's </v>

3921
02:45:57.951 --> 02:46:00.170
<v Speaker 4>going to come one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some day,</v>

3922
02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:01.133
<v Speaker 4>whether they're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out how to travel back and forth </v>

3923
02:46:02.871 --> 02:46:03.260
<v Speaker 4>through time.</v>

3924
02:46:03.260 --> 02:46:07.130
<v Speaker 4>It's going to take a long ass time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But one thing that he along as time,</v>

3925
02:46:07.370 --> 02:46:08.203
<v Speaker 4>one thing that he learned was that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely will never be able to go </v>

3926
02:46:11.001 --> 02:46:14.010
<v Speaker 4>back in time and save his dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>

3927
02:46:14.011 --> 02:46:16.610
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the idea as it's been explained,</v>

3928
02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:21.700
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you only can time travel back to</v>

3929
02:46:22.221 --> 02:46:24.590
<v Speaker 4>the point where the first time machine </v>
<v Speaker 4>was made.</v>

3930
02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:28.790
<v Speaker 4>So if someone one day fuck comes up with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a time machine,</v>

3931
02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.560
<v Speaker 4>say if that's like a hundred years from </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

3932
02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:35.090
<v Speaker 4>the from that moment on from the moment </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the invention of the time machine to,</v>

3933
02:46:35.091 --> 02:46:35.924
<v Speaker 4>to forever in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those people can come back to that </v>

3934
02:46:39.171 --> 02:46:39.980
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>

3935
02:46:39.980 --> 02:46:40.813
<v Speaker 6>So you're telling me the first guy that </v>
<v Speaker 6>invents at time of trig can travel back </v>

3936
02:46:42.801 --> 02:46:45.680
<v Speaker 6>a second then two seconds than five </v>
<v Speaker 6>seconds.</v>

3937
02:46:45.780 --> 02:46:46.613
<v Speaker 4>Mm even know even crazier when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment of first time machine is </v>

3938
02:46:50.491 --> 02:46:54.210
<v Speaker 4>invented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the people that have gone from,</v>

3939
02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:55.193
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say a time machine gets invented </v>

3940
02:46:55.981 --> 02:46:56.814
<v Speaker 4>in 2050 okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the people from 2052 as long as </v>

3941
02:47:01.381 --> 02:47:02.214
<v Speaker 4>human life survives and as long as </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a power source and as long as </v>

3942
02:47:06.070 --> 02:47:06.903
<v Speaker 4>there's a computer grid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as there's some method of </v>

3943
02:47:09.541 --> 02:47:10.374
<v Speaker 4>establishing information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those people will be able to come </v>

3944
02:47:13.501 --> 02:47:16.380
<v Speaker 4>back to that moment and any other moment</v>
<v Speaker 4>in between.</v>

3945
02:47:16.500 --> 02:47:20.700
<v Speaker 4>So time stops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no regular time.</v>

3946
02:47:20.701 --> 02:47:22.740
<v Speaker 4>They might be regular time for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he becomes,</v>

3947
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.863
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only a matter of perspective </v>

3948
02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:26.273
<v Speaker 4>because regular time for you is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to matter anymore because people </v>

3949
02:47:28.021 --> 02:47:28.854
<v Speaker 4>can come and go back to your time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How are we sure I hadn't said this as </v>

3950
02:47:32.371 --> 02:47:35.520
<v Speaker 4>much as they want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then here's another problem.</v>

3951
02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:36.533
<v Speaker 4>Here's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much mass is contained in this one </v>

3952
02:47:40.861 --> 02:47:44.520
<v Speaker 4>environment and is it okay to bring in </v>
<v Speaker 4>more mass?</v>

3953
02:47:44.670 --> 02:47:47.280
<v Speaker 4>And what happens if you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you have,</v>

3954
02:47:47.430 --> 02:47:51.000
<v Speaker 4>if you have 300 million people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America right now,</v>

3955
02:47:51.090 --> 02:47:51.923
<v Speaker 4>but a time machine gets invented and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then all of a sudden people from </v>

3956
02:47:55.620 --> 02:47:56.453
<v Speaker 4>2050 to 250,050</v>
<v Speaker 4>to whenever the fuck the next big </v>

3957
02:48:00.901 --> 02:48:02.640
<v Speaker 4>asteroid wipes us out like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dinosaurs.</v>

3958
02:48:02.641 --> 02:48:03.474
<v Speaker 4>You've got super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super far distance in the future people </v>

3959
02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:06.953
<v Speaker 4>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every person has the possibility and </v>

3960
02:48:09.391 --> 02:48:12.600
<v Speaker 4>potential with technology to reach this </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment right now.</v>

3961
02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:15.390
<v Speaker 4>And what if they did all together all at</v>
<v Speaker 4>once?</v>

3962
02:48:15.690 --> 02:48:17.640
<v Speaker 4>What we even have the space to contain </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

3963
02:48:18.090 --> 02:48:18.923
<v Speaker 4>Would we even have the space on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth to what we would have to regulate </v>

3964
02:48:21.421 --> 02:48:22.254
<v Speaker 4>time travel at every second of every day</v>
<v Speaker 4>from today on until the moment there's </v>

3965
02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:28.140
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3966
02:48:28.140 --> 02:48:28.973
<v Speaker 6>I can debunk this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you ready for me to debunk a </v>

3967
02:48:30.321 --> 02:48:31.670
<v Speaker 6>scientist?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hoping you can do it.</v>

3968
02:48:31.700 --> 02:48:33.770
<v Speaker 6>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mic drop moment.</v>

3969
02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:36.380
<v Speaker 6>Dear scientists have spent your whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>life figuring this out.</v>

3970
02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:39.680
<v Speaker 6>I just shut you down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I built a time travel.</v>

3971
02:48:39.710 --> 02:48:40.543
<v Speaker 6>Me and Brian are time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Travel consists of a bottle of </v>

3972
02:48:42.501 --> 02:48:44.120
<v Speaker 6>champagne,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lighter and a joint.</v>

3973
02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:47.240
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying it's simple,</v>

3974
02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:51.310
<v Speaker 6>simpler time machine stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No mental illness.</v>

3975
02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:57.640
<v Speaker 6>Can I handle this one on my own?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm just saying simple mechanics.</v>

3976
02:48:58.200 --> 02:48:59.930
<v Speaker 6>Let's pretend that that's the time </v>
<v Speaker 6>machine,</v>

3977
02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:00.770
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we got it.</v>

3978
02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:01.910
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We invent the time machine.</v>

3979
02:49:01.911 --> 02:49:02.744
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

3980
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:05.450
<v Speaker 6>we right now we can travel back to that </v>
<v Speaker 6>moment three days ago.</v>

3981
02:49:05.451 --> 02:49:06.284
<v Speaker 6>We can try to travel back to this moment</v>
<v Speaker 6>or three days and now I can say to </v>

3982
02:49:09.991 --> 02:49:10.950
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

3983
02:49:11.460 --> 02:49:14.640
<v Speaker 6>our time machine really just consists of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a bottle of champagne,</v>

3984
02:49:14.970 --> 02:49:17.570
<v Speaker 6>a joint and lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go to f,</v>

3985
02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:20.940
<v Speaker 6>let's fucking send you back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know the three things,</v>

3986
02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:24.290
<v Speaker 6>bill one then come back to me now your </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea,</v>

3987
02:49:24.310 --> 02:49:28.020
<v Speaker 6>she gets together with my chipolte lay </v>
<v Speaker 6>person and have sex and have a baby.</v>

3988
02:49:28.021 --> 02:49:33.021
<v Speaker 6>That makes no sense you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no time machine ever going to be</v>

3989
02:49:34.231 --> 02:49:38.180
<v Speaker 6>built because [inaudible] bro,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's up.</v>

3990
02:49:39.150 --> 02:49:42.210
<v Speaker 6>Donald Trump is president.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cats and dogs living together.</v>

3991
02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:44.100
<v Speaker 6>Simulation program,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tie machine,</v>

3992
02:49:44.101 --> 02:49:45.270
<v Speaker 6>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Births,</v>

3993
02:49:45.271 --> 02:49:46.950
<v Speaker 6>ideas back to the future three </v>
<v Speaker 6>basically.</v>

3994
02:49:46.980 --> 02:49:47.813
<v Speaker 6>Is that what it is?</v>

3995
02:49:50.070 --> 02:49:53.550
<v Speaker 6>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie shutting your shit down.</v>

3996
02:49:54.350 --> 02:49:57.030
<v Speaker 6>I'm interrupting your kettle bell </v>
<v Speaker 6>workout on.</v>

3997
02:49:57.040 --> 02:50:00.330
<v Speaker 6>Stop shutting down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh fuck.</v>

3998
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.943
<v Speaker 6>Would you like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to be cool to see like </v>

3999
02:50:02.370 --> 02:50:04.790
<v Speaker 6>scientists actually work on time travel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if they're like,</v>

4000
02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:05.713
<v Speaker 6>like shooting lasers does that walls and</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to run through a wall or </v>

4001
02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:08.513
<v Speaker 6>essentially</v>

4002
02:50:09.070 --> 02:50:10.840
<v Speaker 4>definitely doing it in one way or </v>
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>

4003
02:50:10.841 --> 02:50:12.550
<v Speaker 4>They might even not even realize they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it,</v>

4004
02:50:12.700 --> 02:50:13.533
<v Speaker 4>but every intensive scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment that anyone's doing anywhere </v>

4005
02:50:17.201 --> 02:50:18.034
<v Speaker 4>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need results that they get in </v>

4006
02:50:19.031 --> 02:50:21.940
<v Speaker 4>groundbreaking results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Auger kind of added together and to this</v>

4007
02:50:21.941 --> 02:50:25.180
<v Speaker 4>super possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whatever they invent today,</v>

4008
02:50:25.181 --> 02:50:28.090
<v Speaker 4>whatever they figure out today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if they're not thinking like,</v>

4009
02:50:28.091 --> 02:50:29.740
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna invent a time machine,</v>

4010
02:50:29.770 --> 02:50:30.603
<v Speaker 4>but any new technology that someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>invents a day makes more things </v>

4011
02:50:32.891 --> 02:50:35.140
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's more things become possible.</v>

4012
02:50:35.141 --> 02:50:37.150
<v Speaker 4>Eventually people are going to get to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the point where they go,</v>

4013
02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:38.950
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this time thing,</v>

4014
02:50:39.190 --> 02:50:42.310
<v Speaker 4>we manipulate this or is this just what </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is?</v>

4015
02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:43.173
<v Speaker 4>Is it what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or we can we move around in it like the </v>

4016
02:50:44.681 --> 02:50:46.540
<v Speaker 4>air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember when we didn't used to think we</v>

4017
02:50:46.541 --> 02:50:47.374
<v Speaker 4>could fly through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then we realized we could fly </v>

4018
02:50:48.731 --> 02:50:49.450
<v Speaker 4>through the air.</v>

4019
02:50:49.450 --> 02:50:50.283
<v Speaker 4>Why can't we fly through time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you sure we can't fly through time </v>

4020
02:50:52.331 --> 02:50:53.164
<v Speaker 4>today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if people keep getting smarter and </v>

4021
02:50:54.581 --> 02:50:55.414
<v Speaker 4>smarter and more and more aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibilities that had been created by </v>

4022
02:50:58.781 --> 02:51:02.260
<v Speaker 4>all these different technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to open up the door to insane</v>

4023
02:51:02.261 --> 02:51:03.094
<v Speaker 4>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like unimaginable possibility of the </v>

4024
02:51:05.741 --> 02:51:08.860
<v Speaker 4>ability to manipulate matter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human bodies,</v>

4025
02:51:08.861 --> 02:51:09.694
<v Speaker 4>time travel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a matter of whether or not </v>

4026
02:51:11.141 --> 02:51:13.660
<v Speaker 4>we'll have enough power and whether or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not we'll,</v>

4027
02:51:13.690 --> 02:51:16.870
<v Speaker 4>like if we do it correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're figuring it out to the point where</v>

4028
02:51:16.990 --> 02:51:17.823
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we definitely didn't figure out the </v>

4029
02:51:18.101 --> 02:51:20.440
<v Speaker 4>fossil fuel thing or the plastic thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctly.</v>

4030
02:51:20.650 --> 02:51:21.483
<v Speaker 4>We invented it without considering the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of way more fucking people </v>

4031
02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:26.073
<v Speaker 4>and way more impact on the environment </v>
<v Speaker 4>than anybody ever imagined when they </v>

4032
02:51:28.031 --> 02:51:28.864
<v Speaker 4>first invented those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you see the oceans choking up </v>

4033
02:51:30.641 --> 02:51:34.360
<v Speaker 4>with plastic and the fucking skies all </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking black with smog from shitty car,</v>

4034
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:35.463
<v Speaker 4>like nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody saw that coming when they </v>

4035
02:51:36.251 --> 02:51:37.240
<v Speaker 4>invented those things.</v>

4036
02:51:37.510 --> 02:51:38.343
<v Speaker 4>So there's gotta be a way where they can</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at all the different things that </v>

4037
02:51:41.141 --> 02:51:41.974
<v Speaker 4>we're doing right now and extrapolate </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the future and figure out how to </v>

4038
02:51:46.001 --> 02:51:47.470
<v Speaker 4>fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once they can do that,</v>

4039
02:51:47.740 --> 02:51:51.910
<v Speaker 4>then it becomes a matter of how much </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy do you put forth and what are the</v>

4040
02:51:51.911 --> 02:51:55.450
<v Speaker 4>rewards that you get back and can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can continue to sustain that energy.</v>

4041
02:51:55.630 --> 02:51:56.463
<v Speaker 4>So if you can continue to sustain the </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy and you start just creating time </v>

4042
02:51:59.111 --> 02:52:01.780
<v Speaker 4>machines and you start creating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4043
02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:04.960
<v Speaker 4>the ability to manipulate bodies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>change shapes,</v>

4044
02:52:05.110 --> 02:52:07.900
<v Speaker 4>you would turn your body into whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck you wanted it to be.</v>

4045
02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:10.210
<v Speaker 4>And there would be no standard human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

4046
02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:14.620
<v Speaker 4>There'd be people with fucking wings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There would be people with giant heads.</v>

4047
02:52:14.621 --> 02:52:17.350
<v Speaker 4>You could literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they start manipulating bodies,</v>

4048
02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:18.333
<v Speaker 4>it's just a matter of time before they </v>
<v Speaker 4>manipulate them at will and before they </v>

4049
02:52:21.011 --> 02:52:22.540
<v Speaker 4>manipulate them back and forth.</v>

4050
02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:23.433
<v Speaker 4>What's going to be the first person that</v>
<v Speaker 4>decides to become a horse person and </v>

4051
02:52:25.631 --> 02:52:26.464
<v Speaker 4>then besides become a center and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>decides to become the hulk and then </v>

4052
02:52:29.411 --> 02:52:32.270
<v Speaker 4>becomes a brony.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know how many,</v>

4053
02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:33.273
<v Speaker 4>how many fucking people are going to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird shit to their body once they </v>

4054
02:52:35.891 --> 02:52:38.530
<v Speaker 4>realize that you can change it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can decide,</v>

4055
02:52:38.531 --> 02:52:42.910
<v Speaker 4>you can introduce a gene that makes your</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulders stretch out wide like this,</v>

4056
02:52:42.940 --> 02:52:45.640
<v Speaker 4>give me tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never fucking know.</v>

4057
02:52:45.660 --> 02:52:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Give me wings tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

4058
02:52:47.980 --> 02:52:48.813
<v Speaker 4>If they can figure out how to splice </v>
<v Speaker 4>genes into different plants to create </v>

4059
02:52:52.661 --> 02:52:53.494
<v Speaker 4>like more resistant plants to pesticides</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can figure out how to </v>

4060
02:52:56.891 --> 02:52:57.724
<v Speaker 4>manipulate things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They figured out how to grow a human </v>

4061
02:52:59.830 --> 02:53:00.880
<v Speaker 4>ear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4062
02:53:00.881 --> 02:53:02.350
<v Speaker 4>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on some sort of a mammoth.</v>

4063
02:53:02.360 --> 02:53:04.000
<v Speaker 4>He was a mouse or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they're,</v>

4064
02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:04.953
<v Speaker 4>they're constantly trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 4>new ways to combine things and </v>

4065
02:53:08.171 --> 02:53:09.190
<v Speaker 4>manipulate things.</v>

4066
02:53:09.550 --> 02:53:12.910
<v Speaker 4>Just keep going from today to a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand years from now.</v>

4067
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:14.560
<v Speaker 4>It's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Inevitable,</v>

4068
02:53:14.561 --> 02:53:15.640
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they habitable.</v>

4069
02:53:15.730 --> 02:53:17.100
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if they had told your </v>
<v Speaker 4>grandparents,</v>

4070
02:53:17.110 --> 02:53:19.540
<v Speaker 4>you'll be able to speak to your child on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other side of the coast.</v>

4071
02:53:20.050 --> 02:53:23.080
<v Speaker 4>How would I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just look at this human ear.</v>

4072
02:53:23.081 --> 02:53:23.914
<v Speaker 4>They grew on a fucking rat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had kind of looked like Richard Ross </v>

4073
02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:27.550
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Asian guy.</v>

4074
02:53:27.610 --> 02:53:28.151
<v Speaker 4>It looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4075
02:53:28.151 --> 02:53:30.850
<v Speaker 4>lead Ishmael's ear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the UFC fighter.</v>

4076
02:53:31.950 --> 02:53:35.270
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They grew his nose jacked.</v>

4077
02:53:35.310 --> 02:53:36.143
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They grew his nose on his forehead and </v>

4078
02:53:37.301 --> 02:53:39.190
<v Speaker 4>then they cut you open and stitch it </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in.</v>

4079
02:53:40.900 --> 02:53:41.733
<v Speaker 4>I was on the forehead or on your face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they do is they kind of stretch it </v>

4080
02:53:45.011 --> 02:53:45.844
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They stretch your skin out by putting </v>

4081
02:53:48.041 --> 02:53:52.810
<v Speaker 4>this sort of a artificial nose thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they kind of grow on your head.</v>

4082
02:53:53.470 --> 02:53:56.110
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of different experiments</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people are doing right now.</v>

4083
02:53:56.430 --> 02:53:58.240
<v Speaker 4>This is the hope and this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting,</v>

4084
02:53:58.241 --> 02:54:00.940
<v Speaker 4>but it's kind of like almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4085
02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:04.750
<v Speaker 4>be beginner steps to what they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately going to be able to do.</v>

4086
02:54:04.830 --> 02:54:05.663
<v Speaker 4>No way does this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they doing this because there's no </v>

4087
02:54:07.930 --> 02:54:09.620
<v Speaker 4>like those plastic surgery stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4088
02:54:09.621 --> 02:54:09.910
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4089
02:54:09.910 --> 02:54:11.260
<v Speaker 4>I got his nose fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4090
02:54:11.261 --> 02:54:13.840
<v Speaker 4>but I mean like meaning you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all of a sudden we have,</v>

4091
02:54:13.841 --> 02:54:15.430
<v Speaker 4>we have a cure to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knows it's gone.</v>

4092
02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4093
02:54:15.970 --> 02:54:19.300
<v Speaker 4>As opposed to AIDS.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Medication is still kind of like,</v>

4094
02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:21.310
<v Speaker 4>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to hold it off.</v>

4095
02:54:21.350 --> 02:54:24.190
<v Speaker 4>We're not curing it cause the money's in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comeback.</v>

4096
02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Chris Rock said to Joe,</v>

4097
02:54:29.771 --> 02:54:30.604
<v Speaker 4>I don't get all my information from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it from podcasts and comedy and </v>

4098
02:54:33.191 --> 02:54:35.590
<v Speaker 4>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never know.</v>

4099
02:54:35.890 --> 02:54:36.723
<v Speaker 4>It definitely could be real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would imagine it would be really </v>

4100
02:54:38.891 --> 02:54:39.724
<v Speaker 4>hard for people to ethically hide the a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cure for aids because they can make </v>

4101
02:54:44.830 --> 02:54:46.540
<v Speaker 4>money from the treatment.</v>

4102
02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:49.210
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to assume that the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>people too.</v>

4103
02:54:49.450 --> 02:54:50.283
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to assume that the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are making the treatment got ahold </v>

4104
02:54:53.291 --> 02:54:54.124
<v Speaker 4>of the cure and decided to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either they bought them out or it was </v>

4105
02:54:57.611 --> 02:54:59.350
<v Speaker 4>their company that invented it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to,</v>

4106
02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:01.630
<v Speaker 4>they'd have to all be conveniently </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected.</v>

4107
02:55:02.230 --> 02:55:03.063
<v Speaker 4>I guess you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's also a scientist as a </v>

4108
02:55:04.761 --> 02:55:05.594
<v Speaker 4>scientist that would have to be involved</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the discovery of something as </v>

4109
02:55:09.410 --> 02:55:14.410
<v Speaker 4>monumental as curing aids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If a scientist could figure that out,</v>

4110
02:55:14.990 --> 02:55:17.740
<v Speaker 4>that would be gigantic for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reputation it would see.</v>

4111
02:55:17.780 --> 02:55:19.970
<v Speaker 4>They would be like Francis Crick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would be like,</v>

4112
02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:21.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there'll be like Watson.</v>

4113
02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:24.040
<v Speaker 4>They would be like one of the great </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists of all times.</v>

4114
02:55:24.041 --> 02:55:26.540
<v Speaker 4>Someone has invented something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would be like,</v>

4115
02:55:27.050 --> 02:55:27.883
<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could go back in time and think </v>

4116
02:55:30.501 --> 02:55:33.530
<v Speaker 4>about all the big inventors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the teslas and all the different people.</v>

4117
02:55:33.530 --> 02:55:34.363
<v Speaker 4>Someone who can invent something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>cures the black plague of the 20th </v>

4118
02:55:37.431 --> 02:55:38.990
<v Speaker 4>century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what AIDS was.</v>

4119
02:55:38.991 --> 02:55:41.120
<v Speaker 4>Still a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone came along and cured that,</v>

4120
02:55:41.570 --> 02:55:42.890
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd be big.</v>

4121
02:55:43.220 --> 02:55:44.053
<v Speaker 4>They'd be giant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can keep that shit </v>

4122
02:55:44.901 --> 02:55:47.360
<v Speaker 4>quiet because I'm going to lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make sense?</v>

4123
02:55:47.890 --> 02:55:50.210
<v Speaker 4>Now May,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I'm agreeing with the conspiracy</v>

4124
02:55:50.211 --> 02:55:50.841
<v Speaker 4>theorists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4125
02:55:50.841 --> 02:55:54.290
<v Speaker 4>I've heard on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't totally listen to them.</v>

4126
02:55:54.380 --> 02:55:55.213
<v Speaker 4>Not because their ideas are invalid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because a lot of times they don't </v>

4127
02:55:58.820 --> 02:56:01.760
<v Speaker 4>absolutely know and people jumped to </v>
<v Speaker 4>conclusions,</v>

4128
02:56:01.761 --> 02:56:02.594
<v Speaker 4>so it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the conspiracies don't exist because </v>

4129
02:56:03.591 --> 02:56:05.030
<v Speaker 4>they definitely exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all know that.</v>

4130
02:56:05.031 --> 02:56:07.550
<v Speaker 4>Some people can spire to do certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

4131
02:56:07.551 --> 02:56:11.060
<v Speaker 4>It happens all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's whether or not the conspiracies</v>

4132
02:56:11.061 --> 02:56:14.660
<v Speaker 4>that we just get really attached to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not they're,</v>

4133
02:56:14.780 --> 02:56:17.510
<v Speaker 4>they're real and oftentimes they're just</v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

4134
02:56:18.290 --> 02:56:19.123
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still believe in time travel time </v>

4135
02:56:21.411 --> 02:56:24.680
<v Speaker 4>travel is totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think it's happened yet.</v>

4136
02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:26.030
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4137
02:56:26.031 --> 02:56:27.650
<v Speaker 4>I think everything's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4138
02:56:27.860 --> 02:56:30.110
<v Speaker 4>I think we're going to come to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird point in time,</v>

4139
02:56:30.111 --> 02:56:32.270
<v Speaker 4>whether it's like I said a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>years from now,</v>

4140
02:56:32.271 --> 02:56:33.104
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a weird point in time </v>

4141
02:56:34.461 --> 02:56:35.294
<v Speaker 4>where we could do anything we want.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that part of you</v>

4153
02:57:07.700 --> 02:57:08.533
<v Speaker 2>Indiana Jones where she's riding an </v>
<v Speaker 2>elephant and then she sprays Cologne on </v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so ridiculous.</v>

4159
02:57:23.250 --> 02:57:24.083
<v Speaker 4>I broke this lighter while I was sitting</v>
<v Speaker 4>here and I didn't know why I was doing </v>

4160
02:57:26.791 --> 02:57:27.624
<v Speaker 4>it while I was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just kept pushing on little pieces of </v>

4161
02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:31.800
<v Speaker 4>lighter and pieces are breaking off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4162
02:57:31.801 --> 02:57:32.634
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck is wrong with you.</v>

4163
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:36.180
<v Speaker 2>They got like lighter fluid all over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to light it a joint.</v>

4164
02:57:36.181 --> 02:57:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4165
02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:37.390
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

4166
02:57:37.391 --> 02:57:38.224
<v Speaker 4>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

4167
02:57:38.590 --> 02:57:39.423
<v Speaker 4>What is it about pot that makes you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing at a time is just not </v>

4168
02:57:42.581 --> 02:57:47.110
<v Speaker 4>interesting enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got to thinking about time travel and</v>

4169
02:57:47.290 --> 02:57:50.290
<v Speaker 4>chipotle lay and how do I break this </v>
<v Speaker 4>lighter with two fingers?</v>

4170
02:57:50.500 --> 02:57:52.630
<v Speaker 4>Can I you just use two fingers and break</v>
<v Speaker 4>the slider?</v>

4171
02:57:52.690 --> 02:57:54.340
<v Speaker 4>I won't push with the third finger at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

4172
02:57:54.660 --> 02:57:55.493
<v Speaker 4>He says time travel is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks it's just not technologically </v>

4173
02:57:58.361 --> 02:58:00.970
<v Speaker 4>here yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says he needs about 250,000</v>

4174
02:58:01.290 --> 02:58:01.980
<v Speaker 4>to make a scale</v>

4175
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:02.813
<v Speaker 6>model of his machine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you could get funding like the </v>

4176
02:58:04.501 --> 02:58:06.030
<v Speaker 6>hard drum collider,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like 10 billion,</v>

4177
02:58:06.060 --> 02:58:07.140
<v Speaker 6>then they could probably do it.</v>

4178
02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:09.580
<v Speaker 5>This is Ma Mallet says that's what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>said.</v>

4179

<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that too though.</v>

4180
02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:12.513
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4245
03:00:56.001 --> 03:00:58.340

<v Speaker 5>When you look at like the future,</v>

4246
03:00:59.030 --> 03:01:00.220
<v Speaker 5>like you look at technology</v>

4247
03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:01.690
<v Speaker 4>in the future and you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

4248
03:01:01.691 --> 03:01:04.300
<v Speaker 4>what does entertainment going to be like</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see something like this?</v>

4249
03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:05.553
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have like full on dmt </v>

4250
03:01:06.731 --> 03:01:08.470
<v Speaker 4>trips with a headset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4251
03:01:08.670 --> 03:01:09.503
<v Speaker 4>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not even going to have to do a </v>

4252
03:01:10.121 --> 03:01:10.990
<v Speaker 4>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4253
03:01:10.991 --> 03:01:11.824
<v Speaker 4>that's something McKenna predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terence Mckenna predicted that one day </v>

4254
03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:16.893
<v Speaker 4>through virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would figure out a way to recreate </v>

4255
03:01:19.810 --> 03:01:20.643
<v Speaker 4>the DMT dimension and you'd be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go there without actually being fucked </v>

4256
03:01:24.011 --> 03:01:27.430
<v Speaker 4>up without actually being intoxicated on</v>
<v Speaker 4>dmt.</v>

4257
03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:28.660
<v Speaker 4>You'd be able to go there.</v>

4258
03:01:29.640 --> 03:01:32.460
<v Speaker 6>I think DMT is the existence of time </v>
<v Speaker 6>trouble.</v>

4259
03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:35.210
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

4260
03:01:35.260 --> 03:01:36.810
<v Speaker 6>it's something weird,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4261
03:01:36.811 --> 03:01:38.310
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kill that.</v>

4262
03:01:39.190 --> 03:01:41.820
<v Speaker 6>It's talking about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why I reached out to that.</v>

4263
03:01:41.821 --> 03:01:42.840
<v Speaker 6>Have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4264
03:01:42.841 --> 03:01:44.460
<v Speaker 6>I reached out to dunk and talk to him </v>
<v Speaker 6>about it.</v>

4265
03:01:44.590 --> 03:01:45.740
<v Speaker 6>You want to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4266
03:01:45.810 --> 03:01:47.840
<v Speaker 6>I told him I did and he said he thought </v>
<v Speaker 6>it was a bad idea.</v>

4267
03:01:48.210 --> 03:01:51.300
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like I say that knows pretty well,</v>

4268
03:01:52.570 --> 03:01:53.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't have that Brent.</v>

4269
03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:56.020
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I don't have the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to babysit you,</v>

4270
03:01:56.100 --> 03:01:58.160
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You sure?</v>

4271
03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:59.140
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right up there,</v>

4272
03:01:59.160 --> 03:02:01.950
<v Speaker 6>I've done every drug there is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I've never done dmt and I don't know</v>

4273
03:02:01.951 --> 03:02:04.860
<v Speaker 6>if my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my biggest fear right now is not,</v>

4274
03:02:04.890 --> 03:02:07.110
<v Speaker 6>it's not the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not the con,</v>

4275
03:02:07.650 --> 03:02:08.483
<v Speaker 6>it's the fact that I have two children </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they rely on my brain to make them </v>

4276
03:02:11.551 --> 03:02:12.384
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for me to fuck with my brain for me </v>

4277
03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.880
<v Speaker 6>is not the greatest thing because I got </v>
<v Speaker 6>a pretty fragile brain.</v>

4278
03:02:18.030 --> 03:02:19.800
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've all heard of this podcast.</v>

4279
03:02:20.140 --> 03:02:22.380
<v Speaker 6>I fucking drink a bottle of wine on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>treadmill.</v>

4280
03:02:22.410 --> 03:02:27.000
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm not the guy that maybe belongs </v>
<v Speaker 6>rolling the dice and going,</v>

4281
03:02:27.060 --> 03:02:27.893
<v Speaker 6>let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you worried that would happen </v>

4282
03:02:29.610 --> 03:02:31.230
<v Speaker 6>but don't come back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't come back.</v>

4283
03:02:31.390 --> 03:02:32.223
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Come like the dude from pink floyd and </v>

4284
03:02:33.391 --> 03:02:37.320
<v Speaker 6>just lose your marbles or diamond.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

03:02:52.060 --> 03:02:53.350
<v Speaker 6>Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you weren't even in that country.</v>

4290
03:02:53.351 --> 03:02:55.850

<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

4291
03:02:55.860 --> 03:02:56.681
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>

4292
03:02:56.681 --> 03:03:00.310
<v Speaker 6>The only reason I won't do it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just a pure,</v>

4293
03:03:00.311 --> 03:03:01.900
<v Speaker 6>I don't come back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4294
03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:03.910
<v Speaker 6>that's a legitimate fear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

4295
03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:04.833
<v Speaker 6>I love my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want them to have a great life and I </v>

4296
03:03:06.071 --> 03:03:08.740
<v Speaker 6>committed to that when I had them and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's my fear.</v>

4297
03:03:09.100 --> 03:03:14.100
<v Speaker 6>Do I respect you massively for allowing </v>
<v Speaker 6>a differentiation in,</v>

4298
03:03:14.950 --> 03:03:17.290
<v Speaker 6>in family and and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

<v Speaker 6>and the extra treasure psychosis or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the,</v>

4300
03:03:21.250 --> 03:03:23.500
<v Speaker 6>whatever the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic say.</v>

4301
03:03:23.501 --> 03:03:24.334
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

4302
03:03:26.770 --> 03:03:28.840
<v Speaker 6>Can I tell you what I all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could think that whole time.</v>

<v Speaker 6>people could throw on goggles,</v>

4306
03:03:37.690 --> 03:03:38.523
<v Speaker 6>smoke a joint,</v>

<v Speaker 6>already.</v>

<v Speaker 4>People that have like live shows like I </v>

<v Speaker 4>I know the brilliance of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I loved what I love about it and when I </v>

4335
03:04:42.741 --> 03:04:43.574
<v Speaker 4>Did you try it out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now they're actually advertising it </v>

4336
03:04:45.621 --> 03:04:46.454
<v Speaker 4>on tv to the masses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the moms and the dads on the </v>

4337
03:04:49.371 --> 03:04:51.610
<v Speaker 4>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the one that Samsung has is,</v>

4338
03:04:51.611 --> 03:04:55.130
<v Speaker 4>is cool but there's one that has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>higher resolution,</v>

4339
03:04:55.360 --> 03:04:56.193
<v Speaker 4>like not just like the cell phone one is</v>
<v Speaker 4>like real simple because you just use </v>

4340
03:04:59.451 --> 03:05:00.284
<v Speaker 4>your existing cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you slide it into this sort of bracket </v>

4341
03:05:02.271 --> 03:05:03.104
<v Speaker 4>you put on the headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they have some that are attached to </v>

4342
03:05:04.941 --> 03:05:06.230
<v Speaker 4>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4343
03:05:06.240 --> 03:05:10.730
<v Speaker 4>they're the really intensive programming</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as like their ability to,</v>

4344
03:05:10.731 --> 03:05:11.564
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to computate like the big thing about </v>

4345
03:05:13.580 --> 03:05:17.990
<v Speaker 4>visuals and about artificial reality and</v>
<v Speaker 4>about virtual reality.</v>

4346
03:05:18.260 --> 03:05:19.093
<v Speaker 4>The big thing is computational power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's to be able to create a seamless </v>

4347
03:05:24.321 --> 03:05:26.120
<v Speaker 4>reality all the time.</v>

4348
03:05:26.480 --> 03:05:27.313
<v Speaker 4>Like it's one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would always see when you would play </v>

4349
03:05:29.151 --> 03:05:31.430
<v Speaker 4>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a little bit of lag.</v>

4350
03:05:31.790 --> 03:05:34.690
<v Speaker 4>Like if your computer was struggling </v>
<v Speaker 4>because your um,</v>

4351
03:05:35.210 --> 03:05:36.043
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your video card couldn't keep up with </v>

4352
03:05:37.431 --> 03:05:40.030
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the resolution of the,</v>

4353
03:05:40.031 --> 03:05:43.810
<v Speaker 4>of the screen and the frames per second </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you had it set up down.</v>

4354
03:05:44.490 --> 03:05:46.400
<v Speaker 4>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you the resolution is a big one cause it</v>

4355
03:05:46.470 --> 03:05:49.010
<v Speaker 4>it would establish with the frames per </v>
<v Speaker 4>second where,</v>

4356
03:05:49.011 --> 03:05:49.844
<v Speaker 4>because like most video cards like in </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I used to make pcs I used to buy </v>

4357
03:05:53.960 --> 03:05:54.793
<v Speaker 4>like pcs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just buy the shell and buy a </v>

4358
03:05:56.061 --> 03:05:58.300
<v Speaker 4>motherboard and hard drives and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

4359
03:05:58.550 --> 03:06:01.010
<v Speaker 4>my friend Andrew would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would always help me out.</v>

4360
03:06:01.011 --> 03:06:01.844
<v Speaker 4>Here's my security net in case things </v>
<v Speaker 4>went bad cause I was like okay what the </v>

4361
03:06:04.251 --> 03:06:05.084
<v Speaker 4>fuck is next?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would get on the phone with him </v>

4362
03:06:06.981 --> 03:06:08.710
<v Speaker 4>from Oklahoma and he would talk me </v>
<v Speaker 4>through it.</v>

4363
03:06:08.710 --> 03:06:10.660
<v Speaker 4>But it's only making toast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4364
03:06:10.880 --> 03:06:11.713
<v Speaker 4>But creating a pc that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the big things is like if you </v>

4365
03:06:14.871 --> 03:06:17.450
<v Speaker 4>want to game on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old video cards,</v>

4366
03:06:17.451 --> 03:06:18.284
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them you'd have to connect to </v>
<v Speaker 4>video cards together and form an Sli </v>

4367
03:06:21.111 --> 03:06:25.640
<v Speaker 4>connection that allowed you to have like</v>
<v Speaker 4>double the processing power in order for</v>

4368
03:06:25.641 --> 03:06:26.474
<v Speaker 4>you to play at a high resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise you'd have turned the </v>

4369
03:06:28.011 --> 03:06:30.410
<v Speaker 4>resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was way low so that it looked like</v>

4370
03:06:30.411 --> 03:06:31.244
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some guys would even take away all </v>

4371
03:06:32.931 --> 03:06:33.764
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4372
03:06:33.980 --> 03:06:37.700
<v Speaker 4>the textures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like say you would be playing quake,</v>

4373
03:06:37.730 --> 03:06:41.210
<v Speaker 4>so you'd be going down a dark dungeon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would look cool as fuck and you would</v>

4374
03:06:41.211 --> 03:06:44.150
<v Speaker 4>see good crazy lighting and the graphics</v>
<v Speaker 4>are amazing.</v>

4375
03:06:44.360 --> 03:06:48.800
<v Speaker 4>But to the hardcore competitive gamers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit was just distracting.</v>

4376
03:06:49.040 --> 03:06:53.360
<v Speaker 4>So what they would do is they would take</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the textures out and they would turn</v>

4377
03:06:53.361 --> 03:06:58.361
<v Speaker 4>the entire space that you were playing </v>
<v Speaker 4>in and to this white canvas with you.</v>

4378
03:06:59.220 --> 03:07:00.053
<v Speaker 4>Like you are a bright red and they can </v>
<v Speaker 4>even change what your character </v>

4379
03:07:02.941 --> 03:07:06.480
<v Speaker 4>represented on their screen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like you would say like,</v>

4380
03:07:06.481 --> 03:07:10.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be like this little chick </v>
<v Speaker 4>character because the chick character is</v>

4381
03:07:10.651 --> 03:07:12.870
<v Speaker 4>really difficult to hit cause she's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>small.</v>

4382
03:07:12.871 --> 03:07:13.704
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to pinpoint even though they </v>
<v Speaker 4>all have the same sort of box that you </v>

4383
03:07:16.141 --> 03:07:18.270
<v Speaker 4>could shoot them in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was to be harder to pinpoint.</v>

4384
03:07:18.480 --> 03:07:19.313
<v Speaker 4>And other people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what I want is everybody I play to </v>

4385
03:07:22.141 --> 03:07:24.750
<v Speaker 4>be the giant square robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're an easy target.</v>

4386
03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:27.870
<v Speaker 4>So you see this like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what quake looks like.</v>

4387
03:07:27.871 --> 03:07:28.704
<v Speaker 4>This is quake three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it looks like when they turn off </v>

4388
03:07:31.140 --> 03:07:34.350
<v Speaker 4>all the textures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's probably better ones out there,</v>

4389
03:07:34.351 --> 03:07:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Jim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we can see like a death match.</v>

4390
03:07:36.420 --> 03:07:37.790
<v Speaker 4>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no texture.</v>

4391
03:07:37.791 --> 03:07:39.570
<v Speaker 4>So you don't see any texture on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>

4392
03:07:39.571 --> 03:07:41.820
<v Speaker 4>You don't see any graphics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's sort of muted.</v>

4393
03:07:41.900 --> 03:07:42.733
<v Speaker 6>Is this theoretically what the premise </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the matrix was where he just saw </v>

4394
03:07:44.991 --> 03:07:45.170
<v Speaker 6>number</v>

4395
03:07:45.170 --> 03:07:46.040
<v Speaker 4>verse?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4396
03:07:46.041 --> 03:07:46.461
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4397
03:07:46.461 --> 03:07:47.510
<v Speaker 4>But this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just,</v>

4398
03:07:47.511 --> 03:07:49.190
<v Speaker 4>she just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a last,</v>

4399
03:07:49.191 --> 03:07:51.050
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of cheating a lot of people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes.</v>

4400
03:07:51.051 --> 03:07:52.510
<v Speaker 4>It makes you green also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4401
03:07:52.511 --> 03:07:54.290
<v Speaker 4>oh there's the bright green guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4402
03:07:54.291 --> 03:07:57.590
<v Speaker 4>you can change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can change what their character is.</v>

4403
03:07:57.680 --> 03:08:01.400
<v Speaker 4>So like say you don't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the right,</v>

4404
03:08:01.401 --> 03:08:03.470
<v Speaker 4>like say if you decide that you were a </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl in the game.</v>

4405
03:08:03.471 --> 03:08:04.490
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

4406
03:08:04.491 --> 03:08:07.550
<v Speaker 4>played as a girl because it was small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

4407
03:08:07.610 --> 03:08:09.550
<v Speaker 4>you don't get to decide how other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>see you.</v>

4408
03:08:09.620 --> 03:08:12.410
<v Speaker 4>Other people can see you as a giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>circle.</v>

4409
03:08:12.560 --> 03:08:16.910
<v Speaker 4>Like instead of even seeing you as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person or a seeing is as a moving thing,</v>

4410
03:08:17.060 --> 03:08:17.893
<v Speaker 4>they could see you as a circle that </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't change and you just become a </v>

4411
03:08:20.391 --> 03:08:23.810
<v Speaker 4>target.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's way easier to hit you that it is</v>

4412
03:08:23.811 --> 03:08:24.644
<v Speaker 4>for you to hit.</v>

4413
03:08:25.300 --> 03:08:27.200
<v Speaker 4>It was way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way easier for them to hit you,</v>

4414
03:08:27.201 --> 03:08:31.010
<v Speaker 4>then it's for you to hit them because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've become a giant target.</v>

4415
03:08:31.011 --> 03:08:33.960
<v Speaker 4>Whereas you're playing the game the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's intended and they're just,</v>

4416
03:08:33.980 --> 03:08:35.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4417
03:08:35.121 --> 03:08:37.730
<v Speaker 4>an octopus with a machine gun or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck their characters.</v>

4418
03:08:38.180 --> 03:08:41.810
<v Speaker 4>So you can kind of manipulate things and</v>
<v Speaker 4>change in the settings.</v>

4419
03:08:42.020 --> 03:08:44.480
<v Speaker 4>And some people like it because it makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>it real simple.</v>

4420
03:08:44.750 --> 03:08:45.590
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>

4421
03:08:45.620 --> 03:08:48.200
<v Speaker 4>it's such a fast paced game anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to be there.</v>

4422
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:49.063
<v Speaker 4>They're not there for all that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not there for textures and the </v>

4423
03:08:51.291 --> 03:08:52.124
<v Speaker 4>way it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just that kick ass and spray </v>

4424
03:08:53.751 --> 03:08:54.584
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rail gun people in the middle of the </v>

4425
03:08:56.061 --> 03:08:56.894
<v Speaker 4>air.</v>

4426
03:08:57.630 --> 03:09:00.990
<v Speaker 6>It would bounce off these bouncy pad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't talk.</v>

4427
03:09:00.991 --> 03:09:02.760
<v Speaker 6>You can't talk to me about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4428
03:09:03.270 --> 03:09:04.530
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4429
03:09:04.560 --> 03:09:05.393
<v Speaker 6>video games without thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way dunk and looked at him when he was </v>

4430
03:09:07.441 --> 03:09:08.670
<v Speaker 6>addicted to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

4431
03:09:08.730 --> 03:09:10.200
<v Speaker 6>I think about that so much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cause you know,</v>

4432
03:09:10.201 --> 03:09:14.580
<v Speaker 6>it's like when he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it different kind of video game too.</v>

4433
03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:17.880
<v Speaker 6>He plays a video game that you become </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a part of the game.</v>

4434
03:09:17.881 --> 03:09:20.820
<v Speaker 6>He's into those like massive multiplayer</v>
<v Speaker 6>games,</v>

4435
03:09:20.990 --> 03:09:21.890
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

4436
03:09:21.990 --> 03:09:24.540
<v Speaker 6>I remember driving through the training </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the hills.</v>

4437
03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:25.171
<v Speaker 6>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4438
03:09:25.171 --> 03:09:27.840
<v Speaker 6>that's the mountains of till door or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

4439
03:09:27.980 --> 03:09:28.813
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

4440
03:09:29.090 --> 03:09:29.351
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4441
03:09:29.351 --> 03:09:31.090
<v Speaker 6>but I used to be addicted to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this sounds silly,</v>

4442
03:09:31.130 --> 03:09:32.910
<v Speaker 6>really silly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but to Tony Hawk's,</v>

4443
03:09:32.950 --> 03:09:34.000
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ice skater,</v>

4444
03:09:34.230 --> 03:09:36.730
<v Speaker 6>it was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were addicted to a skating game.</v>

4445
03:09:36.770 --> 03:09:37.603
<v Speaker 6>I was addicted to video games.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just the idea of getting into the </v>

4446
03:09:39.641 --> 03:09:42.460
<v Speaker 6>same format.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just like drinking or drugs.</v>

4447
03:09:42.461 --> 03:09:44.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure the same rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4448
03:09:44.801 --> 03:09:46.240
<v Speaker 6>and then all of a sudden the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>payoff.</v>

4449
03:09:46.300 --> 03:09:48.550
<v Speaker 6>But just imagine once this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

4450
03:09:48.551 --> 03:09:51.640
<v Speaker 6>this technology does virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 6>technology we were just looking at,</v>

4451
03:09:51.880 --> 03:09:53.950
<v Speaker 6>imagine if that becomes</v>

4452
03:09:53.980 --> 03:09:54.813
<v Speaker 4>the new video game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then things are going to be so bizarre </v>

4453
03:09:57.311 --> 03:09:58.144
<v Speaker 4>because all all they're going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do is figure out some sort of a body </v>

4454
03:10:01.291 --> 03:10:04.670
<v Speaker 4>suit that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you were where the,</v>

4455
03:10:04.671 --> 03:10:09.340
<v Speaker 4>the actions of your environment </v>
<v Speaker 4>correspond how the body suit feels like.</v>

4456
03:10:09.640 --> 03:10:13.810
<v Speaker 4>Like you could sit there with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality thing on and stand there</v>

4457
03:10:14.050 --> 03:10:14.883
<v Speaker 4>and when things grab at you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll feel like something's actually </v>

4458
03:10:17.471 --> 03:10:18.304
<v Speaker 4>grabbing you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's gonna get weirder and weirder </v>

4459
03:10:19.690 --> 03:10:21.040
<v Speaker 4>and then eventually they going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen man,</v>

4460
03:10:21.220 --> 03:10:23.110
<v Speaker 4>we can give you what we're giving you </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

4461
03:10:23.140 --> 03:10:23.973
<v Speaker 4>but it's not as good as we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what we can do is we can cut your </v>

4462
03:10:26.351 --> 03:10:27.184
<v Speaker 4>brain open and we could put these </v>
<v Speaker 4>electrodes in there and I can guarantee </v>

4463
03:10:29.921 --> 03:10:32.200
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are going to be a super person.</v>

4464
03:10:32.380 --> 03:10:34.960
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be one of the avengers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to live in the moon.</v>

4465
03:10:35.140 --> 03:10:37.840
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get your dick sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anytime you snap your finger twice,</v>

4466
03:10:38.140 --> 03:10:43.140
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a a Harem of golden</v>
<v Speaker 4>girls from planet pussy that are here to</v>

4467
03:10:44.051 --> 03:10:44.884
<v Speaker 4>suck your Dick 24 hours a day just </v>
<v Speaker 4>waiting and like a corral like </v>

4468
03:10:47.831 --> 03:10:51.550
<v Speaker 4>immigrants trying to fucking come off of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a raft and escaped to freedom.</v>

4469
03:10:51.730 --> 03:10:53.180
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going to be like every day</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your life.</v>

4470
03:10:53.240 --> 03:10:56.060
<v Speaker 6>All you gotta do is cut your head open,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it takes some wires in there.</v>

4471
03:10:56.360 --> 03:10:57.193
<v Speaker 6>What will happen is the same thing as my</v>
<v Speaker 6>wife and your wife grown chickens and </v>

4472
03:11:00.441 --> 03:11:03.020
<v Speaker 6>grown eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll all the sudden,</v>

4473
03:11:03.530 --> 03:11:04.730
<v Speaker 6>40 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll be like,</v>

4474
03:11:05.090 --> 03:11:06.890
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to have a child.</v>

4475
03:11:07.340 --> 03:11:08.570
<v Speaker 6>Like it's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

4476
03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:10.370
<v Speaker 6>Your wife does it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My wife does it.</v>

4477
03:11:10.640 --> 03:11:11.473
<v Speaker 6>They grow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have chickens and they grow eggs </v>

4478
03:11:12.861 --> 03:11:13.694
<v Speaker 6>and they fucking find some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>pleasure in like almost dislike 20 year </v>

4479
03:11:18.051 --> 03:11:22.250
<v Speaker 6>jump at 50 or jump back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like having an animal and I know you</v>

4480
03:11:22.251 --> 03:11:24.350
<v Speaker 6>love those eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know I fucking love those eggs.</v>

4481
03:11:24.351 --> 03:11:26.930
<v Speaker 6>When I cracked those eggs open and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I met.</v>

4482
03:11:26.931 --> 03:11:29.240
<v Speaker 6>I never eat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never eat scrambled eggs my life until</v>

4483
03:11:29.241 --> 03:11:32.090
<v Speaker 6>I got chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now I'm like fucking scrambled eggs.</v>

4484
03:11:32.091 --> 03:11:33.140
<v Speaker 6>You get away with eating.</v>

4485
03:11:33.170 --> 03:11:37.280
<v Speaker 6>No scrambled eggs over easy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't fuck with scrambled eggs,</v>

4486
03:11:37.430 --> 03:11:39.410
<v Speaker 6>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now that I know they're in my backyard,</v>

4487
03:11:39.411 --> 03:11:41.570
<v Speaker 6>a little wet scrambled egg with some </v>
<v Speaker 6>cheese on it.</v>

4488
03:11:41.900 --> 03:11:44.120
<v Speaker 6>That's the best God damn thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world because they're my eggs,</v>

4489
03:11:44.270 --> 03:11:45.103
<v Speaker 6>but so the same thing will happen is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that progression will give just like </v>

4490
03:11:47.481 --> 03:11:49.870
<v Speaker 6>tomatoes and cucumbers and Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all that shit.</v>

4491
03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:51.830
<v Speaker 6>We get a store back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had to grow it.</v>

4492
03:11:51.831 --> 03:11:52.664
<v Speaker 6>They never fucked with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Same thing will happen is one day </v>

4493
03:11:54.441 --> 03:11:56.000
<v Speaker 6>someone would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

4494
03:11:56.210 --> 03:11:57.043
<v Speaker 6>it's going to sound crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking about getting a hand job </v>

4495
03:11:59.390 --> 03:12:00.560
<v Speaker 6>and someone would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

4496
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:02.420
<v Speaker 6>From like a person?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

4497
03:12:02.421 --> 03:12:04.040
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to disconnect.</v>

4498
03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:06.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to get one hand job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to see what it feels like.</v>

4499
03:12:06.940 --> 03:12:10.040
<v Speaker 6>I've heard about it so tired that people</v>
<v Speaker 6>hooked up to the Matrix.</v>

4500
03:12:10.370 --> 03:12:12.020
<v Speaker 6>You wouldn't be able to jerk you off </v>
<v Speaker 6>correctly.</v>

4501
03:12:12.230 --> 03:12:13.063
<v Speaker 6>And it was like really tired,</v>
<v Speaker 6>atrophied hands because they haven't </v>

4502
03:12:15.771 --> 03:12:17.810
<v Speaker 6>moved in months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't disconnect</v>

4503
03:12:22.590 --> 03:12:23.423
<v Speaker 4>good though because they don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy and then after they're done they </v>

4504
03:12:25.171 --> 03:12:27.540
<v Speaker 4>have to rest for days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're exhausted.</v>

4505
03:12:27.930 --> 03:12:28.763
<v Speaker 4>Arm swells up with inflammation is your </v>
<v Speaker 4>tore all the ligaments and their arm </v>

4506
03:12:32.011 --> 03:12:34.530
<v Speaker 4>cause they're just not used to moving it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they jerked you off.</v>

4507
03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:35.453
<v Speaker 6>But look at you like hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hunting with the airfoil hands with the </v>

4508
03:12:41.041 --> 03:12:42.070
<v Speaker 6>eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's,</v>

4509
03:12:42.150 --> 03:12:43.140
<v Speaker 6>there's a also,</v>

4510
03:12:43.140 --> 03:12:43.973
<v Speaker 4>because we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are a part of the generation that </v>

4511
03:12:47.191 --> 03:12:49.500
<v Speaker 4>came before us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They gave birth to us,</v>

4512
03:12:49.740 --> 03:12:50.573
<v Speaker 4>you know the people for them gave birth </v>
<v Speaker 4>to them and all you have to do is go </v>

4513
03:12:52.491 --> 03:12:55.040
<v Speaker 4>back three or four times and you live on</v>
<v Speaker 4>savages.</v>

4514
03:12:55.190 --> 03:12:57.050
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not that far away.</v>

4515
03:12:57.200 --> 03:12:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Not that far away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that like five or six times.</v>

4516
03:12:59.541 --> 03:13:01.070
<v Speaker 4>You get to the point where there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>electricity.</v>

4517
03:13:01.360 --> 03:13:02.193
<v Speaker 4>He get to the point where people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>burning wood and coal and shit to stay </v>

4518
03:13:04.671 --> 03:13:06.500
<v Speaker 4>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's not that far.</v>

4519
03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:08.960
<v Speaker 4>Where you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't do that like 10 or 11 times.</v>

4520
03:13:08.961 --> 03:13:10.940
<v Speaker 4>Do you get to like barbarian type </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

4521
03:13:11.090 --> 03:13:13.190
<v Speaker 4>but then you got to keep people going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go camping.</v>

4522
03:13:13.310 --> 03:13:14.143
<v Speaker 4>But this is what I'm saying is like when</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at the future and we're </v>

4523
03:13:16.791 --> 03:13:21.530
<v Speaker 4>saying this is a real slippery slope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's always gonna be people that</v>

4524
03:13:21.531 --> 03:13:22.290
<v Speaker 4>want eggs.</v>

4525
03:13:22.290 --> 03:13:22.971
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't,</v>

4526
03:13:22.971 --> 03:13:24.830
<v Speaker 4>it was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you to cut into their brain</v>

4527
03:13:24.831 --> 03:13:25.664
<v Speaker 4>and create the perfect reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be happy with their </v>

4528
03:13:27.441 --> 03:13:31.310
<v Speaker 4>imperfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yet realistic reality.</v>

4529
03:13:31.370 --> 03:13:32.810
<v Speaker 4>I know this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

4530
03:13:32.840 --> 03:13:33.673
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to take that magic leap </v>

4531
03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:36.193
<v Speaker 4>into you drilling a hole in my head and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sticking in some sort of a Usb port and </v>

4532
03:13:40.041 --> 03:13:41.960
<v Speaker 4>plug me into the Matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not ready.</v>

4533
03:13:42.170 --> 03:13:43.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they decided to go out,</v>

4534
03:13:43.700 --> 03:13:45.650
<v Speaker 4>but their kids might not do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4535
03:13:46.280 --> 03:13:47.090
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might,</v>

4536
03:13:47.090 --> 03:13:47.923
<v Speaker 4>it might be one of those generational </v>
<v Speaker 4>things where it takes just a few </v>

4537
03:13:50.571 --> 03:13:54.380
<v Speaker 4>generations of people to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you camping?</v>

4538
03:13:55.730 --> 03:13:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Why you camping?</v>

<v Speaker 4>generation.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Those fixes in life.</v>

4559
03:14:54.710 --> 03:14:56.840
<v Speaker 4>Just throw on the goggles and be in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>

4560
03:14:56.841 --> 03:14:59.840
<v Speaker 4>It'd be really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be so connected to that technology.</v>

4561
03:14:59.841 --> 03:15:01.400
<v Speaker 4>You'd want it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could,</v>

4562
03:15:01.401 --> 03:15:03.680
<v Speaker 4>it'd be so much more spectacular than </v>
<v Speaker 4>regular life.</v>

4563
03:15:03.710 --> 03:15:05.870
<v Speaker 4>You'd want it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a real problem,</v>

4564
03:15:06.170 --> 03:15:06.831
<v Speaker 4>you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4565
03:15:06.831 --> 03:15:07.664
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you lived your life without </v>

4566
03:15:09.531 --> 03:15:10.970
<v Speaker 4>it and then all of a sudden it was an </v>
<v Speaker 4>option,</v>

4567
03:15:11.240 --> 03:15:12.073
<v Speaker 4>it'd be so you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would I do those other things like </v>

4568
03:15:14.091 --> 03:15:14.924
<v Speaker 4>I'm really confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certain options that would be </v>

4569
03:15:19.980 --> 03:15:21.530
<v Speaker 4>before people would probably a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

4570
03:15:21.531 --> 03:15:22.970
<v Speaker 4>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of hundred percent.</v>

4571
03:15:23.140 --> 03:15:23.973
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people would not be able to </v>

4572
03:15:25.161 --> 03:15:28.670
<v Speaker 4>handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like we're not born with the</v>

4573
03:15:28.671 --> 03:15:33.671
<v Speaker 4>discipline or the even the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those kinds of parameters,</v>

4574
03:15:34.940 --> 03:15:37.490
<v Speaker 4>like I think that's what's going on with</v>
<v Speaker 4>these massive multiplayer games.</v>

4575
03:15:37.491 --> 03:15:38.324
<v Speaker 4>Guys like Dunkin and you remember rob,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dude from the comedy store we've </v>

4576
03:15:40.701 --> 03:15:42.980
<v Speaker 4>talked about often who is addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everquest?</v>

4577
03:15:43.100 --> 03:15:44.450
<v Speaker 4>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same kind of stuff.</v>

4578
03:15:44.860 --> 03:15:45.693
<v Speaker 4>Do you just get you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get influenced by something that </v>

4579
03:15:48.801 --> 03:15:50.010
<v Speaker 4>you're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't</v>

4580
03:15:50.010 --> 03:15:50.843
<v Speaker 5>have an immune system for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He don't have like an intellectual </v>

4581
03:15:53.161 --> 03:15:55.590
<v Speaker 5>immune system to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4582
03:15:56.220 --> 03:15:57.053
<v Speaker 5>this is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we have to decide what we're doing </v>

4583
03:15:59.071 --> 03:15:59.904
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are we going to live in the shittiest </v>

4584
03:16:01.681 --> 03:16:02.514
<v Speaker 5>fucking neighborhood possible and rent </v>
<v Speaker 5>the worst fucking apartment possible as </v>

4585
03:16:05.761 --> 03:16:09.060
<v Speaker 5>long as it's got an internet connection </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just plug in and be there all day?</v>

4586
03:16:09.300 --> 03:16:14.220
<v Speaker 5>Or are we going to try to live a </v>
<v Speaker 5>comfortable existence on earth</v>

4587
03:16:14.260 --> 03:16:16.270
<v Speaker 4>and material earth where you can afford </v>
<v Speaker 4>to pay your bills?</v>

4588
03:16:16.271 --> 03:16:19.780
<v Speaker 4>You don't freak out and occasionally use</v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing.</v>

4589
03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:21.970
<v Speaker 4>How do we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you manage this?</v>

4590
03:16:22.240 --> 03:16:24.550
<v Speaker 4>Because if it's so much better than real</v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

4591
03:16:24.551 --> 03:16:25.384
<v Speaker 4>if you put it on and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're an avatar and it feels like </v>

4592
03:16:28.781 --> 03:16:29.614
<v Speaker 4>Avatar and you're having a fucking great</v>
<v Speaker 4>time and you're jumping through the </v>

4593
03:16:31.871 --> 03:16:34.840
<v Speaker 4>trees and landing in these hammocks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

4594
03:16:34.841 --> 03:16:35.674
<v Speaker 4>and you're all fucking flying dragons </v>
<v Speaker 4>around and going to war and getting </v>

4595
03:16:38.861 --> 03:16:42.490
<v Speaker 4>hooked up to that tree there guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's gonna be real,</v>

4596
03:16:42.580 --> 03:16:43.413
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have that where it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be something that they've </v>

4597
03:16:46.301 --> 03:16:47.134
<v Speaker 4>invented it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can send your mind and it won't </v>

4598
03:16:50.201 --> 03:16:51.034
<v Speaker 4>even be artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's not going to be like </v>

4599
03:16:52.481 --> 03:16:53.314
<v Speaker 4>some like previously created narrative </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's got a beginning and an end </v>

4600
03:16:58.480 --> 03:16:59.313
<v Speaker 4>like dragon's layer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that video game where you'd </v>

4601
03:17:01.180 --> 03:17:02.530
<v Speaker 4>fucking turn the handle to the left?</v>

4602
03:17:02.560 --> 03:17:03.393
<v Speaker 5>It's into the right</v>

4603
03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:05.500
<v Speaker 4>cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

4604
03:17:05.500 --> 03:17:06.333
<v Speaker 4>now talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about that computations are </v>

4605
03:17:08.491 --> 03:17:11.490
<v Speaker 4>gonna reach a point where it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking powerful.</v>

4606
03:17:11.640 --> 03:17:12.473
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be able to create a </v>
<v Speaker 4>real world where you're going to feel </v>

4607
03:17:14.911 --> 03:17:17.700
<v Speaker 4>pebbles into your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going gonna feel sand.</v>

4608
03:17:17.701 --> 03:17:19.210
<v Speaker 4>We're going to be thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to,</v>

4609
03:17:19.211 --> 03:17:20.044
<v Speaker 4>your Dick's going to get hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to feel like you're really </v>

4610
03:17:21.991 --> 03:17:24.180
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be indistinguishable.</v>

4611
03:17:24.181 --> 03:17:25.830
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a matter of time.</v>

4612
03:17:26.070 --> 03:17:28.950
<v Speaker 4>It's not if it's when it's 100%,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

4613
03:17:29.490 --> 03:17:33.870
<v Speaker 4>when you see that this is Morse code,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is banging on coconuts.</v>

4614
03:17:33.871 --> 03:17:36.360
<v Speaker 4>That's a smoke signal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what that is.</v>

4615
03:17:36.390 --> 03:17:37.560
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's common,</v>

4616
03:17:37.561 --> 03:17:38.000
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4617
03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:38.833
<v Speaker 5>It's going to save marriages too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you can be able to like put </v>

4618
03:17:40.471 --> 03:17:43.770
<v Speaker 5>these little yellow or green dots on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your wife and then go like,</v>

4619
03:17:43.771 --> 03:17:45.570
<v Speaker 5>download any girl you want and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4620
03:17:45.571 --> 03:17:47.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking Roseanne Barr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4621
03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:49.160
<v Speaker 5>Because we get so mad at my wife's never</v>
<v Speaker 5>greenlight.</v>

4622
03:17:49.230 --> 03:17:52.380
<v Speaker 5>And that stopped with the downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we do it without the dots tonight?</v>

4623
03:17:53.510 --> 03:17:58.510
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we do it without the dots?</v>

4624
03:18:00.160 --> 03:18:03.000
<v Speaker 5>I live a pretty amazing life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love my life.</v>

4625
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.863
<v Speaker 5>I think there were a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot to be a lot of people that trade </v>

4626
03:18:05.431 --> 03:18:07.940
<v Speaker 5>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but every now and then I'd like to throw</v>

4627
03:18:07.941 --> 03:18:08.774
<v Speaker 5>in some goggles and a bed in a hotel </v>
<v Speaker 5>room and just hang out in the room and </v>

4628
03:18:11.311 --> 03:18:12.920
<v Speaker 5>listening to guys podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

4629
03:18:12.930 --> 03:18:14.210
<v Speaker 5>that's all I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

4630
03:18:14.230 --> 03:18:15.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking,</v>

4631
03:18:15.630 --> 03:18:17.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you bringing it all back.</v>

4632
03:18:17.880 --> 03:18:18.713
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's the first thing I think is </v>

4633
03:18:20.220 --> 03:18:21.390
<v Speaker 5>those things are here.</v>

4634
03:18:21.570 --> 03:18:24.870
<v Speaker 5>We can get them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Samsung's got them plug one in.</v>

4635
03:18:25.340 --> 03:18:27.180
<v Speaker 5>Let me get those things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those things.</v>

4636
03:18:27.210 --> 03:18:28.043
<v Speaker 5>That's Nvidia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not the Samsung one is the one </v>

4637
03:18:29.791 --> 03:18:33.000
<v Speaker 5>with the cell phone and there's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>good Jason's we're talking about,</v>

4638
03:18:33.001 --> 03:18:35.880
<v Speaker 5>we've talked about it early on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Video Shit is complete next level,</v>

4639
03:18:35.910 --> 03:18:38.070
<v Speaker 5>next back to the next level on the next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>next,</v>

4640
03:18:38.071 --> 03:18:39.000
<v Speaker 5>next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>next level.</v>

4641
03:18:39.180 --> 03:18:42.300
<v Speaker 5>And when that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when that becomes something that I think</v>

4642
03:18:42.301 --> 03:18:43.134
<v Speaker 5>what we're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think we should probably talk </v>

4643
03:18:44.521 --> 03:18:48.250
<v Speaker 5>about this once we're done here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the best way to do it is to find</v>

4644
03:18:48.250 --> 03:18:52.480
<v Speaker 6>out when they're available and then like</v>
<v Speaker 6>set up some sort of a new studio.</v>

4645
03:18:52.720 --> 03:18:55.120
<v Speaker 6>Like a new room in here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got you covered.</v>

4646
03:18:55.150 --> 03:18:58.100
<v Speaker 6>You know like we have that other room.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We could do something back in there.</v>

4647
03:18:58.480 --> 03:19:01.060
<v Speaker 6>Like a room for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's based off of a room.</v>

4648
03:19:01.120 --> 03:19:01.781
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4649
03:19:01.781 --> 03:19:02.650
<v Speaker 6>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got you covered.</v>

4650
03:19:02.770 --> 03:19:03.171
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

4651
03:19:03.171 --> 03:19:04.500
<v Speaker 6>I've been approached by a bit of traffic</v>
<v Speaker 6>channel.</v>

4652
03:19:04.501 --> 03:19:08.140

<v Speaker 6>I'll fuck your mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 6>the pool table.</v>

4665
03:19:35.950 --> 03:19:36.783
<v Speaker 6>I'm a fan always of comedy of podcasting</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I can tell you what the consumer </v>

4666
03:19:41.861 --> 03:19:43.000
<v Speaker 6>wants because this is what I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how,</v>

4667
03:19:43.001 --> 03:19:46.180
<v Speaker 6>this is how I use podcasts and the way </v>
<v Speaker 6>people use it that listened to it.</v>

4668
03:19:46.410 --> 03:19:48.760
<v Speaker 6>And then when I'm on the road bike,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like to,</v>

4669

03:19:52.181 --> 03:19:55.690
<v Speaker 6>phone and I just kind of like fall </v>
<v Speaker 6>asleep and disappear into it.</v>

4671
03:19:56.560 --> 03:20:00.580
<v Speaker 6>That is the next level of podcasting I </v>
<v Speaker 6>believe because man,</v>

4672
03:20:00.581 --> 03:20:02.440
<v Speaker 6>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got a loan out on the road.</v>

4673
03:20:02.441 --> 03:20:05.890
<v Speaker 6>It would be so much easier for me to </v>
<v Speaker 6>like pour a glass of wine,</v>

4674
03:20:05.920 --> 03:20:06.753
<v Speaker 6>throw on some goggles,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they'd just be with you guys and </v>

<v Speaker 6>just be like going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

4676
03:20:09.470 --> 03:20:11.260
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's unavoidable.</v>

4677
03:20:11.290 --> 03:20:12.123
<v Speaker 6>I think the same way when you're sitting</v>
<v Speaker 6>in your man cave and you watch a </v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it plays right in front of you.</v>

4685
03:20:28.570 --> 03:20:31.420

4702
03:21:11.321 --> 03:21:12.154
<v Speaker 6>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm being dead serious when I say </v>

4703
03:21:12.851 --> 03:21:13.684
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

4704
03:21:13.700 --> 03:21:14.533
<v Speaker 6>and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've been approached for travel </v>

4705
03:21:15.671 --> 03:21:16.930
<v Speaker 6>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People have come to us and go,</v>

4706
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.831
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>could you do vr?</v>

4707
03:21:17.831 --> 03:21:19.960
<v Speaker 6>It just doesn't work for a network TV </v>
<v Speaker 6>show.</v>

4708
03:21:20.350 --> 03:21:24.040
<v Speaker 6>I'll send whatever p context.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have this way to Jamie.</v>

4709
03:21:24.110 --> 03:21:28.690
<v Speaker 6>And because as a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is what I'd like to watch.</v>

4710
03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:30.610
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to sit right there.</v>

4711
03:21:30.611 --> 03:21:33.250
<v Speaker 6>I really want to sit right here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's going to happen.</v>

4712
03:21:34.180 --> 03:21:35.550
<v Speaker 6>It's just what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

4713
03:21:35.551 --> 03:21:36.384
<v Speaker 6>we're experiencing right now is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>beginning of a new revolution in </v>

4714
03:21:39.341 --> 03:21:41.710
<v Speaker 6>entertainment where movies are going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>play out like that.</v>

4715
03:21:41.950 --> 03:21:44.950
<v Speaker 6>I think there's also going to be movies </v>
<v Speaker 6>with not just one,</v>

4716
03:21:44.960 --> 03:21:46.220
<v Speaker 6>but multiple different</v>

4717
03:21:46.220 --> 03:21:48.470
<v Speaker 4>possibilities like at every turn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

4718
03:21:48.500 --> 03:21:49.333
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's going to be interactive </v>

4719
03:21:50.271 --> 03:21:51.890
<v Speaker 4>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what they're gonna do is they're</v>

4720
03:21:51.891 --> 03:21:55.340
<v Speaker 4>going to figure out a way to engineer </v>
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality into an integrated,</v>

4721
03:21:55.670 --> 03:21:56.503
<v Speaker 4>integrated environment where the virtual</v>
<v Speaker 4>reality is interactive and there's a </v>

4722
03:22:01.101 --> 03:22:04.160
<v Speaker 4>bunch of different potentials.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like instead of like,</v>

4723
03:22:05.180 --> 03:22:06.590
<v Speaker 4>say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4724
03:22:06.620 --> 03:22:08.090
<v Speaker 4>if there's a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4725
03:22:08.091 --> 03:22:09.920
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>American Werewolf in London,</v>

4726
03:22:10.020 --> 03:22:10.853
<v Speaker 4>it's got a really specific beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a really specific moment where it </v>

4727
03:22:13.941 --> 03:22:16.490
<v Speaker 4>becomes a werewolf specific moment </v>
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>

4728
03:22:16.700 --> 03:22:17.533
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his girlfriend realizes he's aware of </v>

4729
03:22:19.311 --> 03:22:20.144
<v Speaker 4>wolf and then he gets killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all these specific moments that </v>

4730
03:22:22.760 --> 03:22:25.460
<v Speaker 4>what if instead of all those specific </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments,</v>

4731
03:22:25.640 --> 03:22:29.750
<v Speaker 4>it's completely interactive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're actually there in London and</v>

4732
03:22:29.751 --> 03:22:33.740

<v Speaker 4>friend is put my fucking mind.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're in the bogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're walking around in Scotland,</v>

<v Speaker 4>where the slaughtered lamb.</v>

03:22:46.860 --> 03:22:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Remember they had the head on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff's going to be possible.</v>

4740
03:22:50.001 --> 03:22:52.760
<v Speaker 4>You're going to feel the rain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to feel the moisture.</v>

4741
03:22:52.940 --> 03:22:55.280
<v Speaker 4>They get to do a tap into your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>dope man.</v>

4742
03:22:55.281 --> 03:22:56.114
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be able to do something</v>
<v Speaker 4>to your brain that makes you think </v>

4743
03:22:58.791 --> 03:22:59.900
<v Speaker 4>you're really experiencing it.</v>

4744
03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:02.970
<v Speaker 6>You just proved me wrong and all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>

4745
03:23:02.971 --> 03:23:04.300
<v Speaker 6>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's perfect for travel.</v>

4746
03:23:04.310 --> 03:23:05.143
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't get it.</v>

4747
03:23:05.160 --> 03:23:06.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm looking at it and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

4748
03:23:06.840 --> 03:23:07.673
<v Speaker 6>I could be in London,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like throwing goggles a be fucking </v>

4749
03:23:09.631 --> 03:23:11.910
<v Speaker 6>walking through Austria.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's going to happen.</v>

4750
03:23:11.940 --> 03:23:13.430
<v Speaker 6>That's the fucking future mining.</v>

4751
03:23:13.560 --> 03:23:14.810
<v Speaker 4>It might not happen.</v>

4752
03:23:14.850 --> 03:23:15.990
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're alive.</v>

4753
03:23:16.270 --> 03:23:17.103
<v Speaker 6>I think it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's just going to be just like </v>

4754
03:23:18.281 --> 03:23:19.114
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you go to Disneyland or anything </v>

4755
03:23:19.811 --> 03:23:20.381
<v Speaker 6>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

4756
03:23:20.381 --> 03:23:22.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm wa on the needs for speed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I need your help.</v>

4759
03:23:25.490 --> 03:23:26.323
<v Speaker 6>But to just going to be way more intense</v>
<v Speaker 6>than a horse ride at Disneyland is a </v>

4760
03:23:28.721 --> 03:23:29.280
<v Speaker 6>better example.</v>

4761
03:23:29.280 --> 03:23:30.113
<v Speaker 4>Well cause they have like 68 different </v>
<v Speaker 4>endings or different stories that play </v>

4762
03:23:34.011 --> 03:23:34.390
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

4763
03:23:34.390 --> 03:23:36.430
<v Speaker 6>Have you been on those rides where they </v>
<v Speaker 6>are like,</v>

4764

<v Speaker 6>I only know that universal in Orlando </v>
<v Speaker 6>has them,</v>

4765
03:23:39.670 --> 03:23:40.503
<v Speaker 6>but it's like the spiderman ride,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the whole crowd where it's a screen and </v>

4766
03:23:43.931 --> 03:23:44.764
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a cart that technically doesn't </v>

4767
03:23:46.361 --> 03:23:47.194
<v Speaker 6>move technically,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the screen shoots fire at you in </v>

4768
03:23:50.031 --> 03:23:50.890
<v Speaker 6>suits Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>feet.</v>

<v Speaker 6>impossible.</v>

03:24:14.240 --> 03:24:16.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't get like a little bit of video</v>

4785
03:24:16.961 --> 03:24:17.621
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

4786
03:24:17.621 --> 03:24:19.240
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to try.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Barb was shooting an episode.</v>

4787
03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:22.060
<v Speaker 6>I think people would want to see the </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit of video even till they go,</v>

4788
03:24:22.061 --> 03:24:23.530
<v Speaker 6>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even see anything.</v>

4789
03:24:23.710 --> 03:24:24.550
<v Speaker 6>And then you could explain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4790
03:24:24.590 --> 03:24:27.310
<v Speaker 6>nothing is actually happening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>

4791
03:24:27.700 --> 03:24:28.700
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's uh,</v>

4792
03:24:28.810 --> 03:24:31.480
<v Speaker 6>it's like the raiders of the lost ark or</v>
<v Speaker 6>writers a little bit like that,</v>

4793
03:24:31.720 --> 03:24:35.040
<v Speaker 6>but a little more driven thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The raiders of the lost Ark is moving,</v>

4794
03:24:35.150 --> 03:24:39.130
<v Speaker 6>goes fucking rods blow me away every </v>
<v Speaker 6>time when you go,</v>

4795
03:24:39.310 --> 03:24:42.310
<v Speaker 6>when it's just a screen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am like a child,</v>

4796
03:24:42.311 --> 03:24:43.700
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Ha,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I guess that's the premise of the show </v>

4799
03:24:47.071 --> 03:24:48.030
<v Speaker 6>also.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But man,</v>

4801
03:24:53.731 --> 03:24:55.170
<v Speaker 6>like that times a million.</v>

<v Speaker 6>comparison to soccer.</v>

<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>soccer was very popular in the 70s never</v>

<v Speaker 6>talk about around a campfire flashing.</v>

4840
03:26:25.351 --> 03:26:26.184
<v Speaker 6>Your lights went to the other car when </v>
<v Speaker 6>there is no headlights on and you're </v>

4841
03:26:28.051 --> 03:26:29.940

<v Speaker 6>I think I saw a movie with Ethan Hawke </v>

4844

<v Speaker 6>about the terrible Richard Gere.</v>

4849
03:26:48.630 --> 03:26:49.463
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just wondering because I keep </v>

4850
03:26:50.131 --> 03:26:51.780
<v Speaker 6>feeling like I should wrap it up into </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

4851
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:53.520
<v Speaker 6>You want to wrap it?</v>

4853
03:26:55.711 --> 03:26:56.544
<v Speaker 6>We fake wrapped it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can figure out if it not wrapping it </v>

4854
03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:00.930
<v Speaker 6>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Another conversation just got perfect.</v>

4855
03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:02.820
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's good.</v>

4856
03:27:02.821 --> 03:27:05.880
<v Speaker 6>It's in a good place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm very happy.</v>

4857
03:27:06.270 --> 03:27:09.590
<v Speaker 6>I've gotten over the stupor of about 40 </v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes ago where I was so high shit and</v>

4858
03:27:09.591 --> 03:27:14.591
<v Speaker 6>I've been talking to anybody that I hit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hit a moment where I was like,</v>

4859
03:27:15.630 --> 03:27:16.710
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait.</v>

4860
03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:20.640
<v Speaker 6>My idea was good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

4861
03:27:20.641 --> 03:27:22.740
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't remember what it was halfway </v>
<v Speaker 6>into it.</v>

4862
03:27:23.010 --> 03:27:25.260
<v Speaker 6>The idea of being like pick a regular </v>
<v Speaker 6>job and a,</v>

4863
03:27:25.420 --> 03:27:27.420
<v Speaker 6>if like eight out of 10 people that came</v>
<v Speaker 6>there wanting to fuck you,</v>

4864
03:27:28.130 --> 03:27:28.963
<v Speaker 6>but it probably,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if a girl was Washington guys balls and </v>

4865
03:27:30.181 --> 03:27:31.014
<v Speaker 6>Asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll probably be more than eight out of </v>

4866
03:27:31.591 --> 03:27:32.910
<v Speaker 6>10.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm probably really conservative.</v>

4867
03:27:33.740 --> 03:27:34.573
<v Speaker 6>But this girl that was she,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean she knew that was a part of her </v>

4868
03:27:36.421 --> 03:27:37.350
<v Speaker 6>job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She made more money.</v>

4869
03:27:37.410 --> 03:27:38.243
<v Speaker 6>It's a different gig.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw you hit that joint more than I've </v>

4870
03:27:40.021 --> 03:27:40.860
<v Speaker 6>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You had a joint.</v>

4871
03:27:41.020 --> 03:27:42.100
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty strong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pretty</v>

4872
03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:43.360
<v Speaker 4>strong stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were deep.</v>

4873
03:27:43.730 --> 03:27:48.640
<v Speaker 4>Who went in the hole deep in the rabbit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

4874

<v Speaker 4>Soliciting crusher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A who gives a fuck?</v>

4875
03:27:51.570 --> 03:27:53.550

<v Speaker 4>He's got to have a lean,</v>

4876
03:27:53.560 --> 03:27:55.690
<v Speaker 4>is trying to kill his neighbor's dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know about that?</v>

4880
03:28:03.521 --> 03:28:05.560
<v Speaker 4>pig.</v>

4881
03:28:05.800 --> 03:28:06.633
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the technical name for what kind of an </v>

4882
03:28:09.181 --> 03:28:12.100

<v Speaker 4>flank them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get on the side of them and they </v>

<v Speaker 4>just fuck it all run at him and tear him</v>
<v Speaker 4>apart.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Those are aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't really go after people.</v>

4899
03:28:53.770 --> 03:28:54.603
<v Speaker 4>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a really interesting thing about </v>

4900
03:28:55.530 --> 03:29:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Havalinas there a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an animal that responds in an insane way</v>

4901
03:29:01.420 --> 03:29:02.253
<v Speaker 4>to what's called a Predator call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a Predator call is look at the </v>

4902

<v Speaker 4>fucking teeth on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how the biggest Havalina,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they're not that big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're fucking for Roche.</v>

4904
03:29:12.420 --> 03:29:15.340
<v Speaker 4>These are ferocious animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so powerful.</v>

4905
03:29:15.820 --> 03:29:17.590
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they take this sound,</v>

4906
03:29:17.591 --> 03:29:19.660
<v Speaker 4>a Predator call is like a sound of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

4907
03:29:19.661 --> 03:29:21.390
<v Speaker 4>It's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have this thing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like something in agony and pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These motherfuckers come running like </v>

4910
03:29:34.001 --> 03:29:35.200
<v Speaker 4>described it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

4911
03:29:35.230 --> 03:29:36.063
<v Speaker 4>havoline has come to a Predator call the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way you wish all animals came to a </v>

4912

<v Speaker 4>Like it's a race between them and all </v>

4915
03:29:47.921 --> 03:29:51.880
<v Speaker 4>the other monsters behind them that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>chasing to try to find this rabbit.</v>

4916
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.983
<v Speaker 4>It's screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're probably broke its leg or </v>

4917
03:29:54.251 --> 03:29:56.950
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Wild animals are solo.</v>

4923

<v Speaker 4>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The wild of being a fucking peccary </v>

4924
03:30:17.380 --> 03:30:18.213
<v Speaker 4>running around and dug stan hopes </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood trying to get by in the </v>

4925
03:30:20.441 --> 03:30:22.450
<v Speaker 4>desert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven miles away from Mexico.</v>

4926
03:30:23.320 --> 03:30:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen man on a buffalo?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've met this guy.</v>

4927
03:30:25.511 --> 03:30:26.344
<v Speaker 4>He rides a buffalo around like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>horse and then he gets attacked by a </v>

4928
03:30:28.841 --> 03:30:30.670
<v Speaker 4>cougar and say as a baby and all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

4929
03:30:30.671 --> 03:30:33.310

<v Speaker 4>that's really good.</v>

4930
03:30:33.610 --> 03:30:36.160
<v Speaker 4>And I highly recommend episodes of man </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Buffalo.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That</v>

4933
03:30:40.070 --> 03:30:45.070
<v Speaker 6>is the perfect sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dropped a fucking champ.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

4939
03:31:00.201 --> 03:31:04.350

<v Speaker 6>animals baby in the middle of nowhere we</v>

4940

<v Speaker 6>it's not that aggressive.</v>

4978
03:32:24.410 --> 03:32:26.060
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like Paul Paul.</v>

<v Speaker 6>how to handle an animal like that.</v>

4982
03:32:36.050 --> 03:32:37.820
<v Speaker 6>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I fought a bear,</v>

4983
03:32:38.120 --> 03:32:39.110
<v Speaker 6>I saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I reached out,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty fucked up.</v>

4990
03:32:54.230 --> 03:32:58.730
<v Speaker 6>But like when you fight a bear or are </v>
<v Speaker 6>you fighting a lion,</v>

4991
03:32:59.380 --> 03:33:02.350
<v Speaker 6>it really is uninteresting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4992
03:33:02.940 --> 03:33:05.360
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot of like interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

4993
03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:07.040
<v Speaker 6>it's scary for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And doing it.</v>

4994
03:33:07.041 --> 03:33:09.170
<v Speaker 6>But when you watch it on video,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a lot like,</v>

4995
03:33:10.040 --> 03:33:10.873
<v Speaker 6>it's a lot more dramatic for you in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>moment than it looks because they're </v>

4996
03:33:14.451 --> 03:33:17.090
<v Speaker 6>very fucking team.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

03:33:17.091 --> 03:33:17.900
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so yeah,</v>

4998
03:33:17.900 --> 03:33:20.050
<v Speaker 6>so if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I told her on Ari's,</v>

<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5001
03:33:24.830 --> 03:33:26.390
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's literally like you feel like you're</v>

5002
03:33:26.391 --> 03:33:28.100
<v Speaker 6>getting lifted off the ground and shaken</v>
<v Speaker 6>by your head,</v>

5003
03:33:28.310 --> 03:33:29.660
<v Speaker 6>but they're just moving you around a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit.</v>

5004
03:33:29.661 --> 03:33:33.380
<v Speaker 6>But they're so fucking powerful that </v>
<v Speaker 6>literally to watch that.</v>

5005
