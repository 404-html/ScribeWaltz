<v Speaker 1>They're tuning in.</v>

10
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Week number five,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

13
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>we've been having a good fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a good God downtown in Boston.</v>

14
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this yesterday,</v>

15
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>but we'll talk about it again just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Eddie's here.</v>

16
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.680
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking crazy when I asked on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage how many people listened to the </v>

17
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this,</v>

18
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>the ability that you have when everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>went crazy,</v>

19
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>it was like this huge audience and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

20
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd say like 60 percent of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy percent of them said they </v>

21
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.370
<v Speaker 1>listened to the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

22
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.170
<v Speaker 1>So it's only going to keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So only as long as you make things that </v>

23
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>people think are interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only going to like,</v>

24
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is radio.</v>

25
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.940
<v Speaker 1>It says this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just as powerful as any radio </v>

26
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.940
<v Speaker 1>station that's ever existed</v>

27
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 2>without the bullshit and drama and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit is just straight up talking.</v>

28
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.910
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck happened to that kid?</v>

29
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we are.</v>

30
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm a terrible camera man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look as sharp.</v>

31
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Brian's off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking Brian is off in Ohio with </v>

32
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.120
<v Speaker 2>his lady friend or right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the family.</v>

33
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can a good God damn time getting the</v>

34
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:40.850
<v Speaker 2>free gun as far with any problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

35
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Rob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's strange character?</v>

36
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You all understand Eddie Bravo in the </v>

37
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.351
<v Speaker 2>10th planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reality Show comes to light 10th planet </v>

38
00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:53.351
<v Speaker 2>Riverside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is respect.</v>

39
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because I was talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the phone last week and you said that</v>

40
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:01.841
<v Speaker 2>you went to see a shitty movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're one of the few people like </v>

41
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:05.351
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ticket shitty movie and make it </v>

42
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:05.351
<v Speaker 2>work for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

43
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Like we really make it work for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see what the bad points on.</v>

44
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 2>You said you watched the expendables or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever and it's so weird how we </v>

45
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 2>learned that from Paul Mooney.</v>

46
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 2>We had a conversation once about when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a comedian,</v>

47
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:15.680
<v Speaker 2>you should get entertained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you something.</v>

48
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 2>The last two weeks I've done something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has blown me apart.</v>

49
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 2>I went to see a different form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>

50
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I want to watch Eddie Bravo teach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

51
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:25.760
<v Speaker 2>that's entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that place is,</v>

52
00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 2>the way you sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a big fucking states.</v>

53
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Like if I had one man show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do it there with the mats facing</v>

54
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:36.341
<v Speaker 2>everything and I still here and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first week he taught this move where </v>

55
00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:41.140
<v Speaker 2>you're hitting the guy and then you roll</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take his leg and the guy gives you </v>

56
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.140
<v Speaker 2>an arm so you have three different </v>
<v Speaker 2>options.</v>

57
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 2>And then last week he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you were there,</v>

58
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:44.540
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the fucking movie.</v>

59
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Speaker 2>It's got to let it go and you're hitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

60
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 2>You're on his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you take this leg and you hook double</v>

61
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:54.491
<v Speaker 2>hook on this leg and you pull over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he didn't take his arm from spider </v>

62
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:54.491
<v Speaker 2>web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

63
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no truck.</v>

64
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really cool.</v>

65
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 2>But just the way that he was teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you remember that.</v>

66
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Come on dog.</v>

67
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 3>If I didn't want my dog was just making </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit up.</v>

68
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 3>I thought you would know because in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of the DVD,</v>

69
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because at that point you didn't really </v>

70
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 3>know the system at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the beauty of it is you were just</v>

71
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:16.351
<v Speaker 3>talking about night of the living dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I flip you with the butterfly </v>

72
00:03:16.351 --> 00:03:19.531
<v Speaker 3>hooks and then last week you start on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys back with your two hooks in the</v>

73
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 3>guy in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks you're going to choke them out</v>

74
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 3>and you flip over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say you got this leg,</v>

75
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 3>you hook them with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it to the truck,</v>

76
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got the truck.</v>

77
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.190
<v Speaker 3>And it was really weird how I went home </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it fucked with me that night I was </v>

78
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.330
<v Speaker 3>doing to accommodate it affected you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if it fucked up.</v>

79
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Like I thought about it when I left </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and then I went the other night </v>

80
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.741
<v Speaker 3>which was a very simple hold where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was controlling the guy with the under </v>

81
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:40.980
<v Speaker 3>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you're really good at.</v>

82
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 3>He said George Sada Rapa is in town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been in town for the last two </v>

83
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.251
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we've been focusing on over hook </v>

84
00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 3>butterfly stuff to rubber guard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

85
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.710
<v Speaker 3>but the point being that the situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>was that I was very intrigued while I </v>

86
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 3>was watching him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't get intrigued by Dick.</v>

87
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.670
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go see Avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these movies don't do well when </v>

88
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.151
<v Speaker 3>someone's really good at tapping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone's really good at something </v>

89
00:04:06.151 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 3>and really good at speaking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that's always fascinated me,</v>

90
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.090
<v Speaker 3>how he walks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he keeps it.</v>

91
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.320
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like a standup comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He walks in a certain area so people </v>

92
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 3>have to look at it and he doesn't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what he's doing.</v>

93
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just being him,</v>

94
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 3>he commands attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

95
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 3>He's not a big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a flamboyant guy,</v>

96
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't take my eyes off.</v>

97
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Are you gay for Eddie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie?</v>

98
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about what I learned this </v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

99
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 3>so we just came out to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm supposed to go into the bucket.</v>

100
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm supposed to go to the theater and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see some fucking guy.</v>

101
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 3>That's not funny and being at the but </v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys are funny,</v>

102
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.100
<v Speaker 3>but I have went to see different in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu class and was very entertained </v>

103
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.900
<v Speaker 3>them was very interesting and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole point of this.</v>

104
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't about the UCB theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is you that you really </v>

105
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 3>locked me in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was very,</v>

106
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever,</v>

107
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you locked me in all the time.</v>

108
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 3>So you know that when you're onstage you</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn something.</v>

109
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.900
<v Speaker 3>You know how fucking much great shit I </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about you to everybody.</v>

110
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 3>That's what I tell everybody is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ringing all the time.</v>

111
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

112
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Everybody recognizes game business </v>
<v Speaker 3>originally with the 10th planet.</v>

113
00:05:07.581 --> 00:05:12.581
<v Speaker 3>Kush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Originally it was going to be the both </v>

114
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:12.581
<v Speaker 3>of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when joe was around I'm like,</v>

115
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.700
<v Speaker 3>why would I want to put the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera on me and I'm just going to keep </v>

116

<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

117
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 3>I can't really speak my mind anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like being really honest.</v>

118
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.120
<v Speaker 3>I can't really do that on other people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings.</v>

119
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 3>I can't really be that honest and Joey </v>
<v Speaker 3>can just smash people.</v>

120
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.200
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if I didn't say it.</v>

121
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if dudes get upset at some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your predictions.</v>

122
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Davis was Davis burned the kilt though.</v>

00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 3>So I barely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I barely know what.</v>

138
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm just navigating the strip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with Brian hit a fucking thing,</v>

00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

140
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:21.930
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're talking about this,</v>

141
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 3>this review we're talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually just being released as we speak</v>

142
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 10th planet Kirsch,</v>

143
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 3>episode 19 featuring Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one.</v>

144
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:35.771
<v Speaker 3>It's up like right this second probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Joey fucking goes off and I got to </v>

145
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 3>put.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to put like a warning thing before</v>

146
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The views of jelly karate do not reflect</v>

147
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 3>the views of Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

148
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 3>I got to put that up.</v>

149
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love.</v>

150
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll see.</v>

151
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:54.911
<v Speaker 3>You'll see what we mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was funny because I said I read </v>

152
00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:54.911
<v Speaker 3>something that Dana had mentioned that </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his name,</v>

153
00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 3>choked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I started taking about Kenny Florian</v>

154
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 3>and I started taking a bite and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

155
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 3>how can I say that about a guy that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>never tried what he's doing,</v>

156
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 3>like this is to the port and point in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life where I'm at.</v>

157
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 3>I can never say somebody choked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

158
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 3>maybe you had a bad day or then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started thinking about here like six bad</v>

159
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

160
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.030
<v Speaker 3>but I never said he choked her like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

161
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.750
<v Speaker 3>All I said was I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said was he was the skinniest Jesus.</v>

162
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will see exactly what you said </v>

163
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.760
<v Speaker 3>when they watched the episode last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

164
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.760
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

165

<v Speaker 3>people don't know what we're talking </v>

166
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.901
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey does this break down to the UFC as </v>

168
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.611
<v Speaker 3>probably even if you're not a UFC fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably the funniest fucking </v>

169
00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:33.790
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You walk in the Internet,</v>

<v Speaker 3>most entertaining reviews of UFC </v>

171
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 3>previews and review.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes we review a show.</v>

172
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes there's is nothing out there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that Shit's entertaining to a point,</v>

175
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:59.861
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how many times I </v>

<v Speaker 3>fuck you want it to last 30 minutes and </v>

178
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:07.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm always find three or three and three</v>
<v Speaker 3>might pick some money.</v>

179
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 3>You understand it because I've learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>from these guys and I know what it is to</v>

<v Speaker 3>get beat up.</v>

181
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.420
<v Speaker 3>So I watched these fights and that's how</v>
<v Speaker 3>I picked the things that I've been like </v>

185
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't want him to see that many guys </v>

<v Speaker 3>insight from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from like any articles or any </v>

<v Speaker 3>from mma forums I think do have more </v>

193
00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 3>opinions and better opinions and points </v>
<v Speaker 3>of view on MMA forums.</v>

194
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:54.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's some very good writers as </v>

195
00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:57.791
<v Speaker 3>you're right on the underground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's guys who are running the </v>

<v Speaker 3>underground,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a magazine.</v>

199
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:04.491
<v Speaker 3>This is like really well written,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really well written breakdown of the </v>

200
00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:04.491
<v Speaker 3>event of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a guy's performance.</v>

201
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.770
<v Speaker 3>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just because a guy has a job with </v>

202
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.981
<v Speaker 3>Yahoo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it make them more credible than </v>

203
00:09:12.981 --> 00:09:14.390
<v Speaker 3>mcfuck stick one on the underground?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just human beings just right and</v>

204
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 3>they need to be official on ESPN DOT </v>
<v Speaker 3>com.</v>

205
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:23.001
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a interacting with people in the </v>

206
00:09:23.001 --> 00:09:23.001
<v Speaker 3>underground and getting someone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>

207
00:09:23.001 --> 00:09:26.600
<v Speaker 3>You get a bit more insight as to how </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights going to go down from that and I </v>

208
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 3>think than any of the websites online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

209
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 3>the one time I do like hearing what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter actually has to say about a </v>

210
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.561
<v Speaker 3>fight the one time when they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about stuff that the public and me </v>

211
00:09:36.561 --> 00:09:40.970
<v Speaker 3>included really don't know about what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really going on in that fucking cage.</v>

212
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.850
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very few people experience fighting in </v>

213
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.061
<v Speaker 3>front of the fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when a guy is breaking down a fight </v>

214
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:50.330
<v Speaker 3>and they see something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a chink in that guy's armor,</v>

215
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.340
<v Speaker 3>like he folds or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe fighters can after awhile </v>

216
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 3>some fighters are known as folders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

217
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:58.600
<v Speaker 3>They just fold under the pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

218
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.620
<v Speaker 3>and I'm a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that quicker than the average </v>

219
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I like that kind of incentive.</v>

220
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:09.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a time when I was doing </v>

221
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.341
<v Speaker 3>commentary with Randy and I'm a dude got</v>
<v Speaker 3>poked in the eye and the referee went </v>

222
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:10.780
<v Speaker 3>over to him and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenya,</v>

223
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 3>see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

224
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:12.590
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

225
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>

226
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Randy got angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Randy goes,</v>

227
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:17.160
<v Speaker 3>you never tell them you can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

228
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:19.200
<v Speaker 3>if he tells him he can't see it means he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want to fight.</v>

229
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

230
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 3>He got like really intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like his crazy,</v>

231

<v Speaker 3>They just were kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take a guy down and dive on leg </v>

290
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.080

<v Speaker 3>feet pretty easy and a lot of dudes were</v>

<v Speaker 3>his hand way back.</v>

303
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 3>So he was basically just punching you </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>

304

<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>pictures and then you watch the pictures</v>
<v Speaker 3>of us.</v>

327
00:14:52.321 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 3>How your memories become memories of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You actually remember that those are </v>
<v Speaker 3>your memories.</v>

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know if you use them,</v>

332
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.870
<v Speaker 1>if it's a memory that's never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up.</v>

333
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to retrieve if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any emotional like bearing </v>

334
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.171
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have memories from my early </v>

335
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:12.171
<v Speaker 1>childhood because they were like strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>

336
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:14.370
<v Speaker 1>That meant something to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned something from that experience</v>

337
00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:17.220
<v Speaker 1>but like a regular memory just hanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with somebody.</v>

340
00:15:21.871 --> 00:15:24.540
<v Speaker 1>As I get older I feel like I have less </v>
<v Speaker 1>room on my hard drive.</v>

341
00:15:24.541 --> 00:15:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I got an old hard drive dump</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

342
00:15:28.771 --> 00:15:30.300
<v Speaker 1>but I do remember the important stuff.</v>

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Ken Shamrock told me,</v>

347
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:46.290
<v Speaker 3>Ken Shamrock told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out of his mouth and all those </v>

348
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.071
<v Speaker 3>pancreas fights were worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never set up except except for when </v>

349
00:15:50.801 --> 00:15:53.230
<v Speaker 3>foreigners fought each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would just let them fight.</v>

350
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when it was Japanese against a </v>

351
00:15:58.830 --> 00:15:59.230
<v Speaker 3>foreigner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he said he was.</v>

352
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:04.290
<v Speaker 3>He actually worked for the Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in pancreas as their American to </v>

353
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.310
<v Speaker 3>fight so they can mix it in with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>European.</v>

354
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.720
<v Speaker 3>That's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

355
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:13.140
<v Speaker 3>I was brought in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be really good at the same </v>

356
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:13.140
<v Speaker 3>time because he said he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to be really,</v>

357
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.020
<v Speaker 3>really good because you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

358
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.040
<v Speaker 3>if you had to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked you to take them to the later</v>

359
00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:23.041
<v Speaker 3>rounds or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take them late into the fact you got to </v>

360
00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:23.041
<v Speaker 3>be good enough to.</v>

361
00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Cause sometimes the foreigners didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know they were fixed.</v>

362
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.930
<v Speaker 3>He said the foreigners didn't always </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

363
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
<v Speaker 3>but we would control it like we were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the foreigners,</v>

364
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.970
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to make sure just didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>knock them out.</v>

365
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:36.190
<v Speaker 3>He sounded with him that we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create characters and do different shit.</v>

366
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.010
<v Speaker 3>What they do with the phone or got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did this is just all.</v>

367
00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:41.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this is true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about gambling.</v>

368
00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:42.670
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>

369
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.780
<v Speaker 3>but it's fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

370
00:16:43.781 --> 00:16:45.190
<v Speaker 3>if it's all about predicting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outcome.</v>

371
00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Is it like pro wrestling with fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was.</v>

372
00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a half pro-wrestling half</v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

373
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.340
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a pancreas,</v>

374
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.240
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

375
00:16:55.241 --> 00:16:56.850
<v Speaker 3>This is what Ken shamrock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

376
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.840
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't know it because I do know one</v>

377
00:16:58.841 --> 00:17:01.740

<v Speaker 3>Alan goes was all over frank shamrock.</v>

381
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:18.180
<v Speaker 3>You could if you grabbed the rope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you got to let go of the hold and </v>

382
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.760
<v Speaker 3>start again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're a fucking hold of.</v>

383
00:17:18.761 --> 00:17:22.030
<v Speaker 3>You can grab the rope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Alan goes,</v>

384
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.540
<v Speaker 3>was over frank shamrock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

385
00:17:24.541 --> 00:17:25.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just started greg.</v>

386
00:17:25.451 --> 00:17:26.560
<v Speaker 3>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was so green,</v>

387
00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:30.310
<v Speaker 3>he really didn't know Jujitsu that well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just a real natural athlete,</v>

388
00:17:30.311 --> 00:17:31.420
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong.</v>

389
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:36.450
<v Speaker 3>He was always explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just a fitness fucking </v>

390
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:36.450
<v Speaker 3>powerhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he knew some,</v>

391
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.450
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit from Ken Shamrock,</v>

392
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.730
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't that good at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Alan goes,</v>

393
00:17:39.731 --> 00:17:43.070
<v Speaker 3>was all over him and if it wasn't for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ropes he would've fucking um,</v>

394
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:48.300
<v Speaker 3>but at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>frank shamrock guide them in a fucking </v>

395
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 3>foot lock dude and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't reach the any fucking jacked</v>

396
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 1>him and broke his ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

397
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like a draw I think.</v>

398
00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly if there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was a disqualification,</v>

399
00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something at the end.</v>

400
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know Alan gross was all over </v>

401
00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:04.220
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got saved at Frank Shamrock.</v>

402
00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:08.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm saving the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end he got them in an </v>

403
00:18:08.951 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>ankle lock man and an allen goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't defend ride and he broke it.</v>

404
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.970
<v Speaker 1>He screams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screams.</v>

405
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised that frank shamrock retired.</v>

406
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised commentator for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strikeforce,</v>

407
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.970
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't retired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he retired.</v>

408
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:22.500
<v Speaker 1>He had a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big dude.</v>

409
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 1>He retired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a big ceremony,</v>

410
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:29.950
<v Speaker 1>stood in the middle of the octagon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how many times as he retired.</v>

411
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Many times I'll honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

412
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Farewell Tours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically he's had several farewell </v>

413
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.330
<v Speaker 1>tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barrel.</v>

414
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you think,</v>

415
00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:44.760
<v Speaker 1>can you think frank shamrock getting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that cage,</v>

416
00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 1>just bow and everybody's just publicity </v>
<v Speaker 1>stunt,</v>

417
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>but eventually he's going to come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make it.</v>

418
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really big deal.</v>

419
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:54.291
<v Speaker 1>Who's coming back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say it was a publicity </v>

420
00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:54.291
<v Speaker 1>stunt because maybe he believes he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really retiring,</v>

421
00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>but I believe and he hasn't made that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much money.</v>

422
00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:01.610
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't made that much money and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all these boxes that have made </v>

423
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:01.620
<v Speaker 1>gazillions and boxing and happens all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

424
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.680
<v Speaker 1>All of these five bucks than lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>because though you get used to the </v>

425
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:06.680
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

426
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:06.680
<v Speaker 1>If I fight again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could fight for like,</v>

427
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.540
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make $500,000.</v>

428
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.570
<v Speaker 1>That means a lot to these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys aren't rich will come back.</v>

429
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.130
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How will always come back?</v>

430
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I think he's coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in his late thirties,</v>

431
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I believe he's about 37.</v>

432
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he even guys with millions come back for</v>

433
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:22.470
<v Speaker 1>the money and he didn't make no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

434
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 1>he's a smart guy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't to them.</v>

435
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he's.</v>

436
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I think he could do anything and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he decides that he doesn't want to </v>

437
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.850
<v Speaker 1>compete anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should you compete?</v>

438
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.130
<v Speaker 1>If it's not as hard anymore and he feels</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his performances reflect that,</v>

439
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 1>why not just step down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not stop doing it?</v>

440
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:42.321
<v Speaker 1>If you can get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem with fighters is at a </v>

441
00:19:42.321 --> 00:19:44.901
<v Speaker 1>certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your self esteem and your self worth </v>

442
00:19:44.901 --> 00:19:46.860
<v Speaker 1>evolves completely around your ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight and beat people up and when you</v>

443
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:48.540
<v Speaker 1>can't do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like a loser.</v>

444
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.610
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys,</v>

445
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.470
<v Speaker 1>they don't even know who they are when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they stopped competing because it's such</v>

446
00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:57.471
<v Speaker 1>an intense experience that a giant chunk</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their life is dedicated to getting </v>

447
00:19:57.471 --> 00:19:58.710
<v Speaker 1>really good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to getting good at fighting.</v>

448
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Their whole life revolves around their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and then when they're not </v>

449
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.710
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're lost.</v>

450
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was doing comedy and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking,</v>

451
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.960
<v Speaker 1>one of the best things that happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me is I tore my acl and the reason being</v>

452
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:14.961
<v Speaker 1>is I couldn't train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do anything and I certainly </v>

453
00:20:14.961 --> 00:20:14.961
<v Speaker 1>couldn't fight and I needed an </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation,</v>

454
00:20:14.961 --> 00:20:18.270
<v Speaker 1>but it took competing as an option away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>

455
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.270
<v Speaker 1>I was 21 years old and it took it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I was like,</v>

456
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't compete anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my legs fucked.</v>

457
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I do have to concentrate in the </v>

458
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:28.460
<v Speaker 1>next phase of my life because otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about martial arts was,</v>

459
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.590
<v Speaker 1>this is the only thing I'd ever done </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was I was good at.</v>

460
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.310
<v Speaker 1>So I would do other things that suck </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

461
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm good at this.</v>

462
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck am I doing?</v>

463
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Why am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I,</v>

464
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.010
<v Speaker 1>why am I getting away from this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brain would be like,</v>

465
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be terrible at it.</v>

466
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Do something to be good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if there's no fucking money in it.</v>

467
00:20:42.211 --> 00:20:43.860
<v Speaker 1>No future in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.570
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

469
00:20:44.571 --> 00:20:45.840
<v Speaker 1>you can get really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

470
00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 1>really attached to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of who you are and being a fighter,</v>

471
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.730
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for those guys to </v>
<v Speaker 1>step away.</v>

472
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call it the glory.</v>

473
00:20:53.471 --> 00:20:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Everybody says the glory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's far more complicated than that.</v>

474
00:20:56.291 --> 00:21:01.291
<v Speaker 1>It's who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all of a sudden their life is not </v>

475
00:21:01.291 --> 00:21:04.651
<v Speaker 1>wrapped around training camps and </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparing and improving your skills to </v>

476
00:21:04.651 --> 00:21:08.551
<v Speaker 1>face the next level and to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top and you get your title back once </v>

477
00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:09.250
<v Speaker 1>you've lost it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that anymore.</v>

478
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Now it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just a regular dude.</v>

479
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were just a regular dude,</v>

480
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:14.020
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing sad about being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular dude,</v>

481
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:19.350
<v Speaker 1>but I guess if you're a fighter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd go to become just being a regular </v>

482
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.600
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of them,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's just too much to handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want them to normal life.</v>

484
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.110
<v Speaker 1>They're wired for fucking craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

486
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.110
<v Speaker 1>That shit's hard to walk away from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:12.850
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think if you had a.</v>

606
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.750
<v Speaker 3>I think if you had a black belt in </v>
<v Speaker 3>karate and some states still your hand.</v>

607
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.680
<v Speaker 3>I say that's ever been the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you never heard about that.</v>

608
00:26:30.681 --> 00:26:32.120
<v Speaker 3>I've heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People heard about it,</v>

609
00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:33.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just things that people make up.</v>

610
00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any place that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you register.</v>

611
00:26:36.501 --> 00:26:41.501
<v Speaker 3>Your hands is deadly weapon closet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost positive 100 percent we got on.</v>

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 3>It was very short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not true.</v>

613
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.460
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just looked very upset.</v>

<v Speaker 3>ever goes down.</v>

615
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 3>You always lose because that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not necessarily the case.</v>

641
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:01.860
<v Speaker 3>a lot of scrambling the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tough to see what's going on,</v>

642
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 3>but seconds later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe four,</v>

643
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:09.050
<v Speaker 3>maybe five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dudes unconscious on the ground and </v>

647
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:11.420
<v Speaker 3>like a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>

648
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.290
<v Speaker 3>he's an action hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like Spiderman.</v>

649
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.560
<v Speaker 3>He just blast this dude out of nowhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they all got it on video and you </v>

650
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:18.600
<v Speaker 3>can't say anything because the guy hit a</v>
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>

651
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:23.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like the perfect scenario is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a guy using his martial arts for </v>

652
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:24.870
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unquestionably.</v>

653
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:30.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in a place where a guy assaults a </v>

654
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:30.690
<v Speaker 3>woman and does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hits her with a sucker punch.</v>

655
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 3>He confronts the man with his hands up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a passive way like this.</v>

656
00:28:34.021 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.630
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just knocked out a girl like,</v>

658
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.870
<v Speaker 3>surely it's got to be a reason for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

659
00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

660
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.980
<v Speaker 3>that girl killed my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

661
00:28:40.981 --> 00:28:41.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never know.</v>

662
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.200
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a bitch ass.</v>

663
00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:45.810
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not your bitch ass out to roger were</v>

664
00:28:45.811 --> 00:28:47.340
<v Speaker 3>to kick his ass and it's all on video.</v>

665
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.530
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roger worth the captain.</v>

666
00:28:49.531 --> 00:28:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Save a hoe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

667
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give him a Cape right now.</v>

668
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.540
<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he meant to do and I think</v>

669
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:59.541
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't help himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that guy went through a lot of </v>

670
00:28:59.541 --> 00:28:59.541
<v Speaker 3>abuse when he was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

671
00:28:59.541 --> 00:29:03.800
<v Speaker 3>he's very sensitive to bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when he sees a situation like </v>

672
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.651
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you have to step in and do </v>

673
00:29:06.651 --> 00:29:06.651
<v Speaker 3>something like that girl just got </v>
<v Speaker 3>punched.</v>

674
00:29:06.651 --> 00:29:08.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean even if it was for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what could it have been?</v>

675
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

676
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.940
<v Speaker 3>what's the reason to walk up to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken sucker?</v>

677
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:13.150
<v Speaker 3>Punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drown your puppy.</v>

678
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.510
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The is it.</v>

679
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.370
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I sucker punch a check.</v>

680
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:24.380
<v Speaker 3>Let me think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would have had to have the keys to </v>

681
00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:24.630
<v Speaker 3>the nuclear bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was writing.</v>

682
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.350
<v Speaker 3>She stole my fucking phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would fuck if she's still on my phone.</v>

683
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.010
<v Speaker 3>I would sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

684
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:35.260
<v Speaker 3>That's all tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A girl has to steal your phone and </v>

685
00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:35.260

<v Speaker 3>isolation tank and that's the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory behind lives.</v>

743
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.470
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>

744
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 3>It was falling apart and we decided </v>
<v Speaker 3>let's try to rekindle our love and drive</v>

745
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:20.630

750
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:31.330
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize the first time ever I </v>
<v Speaker 3>drove up,</v>

751
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:33.460
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize how beautiful the cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>of credible.</v>

752
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.160
<v Speaker 3>The view is incredible all the way up </v>
<v Speaker 3>the coast.</v>

753
00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:38.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like I kept pulling over a minute </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

754
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.210

<v Speaker 3>That road that road's scary as fuck.</v>

757
00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like you could easily just turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just decide.</v>

758
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.640
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to end it.</v>

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 3>Turned to the right and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're off the side of the cliff.</v>

763
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.160
<v Speaker 3>And you're trusting the other person </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming the other direction.</v>

764
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:03.350
<v Speaker 3>You try trusting you to not be crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide.</v>

765
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:05.870
<v Speaker 3>So we're driving up the coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go up to Monterrey.</v>

<v Speaker 3>spend a couple of days and Manoa.</v>

771

<v Speaker 3>It was getting a little boring.</v>

772
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.740
<v Speaker 3>It was getting a little boring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>we go hiking and shed.</v>

782
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:41.810

<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

783
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:43.370
<v Speaker 3>We go to the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

784
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 3>I got that all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like some magical shit.</v>

785
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:50.290
<v Speaker 3>And then van that Sun was coming down </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we go back to the bungalow and we </v>

786
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 3>didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have anything.</v>

787
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV,</v>

788
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.810
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had nothing straight up.</v>

789
00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 3>So we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

790
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.960
<v Speaker 3>So it's like 7:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're kicking back.</v>

791
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:05.110
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we watched the last two days at </v>

792
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Monterey on the little lcd screen on our</v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter.</v>

793
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:10.480
<v Speaker 3>We're watching that and I'm thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only 90 minutes of this.</v>

794
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.080
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

00:39:43.421 --> 00:39:44.360
<v Speaker 3>I forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

920
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.700
<v Speaker 3>What I think has happened in Joey</v>

921
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:50.770
<v Speaker 1>is much more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not that this is making us </v>

922
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:54.730
<v Speaker 1>soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is becoming a part of us </v>

923
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:58.010
<v Speaker 1>and you leave your phone at home and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave my phone at home and I go out and </v>

924
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I realized I don't have my phone on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel naked.</v>

925
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

926
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I feel connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vulnerable.</v>

927
00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I feel vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk in your door,</v>

928
00:40:05.481 --> 00:40:08.180
<v Speaker 1>you pick up your phone and I called you </v>
<v Speaker 1>big fucking deal.</v>

929
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.600
<v Speaker 1>It feels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feels good about it.</v>

930
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Think about when you walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't had your phone and you open </v>

931
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.240
<v Speaker 1>it up and you think all this is all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is going to be in there,</v>

932
00:40:18.241 --> 00:40:23.241
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's nostalgia for the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're moving towards an era </v>

933
00:40:23.241 --> 00:40:27.671
<v Speaker 1>where you don't remember phone numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>there on this device that controls </v>

934
00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:28.280
<v Speaker 1>everything in your life and it might </v>
<v Speaker 1>even be a part of your body.</v>

935
00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:40:29.571 --> 00:40:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you can't hold onto the past where </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are changing.</v>

937
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.220
<v Speaker 1>They're obviously changing in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

938
00:40:34.221 --> 00:40:36.020
<v Speaker 1>The Internet has made things radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

939
00:40:36.021 --> 00:40:41.021
<v Speaker 1>Just in our lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have had more change in our lifetime </v>

940
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:41.180
<v Speaker 1>then hundreds and hundreds of years in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>

941
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Just in a few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this all this computer and </v>

942
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:46.490
<v Speaker 1>technology and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm making a soft.</v>

943
00:40:46.491 --> 00:40:48.410
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming a part of us and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>

944
00:40:48.411 --> 00:40:53.411
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in some way it's going to help </v>

945
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:53.411
<v Speaker 1>human beings evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

946
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:54.740
<v Speaker 1>two years from now when the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombed the fucking power,</v>

947
00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.370
<v Speaker 1>the satellites,</v>

948
00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:00.440
<v Speaker 3>we got no fault and you're stuck on </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking trying to call me fucking.</v>

949
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:04.960
<v Speaker 3>I had a fucking know joey's number that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

950
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:07.580
<v Speaker 3>at least in my worries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the world ends because no,</v>

951
00:41:07.581 --> 00:41:10.110
<v Speaker 3>I didn't tell her about the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's listened.</v>

952
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.740
<v Speaker 3>They they'd been trying to hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ain't gonna have no lines.</v>

953
00:41:12.741 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 3>When the world ends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no full need to know how to with</v>

954
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:19.460
<v Speaker 3>your shoelace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand they'll kill a rabbit.</v>

955
00:41:19.461 --> 00:41:20.580
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm getting ready for next </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

956
00:41:20.581 --> 00:41:25.581
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I hang out with the brothers </v>

957
00:41:25.581 --> 00:41:28.361
<v Speaker 3>and Vermont and shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go hunting with Ricky </v>

958
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:28.361
<v Speaker 3>Schroder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to make it a reality.</v>

959
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So Eddie Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and Ricky Schroder out hunting.</v>

960
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only animal I've ever killed was</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you count,</v>

961
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.910
<v Speaker 1>set up a mouse trap and he killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>another man.</v>

962
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing I'm going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>down for that though,</v>

963
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go hunting with Ricky Schroder.</v>

964
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should film that.</v>

965
00:41:42.411 --> 00:41:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on over and get a rifle.</v>

966
00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:49.440
<v Speaker 1>That would be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I super baked in the woods with </v>

967
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a great idea.</v>

968
00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.240
<v Speaker 1>If I was really high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be better at him.</v>

969
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

970
00:41:57.441 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be high with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same woods as other people.</v>

971
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I would not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't do the rubber gloves to go to.</v>

972
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.680
<v Speaker 1>One is fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be very careful.</v>

973
00:42:09.681 --> 00:42:13.310
<v Speaker 1>I read this article online about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was researching hunting in the hunting</v>

974
00:42:13.311 --> 00:42:15.100
<v Speaker 1>exits in Maine because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

975
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have this joke about hunting </v>

976
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.110
<v Speaker 1>in Maine and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what the real numbers were like</v>

977
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 1>how many people actually got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

978
00:42:20.511 --> 00:42:24.320
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is experienced hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally see deer,</v>

979
00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:29.380
<v Speaker 1>they'll see a deer and they'll pull the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger and then after they pulled the </v>

980
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.711
<v Speaker 1>trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize it's a woman in a red </v>

981
00:42:32.711 --> 00:42:34.481
<v Speaker 1>jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's their mind plays tricks </v>

982
00:42:34.481 --> 00:42:36.230
<v Speaker 1>on them because a seasoned hunter has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get so good at recognizing movement.</v>

983
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.300
<v Speaker 1>There he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the opening poem,</v>

984
00:42:38.301 --> 00:42:43.301
<v Speaker 1>pulled the trigger so their brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally puts an image of a deer in </v>

985
00:42:43.301 --> 00:42:43.301
<v Speaker 1>front of them.</v>

986
00:42:43.301 --> 00:42:47.930
<v Speaker 1>When they see motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain tries to already give you the</v>

987
00:42:47.931 --> 00:42:51.770
<v Speaker 1>image before it even gets it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for it for it so bad that</v>

988
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:56.771
<v Speaker 1>your brain makes you visualize a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the deer and these guys </v>

989
00:42:56.771 --> 00:42:58.720
<v Speaker 1>literally say they saw a deer and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most horrible night.</v>

990
00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:00.530
<v Speaker 1>How often does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

991
00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

992
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem and the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced hunters,</v>

993
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:09.340
<v Speaker 1>experienced hunters who just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just used to knowing that you </v>

994
00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:09.340
<v Speaker 1>have to capitalize on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on on a quick opening.</v>

995
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:12.560
<v Speaker 1>There's the opening thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to person like that Shit's</v>

996
00:43:12.561 --> 00:43:13.250
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

997
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:18.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the scariest thing about hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters that don't know what the fuck </v>

998
00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:20.840
<v Speaker 1>they're doing and people accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting people.</v>

999
00:43:20.841 --> 00:43:22.460
<v Speaker 1>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to experience.</v>

1000
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Hope is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty percent and the other is an </v>

1001
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:30.200
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some motherfuckers going to get shot </v>

1002
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:30.200
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1003
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 1>The article that I was reading was about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was an investigator and he </v>

1004
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 1>was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1005
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you like investigating people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot and you know,</v>

1006
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:40.930
<v Speaker 1>they had this one guy that he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspect and the guy wasn't experienced </v>

1007
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:40.930
<v Speaker 1>hunter and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1008
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:41.210
<v Speaker 1>was asking the guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1009
00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:42.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see anything or anything going on,</v>

1010
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a situation.</v>

1011
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:45.530
<v Speaker 1>And the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1012
00:43:45.531 --> 00:43:46.520
<v Speaker 1>no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See anything.</v>

1013
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 1>All he did was just drive by the dude's </v>
<v Speaker 1>house everyday for a week.</v>

1014
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Just pause in front of the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop looking at them.</v>

1015
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Drive four or five days later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dude who just couldn't take it </v>

1016
00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.851
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the guilt of accidentally </v>

1017
00:44:00.851 --> 00:44:00.851
<v Speaker 1>shooting somebody while you're hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1018
00:44:00.851 --> 00:44:05.050
<v Speaker 1>you think you've seen a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I talked to the guy and that's what </v>

1019
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:05.390
<v Speaker 1>the guy said once he finally confessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1020
00:44:05.391 --> 00:44:06.440
<v Speaker 1>I really thought it was a person.</v>

1021
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean I really thought it was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

1022
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I saw an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the horns,</v>

1023
00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:14.261
<v Speaker 1>I saw the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw buck with a big rack and I pulled </v>

1024
00:44:14.261 --> 00:44:16.601
<v Speaker 1>the trigger and it was a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go do that tape.</v>

1025
00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Bit cost suckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to go home.</v>

1026
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I want a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't eat them man.</v>

1027
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:29.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to eat a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to tell my animals </v>

1028
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:29.050
<v Speaker 1>like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:29.050
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want to eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Light shot.</v>

1030
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1031
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you want to see that fucking hold </v>

1032
00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.521
<v Speaker 1>his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want the animal to die in </v>

1033
00:44:37.521 --> 00:44:40.071
<v Speaker 1>some fucking factory farm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they get their brain smashed by a </v>

1034
00:44:40.071 --> 00:44:40.071
<v Speaker 1>piston and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1035
00:44:40.071 --> 00:44:43.040
<v Speaker 1>they're living in cow shit all day for </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of their life until that happened.</v>

1036
00:44:43.041 --> 00:44:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to shoot him that.</v>

1037
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:45.750
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to either,</v>

1038
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:50.751
<v Speaker 1>but I eat meat and I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a juicy fat fucking steak last </v>

1039
00:44:50.751 --> 00:44:51.760
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was wonderful to meet.</v>

1040
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Now what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1041
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a part of being a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

1042
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I love Pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see me.</v>

1043
00:44:56.491 --> 00:45:01.491
<v Speaker 1>Shoot me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoot a pitch of the head with it.</v>

1044
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Even though I would love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to shoot an animal.</v>

1045
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't got bless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers.</v>

1046
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't want to and I respect </v>

1047
00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:12.690
<v Speaker 1>that and I think there's nothing wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

1048
00:45:12.691 --> 00:45:17.691
<v Speaker 1>I love those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you shooting Debbie and I </v>

1049
00:45:17.691 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 1>don't think that because you eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy the argument that you should</v>

1050
00:45:18.481 --> 00:45:20.130
<v Speaker 1>have to shoot an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>

1051
00:45:20.131 --> 00:45:25.131
<v Speaker 1>I think we've allowed ourselves to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another be removed from the </v>

1052
00:45:25.131 --> 00:45:29.151
<v Speaker 1>process of murdering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughtering and butchering the animal </v>

1053
00:45:29.151 --> 00:45:31.970
<v Speaker 1>and we just enjoyed the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of crazy if you really </v>

1054
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.970
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

1055
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just want to,</v>

1056
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.670
<v Speaker 1>for my own personal edification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to go and experience it.</v>

1057
00:45:35.671 --> 00:45:40.671
<v Speaker 1>I want you to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can we get a college shooting in </v>

1058
00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:40.671
<v Speaker 1>your back yard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1059
00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:40.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>

1060
00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:40.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1061
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.500
<v Speaker 1>my gardener got in trouble for killing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>goat as backyard.</v>

1062
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:45.120
<v Speaker 1>What they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got mad at them.</v>

1063
00:45:45.121 --> 00:45:46.770
<v Speaker 1>They were going to evict him from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and he's like,</v>

1064
00:45:46.771 --> 00:45:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1065
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.550
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1066
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I could cook right in my backyard </v>
<v Speaker 1>because why can't I kill a goat?</v>

1067
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:54.390
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way,</v>

1068
00:45:54.391 --> 00:45:55.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not diseased.</v>

1069
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.150
<v Speaker 1>It's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the safest thing to him.</v>

1070
00:45:57.151 --> 00:45:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so normal.</v>

1071
00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1072
00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is normal.</v>

1073
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't he kill it?</v>

1074
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.030
<v Speaker 1>How come he can cook it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come he can.</v>

1075
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:08.120
<v Speaker 1>He could it be outside with a side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beef sawn off chunks and nobody would </v>

1076
00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:08.120
<v Speaker 1>say a word.</v>

1077
00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:08.120
<v Speaker 1>They would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1078
00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:12.831
<v Speaker 1>that's a big piece of beef out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you actually killed the cow and </v>

1079
00:46:12.831 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 1>start sawing the beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would get in big trouble.</v>

1080
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And I understand it because you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get rid of the crust and that's one </v>

1081
00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:18.590
<v Speaker 1>of those neighbor rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1082
00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:22.560
<v Speaker 1>someone rabid person to spend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't give a fuck.</v>

1083
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 1>He's the way he was talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1084
00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 1>why this is silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1085
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:27.740
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is that.</v>

1086
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure my meat is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1087
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:31.100
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not disease.</v>

1088
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:33.990
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid in Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my uncle would get the pigs,</v>

1089
00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:35.970
<v Speaker 1>bring them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom for a couple of weeks.</v>

1090
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to fucking kill him while </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were there.</v>

1091
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped eating pork for awhile because</v>

1092
00:46:40.201 --> 00:46:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I saw that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother's keeper.</v>

1093
00:46:41.971 --> 00:46:46.971
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that documentary about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys that were kind of slow and </v>

1094
00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:48.510
<v Speaker 1>one of them I think got accused of </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder or something like that.</v>

1095
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:50.520
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the documentary.</v>

1096
00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:52.830
<v Speaker 1>They live on a farm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in upstate New York.</v>

1097
00:46:52.831 --> 00:46:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1098
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 1>the guy went to kill one of the pigs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pulls out the shotgun and the pig </v>

1099
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.740
<v Speaker 1>starts run and that pig knows what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck is going down.</v>

1100
00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Pigs are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're smarter than dogs,</v>

1101
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:08.990
<v Speaker 1>so in this pig sees that shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just starts fucking running and </v>

1102
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:11.541
<v Speaker 1>squealing and scrambling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys chasing after him finally gets </v>

1103
00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:11.541
<v Speaker 1>the gun to his head and blows his brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1104
00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:16.400
<v Speaker 1>but like while before it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pig is an utter sheer terror and I </v>

1105
00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:16.590
<v Speaker 1>thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1106
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.600
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I want to experience that.</v>

1107
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I eating pigs?</v>

1108
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Pig Bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat it all the time.</v>

1109
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I gave up lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen while I was like,</v>

1110
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>cows are dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them.</v>

1111
00:47:28.681 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>They're but really the</v>

1112
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 2>shit that you're supposed to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is the smart shit.</v>

1113
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.180
<v Speaker 2>I think you're supposed to eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Smart,</v>

1114
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:36.910
<v Speaker 2>but difficult to catch fish and game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1115
00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.960
<v Speaker 2>there was a hard to catch like cows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs and you're sitting there laying </v>

1116
00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:41.960
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably not the best for you.</v>

1117
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate your argument and I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I eat a piece of meat that some </v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking thing of his neck.</v>

1119
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to think about it,</v>

1120
00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:54.040
<v Speaker 2>but by me going hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really couldn't do anyway,</v>

1121
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.560

<v Speaker 2>I don't like none of that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is this one of the greatest ideas ever?</v>

1180
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Some do just selling use of shit on the </v>

1184
00:50:50.331 --> 00:50:50.960

<v Speaker 3>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1188
00:51:00.471 --> 00:51:01.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a license.</v>

1189
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:04.210
<v Speaker 3>You can't just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have some sort of a merchant</v>

1190
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:09.220
<v Speaker 3>slice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to have a kitchen really hard </v>

1191
00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.060
<v Speaker 3>because trucks in rich neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we really don't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Rich neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1194
00:51:13.101 --> 00:51:18.101
<v Speaker 3>you can't be going through Beverly Hills</v>
<v Speaker 3>and an ice cream truck probably trying </v>

1195
00:51:18.101 --> 00:51:18.920
<v Speaker 3>to rob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what it is.</v>

1196
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main thing is they know in the rich </v>

1197

<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids just can't come out.</v>

1198
00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:29.050
<v Speaker 3>They can't get to end the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the kids are out in the fucking </v>

1199
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:29.050
<v Speaker 3>streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three and four.</v>

1200
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:32.830
<v Speaker 3>But like the kids are like fucking stray</v>
<v Speaker 3>dogs for neighborhoods.</v>

1201
00:51:32.831 --> 00:51:34.580
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I would go when I was little,</v>

<v Speaker 3>middle of the street.</v>

1205
00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:46.490
<v Speaker 3>You would have to stop and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be playing soccer in the middle </v>

1206
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:47.060
<v Speaker 3>of the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be playing like,</v>

1207

1208
00:51:52.061 --> 00:51:53.951

<v Speaker 3>And you would literally have to stop </v>

<v Speaker 3>your car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1211
00:51:55.230 --> 00:52:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Tell them in the street cars coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody would stop the game for a </v>

1212
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.230
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

1213

<v Speaker 3>We did that car would drive by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd restart the game.</v>

1214
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Epic Got Damn Day playing football in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the street with cars.</v>

1215
00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.710
<v Speaker 3>That was the story of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of poor fucking Mexican.</v>

1216
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:12.280

<v Speaker 3>it was a couple guys that were like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and 11.</v>

1220
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Once my Stepdad left that I was gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on the streets.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Stepdad could.</v>

1222

<v Speaker 3>basketball game with a bunch of Mexicans</v>

1229
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:39.920
<v Speaker 3>and we're all in the rock.</v>

1230
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 3>And Eric was in the rush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one had a dad.</v>

1232
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.770
<v Speaker 3>But fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a plan.</v>

1233
00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.800
<v Speaker 3>I did it with ice cream truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>football on the fucking street and asked</v>
<v Speaker 3>them truck coming by.</v>

1236

<v Speaker 3>stick ball football.</v>

1239
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:07.530
<v Speaker 3>And then when their leaves came down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where you play two hand touch and</v>

1240
00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:12.590
<v Speaker 3>the bricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We put the bricks in the middle of the </v>

1241
00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:13.160
<v Speaker 3>street and leaves on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some dickheads driving with his car.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucking animals.</v>

1243

<v Speaker 3>moved to this place to make a plane,</v>

1245
00:53:21.981 --> 00:53:25.440
<v Speaker 3>and it was one of those streets where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would live on the street.</v>

1246

<v Speaker 1>Gone every week we had a thing called </v>

1261
00:53:57.471 --> 00:54:00.680

1263
00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.810
<v Speaker 1>lemon trees filled backpacks with lemons</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we climb another trees and we'd</v>

<v Speaker 1>lemons.</v>

1266
00:54:08.811 --> 00:54:10.070

<v Speaker 1>We were all camouflaged.</v>

1269
00:54:15.471 --> 00:54:18.870
<v Speaker 1>We love camouflage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we would practice jumping fences and</v>

1270
00:54:18.871 --> 00:54:23.871
<v Speaker 1>escape routes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew everybody's backyard and </v>

1271
00:54:23.871 --> 00:54:23.871
<v Speaker 1>everyone's fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would practice,</v>

1272
00:54:23.871 --> 00:54:26.520
<v Speaker 1>so if any we got chased to the cops </v>
<v Speaker 1>would even come by a cop chases,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What gone in the backyard.</v>

1274
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:32.330
<v Speaker 1>So the fences we were going through know</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this conversation with Brian Cowen</v>

1275

<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have it again with you guys</v>

<v Speaker 1>three of us that we were kind of left to</v>

<v Speaker 1>our own devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1278
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think every interesting person that I </v>

1279
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:48.771
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them were not raised by </v>

1280
00:54:48.771 --> 00:54:49.080
<v Speaker 1>the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all like raised like wild dogs.</v>

1281
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:51.060
<v Speaker 1>They all like figured out their way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the world.</v>

1282
00:54:51.061 --> 00:54:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Like they made a good relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mother,</v>

1283
00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.660
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really see her that </v>
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>

1284
00:54:54.661 --> 00:54:56.880
<v Speaker 1>She didn't really teach them things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kind of figured things out on their</v>

1285
00:54:56.881 --> 00:54:58.590
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I for sure did.</v>

1286
00:54:58.591 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was leaving my brother on the streets.</v>

1287
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:02.710
<v Speaker 1>My mom just had to work all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She works.</v>

1288
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:08.430
<v Speaker 1>If you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had like a really cool dad who </v>

1289
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.941
<v Speaker 1>was like a Christian who was like a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican but Super Nice Guy,</v>

1290
00:55:12.301 --> 00:55:13.920
<v Speaker 1>you could've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have thought like that.</v>

1291
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.090
<v Speaker 1>If your dad raised you like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought you along like that.</v>

1292
00:55:17.091 --> 00:55:18.300

00:55:30.111 --> 00:55:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's going to be the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher in your life if you find that </v>

1300

<v Speaker 1>and a fun guy in a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the United States would never do a bad </v>

1304
00:55:44.601 --> 00:55:44.601
<v Speaker 1>thing to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1305
00:55:44.601 --> 00:55:44.601
<v Speaker 1>you could be sucked into that way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

1306
00:55:44.601 --> 00:55:45.140
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1307

<v Speaker 1>You don't think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so because you're,</v>

1308
00:55:48.181 --> 00:55:50.970
<v Speaker 1>you and you grew up wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You grew up,</v>

1309
00:55:50.971 --> 00:55:52.530
<v Speaker 1>your parents died young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>

1310
00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:57.531
<v Speaker 1>you were really on your own and in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways when you were taken in by </v>

1311
00:55:57.531 --> 00:55:57.531
<v Speaker 1>people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's very young thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom was pro American dog right here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1317
00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:14.100
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to look at the world</v>

1318
00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:19.101
<v Speaker 1>like this is how you developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to step back and </v>

1319
00:56:19.101 --> 00:56:19.101
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't buy into none of that shit.</v>

1323
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:29.300
<v Speaker 2>I never bought into clubs I never bought</v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

1324
00:56:29.301 --> 00:56:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Now that she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You grew up very streetwise.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1330
00:56:46.301 --> 00:56:49.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not about being Cuban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my big thing was to be an American.</v>

1331
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:51.780

<v Speaker 2>The guys that I knew when they were </v>

1445
01:01:36.821 --> 01:01:36.821
<v Speaker 2>going through the line,</v>

<v Speaker 2>time I was allowed to go to the store </v>

1450
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:52.661
<v Speaker 2>for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked it out where I had to drive to </v>

1451
01:01:52.661 --> 01:01:55.361
<v Speaker 2>take garbage out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would go to the store for 15 </v>

1452
01:01:55.361 --> 01:01:55.361
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

1453
01:01:55.361 --> 01:01:55.460

<v Speaker 2>restaurant,</v>

1454
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.380
<v Speaker 2>so it would be ready by the time I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1455
01:01:57.381 --> 01:02:00.320
<v Speaker 2>so I would go back to the prison with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese food and groceries.</v>

1456
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:05.620
<v Speaker 2>That's how strong I was in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus they were doing steroids and </v>

1457
01:02:05.901 --> 01:02:08.750
<v Speaker 2>selling drugs in prison waves like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

1458
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:13.990
<v Speaker 2>so I always in the stock room clerks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had to pay me rent so high </v>

1459
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.990
<v Speaker 2>because they never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start,</v>

1460
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.130
<v Speaker 2>but you got to give me $3.</v>

1461
01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:26.220
<v Speaker 2>You got to give you some cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cigarettes.</v>

1462
01:02:26.221 --> 01:02:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I had pills and they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just belong to other people,</v>

1463
01:02:29.701 --> 01:02:32.340
<v Speaker 2>but you put them on the pallets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would give them a key,</v>

1464
01:02:32.341 --> 01:02:33.750
<v Speaker 2>whatever they needed to go take shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1465
01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.300
<v Speaker 2>So they knew where the connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the.</v>

1466
01:02:35.301 --> 01:02:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I was to know I was the holdup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus they get the steroids and so he had</v>

1467
01:02:39.091 --> 01:02:41.790
<v Speaker 2>to put it up their ass or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1468
01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:46.791
<v Speaker 2>I never asked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine shooting a steroid in the </v>

1469
01:02:46.791 --> 01:02:49.050
<v Speaker 2>smuggling in again going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they put it.</v>

1470
01:02:49.051 --> 01:02:54.051
<v Speaker 2>Where that contact visits should do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you take your fucking kid and you fill </v>

1471
01:02:54.051 --> 01:02:56.850
<v Speaker 2>his pockets with the [inaudible] and why</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making out with your husband.</v>

1472
01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:00.030
<v Speaker 2>You said you want to see the kid and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>pass the kit to the husband and he takes</v>

1473
01:03:00.031 --> 01:03:01.600
<v Speaker 2>the drugs out that it gives your back.</v>

1474
01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:07.050
<v Speaker 2>That's how Henry Hill did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they do it.</v>

1475
01:03:07.051 --> 01:03:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Same Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no.</v>

1476
01:03:08.361 --> 01:03:10.530
<v Speaker 2>You can grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more drugs on the inside.</v>

1477
01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:12.540
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the outside and to boot.</v>

1478
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:16.020
<v Speaker 2>This was a minimum security camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had contact visits.</v>

1479
01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:18.810
<v Speaker 2>When you have a contact visit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's parties every night.</v>

1480
01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.880
<v Speaker 2>These motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first time I didn't know.</v>

1481
01:03:23.881 --> 01:03:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second time I did it was it couldn't</v>

1482
01:03:27.121 --> 01:03:29.760
<v Speaker 2>do a needle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the Mexicans took a Mexican thing.</v>

1483
01:03:29.761 --> 01:03:32.340
<v Speaker 2>A heroin melted it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>will always roll his own cigarettes or </v>

1622
01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:33.120
<v Speaker 2>some random guy came up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got talent.</v>

1623
01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that if you didn't go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison,</v>

1624
01:09:37.401 --> 01:09:42.401
<v Speaker 2>if he didn't have that experience of </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking in front of those people that </v>

1625
01:09:42.401 --> 01:09:42.401
<v Speaker 2>you probably never would have done </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup over,</v>

1626
01:09:42.401 --> 01:09:43.130
<v Speaker 2>stand up something that was in the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your head anyway,</v>

1627
01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:48.160
<v Speaker 2>it was in the back of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The prison really woke the animal up </v>

1628
01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.830
<v Speaker 2>because it before I had thought I bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if any.</v>

1629
01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.520

<v Speaker 2>prison heard the niggas crazy by Richard</v>

1630
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.170

<v Speaker 2>You had to think of.</v>

1631
01:09:56.190 --> 01:10:00.510
<v Speaker 2>He pushed it so hard on that before </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison for the pilot,</v>

1632
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:03.500
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was always good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the Deli.</v>

1633
01:10:03.501 --> 01:10:08.501

<v Speaker 2>It was always good with that shit and </v>

1634
01:10:08.501 --> 01:10:11.441
<v Speaker 2>then the thing that really got me was </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go to prison and do a </v>

<v Speaker 2>psychological evaluation.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Mexicans always have wild jail tattooed </v>

1688
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:25.330
<v Speaker 2>generations of Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At one time I was in jail with the </v>

01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:21.360
<v Speaker 2>you talked into people have to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you were finding that you should go</v>

1710
01:13:21.361 --> 01:13:26.361
<v Speaker 2>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do people tell you that you should do </v>

1711
01:13:26.361 --> 01:13:26.361
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1712
01:13:26.361 --> 01:13:26.361
<v Speaker 2>Tell us about the first time on stage.</v>

1713
01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I would consider the first time he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>on stage.</v>

1714
01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.520
<v Speaker 2>The first time outside of prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time I was my first time on </v>

1715
01:13:34.651 --> 01:13:37.860
<v Speaker 2>stage was an open mic night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before I went to the open mic night,</v>

1716
01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:39.050
<v Speaker 2>it was locker room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1717
01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:39.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1718
01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I understand that and if your first your</v>
<v Speaker 2>first night efficiently as a comedian is</v>

1719
01:13:44.791 --> 01:13:46.670
<v Speaker 2>an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interiors,</v>

1720
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:49.290
<v Speaker 2>but I'm so curious about yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is,</v>

1721
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:51.860
<v Speaker 2>the truth of the matter is now you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>down with it and remember it,</v>

1722
01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.670
<v Speaker 2>but come on dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About a month ago,</v>

1723
01:13:53.671 --> 01:13:58.671
<v Speaker 2>I got a call from a friend of mine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking that I hadn't talked to </v>

1724
01:13:58.671 --> 01:13:58.671
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hooked up with them on facebook and he</v>

1725
01:13:58.671 --> 01:13:58.671
<v Speaker 2>said something to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1726
01:13:58.671 --> 01:14:03.561
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew on that bus ride home that you </v>

1727
01:14:03.561 --> 01:14:03.561
<v Speaker 2>always going to be an entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked him,</v>

1728
01:14:03.561 --> 01:14:04.380
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

1729
01:14:04.381 --> 01:14:09.381
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember if the freshman </v>

1730
01:14:09.381 --> 01:14:09.900
<v Speaker 2>basketball you would get on the bus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking go off every night?</v>

1731
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:15.250
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got to the point where the bus </v>

1732
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:15.250
<v Speaker 2>drivers</v>

1733
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.070
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't pick you up anymore because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to go on and do the theme from the </v>

1734
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:18.760
<v Speaker 1>couple that had done it and then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would go into a fucking 20 minutes,</v>

1735
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:23.761
<v Speaker 1>get all the way we got to the say and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>even wrote a blog about it that after he</v>

1736
01:14:24.041 --> 01:14:26.050
<v Speaker 1>told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I called a bunch of people in those</v>

1737
01:14:26.051 --> 01:14:28.510
<v Speaker 1>days and I to go pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do on the bus?</v>

1738
01:14:28.511 --> 01:14:29.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you don't remember.</v>

1739
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:32.950
<v Speaker 1>We used to take over [inaudible] buses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one bus,</v>

1740
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
<v Speaker 1>90th street at 38th street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ran it and you were the fucking host </v>

1741
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:38.000
<v Speaker 1>and MC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1742
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.340
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started thinking.</v>

1743
01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1744
01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.780
<v Speaker 1>So if I really go to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was freshman year basketball.</v>

1745
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to like the buses up every time </v>

1746
01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.320
<v Speaker 1>and they would fucking pick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that like being out there for</v>

1747
01:14:50.321 --> 01:14:55.321
<v Speaker 1>two different bus drivers and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick you up because you guys are too </v>

1748
01:14:55.321 --> 01:14:55.321
<v Speaker 1>fucking loud.</v>

1749
01:14:55.321 --> 01:14:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

1750
01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.000
<v Speaker 1>But then in school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1751
01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 1>no one ever considers that maybe this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy should be a standup comedian.</v>

1752
01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.470
<v Speaker 1>They just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to silence him.</v>

1753
01:15:02.490 --> 01:15:07.490
<v Speaker 1>We've got to stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to teach some discipline to </v>

1754
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:10.321
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lack of discipline is really what </v>

1755
01:15:10.321 --> 01:15:11.200
<v Speaker 1>makes someone a comic though I wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup at all,</v>

1756
01:15:11.201 --> 01:15:12.850
<v Speaker 1>like in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like growing up.</v>

1757
01:15:12.851 --> 01:15:17.851
<v Speaker 1>But I was always every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the teacher I had because </v>

1758
01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.320
<v Speaker 1>junior high and high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have like seven teachers.</v>

1759
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I was always the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't start shit.</v>

1760
01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Play pranks and always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless the teacher was Mr Endres you </v>

1761
01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:29.440
<v Speaker 1>never did shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just fucking.</v>

1762
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:31.810
<v Speaker 1>He was a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you want to act up.</v>

1763
01:15:31.811 --> 01:15:32.860
<v Speaker 1>You want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to talk?</v>

1764
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.570
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this before on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

1765
01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.910
<v Speaker 1>It was Mr Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Sanders.</v>

1766
01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:37.960
<v Speaker 1>10th grade.</v>

1767
01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:39.700
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1768
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I think geology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

1769
01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:44.610
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1770
01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:49.650
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing about someone becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic is there's no one who could have </v>

1771
01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:50.850
<v Speaker 1>pulled you aside and said what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really need to do is become a comic.</v>

1772
01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:54.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like you almost have to experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this resistance to your personality,</v>

1773
01:15:54.961 --> 01:15:58.590
<v Speaker 1>to regular life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that forces you into being a comic.</v>

1774
01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:00.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone can't just come up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and go,</v>

1775
01:16:00.691 --> 01:16:02.760
<v Speaker 1>this is what you really need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't really need to be a comic.</v>

1776
01:16:02.761 --> 01:16:07.761
<v Speaker 1>Like you need to go through all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit in life to experience that </v>

1777
01:16:07.761 --> 01:16:07.761
<v Speaker 1>before someone comes along and tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1778
01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:10.860
<v Speaker 1>How old were you when you first got on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage?</v>

1779
01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Thirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

1780
01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.340
<v Speaker 1>29.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 20.</v>

1781
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been better for I 30 </v>

1782
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.550
<v Speaker 1>because when I was 21 I didn't have shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say.</v>

1783
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I have no opinions about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenneth,</v>

1784
01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:28.230
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your comedians stand up comedians.</v>

1785
01:16:28.231 --> 01:16:33.231
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be fun and it'll be funny if </v>

1786
01:16:33.231 --> 01:16:34.530
<v Speaker 1>that's what they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My problem was when I was 21,</v>

1787
01:16:35.010 --> 01:16:40.010
<v Speaker 1>my whole life from 15 to 21 was all just</v>
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo tournament and kickbox and </v>

1788
01:16:40.041 --> 01:16:42.090
<v Speaker 1>that's all I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 24 hours a day.</v>

1789
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:45.000
<v Speaker 1>That was all I thought about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really consider the world.</v>

1790
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be a loser and I wanted</v>

1791
01:16:46.890 --> 01:16:51.890
<v Speaker 1>to be really good at talking window and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to win the nationals and I </v>

1792
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:52.300
<v Speaker 1>wanted to compete in the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all these ideas up.</v>

1793
01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about fucking politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't a clue as to what was going on </v>

1794
01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:57.540
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

1795
01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about it for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

1796
01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about was this and getting </v>

1797
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.290
<v Speaker 1>laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought about.</v>

1798
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.900
<v Speaker 1>So when I started going into comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally had no opinions.</v>

1799
01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I know how to kick somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to kick somebody in the</v>

1800
01:17:06.961 --> 01:17:11.000
<v Speaker 1>head and I know I like pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy jokes,</v>

1801
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 1>sex jokes for like the first year and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>

1802
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote this when I'm 21 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

1803
01:17:16.701 --> 01:17:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Kind of the opinion that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was interesting on anything.</v>

1804
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:24.370
<v Speaker 1>If I told you anything about anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than sex or kicking somebody in </v>

1805
01:17:24.370 --> 01:17:28.181
<v Speaker 1>the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would already know what I was going </v>

1806
01:17:28.181 --> 01:17:28.181
<v Speaker 1>to say way in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1807
01:17:28.181 --> 01:17:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have enough life experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life experience is very limited.</v>

1808
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I hear that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people to yell to say maybe 30 </v>

1809
01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:36.350
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kind of comedy you do,</v>

1810
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.780
<v Speaker 1>will you look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at you,</v>

1811

1813
01:17:38.931 --> 01:17:40.910

<v Speaker 1>We appoint some shit out.</v>

1814
01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't point some shit out at 21.</v>

1815
01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:44.430
<v Speaker 1>You're not seeing it was I going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to you.</v>

1816
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:49.600
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to listen to you unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're some super genius and even then </v>

1817
01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.110
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not going to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1818
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1819
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I wrestled with it for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a roofer after I got locked up.</v>

1820
01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I roof for one week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking two or three years I was,</v>

1821
01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I went to school and then I was sick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired of people telling me try it.</v>

1822

1825
01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't funny until I started doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo and we would fight and compete</v>

1827
01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.980
<v Speaker 1>You'd be nervous even in the locker room</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're about to go work out because</v>

1828
01:18:24.981 --> 01:18:27.080
<v Speaker 1>somebody might just get kicked in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and knocked out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It happened all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys got knocked out in class all the </v>

1831
01:18:35.501 --> 01:18:37.480
<v Speaker 1>get fucking terrified and so I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>always cracking jokes to break the </v>

1832
01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:40.571
<v Speaker 1>tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always the guy who's doing </v>

1833
01:18:40.571 --> 01:18:42.341
<v Speaker 1>impressions of other people on the team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first time that I became </v>

1834
01:18:42.341 --> 01:18:43.430
<v Speaker 1>funny because the other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1838
01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:51.680
<v Speaker 1>The first time I saw Richard Pryor live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sunset strip,</v>

1839
01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't fucking believe this guy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just talking.</v>

1840
01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:59.710
<v Speaker 1>He's on stage just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the most profound moments </v>

1841
01:18:59.710 --> 01:18:59.710
<v Speaker 1>of my young life.</v>

1842
01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I was like 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was in the audience.</v>

1843
01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking around and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were falling out of their chairs </v>

1844
01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.891
<v Speaker 1>laughing and I was holding my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember my stomach was hurting because </v>

1845
01:19:08.891 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 1>I was laughing so hard and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's just talking.</v>

1847
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:17.080
<v Speaker 1>He's just talking and what he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>is way funnier than any movie I've ever </v>

1848
01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.171
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking of stripes at the time </v>

1851
01:19:24.341 --> 01:19:24.341

<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

<v Speaker 1>guy talking.</v>

<v Speaker 3>on the man show.</v>

2315
01:39:15.931 --> 01:39:18.670
<v Speaker 3>There was a two parter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that shit on the Manchester.</v>

2316
01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:23.220
<v Speaker 3>It was a reality when a guy that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>posing as a Dr Phil was,</v>

2317
01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:27.690
<v Speaker 3>had a fake book signing and people up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

2318
01:39:27.710 --> 01:39:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2319
01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:29.480
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the girls were aligned.</v>

2320
01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.320
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even know it's him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like him.</v>

2321
01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:35.040
<v Speaker 3>But I probably didn't fool everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

2322
01:39:35.041 --> 01:39:36.090
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a total punk.</v>

2323
01:39:36.210 --> 01:39:38.410
<v Speaker 3>Like he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when he was signing in,</v>

2324
01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:41.070
<v Speaker 3>I got some coke back in the hotel room.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he was making moves on this one chick </v>

2327
01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:51.620
<v Speaker 3>and from under the table a girl came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

2328
01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:55.790
<v Speaker 3>like he had been getting a blow job and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just walked away and he just kept </v>

2329
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.790
<v Speaker 3>talking to him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You want to party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your friends.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's gets.</v>

2333
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:03.570
<v Speaker 3>It was so much material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the only comedy.</v>

2334
01:40:03.730 --> 01:40:06.780
<v Speaker 3>It was the only man show sketch that two</v>
<v Speaker 3>parts.</v>

2335
01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:09.810
<v Speaker 3>They did it again the next week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was so much material.</v>

2336
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:15.490
<v Speaker 3>It was too funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Stan up and I had a real show where </v>

2337
01:40:15.490 --> 01:40:15.810
<v Speaker 3>we could have really done what we wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do,</v>

2338
01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.840
<v Speaker 3>it could have been very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was two problems with doing that </v>

2339
01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.481
<v Speaker 3>mantra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One was and I was doing fear factor at </v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for.</v>

2343
01:40:28.201 --> 01:40:33.201

<v Speaker 3>It was the worst from day one inside.</v>

2344
01:40:33.211 --> 01:40:34.620

<v Speaker 3>We would be able to do whatever we </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted.</v>

2348
01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:43.830
<v Speaker 3>The way they sold it to me was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>

01:40:43.831 --> 01:40:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Explain the beginning how they offered </v>
<v Speaker 3>you the show while you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but it would be too restrictive.</v>

2363
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:08.740
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2364

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>

2366
01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:12.820
<v Speaker 1>A lawsuit would be good for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy Actually said this to me.</v>

2367
01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:14.650
<v Speaker 1>He said if we got sued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2368
01:41:14.651 --> 01:41:16.810
<v Speaker 1>it would be great publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be great.</v>

2369
01:41:17.250 --> 01:41:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Want to do we want to do nudity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blur it out.</v>

2370
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:21.250
<v Speaker 1>If you want to swear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beep it out.</v>

2371
01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Essentially you could do anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would talk about an real quick.</v>

2372
01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:28.300
<v Speaker 1>We already had like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 ideas for sketches even before that.</v>

2373
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:29.770
<v Speaker 1>So this was like a perfect thing.</v>

2374
01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I remember you called me go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2375
01:41:31.230 --> 01:41:33.730
<v Speaker 1>the fuck comedy central wants me to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the man show.</v>

2376
01:41:33.850 --> 01:41:35.590
<v Speaker 1>How fucking crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just.</v>

2377
01:41:35.710 --> 01:41:36.790
<v Speaker 1>We were thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2378
01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:37.690
<v Speaker 1>what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2379
01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.720
<v Speaker 1>totally it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very strange and they came up to </v>

2380
01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.541
<v Speaker 1>me and they basically just gave us a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story about what they're going to be </v>

2381
01:41:45.541 --> 01:41:45.580
<v Speaker 1>able to do for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have some show.</v>

2382
01:41:45.730 --> 01:41:47.560
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be completely wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do whatever you want,</v>

2383
01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.200
<v Speaker 1>but once we got in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a completely different story.</v>

2384
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:54.160
<v Speaker 1>They had like really restricted ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what the subject matter should be.</v>

2385
01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:59.420
<v Speaker 1>The guy who was the executive producer </v>
<v Speaker 1>wind up like kind of hijacking the show </v>

2386
01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:02.761
<v Speaker 1>and taking all the things on his </v>

2419
01:43:05.041 --> 01:43:05.800
<v Speaker 1>and introduce everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would come out with a microphone,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the handheld microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get this party started.</v>

2422
01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.410
<v Speaker 1>things we ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they fought to the point of tears.</v>

2434
01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:37.720
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do one without you go out there.</v>

2435

<v Speaker 1>They are falling down laughing.</v>

2436
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:43.360
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best intro ever.</v>

2437
01:43:43.361 --> 01:43:46.420
<v Speaker 1>And I got that on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I go to her and I'm like,</v>

2438
01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:47.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise my hands.</v>

2439
01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I've see told you like you got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I is funny.</v>

2440
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm capable of reproducing what I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>is funny.</v>

2441
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:56.540
<v Speaker 1>You might not think it's funny on paper.</v>

2442
01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:58.580
<v Speaker 1>You might not think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny as I'm describing it to you,</v>

2443
01:43:58.581 --> 01:44:03.581
<v Speaker 1>but I know it's funny to me and if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny to me it's going to be funny to </v>

2444
01:44:03.581 --> 01:44:04.970
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just has to be the second it was that</v>

2445
01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:07.110
<v Speaker 1>went to college for four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2446
01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:10.450
<v Speaker 1>The reason Chappelle quit because you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to buy it.</v>

2447
01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Turned out it was the reason why Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolla and Jimmy Jimmy Kimmel stopped </v>

2448
01:44:16.101 --> 01:44:17.180
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because they,</v>

2449
01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:22.380
<v Speaker 1>they gave up ownership of the show so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they could have creative control </v>

2450
01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:24.500
<v Speaker 1>they gave up on because they're tired of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these idiots and they gave up.</v>

2451
01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:25.310
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2452
01:44:25.311 --> 01:44:25.700
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2453
01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:30.730
<v Speaker 1>you guys can have the fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just want to be responsible for what </v>

2454
01:44:30.730 --> 01:44:33.581
<v Speaker 1>gets done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they for sure didn't want to hire </v>

2455
01:44:33.581 --> 01:44:33.581
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

2456
01:44:33.581 --> 01:44:33.581
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2457
01:44:33.581 --> 01:44:33.581
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you signed,</v>

2458
01:44:33.581 --> 01:44:38.201
<v Speaker 1>they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this Eddie Bravo has no TV </v>

2459
01:44:38.201 --> 01:44:38.201
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck do we want him on the show?</v>

2460
01:44:38.201 --> 01:44:38.750
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2461
01:44:38.751 --> 01:44:40.880
<v Speaker 1>we're not gonna hire them with higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Mcguire and bought out.</v>

2462
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:45.910
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem was they didn't understand </v>

2463
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.910
<v Speaker 1>what I was trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to.</v>

2464
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.980
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2465
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:47.210
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says funny shit.</v>

2466
01:44:47.211 --> 01:44:50.900
<v Speaker 1>He comes up with some funny ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might not be like a writer in,</v>

2467
01:44:50.901 --> 01:44:53.090
<v Speaker 1>in as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to come up with a,</v>

2468
01:44:53.091 --> 01:44:55.470
<v Speaker 1>a properly formatted sketch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2469
01:44:55.530 --> 01:44:57.470
<v Speaker 1>without everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he could eventually do that,</v>

2470
01:44:57.471 --> 01:44:59.810
<v Speaker 1>but for right now what he's good at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's good at looking at things,</v>

2471
01:44:59.811 --> 01:45:00.770
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot,</v>

2472
01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.580
<v Speaker 1>coming up with crazy ideas and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

2473
01:45:02.610 --> 01:45:04.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tailor and having a.</v>

2474
01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.890
<v Speaker 1>They weren't hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to us it was,</v>

2475
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:09.590
<v Speaker 1>he wanted it to be his show and I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>there enough.</v>

2476
01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I was doing fear factor at least three </v>
<v Speaker 1>days a week.</v>

2477
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:16.340
<v Speaker 1>So for three days they would be running </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show and Doug did not feel confident</v>

2478
01:45:16.341 --> 01:45:18.530
<v Speaker 1>enough to take over and he would send me</v>
<v Speaker 1>messages.</v>

2479
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:19.850
<v Speaker 1>He would call me up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

01:45:19.851 --> 01:45:22.220
<v Speaker 1>is fucking hell here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>getting in and I can't get this done.</v>

2482
01:45:26.001 --> 01:45:31.001
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the Janet Jackson Nipple thing </v>

2483
01:45:31.001 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 1>happened and then we were fucked because</v>
<v Speaker 1>then shit that we already had approved,</v>

<v Speaker 1>after that Janet Jackson Nipple fiasco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know who weren't in show </v>

<v Speaker 1>trying to stop comedy.</v>

2501
01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:15.080
<v Speaker 1>How about the sketch that we wrote that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they originally approved and they backed</v>

2502
01:46:15.081 --> 01:46:20.081
<v Speaker 1>out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were going to do extreme sack </v>

2503
01:46:20.081 --> 01:46:20.081
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

2504
01:46:20.081 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 1>It was funny because I never forget the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day that that all went down.</v>

2505
01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:24.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between you,</v>

2506
01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:26.930
<v Speaker 1>me and all three of us and I didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fucking be there either.</v>

2507
01:46:27.190 --> 01:46:28.880
<v Speaker 1>It was the worst fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was around.</v>

2508
01:46:28.881 --> 01:46:30.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a bad energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2509
01:46:30.171 --> 01:46:31.480
<v Speaker 1>It was set up that energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2510
01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:32.540
<v Speaker 1>forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went.</v>

2511
01:46:32.541 --> 01:46:35.720
<v Speaker 1>They made me rehearse like Jack Offs </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were.</v>

2512
01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:37.250
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>

2513
01:46:37.251 --> 01:46:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Janice came over and oh,</v>

2514
01:46:38.841 --> 01:46:40.250
<v Speaker 1>it's hysterical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love it.</v>

2515
01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Then the next day I go there and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's talking about it.</v>

2516
01:46:42.901 --> 01:46:47.901
<v Speaker 1>It was hysterical to see all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking educated white people walking </v>

2517
01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:48.710
<v Speaker 1>around like they didn't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck to do.</v>

2518
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna take his balls</v>

2519
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.350
<v Speaker 2>up and he's going to run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got killed and that's it.</v>

2520
01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:55.710
<v Speaker 2>So they all were arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see direction.</v>

2521
01:46:55.711 --> 01:46:57.890
<v Speaker 2>We want to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like a fucking whore.</v>

2522
01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:01.880
<v Speaker 2>It's not want a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Push this through with all his might do.</v>

2523
01:47:02.210 --> 01:47:03.840
<v Speaker 2>This is not a direction we want to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

2524
01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Hired me to do what I think is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what to do.</v>

2525
01:47:07.381 --> 01:47:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna do some crazy shit.</v>

2526
01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:14.780
<v Speaker 2>And then they wanted me to be a junkie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man junkie and take a piss and I'm </v>

2527
01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:14.820
<v Speaker 2>like crack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2528
01:47:14.821 --> 01:47:17.020
<v Speaker 2>this ain't gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2529
01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:22.060
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want them to know makeup and </v>

2530
01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:22.060
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Joey came running out,</v>

2531
01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:25.280
<v Speaker 2>all bets were off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had to shut up or at least that </v>

2532
01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:28.191
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had to shoot two episodes that </v>

2533
01:47:28.191 --> 01:47:30.170
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to shoot two episodes and I was </v>

2534
01:47:30.170 --> 01:47:30.170
<v Speaker 2>going to run through both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even after the first one,</v>

2535
01:47:30.170 --> 01:47:31.770
<v Speaker 2>even after they seen the laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

2536
01:47:31.771 --> 01:47:32.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to happen.</v>

2537
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.000
<v Speaker 2>But what got me was I'm not familiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this environment of a fucking </v>

2538
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.210
<v Speaker 2>standup comic at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had done a couple things,</v>

2539
01:47:39.211 --> 01:47:42.740
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't familiar with the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side of this big Hollywood butches</v>

2540
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:45.690
<v Speaker 2>lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guy who was telling me to my face</v>

2541
01:47:45.810 --> 01:47:48.350
<v Speaker 2>how funny I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I catch them when I get offstage.</v>

2542
01:47:48.650 --> 01:47:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Telling the comedy central people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was tasteless and he thought it was </v>

2543
01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:55.500
<v Speaker 2>terrible and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell Rogan how my balls aren't funny and</v>

2544
01:47:55.501 --> 01:48:00.501
<v Speaker 2>I must've dude and all of a sudden look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at him and I fucking was raging and as </v>

2545
01:48:00.501 --> 01:48:05.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the end of the show I'm side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what really happened was because I </v>

2546
01:48:05.151 --> 01:48:08.451
<v Speaker 2>don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was smoking a joint with the security </v>

2547
01:48:08.451 --> 01:48:08.790
<v Speaker 2>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got a joy run on the set,</v>

2548

<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck and me and this.</v>

2549
01:48:10.671 --> 01:48:11.970
<v Speaker 2>The security goes like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

2550
01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:12.920
<v Speaker 2>I go smoke it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

2551
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Once we went into a little nook and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cranny on a Saturday.</v>

2552
01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Remember they taped on a Saturday and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>sparked up and we got really fucking </v>

2553

<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

2557
01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:30.000
<v Speaker 2>That was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I stopped and I go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>How can you say that to me?</v>

2559
01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I just see you with my own eyes telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people what that wasn't funny and he</v>

2560
01:48:39.541 --> 01:48:41.880
<v Speaker 2>didn't see you when you were saying he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't see me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll still smack your fucking mouth.</v>

2570
01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:04.460
<v Speaker 2>He goes outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought he was bad to the bone with </v>

2571
01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:04.460
<v Speaker 2>his bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of these bikers from Malibu.</v>

2572
01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Probably can suck my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the funny thing is he's outside by </v>

2573
01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:12.561
<v Speaker 2>the pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when I went to hit him by the </v>

2574
01:49:12.561 --> 01:49:14.901
<v Speaker 2>pipe and he hit his head with a pipe and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're outside and he's sitting there </v>

2575
01:49:14.901 --> 01:49:15.480
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going back on this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Joe is leaves you a fucking man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting by a pipe like a little </v>

2577
01:49:20.481 --> 01:49:20.910
<v Speaker 2>fucking girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden,</v>

2578
01:49:20.911 --> 01:49:22.820
<v Speaker 2>my main man had to come up to be Jeff </v>
<v Speaker 2>sussman.</v>

2579
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:23.550
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2580
01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:26.070
<v Speaker 2>they don't want you to know a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might as well.</v>

2581
01:49:26.071 --> 01:49:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2582
01:49:27.150 --> 01:49:32.150
<v Speaker 2>I got to escort you off the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I go such and walked me over </v>

2583
01:49:32.150 --> 01:49:35.511
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went over there and put my hand </v>

2584
01:49:35.511 --> 01:49:35.511
<v Speaker 2>down and the guy wouldn't put his hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go,</v>

2585
01:49:35.511 --> 01:49:38.631
<v Speaker 2>fuck you bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just looked at me like he was a </v>

2586
01:49:38.631 --> 01:49:39.060
<v Speaker 2>tough guy with his friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember he looked at the security</v>

2587
01:49:39.061 --> 01:49:40.910
<v Speaker 2>guard to throw me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He listened.</v>

2588
01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.450
<v Speaker 2>The security guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the security guard is like,</v>

2589
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:44.740
<v Speaker 2>we just smoked a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2590
01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.590
<v Speaker 2>got his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very unfortunate.</v>

2591
01:49:46.591 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 2>He was very political</v>

2592
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.350
<v Speaker 3>and very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very deceptive.</v>

2593
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:51.900
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2594
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:53.000
<v Speaker 3>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't,</v>

2595
01:49:53.570 --> 01:49:54.240
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2596
01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:55.270
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we fucked up.</v>

2597
01:49:55.271 --> 01:49:56.320
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up in a bunch of stuff.</v>

2598
01:49:56.330 --> 01:49:58.070
<v Speaker 1>You're always on that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I fucked up with him.</v>

2599
01:49:58.071 --> 01:50:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I did not know he was that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was a different guy.</v>

2600
01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he do.</v>

2601
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Once he got in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to do it his way.</v>

2602
01:50:04.581 --> 01:50:06.270
<v Speaker 1>He decided that he was running shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a real.</v>

2603
01:50:06.570 --> 01:50:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Remember the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

2604
01:50:07.561 --> 01:50:08.820
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day one,</v>

2605
01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:13.880
<v Speaker 3>we walk in and we already have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think that we have two episodes </v>

2606
01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:13.880
<v Speaker 3>already done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2607
01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:15.810
<v Speaker 3>we've done all these sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's about two episodes worth.</v>

2608
01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:17.520
<v Speaker 3>So we walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got these all these episodes ready to</v>

<v Speaker 3>Let's do them.</v>

2611
01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:21.450
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2612
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:24.150
<v Speaker 3>you've got to write some new shit that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about that.</v>

2613
01:50:24.151 --> 01:50:25.740
<v Speaker 3>That's too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to do that shit.</v>

2614
01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Start over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So right.</v>

2615
01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that simple.</v>

2616
01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:31.770
<v Speaker 3>There was a bunch of sketches they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>already prepared.</v>

2617
01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

2618
01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Dave fucking won and they won.</v>

2619
01:50:36.751 --> 01:50:41.751
<v Speaker 3>They put me in a room with Chris Mcguire</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they go write some jokes about </v>

2620
01:50:41.751 --> 01:50:41.751
<v Speaker 3>Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go to Miami.</v>

2621
01:50:41.751 --> 01:50:42.860
<v Speaker 3>So now I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>

2622
01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:47.870
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm at high school all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to come up with these </v>

2623
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.870
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

2624
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2625
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:50.320
<v Speaker 3>we have all these other ideas that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are we write down new like</v>

2626
01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:52.170
<v Speaker 3>this is day one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first hour.</v>

2627
01:50:52.171 --> 01:50:52.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

2628
01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:56.640
<v Speaker 3>By the time that nightmare day ended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe was there all day too.</v>

2629
01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:58.830
<v Speaker 3>I go gentle man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't fucking right here.</v>

2630
01:50:58.831 --> 01:51:00.480
<v Speaker 3>They're ignoring all the other sketches </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we did.</v>

2631
01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:01.770
<v Speaker 3>And you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>

2632
01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I can't right here though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I had a writer's block here too.</v>

2633
01:51:04.151 --> 01:51:09.151
<v Speaker 3>It's just not the right environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that day you told Janice and the </v>

2634
01:51:09.151 --> 01:51:09.151
<v Speaker 3>producers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2635
01:51:09.151 --> 01:51:10.800
<v Speaker 3>me and Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to write at home.</v>

2636
01:51:10.801 --> 01:51:12.990
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when all the creative juices come</v>

2637
01:51:12.991 --> 01:51:13.800
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

2638
01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:17.130
<v Speaker 3>go ahead and get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll still pay him.</v>

2639
01:51:17.131 --> 01:51:19.140
<v Speaker 3>They just wanted to get rid of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

2640
01:51:19.810 --> 01:51:24.060
<v Speaker 3>I only worked there the first day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all after that was working at home.</v>

2641
01:51:24.150 --> 01:51:26.790
<v Speaker 3>My job was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2642
01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:29.310
<v Speaker 3>we got together a lot too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was really busy with fear factor.</v>

2643
01:51:29.311 --> 01:51:31.730
<v Speaker 3>So if we couldn't get together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd ride it home.</v>

2644
01:51:31.731 --> 01:51:34.080
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to have at least one sketch a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2645
01:51:34.230 --> 01:51:36.180
<v Speaker 3>So I'm at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile I'm training,</v>

2646
01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:38.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm training for Abu Dhabi going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2647
01:51:38.370 --> 01:51:40.140
<v Speaker 3>this is not what I thought it was going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

2648
01:51:40.141 --> 01:51:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just quit my strip job,</v>

2649
01:51:42.270 --> 01:51:44.850
<v Speaker 3>a club or Mr Club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>job strip,</v>

2650
01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Dj job for 10 years now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know this isn't gonna last day </v>

2651
01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:49.950
<v Speaker 3>one's a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2652
01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:54.980
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either the shows shows going to get </v>

2653
01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:56.781
<v Speaker 3>canceled because they were green </v>
<v Speaker 3>lighting a bunch of bullshit and every </v>

2654
01:51:56.781 --> 01:51:56.781
<v Speaker 3>now and then occasionally someone would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be funny,</v>

2655
01:51:56.781 --> 01:51:58.770
<v Speaker 3>like the decap attack thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ducks ducks down.</v>

2656
01:51:58.771 --> 01:51:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was hilarious to</v>

2657
01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:02.190
<v Speaker 1>what that show was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We needed to have control of it.</v>

2658
01:52:02.191 --> 01:52:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Doug had to have control of it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to have an appraiser that was on the</v>

2659
01:52:06.461 --> 01:52:11.461
<v Speaker 1>same page and the other problem we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that shows that it was the man </v>

2660
01:52:11.461 --> 01:52:11.461
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should have been doing our own show.</v>

2661
01:52:11.461 --> 01:52:13.450
<v Speaker 1>We should not have been taken over </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else's show.</v>

2662
01:52:13.451 --> 01:52:14.710
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>

2663
01:52:14.711 --> 01:52:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It was like a prepackaged show that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

2664
01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:21.540
<v Speaker 1>It was easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like know have been on fear </v>

2665
01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:24.151
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really have the time to put </v>

2666
01:52:24.151 --> 01:52:24.151
<v Speaker 1>something together so this way it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>all put together,</v>

2667
01:52:24.151 --> 01:52:28.261
<v Speaker 1>but it was a mistake and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful to those guys at Jimmy </v>

2668
01:52:28.261 --> 01:52:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Kimmel and Adam curl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think it was at the time.</v>

2669
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I thought they had amicably parted ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Jimmy wanted to do is talk show </v>

2670
01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:35.560
<v Speaker 1>and Adam wanted to do his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't the case.</v>

2671
01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:41.250
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want the show to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want anybody else to do it </v>

2672
01:52:41.250 --> 01:52:41.920
<v Speaker 1>and it was there a thing really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we shouldn't have done it.</v>

2673
01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:43.060
<v Speaker 1>The first question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2674
01:52:43.061 --> 01:52:48.061
<v Speaker 1>I love it on my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the air conditioner close by </v>

2675
01:52:48.061 --> 01:52:50.860
<v Speaker 1>dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a fucking yoga class in the </v>

2676
01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:51.890
<v Speaker 1>hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't go out in the hallway.</v>

2677
01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:53.640
<v Speaker 1>We're going to end it with a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes anyway.</v>

2678
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all got sweat on your fucking load or</v>

2679
01:52:57.650 --> 01:53:01.510
<v Speaker 1>it's just that shining too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got makeup on Cock sucker.</v>

2680
01:53:01.570 --> 01:53:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I got glistening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God put some oils.</v>

2681
01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I would have pulled up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look slippery.</v>

2682
01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:08.450
<v Speaker 1>What time is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost 5:00</v>

2683
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.310
<v Speaker 1>or 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>

2684
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want me to go to for 20 symbolically</v>

2685
01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:13.580
<v Speaker 1>when NSF for 27,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2686
01:53:14.230 --> 01:53:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Hanging in there with 20 slash 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes without air conditioning.</v>

2687
01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:17.690
<v Speaker 1>It's too fucking hot.</v>

2688
01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about what Mccain went through and</v>

2689
01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm you fucking Cock sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his choice.</v>

2690
01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:24.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came up here to a house.</v>

2691
01:53:24.621 --> 01:53:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had the era,</v>

2692
01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even really talk about the UFC</v>

2693
01:53:31.311 --> 01:53:31.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

2694
01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.590
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2695
01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Mo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might as well write this.</v>

2696
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:37.070
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think about bj and frankie </v>
<v Speaker 1>edgar?</v>

2697
01:53:37.130 --> 01:53:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know bj,</v>

2698
01:53:38.781 --> 01:53:40.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game plan,</v>

2699
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:42.080
<v Speaker 1>like when they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were in between corners,</v>

2700
01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:44.990
<v Speaker 1>they didn't seem to have a game plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game plan was like kick his ass,</v>

2701
01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:46.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game plan was like,</v>

2702
01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:48.080
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no leg kicks,</v>

2703
01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:50.270
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I want to see way more leg kicks.</v>

2704
01:53:50.271 --> 01:53:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought he could land leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's landing on man.</v>

2705
01:53:52.610 --> 01:53:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Every one of those leg kicks takes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spring out of your step.</v>

2706
01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:57.050
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with a guy who can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't catch him.</v>

2707
01:53:57.051 --> 01:53:58.540
<v Speaker 1>He's so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankie edgar's old.</v>

2708
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Lightening bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's all over the place.</v>

2709
01:53:59.770 --> 01:54:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's too fast,</v>

2710
01:54:01.090 --> 01:54:06.090
<v Speaker 1>but he was able to land lake kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bj landed a bunch of pancakes When he </v>

2711
01:54:06.090 --> 01:54:06.380
<v Speaker 1>tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the attempts to board,</v>

2712
01:54:06.381 --> 01:54:08.360
<v Speaker 1>not that many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it takes a lot of energy,</v>

2713
01:54:08.361 --> 01:54:10.010
<v Speaker 1>but he should have been thrown a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more leg kicks.</v>

2714
01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I think bj tried his fucking ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the fifth round.</v>

2715
01:54:13.401 --> 01:54:15.050
<v Speaker 1>He went after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think frankie,</v>

2716
01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:15.770
<v Speaker 1>frankie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>edgar,</v>

2717
01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:16.790
<v Speaker 1>is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2718
01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:18.110
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fast.</v>

2719
01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:22.550
<v Speaker 1>He never gets tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could do 25 rounds so fast.</v>

2720
01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:25.850
<v Speaker 1>His wrestling is top notch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His striking is amazing.</v>

2721
01:54:25.851 --> 01:54:30.851
<v Speaker 1>He's hard to hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hard to get ahold of not taking </v>

2722
01:54:30.851 --> 01:54:30.860
<v Speaker 1>anything away from frankie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just stopped bj's game plan,</v>

2723
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:32.930
<v Speaker 1>the game plan that I don't agree with.</v>

2724
01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:34.940
<v Speaker 1>His advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advice in the corner.</v>

2725
01:54:35.150 --> 01:54:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't any advice.</v>

2726
01:54:36.381 --> 01:54:38.980
<v Speaker 1>They were just giving whatever kick his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass or whatever that it.</v>

2727
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you want to call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know this from that,</v>

2728
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:44.300
<v Speaker 1>but that last two fights against </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2729
01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:47.360
<v Speaker 1>That was not the same guy seen against </v>
<v Speaker 1>diego sanchez.</v>

2730
01:54:47.361 --> 01:54:48.680
<v Speaker 1>There's something more that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2731
01:54:48.690 --> 01:54:51.020
<v Speaker 1>it could Be a lack of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be,</v>

2732
01:54:51.021 --> 01:54:52.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs to mix things up.</v>

2733
01:54:52.810 --> 01:54:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between the camp,</v>

2734
01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:57.630
<v Speaker 1>the difference between frankie edgar </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup and dig a sanchez standard.</v>

2735
01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:03.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge difference to his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have the cj hurt diego </v>

2736
01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.020
<v Speaker 1>early on a fight that fight was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was perfect.</v>

2737
01:55:05.021 --> 01:55:10.021
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't have any Fucking tenacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the dj was gonna to frankie bEcause </v>

2738
01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:12.740
<v Speaker 1>frankie edgar counters that tenacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his speed.</v>

2739
01:55:13.130 --> 01:55:15.170
<v Speaker 1>It could be the bj get frustrated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2740
01:55:15.171 --> 01:55:20.171
<v Speaker 1>he loses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets a little disheartened and </v>

2741
01:55:20.171 --> 01:55:23.560
<v Speaker 1>amazing wrestler with serious standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>because for the longest time bj had the </v>

2742
01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:23.930
<v Speaker 1>best hands.</v>

2743
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 1>That lightweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one was fucking with bj.</v>

2744
01:55:25.821 --> 01:55:28.190
<v Speaker 1>He was the best boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now frankie edgar,</v>

2745
01:55:28.191 --> 01:55:29.540
<v Speaker 1>it looks like his technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2746
01:55:29.541 --> 01:55:32.600
<v Speaker 1>it's totally different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like he's just too fast,</v>

2747
01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:35.510
<v Speaker 1>too good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's working too hard and I think,</v>

2748
01:55:35.530 --> 01:55:36.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2749
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:38.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe be jay might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2750
01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a switch,</v>

2751
01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:45.320
<v Speaker 1>like you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a switch of camps maybe might not hurt </v>

2752
01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:48.110
<v Speaker 1>add anything new or something fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>jaegers kicking it to a whole nother </v>

2753
01:55:48.110 --> 01:55:48.330
<v Speaker 1>level athletically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speed,</v>

2754
01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:53.480
<v Speaker 1>endurance wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he can move his training camp </v>

2755
01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:53.480
<v Speaker 1>must be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should fucking worker machine.</v>

2756
01:55:53.610 --> 01:55:58.610
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those little dudes you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck with someone has been fucking with </v>

2757
01:55:58.610 --> 01:56:02.451
<v Speaker 1>him all of his life and he built up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of tenacity that not that many </v>

2758
01:56:02.451 --> 01:56:04.200
<v Speaker 1>people can handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mentality is fucking perfect.</v>

2759
01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Randy couture's mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2760
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.810
<v Speaker 1>And It's cardio and his endurance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his will.</v>

2761
01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:11.940
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at like the way he moves,</v>

2762
01:56:11.941 --> 01:56:14.280
<v Speaker 1>he moves better than random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2763
01:56:14.281 --> 01:56:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the mental game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2764
01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:17.040
<v Speaker 1>people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2765
01:56:17.041 --> 01:56:18.380
<v Speaker 1>he's not stopping people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stopped stopping.</v>

2766
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you have to realize though,</v>

2767
01:56:19.741 --> 01:56:22.710
<v Speaker 1>is he's quite a bit smaller than </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else in the division.</v>

2768
01:56:22.711 --> 01:56:25.170
<v Speaker 1>He's 154 pounds for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legit.</v>

2769
01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:28.740
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately he's throwing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>with evil intentions.</v>

2770
01:56:29.070 --> 01:56:31.470
<v Speaker 1>He just hasn't developed the power yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I believe,</v>

2771
01:56:31.710 --> 01:56:33.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the next couple of years,</v>

2772
01:56:33.391 --> 01:56:34.110
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>

2773
01:56:34.111 --> 01:56:36.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be crushing people because</v>

2774
01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:41.301
<v Speaker 1>he comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes in to blast 100 percent now </v>

<v Speaker 1>weapons to his game constantly.</v>
