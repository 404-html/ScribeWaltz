<v Speaker 1>I don't sit on wallet so I don't play </v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>with wallets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're ready.</v>

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't sure.</v>

5
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.760

<v Speaker 1>Phil.</v>

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Show me is you have a mini fanny pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very small.</v>

7
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can carry everything I </v>
<v Speaker 1>need and a small phone.</v>

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>He can't carry a modern phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like pre modern.</v>

9
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>The six fits in there is six plus would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a problem.</v>

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Bang against your deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tighten up.</v>

11
00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:34.721
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for everybody who hasn't seen you on </v>

12
00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>the podcast before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's give them a brief synopsis.</v>

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>You were a trainer one time at Marine </v>
<v Speaker 1>Land and you,</v>

14
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're known as the walrus whisper.</v>

15
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>That's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your handle on twitter,</v>

16
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't select by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know.</v>

17
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on a TV show called white boat and</v>

18
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>it was grassroots as hell in Canada.</v>

19
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>So basically what they do is they fly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

20
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

21
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>they sort of rent the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

22
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of it being,</v>

23
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wipe out whatever country.</v>

24
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>This time it's Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was really grassroots and so they </v>

25
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>told us if you guys can like help </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise,</v>

26
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>so get onto your twitters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on your this,</v>

27
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>get on your that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called me walrus whisper.</v>

28
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>It just made sense to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise I don't particularly love it.</v>

29
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>So it was like for a show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was great,</v>

30
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but let's explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You worked for marine land,</v>

31
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>you got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>

32
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>you were taking care of this wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Risks and it,</v>

33
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:31.341
<v Speaker 1>it became like a big cars because a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people were concerned about the </v>

34
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>animal's safety there and since then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been cited like what?</v>

35
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>What has happened with Greenland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

36
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll give you a quick rundown.</v>

37
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>So I worked at marine land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was killer whale trainer.</v>

38
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I was the guy jumping off the killer </v>
<v Speaker 1>whales doing the flips off dolphins,</v>

39
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quit amidst some duress,</v>

41
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>a difficult period where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll elaborate the basically a water</v>

42
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>disinfection unit broke down and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolve wasn't so much to fix it.</v>

43
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>It was to pump it with more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>chlorine basically.</v>

44
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way water is disinfected of </v>

45
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Greenland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used an ozone generator,</v>

46
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>so they use ozone in conjunction with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Koreans or mitigate the chlorine use</v>

47
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 1>they elected instead or rather the soul </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling mind elected to put off </v>

48
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>actually fixing it and let's just at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night they're pumping it with chlorine.</v>

49
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Well you can just imagine the effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to talk about a little</v>

50
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>bit of chlorine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was,</v>

51
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>this was a tough time.</v>

52
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I actually quit.</v>

53
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I actually quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine the effect.</v>

54
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>So it hurt the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

55
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.230
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this on the earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that people want to go back in </v>

56
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>time a few years to when you first </v>
<v Speaker 1>appeared on the show,</v>

57
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>there was like some serious issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health issues with dolphins,</v>

58
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their skin's peeling off there.</v>

59
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>They've got ulcers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the sea lions are losing for in </v>

60
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>patches bleeding out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this case cases,</v>

61
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>at least one animal died and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>started getting real bad.</v>

62
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And of course my walrus in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all of this is there and she's in the</v>

63
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>water as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if this only compounds the issue,</v>

64
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>and the thing about the Walrus is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

65
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I use the word a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's anomalous.</v>

66
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 2>My relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she thinks I'm her mom.</v>

67
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 2>It was like a scientific thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened or brain circuitry opens.</v>

68
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I imprint on her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my smell,</v>

69
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 2>everything I looked like or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when she was a baby,</v>

70
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 2>well she was actually two years old when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happened.</v>

71
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it kind of us on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

72
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 2>That's not a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

73
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 2>How old is that in the wall?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where swirled like is it dog ears?</v>

74
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's still young.</v>

75
00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean dog years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's babyish.</v>

76
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two years.</v>

77
00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 2>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's fairly young.</v>

78
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 2>And you were a caretaker so she </v>
<v Speaker 2>imprinted that you were her parents?</v>

79
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was sort of a traumatic thing that</v>

80
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:32.340
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

81
00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:37.341
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were drawing blood from them because </v>

82
00:03:37.341 --> 00:03:37.341
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:03:37.341 --> 00:03:37.341
<v Speaker 2>they're not trained to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

84
00:03:37.341 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 2>to accept the pain of drawing blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

85
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't conditioned for this.</v>

86
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 2>They were young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to get blood.</v>

87
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:45.620
<v Speaker 2>So we were actually doing a job on </v>
<v Speaker 2>another wall.</v>

88
00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:50.621
<v Speaker 2>Risks and she was sort of loose running </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and we were wrestling her down and </v>

89
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 2>smooshy come over and she's climbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>hectic and crazy and uh,</v>

90
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's still almost 300 pounds at that </v>

91
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

92
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 2>you gotta move her if she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she's climbing all over you,</v>

93
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a big obstruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sort of put my hands in front of </v>

94
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.550
<v Speaker 2>her face and that's when it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

95
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.510
<v Speaker 2>you see it was like a magical moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden something happened and </v>

96
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 2>she just looked at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her eyes changed.</v>

97
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was now a different person.</v>

98
00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm not her mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was following me.</v>

99
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 2>So I walked down away from the scene </v>
<v Speaker 2>just following me.</v>

100
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>And from that moment on she never </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped.</v>

101
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's just sort of became the basis</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our relationship is that I've sort of</v>

102
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:25.951
<v Speaker 2>raised her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you put like the touch on her to </v>

103
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:25.951
<v Speaker 2>touch on it yet with these two hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>

104
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 2>right in front of her face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it.</v>

105
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Is that a normal thing with animals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said it,</v>

106
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 2>it almost never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hear if the animal's imprinting on </v>

107
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 2>humans a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not usually at her age.</v>

108
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 2>That was a bit advanced for that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

109
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Usually it happens when they're very </v>
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>

110
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's going to happen.</v>

111
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

112
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.760
<v Speaker 2>It does happen when people raise bears </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of weird animals that you </v>

113
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.321
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't ordinarily think is pets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if it would be an </v>

114
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:49.321
<v Speaker 2>actual imprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the imprint is different.</v>

115
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 2>There's one thing of familiarizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you differentiate?</v>

116
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

117
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.630
<v Speaker 2>It's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

118
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 2>she's protective of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She will not leave my side.</v>

119
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could walk to the edge of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth with her and she'll be beside me.</v>

120
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's still a marine land right now.</v>

121
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

122
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:07.651
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen any updated photos and </v>

123
00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:07.651
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't be absolutely sure,</v>

124
00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fairly sure,</v>

125
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 2>but she's hitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't do not bring her on display.</v>

126
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Not on display.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna.</v>

127
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Find her why they hide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hide.</v>

128
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:19.500
<v Speaker 2>The pinnipeds basically seals sea lions </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the walruses.</v>

129
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 2>They bring them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In her case,</v>

130
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't perform anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she comes out,</v>

131
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 2>she's not reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get to do anything.</v>

132
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 2>All she does is goes out on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she looks for me frantically so it's not</v>

133
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:33.121
<v Speaker 2>reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they bring her up between shows </v>

134
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:33.121
<v Speaker 2>occasionally so she can see the sun and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

135
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:38.461
<v Speaker 2>I've got to have people in there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>video cameras ready and I mean it's </v>

137
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 2>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we get the videos,</v>

138
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 2>we get the information I need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's going on with you and them </v>

139
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.830
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's been a series of </v>

140
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.830
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits and this is one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>why you wanted to come in here and talk.</v>

141
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've,</v>

142
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they sued me,</v>

143
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a frivolously they sued me with plotting</v>

144
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 2>to steal a walrus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the,</v>

145
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 2>is the allegation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was in 2000.</v>

146
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 2>This is actually a five year </v>
<v Speaker 2>anniversary.</v>

147
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Comes up on a unbalanced plotting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>steal a walrus.</v>

148
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:09.761
<v Speaker 2>Did you try to get her out of there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know if I tried to get her out of there </v>

149
00:06:09.761 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 2>and have her today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

150
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have nowhere to put a walrus.</v>

151
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do have a river in the front yard,</v>

152
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:18.851
<v Speaker 2>but I have no interest in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in releasing her into the Nag River and </v>

153
00:06:18.851 --> 00:06:18.851
<v Speaker 2>then watch her go over the falls.</v>

154
00:06:18.851 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no interest in that.</v>

155
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that.</v>

156
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a beach front Arctic home </v>
<v Speaker 2>to carrier too.</v>

157
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.660
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they started suing the shit out of </v>

158
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.601
<v Speaker 2>anyone who spoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone who spoke on the record was </v>

159
00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:31.601
<v Speaker 2>getting sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't just me,</v>

160
00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Speaker 2>it was a number of people and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

161
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 2>So we just elected to try to fight as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long as we could try to sustain this </v>

162
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.551
<v Speaker 2>legal battle because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in lawsuits you've got to reveal a lot </v>

163
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:42.551
<v Speaker 2>of information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lawsuit.</v>

164
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not fun like this Greenland's had </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything from my phone to like the,</v>

165
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not physically,</v>

166
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 2>but I've given what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

167
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Like your phone communications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have everything.</v>

168
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

169
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 2>So if they sue you for trying to take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Walrus,</v>

170
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 2>he didn't actually try to take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can get access to your phone </v>

171
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 2>records.</v>

172
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 2>They can ruin your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

173
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.251
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean anything they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get access to your phone or why would </v>

174
00:07:05.251 --> 00:07:05.251
<v Speaker 2>they have access to your phone records </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have?</v>

175
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a legal obligation of giving them</v>

176
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 2>anything that is relevant to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim.</v>

177
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.690
<v Speaker 2>So be it communications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be it photographs,</v>

178
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.700
<v Speaker 2>but what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean they can read all your </v>

179
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.700
<v Speaker 2>text messages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read all your emails,</v>

180
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.350
<v Speaker 2>read them all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

181
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 2>they know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

182
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

183
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:28.721
<v Speaker 2>And I have zero from them after five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years because they're using the system </v>

184
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:32.621
<v Speaker 2>as a means to just simply abused me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting the fool as there as Greenland's </v>

185
00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 2>legal team does exceptionally well </v>
<v Speaker 2>proved,</v>

186
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.640
<v Speaker 2>proved very effective in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.770
<v Speaker 2>abusing a guy like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas a corporation with endless </v>

188
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.770
<v Speaker 2>amounts of money just sue the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of me.</v>

189
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.240
<v Speaker 2>So they're basically just suing you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>punish you and to try to keep other </v>

190
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 2>people from doing the same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about them.</v>

191
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.370
<v Speaker 2>They've sued media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've sued a student.</v>

192
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Eighteen year old kid from California </v>
<v Speaker 2>who didn't eat.</v>

193
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.790
<v Speaker 2>It was a yet to be released.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A project movie.</v>

194
00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 2>He made almost like a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in the,</v>

195
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:04.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the key of marine lands,</v>

196
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Canada's last remaining Orca Kiska and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>marine land caught wind of that and they</v>

197
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 2>sued them for a million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

198
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:17.741
<v Speaker 2>I assume that settled now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that there's no way of </v>

199
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:17.741
<v Speaker 2>knowing because I haven't heard anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

200
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:21.100
<v Speaker 2>But what was their lawsuit based on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

201
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 2>at least in what I think I just scanned </v>
<v Speaker 2>the documents,</v>

202
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:27.700
<v Speaker 2>but they alleged that I can't remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

203
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:33.390
<v Speaker 2>How does that work when they sue someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>from California and does he have to go </v>

204
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:33.390
<v Speaker 2>to Canada?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

205
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually I,</v>

206
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what was so confusing about it.</v>

207
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're,</v>

208
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 2>you're suing Americans and stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that works.</v>

209
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 2>They sued another writer in fact as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an American writer.</v>

210
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't give a shit.</v>

211
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't,</v>

212
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 2>they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get fined recently.</v>

213
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.510
<v Speaker 2>So didn't something happened along those</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines?</v>

214
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:55.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got charged with 11 counts of </v>

215
00:08:55.511 --> 00:08:56.980
<v Speaker 2>animal cruelty a little over a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

216
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.690
<v Speaker 2>I was in court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course marine land,</v>

217
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:05.691
<v Speaker 2>Sue's OSTP PCA for 21 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alleges agency wanted to destroy the </v>

218
00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 2>theme park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's where we're going.</v>

219
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 2>So basically down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the course of,</v>

220
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get into this.</v>

221
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 2>So the charges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have 11 charges of animal cruelty.</v>

222
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 2>First they were five at our five or six </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then an additional five or six.</v>

223
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a total of 11 charges for </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal cruelty that marina has to go to </v>

224
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 2>the criminal court to defend against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They drag it on.</v>

225
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 2>As always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in court every freaking day.</v>

226
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.250
<v Speaker 2>You can bet your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm even,</v>

227
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 2>even one time there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

228
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.370
<v Speaker 2>it was a confidential meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact it was not for me and a local </v>

229
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 2>writer knock on the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut,</v>

230
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 2>sort of walk in and the lawyers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at us like,</v>

231
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you doing here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're like,</v>

232
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:39.940
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like can we sit in on.</v>

233
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know what you just said.</v>

234
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:48.250
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was during the negotiations between </v>

235
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:48.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

236
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.490
<v Speaker 2>the crown and the Spca for the town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

237
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.560
<v Speaker 2>the crown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one who would be laying the </v>

238
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.560
<v Speaker 2>charges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

239
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal cruelty charges.</v>

240
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.560
<v Speaker 2>So you get charged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

241
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 2>What is the crown?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crown is the,</v>

242
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 2>is the justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like the,</v>

243
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 2>essentially the judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're before the judge.</v>

244
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

245
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what the fuck that shit is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get confused.</v>

246
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't wear one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

247
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

248
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 2>so it's like crown land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know crown land.</v>

249
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.440
<v Speaker 2>That's public land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

250
00:10:11.441 --> 00:10:16.441
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I imagine that's probably is in some </v>

251
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:16.441
<v Speaker 2>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why it's called crown.</v>

252
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

253
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a legal expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless.</v>

254
00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:23.811
<v Speaker 2>So they're in their negotiating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically the way animal cruelty </v>

255
00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:24.010
<v Speaker 2>charges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

256
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 2>are our pursuit is they have to meet to </v>
<v Speaker 2>thresholds.</v>

257
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a reasonable chance of </v>

258
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 2>conviction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>

259
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.780
<v Speaker 2>it has to be in the public's interest to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue a series of the first charges </v>

260
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.681
<v Speaker 2>were immediately dropped because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is just driving me crazy for </v>

261
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:44.790
<v Speaker 2>years that this has been going on and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>continues.</v>

262
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.560
<v Speaker 2>But if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

263
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 2>if I make a complaint to the LSPC and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>provide a photo of an animal,</v>

264
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:52.650
<v Speaker 2>which of course I did that is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>damaged and fucked up,</v>

265
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.750
<v Speaker 2>if they don't physically have evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of who it is that's actually harming the</v>

266
00:10:57.751 --> 00:10:59.100
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no cruelty.</v>

267
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 2>They can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that case,</v>

268
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:07.190
<v Speaker 2>they dropped the charges against marine </v>
<v Speaker 2>land because the evidence didn't </v>

269
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 2>actually point to anyone specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just evidence of damage animals.</v>

270
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 2>So they throw a bunch out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

271
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.140
<v Speaker 2>But then there was a bunch that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they did have a good chance at at a</v>

272
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.160
<v Speaker 2>conviction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where marine land promised </v>

273
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 2>the crown that this was going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very expensive process,</v>

274
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 2>long and drawn out process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the crown agreed that it didn't meet</v>

275
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:28.791
<v Speaker 2>the threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It exceed the threshold of being in the </v>

276
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:31.191
<v Speaker 2>public public interest in spending a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of of of public dollars pursuing these </v>

277
00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:33.630
<v Speaker 2>charges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they drop the rest of them.</v>

278
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Marine land turns around and Sues Dos pc</v>
<v Speaker 2>for $21,</v>

279
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.770
<v Speaker 2>million claiming that it was malicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecution that of course they name,</v>

280
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:47.030
<v Speaker 2>they didn't name me specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm always the unnamed Marineland </v>

281
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.730
<v Speaker 2>employee in that and they alleged that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened to defund them and all the,</v>

282
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 2>they think I'm this keyser soze a lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>

283
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Speaker 2>which I don't mind playing up a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

284
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:56.271
<v Speaker 2>but they think I'm pulling strings all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the place and then I have exists </v>

285
00:11:56.271 --> 00:11:56.271
<v Speaker 2>half don't.</v>

286
00:11:56.271 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I think there's employees there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that I'm like,</v>

287
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

288
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 2>they get brought up on 11 charges of </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal cruelty.</v>

289
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 2>The charges get dropped and they turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and sue the government.</v>

290
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Twenty $1,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same government that led them off </v>

291
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.991
<v Speaker 2>for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The SPCA has been complacent and </v>

292
00:12:12.991 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 2>complicit in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in certainly allowing greenland to </v>

293
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:15.750
<v Speaker 2>operate as they have unimpeded for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

294
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.840
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years.</v>

295
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:21.841
<v Speaker 2>They've had a good relation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greenland in fact donated the land of </v>

296
00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:21.841
<v Speaker 2>which the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

297
00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Niagara Falls humane society is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is built on,</v>

298
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 2>which is where the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

299
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 2>SPCA operates out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a plaque on the wall until,</v>

300
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after 2012 and we started,</v>

301
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.850
<v Speaker 2>spoke out that honored murraylands owner</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Holder for his generosity.</v>

302
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sort of get red pill,</v>

303
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 2>is that red pills at the right pill </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty quickly when you wake up?</v>

304
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Pill.</v>

305
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.580
<v Speaker 2>So that was my wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what moment?</v>

306
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:47.581
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinks things started to change pretty </v>

307
00:12:47.581 --> 00:12:50.641
<v Speaker 2>fast for me once I realized the depth of</v>
<v Speaker 2>which marine land was sort of in with </v>

308
00:12:50.641 --> 00:12:52.390
<v Speaker 2>all levels of government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really all levels of government.</v>

309
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.080
<v Speaker 2>they continued to sort of allow for them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do these things,</v>

311
00:12:56.081 --> 00:13:01.081
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're suing the government can't </v>

312
00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:04.560
<v Speaker 2>possibly be in bed with the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>and suing them or the Canadian </v>

313
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Association of Zoos and aquarium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which used to accredit all the zoos and </v>

314
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Canada or still does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They accredit them.</v>

315
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.150
<v Speaker 2>So they try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to say,</v>

316
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a good zoo.</v>

317
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 2>It's accredited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Marine land,</v>

318
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:17.590
<v Speaker 2>I believe also threatened them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were not going to renew their,</v>

319
00:13:17.591 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their uh,</v>

320
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.480
<v Speaker 2>their agreement this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so marine land claimed to have left </v>

321
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Speaker 2>them and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

322
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in the phase of development right </v>

323
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

324
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.160
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just leave this Canadian Association of </v>

325
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Zoos and aquariums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolute bullshit.</v>

326
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.840
<v Speaker 2>They were not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were.</v>

327
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marine lines basically has there.</v>

328
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:37.030
<v Speaker 2>They're out of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

329
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Finally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it took a lot of shit to get finally</v>

330
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 2>get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get to that.</v>

331
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.830
<v Speaker 2>But the real issue in your mind is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they treat the animals,</v>

332
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 2>the way they run their business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

333
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that I've expanded now into </v>

334
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.511
<v Speaker 2>just arguing that those animals should </v>
<v Speaker 2>not be in a relaxed position,</v>

335
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 2>be altogether the whales pools is done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be done,</v>

336
00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.560
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be done.</v>

337
00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:03.390
<v Speaker 2>And I think after blackfish mean before </v>
<v Speaker 2>you came on or when you came on,</v>

338
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 2>it was before black fish had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>released.</v>

339
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.560
<v Speaker 2>And then once people saw what actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to these super intelligent </v>

340
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:12.670
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you lock them up in swimming pools,</v>

341
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:18.290
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to realize it and see </v>

342
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:18.290
<v Speaker 2>worlds.</v>

343
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Attendance is down and people are down </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the whole idea.</v>

344
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Especially killer whales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

345
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.730
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just giant,</v>

346
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:26.731
<v Speaker 2>majestic animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems so fucked up to put them in </v>

347
00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 2>these tanks and to separate them from </v>
<v Speaker 2>families.</v>

348
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean the emotional distress they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>

349
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer that emotionally we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even have the slightest sense of </v>

350
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.821
<v Speaker 2>how complex they can be because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have an ability to express </v>

351
00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:42.061
<v Speaker 2>themselves to us and other than eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>us occasionally and then weed killer </v>

352
00:14:42.061 --> 00:14:42.310
<v Speaker 2>whales only do in captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

353
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:47.311
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no records of a killer whale </v>

354
00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:49.251
<v Speaker 2>attacks in the wild state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck people up in captivity though </v>

355
00:14:49.251 --> 00:14:49.251
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

356
00:14:49.251 --> 00:14:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the pool with a pissed off </v>
<v Speaker 2>killer whale.</v>

357
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

358
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 2>I jumped in one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

359
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm a stubborn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of a cowboy.</v>

360
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 2>He's a young guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like adrenaline junkie.</v>

361
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I like to have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to jump off the kilo,</v>

362
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Elekta her to throw me up high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was having a show with her </v>

363
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.491
<v Speaker 2>basically the way that shows where she </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw you their tail on the end of a </v>

364
00:15:06.491 --> 00:15:06.491
<v Speaker 2>roster mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never know dunks you.</v>

365
00:15:06.491 --> 00:15:10.990
<v Speaker 2>It's called the rocket ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get on the front of the whale as </v>

366
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.950
<v Speaker 2>such at the top of the water and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>she starts to pump her tail and you dive</v>

367
00:15:12.951 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 2>down with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll follow you everywhere,</v>

368
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 2>everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

369
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like flying a plane,</v>

370
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:17.570
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

371
00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:22.571
<v Speaker 2>And then you just arch up and then she </v>
<v Speaker 2>just takes it to the moon and she's </v>

372
00:15:22.571 --> 00:15:25.061
<v Speaker 2>screaming under water when she's having </v>
<v Speaker 2>a good time or rather when she's </v>

373
00:15:25.061 --> 00:15:25.800
<v Speaker 2>expressing herself that she's gonna toss</v>
<v Speaker 2>you this particular time when,</v>

374
00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:26.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was,</v>

375
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.530
<v Speaker 2>when I probably shouldn't have gone in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the water by while she was pissed,</v>

376
00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I could see in their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you tell that she's no,</v>

377
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.890
<v Speaker 2>the animals lick it.</v>

378
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole basis of being a </v>

379
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:38.890
<v Speaker 2>trainers to get to know the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know their behavior,</v>

380
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:39.800
<v Speaker 2>know everything about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You spend a lot of time with them.</v>

381
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.440
<v Speaker 2>What are the indications?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in this case I was.</v>

382
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.570
<v Speaker 2>So the way the shows were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they don't,</v>

383
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.630
<v Speaker 2>they don't exist anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back in the day was you work the </v>

384
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 2>animal initially just to get a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their demeanor.</v>

385
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.300
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to jump in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to run around,</v>

386
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.120
<v Speaker 2>you get a gauge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

387
00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:54.470
<v Speaker 2>you got a good sense of how they are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that particular day.</v>

388
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.850
<v Speaker 2>She just wasn't responding real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her eyes were a little big,</v>

389
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.330
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't focused on Asia.</v>

390
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Looking elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's sort of drifting off a bit.</v>

391
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:07.780
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't really have her attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think I don't know what maybe I </v>

392
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:07.780
<v Speaker 2>had my dad in the crowd or something.</v>

393
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I want it to jump off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I look at the senior trainer at the </v>

394
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:11.620
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

395
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're gonna jump in and like,</v>

396
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:11.960
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm jumping in.</v>

397
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.740
<v Speaker 2>I go to jump in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to the edge of the pool.</v>

398
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Speaker 2>She standard directly above or below me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dive over her.</v>

399
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.300
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she lunges at me and she snaps and I see</v>

400
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:25.370
<v Speaker 2>it from below me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I see under that.</v>

401
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:29.600
<v Speaker 2>She's drawn up and snapped at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I've snapped at you like tried to</v>

402
00:16:29.601 --> 00:16:30.740
<v Speaker 2>bite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She tried to grab me.</v>

403
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 2>So now I feel like if she really wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bite you,</v>

404
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:34.640
<v Speaker 2>she would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

405
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

406
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 2>so now I'm supposed to have warning bite</v>
<v Speaker 2>or was it a bite bite?</v>

407
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Prob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely a warning.</v>

408
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:43.090
<v Speaker 2>But otherwise I wouldn't be here </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight.</v>

409
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.630
<v Speaker 2>She if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

410
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not as she would miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

411
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.870
<v Speaker 2>she's not going to miss so and so and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

412
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:52.871
<v Speaker 2>It gets further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm in the water and I'm now at </v>

413
00:16:52.871 --> 00:16:52.871
<v Speaker 2>the top of the water and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and staring down at her.</v>

414
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.540
<v Speaker 2>She's now inverted upside down and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>swimming and she's circling the pool.</v>

415
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:57.630
<v Speaker 2>So upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

416
00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you get frustrated?</v>

417
00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:03.911
<v Speaker 2>They start doing these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's upside down and she's swimming in </v>

418
00:17:03.911 --> 00:17:03.911
<v Speaker 2>circles and I'm looking at going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

419
00:17:03.911 --> 00:17:04.730
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I take off out of the pool,</v>

420
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:07.640
<v Speaker 2>that's going to trigger some response </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of her that I don't necessarily want</v>

421
00:17:07.641 --> 00:17:10.070
<v Speaker 2>to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm saying why would that happen?</v>

422
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she doesn't want you out of the pool,</v>

423
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:13.370
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting out.</v>

424
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.690
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're getting out of the pool,</v>

425
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:16.610
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be a hard decision if I,</v>

426
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.190
<v Speaker 2>if I start trying to erase out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knows I'm trying to get out.</v>

427
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.380
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't want me to actually stay in </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

428
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Actually just keep me in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know where that's going.</v>

429
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:27.340
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you knew that you had to stay in </v>

430
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 2>there then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm without choice.</v>

431
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:30.200
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the best course of action at this</v>

432
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 2>point because I'm not going to win a </v>
<v Speaker 2>race out of that pool.</v>

433
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.480
<v Speaker 2>And so now I'm upright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She comes to the surface and I see her </v>

434
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>dorsal fin and she's coming pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly at me and I put my hands up like</v>

435
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:40.490
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget it.</v>

436
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:44.540
<v Speaker 2>She works her tail down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arcserve backup like stops dead at me.</v>

437
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.160
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember this big wake happen.</v>

438
00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I put my hands on her rostrum I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorta tap kind of and then I put my feet</v>

439
00:17:50.161 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 2>on her pecs.</v>

440
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I sorta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she takes me to the stage,</v>

441
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 2>she dunks down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she and then she picks me up,</v>

442
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:57.600
<v Speaker 2>puts me on the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of back away like,</v>

443
00:17:57.601 --> 00:17:58.590
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

444
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for like being nice to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend's dad one time there and </v>

445
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of these guys.</v>

446
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I told them I took them on a tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

447
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:07.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just don't touch the big male sea lions.</v>

448
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got big teeth.</v>

449
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 2>They wanna rip your arm off the Kent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not typically aggressive,</v>

450
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 2>but just don't touch him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's in there like this.</v>

451
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh dude,</v>

452
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.880

<v Speaker 2>whale.</v>

453
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I could see that this was another time </v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

454
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 2>but I could see that she's losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients.</v>

455
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.420
<v Speaker 2>And she did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as we turned our backs,</v>

456
00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

458
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should just step away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as he turned his back to go,</v>

459
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.300
<v Speaker 2>she lunged same thing and tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to grab.</v>

460
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was just like,</v>

461
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.850
<v Speaker 2>holy shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't have killer whale shows </v>

462
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.850
<v Speaker 2>there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

463
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.150
<v Speaker 2>that killed that particular killer </v>
<v Speaker 2>whale.</v>

464
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Kisco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the only one left in Canada.</v>

465
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:42.591
<v Speaker 2>There's no more in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not ever going to be in </v>

466
00:18:42.591 --> 00:18:42.591
<v Speaker 2>redlands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never going to get another one.</v>

467
00:18:42.591 --> 00:18:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's been sort of unresponsive for a </v>

468
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.040
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's on a lot of medication,</v>

469
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 2>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of medication.</v>

470
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.720
<v Speaker 2>What kind of medication do you put a </v>
<v Speaker 2>killer whale on while she's got </v>

471
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.791
<v Speaker 2>different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gauge the blood and you start putting </v>

472
00:18:55.791 --> 00:18:56.830
<v Speaker 2>them on an antibiotic antibiotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd get them on a uh,</v>

473
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

474
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 2>how do you take blood from a killer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll flip over and they got out,</v>

475
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 2>they've got a in their tail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a series of large veins.</v>

476
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.160
<v Speaker 2>You just roll them over and they let you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know everything's.</v>

477
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is trained in that day.</v>

478
00:19:10.311 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 2>You're going to provide it voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

479
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:13.680
<v Speaker 2>and it takes a long time to train these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

480
00:19:13.681 --> 00:19:15.150
<v Speaker 2>but you train them to and you just pick </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

481
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:16.340
<v Speaker 2>You just literally grab this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>needle.</v>

482
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.930
<v Speaker 2>You put it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the vein,</v>

483
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.340
<v Speaker 2>and they don't get pissed at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get pissed.</v>

484
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:23.190
<v Speaker 2>If you miss and you keep trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

485
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>

486
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:31.270
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they let you take their blood if </v>

487
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.270
<v Speaker 2>they're healthy and responsive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

488
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.270
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're not,</v>

489
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.340
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that's going to get you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

490
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.550
<v Speaker 2>get them to the edge of the pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so you,</v>

491
00:19:34.551 --> 00:19:37.560
<v Speaker 2>you take their blood and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they find?</v>

492
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Send it to the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to look at cortisol levels,</v>

493
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:41.900
<v Speaker 2>how the stress is you want to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>white blood count,</v>

494
00:19:41.901 --> 00:19:43.170
<v Speaker 2>see if they're finding any infections.</v>

495
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

496
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.900
<v Speaker 2>there's always a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

497
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:50.901
<v Speaker 2>in her case there's always something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the animals are in fact on </v>

498
00:19:50.901 --> 00:19:50.901
<v Speaker 2>value and a lot of different sites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

499
00:19:50.901 --> 00:19:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Tons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

500
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:53.650
<v Speaker 2>That is like rampant use in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

501
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.210
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

502
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 2>in the aquariums.</v>

<v Speaker 2>value and in fact in the lawsuit as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

506
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 2>which is absolutely not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>

507
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.840
<v Speaker 2>is this used everywhere or is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>greenland?</v>

508
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Greenland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sea World's everywhere.</v>

509
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

510
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like dolphins,</v>

511
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.920
<v Speaker 2>dolphins around them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

512
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.050
<v Speaker 2>When I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was,</v>

513
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.780
<v Speaker 2>when I left marine land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the agreement again.</v>

514
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:19.650
<v Speaker 2>I left fairly amicably considering the </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

515
00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.090
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to play my cards right.</v>

516
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And murraylands owner called me back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically to help a dolphin.</v>

517
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.270
<v Speaker 2>And it was the theater.</v>

<v Speaker 2>A good one.</v>

521
00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Buzzfeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go with buzzfeed.</v>

531
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:04.381
<v Speaker 1>affidavit filed in order to Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 1>Superior Court of Justice in dispute </v>

532

<v Speaker 1>of a prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killer whale.</v>

534
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I cake a cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cake is if you watched blackfish,</v>

535
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.080
<v Speaker 1>you've got tillikum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that killed people.</v>

536
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.290
<v Speaker 1>That's telecom son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had his son.</v>

537
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had him.</v>

538
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:22.020
<v Speaker 1>He was in captivity in captivity in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pool by himself.</v>

539
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.220
<v Speaker 1>The raised and bred and born in </v>
<v Speaker 1>captivity it,</v>

540
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:30.690
<v Speaker 1>which is even more fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was turning aggressive and </v>

541
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 1>seaworld was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were having none of it.</v>

542
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.440
<v Speaker 1>They wanted that killer whale back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't blame him.</v>

543
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sued for millions because I'm </v>

544
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:37.620
<v Speaker 1>alleging that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

545
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.350
<v Speaker 1>that marine land is mistreating their </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

546
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.910
<v Speaker 1>sea world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sue's marine land because they're </v>

547
00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.530
<v Speaker 1>mistreating their not taking appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 1>care of the killer whale and actually </v>

548
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:46.530
<v Speaker 1>win the lawsuit.</v>

549
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:47.580
<v Speaker 1>They would not put any barriers around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pool.</v>

550
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.240
<v Speaker 1>We've got a date or green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a large pool.</v>

551
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Imagine this unimpeded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ability to touch a killer whale if you </v>

552
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.990
<v Speaker 1>want it to reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a safe idea.</v>

553
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:57.070
<v Speaker 1>This is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

554
00:21:57.071 --> 00:21:58.750
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're dealing with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>

555
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.430
<v Speaker 1>boisterous male Orca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So seaworld wanted barriers around it so</v>

556
00:22:03.431 --> 00:22:04.690
<v Speaker 1>that people can't get close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

557
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:06.880
<v Speaker 1>the owner Marineland you can't tell him </v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>

558
00:22:06.881 --> 00:22:08.860
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone tells them what to do.</v>

559
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:12.280
<v Speaker 1>So suddenly we're dealing with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this animal started to lunge at the</v>

560
00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:17.281
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is an animal that if it gets a </v>

561
00:22:17.281 --> 00:22:17.281
<v Speaker 1>hold of someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

562
00:22:17.281 --> 00:22:18.070
<v Speaker 1>There's going to toy with them for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

563
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.110
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna hear a lot of screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the screaming will end.</v>

564
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.530
<v Speaker 1>You're not getting anyone out of out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that killer whales math,</v>

565
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 1>forget it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what [inaudible] was dealing</v>

566
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:24.700
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

567
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

568
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.270
<v Speaker 1>They had enough bad press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even back then,</v>

569
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:33.700
<v Speaker 1>if I kick a kill someone or hurt someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything or dies in Murraylands care,</v>

570
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:38.730
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna look bad on c one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So see what it's like getting the fuck </v>

571
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:38.730
<v Speaker 1>out now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When tillikum killed people get killed,</v>

572
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:43.531
<v Speaker 1>how many people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One person is granted a three to four </v>

573
00:22:43.531 --> 00:22:44.180
<v Speaker 1>actually in Victoria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

574
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.070
<v Speaker 1>the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he went to a.</v>

575
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's absolutely hilarious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they kept training them and doing things</v>

576
00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:52.240
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big deal.</v>

577
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.320
<v Speaker 1>That was a pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about it.</v>

578
00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Speaker 1>It'd be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a killer whale.</v>

579
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Almost any animal lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were training,</v>

580
00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions and the lion killed someone.</v>

581
00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:00.730
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a wrap.</v>

582
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Unless that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not true.</v>

583
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.290
<v Speaker 1>One grizzly bear that was a train </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear for films.</v>

584
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:14.010
<v Speaker 1>It was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that movie something 40 some </v>

585
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:14.200
<v Speaker 1>football movie with a big bear.</v>

586
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

587
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.510
<v Speaker 1>the bear killed the guy's brother or </v>
<v Speaker 1>cousin.</v>

588
00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I was just standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible video.</v>

589
00:23:21.881 --> 00:23:23.200
<v Speaker 1>You could watch the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

590
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:28.500
<v Speaker 1>The guy just standing there and the bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>just decides to tear the guy's throat </v>

591
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:28.500
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just reaches up,</v>

592
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.920
<v Speaker 1>bites him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rips his throat open.</v>

593
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 1>The guy runs off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed his neck.</v>

594
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:35.560
<v Speaker 1>He's dead within minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joys of working with animals,</v>

595
00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:36.520
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are.</v>

596
00:23:36.521 --> 00:23:41.521
<v Speaker 1>They kept alive and they started </v>
<v Speaker 1>training him again and there's some </v>

597
00:23:41.521 --> 00:23:42.580
<v Speaker 1>really weird footage of the guard </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

598
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 1>The Berrigan was the one from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare movie.</v>

599
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.600
<v Speaker 2>But semi-pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

600
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Semi-Pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the dog or the dog.</v>

601
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Does the bear that bear fucking killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

602
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is smack in this bare ground.</v>

603
00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Look at will that bear eventually killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody just got tired of people.</v>

604
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.350
<v Speaker 2>It takes nothing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

605
00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.330
<v Speaker 2>so easy for him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

606
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Just decided to fuck them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now when telecom was doing all this,</v>

607
00:24:11.331 --> 00:24:12.950
<v Speaker 2>he was on valium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

608
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:15.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't say for sure that that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case in my suit anymore.</v>

609
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:17.840
<v Speaker 2>When did they start putting killer </v>
<v Speaker 2>whales on volume?</v>

610
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in,</v>

611
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.870
<v Speaker 2>in ocean oceanarium zoos or aquariums </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Shit,</v>

612
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.120
<v Speaker 2>volume is often used as an appetite </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulant,</v>

613
00:24:29.121 --> 00:24:32.210
<v Speaker 2>so when your animal is off off so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

614
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.360
<v Speaker 2>they don't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're not responding to buckets of </v>

615
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:37.360
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

616
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.181
<v Speaker 2>You having to drop the water to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to it because they're not </v>

617
00:24:40.181 --> 00:24:40.181
<v Speaker 2>interested in them or they're not your </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends anymore.</v>

618
00:24:40.181 --> 00:24:40.181
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have a bucket of food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about it.</v>

619
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.210
<v Speaker 2>And so to sort of off enough to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger that appetite,</v>

620
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.570
<v Speaker 2>you'll pump them with the value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them value,</v>

621
00:24:46.571 --> 00:24:48.630
<v Speaker 2>and if they don't want to eat stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>written the phone,</v>

622
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.950
<v Speaker 2>you'd get liquid volume you can inject </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

623
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Well if necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

624
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:54.110
<v Speaker 2>the injections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a process.</v>

625
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:57.440
<v Speaker 2>The things that I've seen and done that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were normal to me,</v>

626
00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.780
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who's working there is insane.</v>

627
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean we used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to drop,</v>

628
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:06.850
<v Speaker 2>we used to call this Beluga Rodeo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>emory inland marina is notorious for </v>

629
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.421
<v Speaker 2>having like we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say we a over 50 that puts their </v>

630
00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:14.381
<v Speaker 2>pushing 60 balugas at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why it's so important to </v>

631
00:25:14.381 --> 00:25:14.690
<v Speaker 2>start changing these fucking laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is absurd.</v>

632
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.720
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it creates a whole world of </v>

633
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:19.720
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

634
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially for these animals,</v>

635
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 2>a babies get killed by males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

636
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.200
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

637
00:25:22.201 --> 00:25:23.240
<v Speaker 2>it's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad.</v>

638
00:25:23.241 --> 00:25:25.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

639
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.900
<v Speaker 2>what we would do is we would drop the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water in one of the pool.</v>

640
00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have anywhere between 10 and 15</v>
<v Speaker 2>balugas flat on their stomach.</v>

641
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a great at the bottom and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't move.</v>

642
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.830
<v Speaker 2>They can't move well if they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move,</v>

643
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:38.510
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're flopping around.</v>

644
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.800
<v Speaker 2>But it means they're going to get fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

645
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like scratched up by the ground.</v>

646
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 2>So if you've got maybe a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

647
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:49.331
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've tried different things to try to </v>

648
00:25:49.331 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 2>mitigate how damaged up they got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one time,</v>

649
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get carved up.</v>

650
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:51.770
<v Speaker 2>We used to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's morbid,</v>

651
00:25:51.771 --> 00:25:54.200
<v Speaker 2>but we used to joke around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we called the Cesar water because it was</v>

652
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.590
<v Speaker 2>blood red by the time we were done </v>
<v Speaker 2>procedures.</v>

653
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

654
00:25:58.401 --> 00:26:03.401
<v Speaker 2>it would make you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the water was thick of blood and </v>

655
00:26:03.401 --> 00:26:07.811
<v Speaker 2>so one time there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a Beluga name peanut and she </v>

656
00:26:07.811 --> 00:26:10.670
<v Speaker 2>started to panic and what she did was </v>
<v Speaker 2>she repeatedly slander tail in a panic.</v>

657
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.190
<v Speaker 2>She started to bounce around like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking basketball.</v>

658
00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:14.510
<v Speaker 2>She was getting air three feet in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

659
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.940
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's probably a 3000 pound a whale,</v>

660
00:26:16.941 --> 00:26:18.830
<v Speaker 2>2000 pound whale or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not going to stop that.</v>

661
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:19.520
<v Speaker 2>We tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

662
00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:21.830
<v Speaker 2>we jumped on her chunks of her tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not joking.</v>

663
00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Chunks of her tail flying off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fly off.</v>

664
00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.350
<v Speaker 2>If anyone goes to marine land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ask about peanut,</v>

665
00:26:27.351 --> 00:26:29.780
<v Speaker 2>go take a look at her at her tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing left of it.</v>

666
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:32.210
<v Speaker 2>She's got like a nub that's sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Jag it on the bottom.</v>

667
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:33.440
<v Speaker 2>She was fucked up after that.</v>

668
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of meds,</v>

669
00:26:34.581 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 2>lots of recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was foul man.</v>

670
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 2>So is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Benzodiazepine,</v>

671
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:43.100
<v Speaker 2>is this a recent thing that they started</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing to?</v>

672
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say so.</v>

673
00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't vouch for anytime before 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started,</v>

674
00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:52.521
<v Speaker 2>but for sure once we were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean when you go to seaworld and </v>

675
00:26:52.521 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 2>you see those killer whales and dolphins</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing shows,</v>

676
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:55.770
<v Speaker 2>there just pilled up out of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking minds.</v>

677
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:57.650
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hardly assemble.</v>

678
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.030
<v Speaker 2>It's merely assemblance of their wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterparts.</v>

679
00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:02.700
<v Speaker 2>You're not going there and seeing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic animal in the more you're seeing</v>

680
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 2>a depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugged,</v>

681
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 2>confused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably frustrated animal and I mean </v>

682
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what those,</v>

683
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.990
<v Speaker 2>what those animals go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult for people to give a shit</v>

684
00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:14.580
<v Speaker 2>about anything if it doesn't affect them</v>
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>

685
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.030
<v Speaker 2>If you see an animal going through this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

686
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 2>you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start to appreciate it.</v>

687
00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel weird even calling them </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

688
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm like killer whales and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins in particular,</v>

689
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:30.800
<v Speaker 2>so fucking intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

690
00:27:30.801 --> 00:27:35.801
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to call them animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously humans are animals as </v>

691
00:27:35.801 --> 00:27:37.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are their own thing.</v>

692
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean those marine mammals are their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own thing.</v>

693
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 2>They have their own world and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated it.</v>

694
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in their world,</v>

695
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:46.860
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking amazing world.</v>

696
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.400
<v Speaker 2>This they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're one of the only animals that we </v>

697
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.581
<v Speaker 2>know of that has a really complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>language and we can't even decipher it.</v>

698
00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.520
<v Speaker 2>And then just last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a marine land and Francis is talking </v>

699
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.070
<v Speaker 2>about Wiki is a killer whale that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>picked up a.</v>

700
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 2>She mimics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she mimics human voice.</v>

701
00:28:04.471 --> 00:28:05.790
<v Speaker 2>So they've got her saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hello,</v>

702
00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:06.720
<v Speaker 2>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these different things.</v>

703
00:28:06.721 --> 00:28:08.730
<v Speaker 2>And it sort of sounds like she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>mimicking.</v>

704
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:10.470
<v Speaker 2>What if she started saying a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>racial shit,</v>

705
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:11.910
<v Speaker 2>racial slurs.</v>

706
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Well then let's get her candidate a band</v>
<v Speaker 2>capture of dolphins today.</v>

707
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

708
00:28:18.241 --> 00:28:23.241
<v Speaker 2>But the capture is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already illegal in the United </v>

709
00:28:23.241 --> 00:28:23.241
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

710
00:28:23.241 --> 00:28:23.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

711
00:28:23.241 --> 00:28:24.570
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go through the,</v>

712
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:28.120
<v Speaker 2>you can get them from Canada and Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets them from being captured under that</v>

713
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:29.730
<v Speaker 2>can get them from anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

714
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.760
<v Speaker 2>So basically the department of fisheries</v>
<v Speaker 2>and oceans very strategically talked </v>

715
00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:37.110
<v Speaker 2>about this sweeping overhaul of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

716
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.710
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever this their thing,</v>

717
00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:42.870
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the words alluding me.</v>

718
00:28:42.871 --> 00:28:44.820
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did this,</v>

719
00:28:44.821 --> 00:28:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I believe anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of mitigate sort of.</v>

720
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Justin Trudeau went off about the kinder</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morgan pipeline sort of.</v>

721
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.580
<v Speaker 2>He ran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>

722
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:56.740
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big pipeline that they're going </v>

723
00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:56.780
<v Speaker 2>to run this oil in BC and there's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of protests,</v>

724
00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.650
<v Speaker 2>what he ran on the campaign that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't do this,</v>

725
00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:03.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin Trudeau talks about saving the </v>

726
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:03.730
<v Speaker 2>world level time and cleaning up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

727
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:03.900
<v Speaker 2>So they've made this announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a good,</v>

728
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.700
<v Speaker 2>that's a good piece of legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

729
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.880
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't bend the breeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't address a lot of the things </v>

730
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:10.880
<v Speaker 2>that we're actually addressing with Bill</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

731
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 2>which is the one that I spoke to you two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

732
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:14.400
<v Speaker 2>that marine land has managed to get this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

733
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.550
<v Speaker 2>this senator to keep playing again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acting the fool,</v>

734
00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:19.890
<v Speaker 2>doing all these creative ways to kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>this bill.</v>

735
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:20.610
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

736
00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:21.550
<v Speaker 2>that's where we're at now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

737
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.720
<v Speaker 2>I expect sometime next week to get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>announcement that this bill should have </v>

738
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:26.730
<v Speaker 2>been passed and brought into the house a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time ago.</v>

739
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.110
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

740
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 2>not the case still still stalled at </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

741
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:32.580
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all lobbying illegal lobbying,</v>

742
00:29:32.581 --> 00:29:37.581
<v Speaker 2>which may or may not turn into some </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems for Senator Don Plett.</v>

743
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for while some of the,</v>

744
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>some</v>

745
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.980
<v Speaker 1>of the parks in the United States would </v>
<v Speaker 1>get them from some of the parks in </v>

746
00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.281
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would get them from Russians and </v>

747
00:29:50.281 --> 00:29:50.281
<v Speaker 1>Chinese who would capture them in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild.</v>

748
00:29:50.281 --> 00:29:50.281
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

749
00:29:50.281 --> 00:29:55.021
<v Speaker 1>so the parks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States would say that they </v>

750
00:29:55.021 --> 00:29:57.571
<v Speaker 1>don't capture whales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they would do is marina would </v>

751
00:29:57.571 --> 00:29:57.880
<v Speaker 1>capture a boatload of wild ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once,</v>

752
00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:58.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

753
00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:01.860
<v Speaker 1>they would do it personally while they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would pay some Russians to,</v>

754
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 1>to capture the Russians that they always</v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

755
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

756
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to cheat at the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're stealing whales.</v>

757
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.440
<v Speaker 1>So they bring the whales in wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those why those,</v>

758
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.210
<v Speaker 1>those whales have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

759
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:16.850
<v Speaker 1>a calf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that calf is now deemed a,</v>

760
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.660
<v Speaker 1>a captive born and now it can be shipped</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the states.</v>

761
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:24.661
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what marina was doing was just </v>

762
00:30:24.661 --> 00:30:24.661
<v Speaker 1>breeding like crazy and then sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to seaworld.</v>

763
00:30:24.661 --> 00:30:26.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we got the killer whale </v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>

764
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 1>How we got Kaikos big trade with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Balugas.</v>

765
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:30.480
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's,</v>

766
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:32.350
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to put an end to because </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these loopholes,</v>

767
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marina really capitalized on this,</v>

768
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:36.250
<v Speaker 1>but they want a long time lobbying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government for years.</v>

769
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've been around for 50 plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

770
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 1>They've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done all the right moves.</v>

771
00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 1>A businessman would do if he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep an a thriving business without too </v>

772
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.350
<v Speaker 1>many hands sort of keeping him from </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything.</v>

773
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just so disturbing that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to just accept this because we </v>

774
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.530
<v Speaker 1>don't know what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

775
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.530
<v Speaker 1>we know that they have a really complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

776
00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:01.650
<v Speaker 1>We can't decipher it though because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so alien in terms of like the sounds </v>

777
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:02.830
<v Speaker 1>that they make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you put into a box,</v>

778
00:31:02.831 --> 00:31:07.831
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like any other animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you in dolphins and killer whales </v>

779
00:31:07.831 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 1>and Wales in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

780
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:13.471
<v Speaker 1>they make sounds with a range of </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity that's just unrivaled in </v>

781
00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:14.260
<v Speaker 1>nature outside of humans.</v>

782
00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 1>And their auditory system is so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you put them in a,</v>

783
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.740
<v Speaker 1>we put them in a concrete pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine what I mean.</v>

784
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I put my ears under the water and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>loud.</v>

785
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.440
<v Speaker 1>The filters or goal and you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>different sounds.</v>

786
00:31:23.441 --> 00:31:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean water being pushed in from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>pipe and the screaming,</v>

787
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:28.870
<v Speaker 1>screaming louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louder,</v>

788
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:29.790
<v Speaker 1>louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pop gone.</v>

789
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800
<v Speaker 1>The audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

790
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

791
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.290
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

792
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I look at them almost like they're kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

793
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're definitely not human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're are kind of people.</v>

794
00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.590
<v Speaker 1>They're like a water people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird if you,</v>

795
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:49.660
<v Speaker 1>if you put yourself into a mindset of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at an animal and and try to </v>

796
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:49.920
<v Speaker 1>change your perception of them a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit rather than,</v>

797
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:52.810
<v Speaker 1>than sort of disassociating and you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start,</v>

798
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.870
<v Speaker 1>you can actually see that they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're people,</v>

799
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

800
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.770
<v Speaker 1>that's just a different meat suit.</v>

801
00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you deal with killer whales </v>

802
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 1>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they evolved in a different environment,</v>

803
00:32:03.341 --> 00:32:05.920
<v Speaker 1>but they evolved to be incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

804
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.250
<v Speaker 1>highly dynamic populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

805
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 1>they live in these very intimate groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stay together for life.</v>

806
00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:18.040
<v Speaker 1>A male killer whale will never leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mother's side over its lifetime.</v>

807
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:21.040
<v Speaker 1>It'll stay within about a body's length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its entire life.</v>

808
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Unless the positives beating on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll just stay on the outside of </v>

809
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.831
<v Speaker 1>the pod for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least they have that luxury of </v>

810
00:32:28.831 --> 00:32:28.831
<v Speaker 1>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in captivity,</v>

811
00:32:28.831 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 1>males get the shit kicked out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>big puppy dogs.</v>

812
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Big Male orchids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>

813
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

814
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:34.470
<v Speaker 1>They're murderous killing people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually big puppy dogs.</v>

815
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.330
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt so bad for candy.</v>

816
00:32:37.331 --> 00:32:38.860
<v Speaker 1>We had this big male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>

817
00:32:38.861 --> 00:32:41.630
<v Speaker 1>big bull male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just.</v>

818
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.290
<v Speaker 1>He was rocked his existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having been pulled from his mother,</v>

819
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.960
<v Speaker 1>and this is really largely explains why </v>
<v Speaker 1>telecom went off.</v>

820
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.480
<v Speaker 1>You ruined their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's over.</v>

821
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean their whole zone diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason they live member to their </v>

822
00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.930
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fuck man.</v>

823
00:32:56.931 --> 00:32:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do we allow this?</v>

824
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.740
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost a form of slavery.</v>

825
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:08.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to diminish the horrors of </v>

826
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.781
<v Speaker 1>human slavery because in human slavery </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least there's no question whatsoever </v>

827
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 1>that that's a human and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

828
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's.</v>

829
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:18.680
<v Speaker 1>It's as awful as it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God damn put the ignorance aside.</v>

830
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 1>The slavery of killer whales is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really close.</v>

831
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:27.430
<v Speaker 1>It's really close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way to get them to work </v>

832
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:28.370
<v Speaker 1>effectively and efficiently is to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>them hungry.</v>

833
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug them and keep them hungry.</v>

834
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.530
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

835
00:33:33.531 --> 00:33:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Now is it still legal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

836
00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:36.560
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't seaworld,</v>

837
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:42.100
<v Speaker 1>aren't they expanding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they just make a bigger a pool </v>

838
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.420
<v Speaker 1>for the killer whales?</v>

839
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 1>We gave them a bigger k.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

840
00:33:46.011 --> 00:33:51.011
<v Speaker 1>So what they've done is they've tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>repackage the show as we're not doing </v>

841
00:33:51.011 --> 00:33:51.011
<v Speaker 1>the big dynamic show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they really still are.</v>

842
00:33:51.011 --> 00:33:52.370
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just showing natural behaviors,</v>

843
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.940
<v Speaker 1>which is bitch want natural behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them go fuck up a whale.</v>

844
00:33:55.941 --> 00:33:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put fuck.</v>

845
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.880
<v Speaker 1>They put like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a backdrop of a couple trees.</v>

846
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a new show.</v>

847
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Hey seaworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one other crazy shit going on.</v>

848
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

849
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.100
<v Speaker 1>in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seaworld now.</v>

850
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.410
<v Speaker 1>See where promised to stop banning a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>

851
00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.090
<v Speaker 1>They promised to stop breeding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>killer whales,</v>

852
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.720
<v Speaker 1>but these fucking promises don't do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe for a moment that they're like </v>

853
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.750
<v Speaker 1>some type of responsible corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens.</v>

854
00:34:17.751 --> 00:34:18.530
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on to this thing.</v>

855
00:34:18.531 --> 00:34:19.940
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're an entity.</v>

856
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.250
<v Speaker 1>The business entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to make money and so what</v>

857
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:24.680
<v Speaker 1>California did was they went out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned,</v>

858
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.040
<v Speaker 1>so in California you can't breed orkos.</v>

859
00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I import export issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>

860
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.400
<v Speaker 1>but in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so again,</v>

861
00:34:31.401 --> 00:34:32.450
<v Speaker 1>see real mix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the promise.</v>

862
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.150
<v Speaker 1>They had an Orca protection act that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were looking to do exactly.</v>

863
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.170
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to put it.</v>

864
00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:41.220
<v Speaker 1>They were going to make it concrete </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed the law that way that we see </v>

865
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.501
<v Speaker 1>worldcat just backpedal on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the road which everyone suspects </v>

866
00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:45.110
<v Speaker 1>they will see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's lobbying like fucking crazy</v>

867
00:34:45.111 --> 00:34:48.920
<v Speaker 1>and just just last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully defeated the bill again.</v>

868
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:53.980
<v Speaker 1>They're putting a lot of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to defeat a bill though they </v>

869
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.581
<v Speaker 1>successfully defeated multiple times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including last week that allows them or </v>

870
00:34:57.581 --> 00:35:02.220
<v Speaker 1>the bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bill would keep them from breeding </v>

871
00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.181
<v Speaker 1>these animals in captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fighting against that successfully </v>

872
00:35:04.181 --> 00:35:04.181
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

873
00:35:04.181 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they're pretending in California,</v>

874
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:08.480
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to breed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

875
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:09.230
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In California,</v>

876
00:35:09.231 --> 00:35:11.720
<v Speaker 1>they actually passed the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state of Florida.</v>

877
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:15.200
<v Speaker 1>It was defeated repeatedly and now fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>last time.</v>

878
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:20.410
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to breed animals in </v>

879
00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:20.410
<v Speaker 1>captivity and if they do breed them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>

880
00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:22.190
<v Speaker 1>they'll be able to ship them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>California to China,</v>

881
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:27.430
<v Speaker 1>so that's where the demand is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact seaworld was just bought by </v>

882
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:28.620
<v Speaker 1>a large Chinese corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just named.</v>

883
00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 1>They just named one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys to the seaworld board.</v>

884
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And so what people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's safe to assume that this is </v>

885
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 1>exactly what's happening is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is</v>

886
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.650
<v Speaker 2>planning their exit strategy and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to start sending their,</v>

887
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.240
<v Speaker 2>their orchestra to China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Geez.</v>

888
00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a booming industry right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

889
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.780
<v Speaker 2>kilowatt captivity is like if you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in there and it's all coming out of </v>

890
00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

891
00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

892
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.240
<v Speaker 2>And so they're still capturing them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wild.</v>

893
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in China it's,</v>

894
00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a burgeoning,</v>

895
00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:03.020
<v Speaker 2>a booming industry man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 four ocean theme parks in China right</v>

896
00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus is building a black crazy.</v>

897
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 2>How many of them are in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States?</v>

898
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.910
<v Speaker 2>How many aquariums?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

899
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

900
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 2>I can't say for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually surprised to read.</v>

901
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:17.880
<v Speaker 2>There's like 300 something dolphins in </v>
<v Speaker 2>captivity in the states.</v>

902
00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I had an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the number I saw.</v>

903
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize it was that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea that there was that many </v>

904
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.470
<v Speaker 2>in captivity in the states.</v>

905
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:27.160
<v Speaker 2>It just seems to be such an archaic </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that.</v>

906
00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:32.220
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine that the United States </v>

907
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:32.220
<v Speaker 2>wants to keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that seaworld is trying to keep</v>

908
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:37.101
<v Speaker 2>doing that in Florida and if they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully lobbied to allow them to </v>

909
00:36:37.101 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 2>keep breeding these animals in </v>
<v Speaker 2>captivity,</v>

910
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.340
<v Speaker 2>but you can't once you have them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>captivity for a long time,</v>

911
00:36:41.341 --> 00:36:44.130
<v Speaker 2>safe seaworld wanted to release them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't really release them.</v>

912
00:36:44.131 --> 00:36:46.500
<v Speaker 2>There's nowhere to release them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's being worked on now.</v>

913
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:49.220
<v Speaker 2>There's a project called the whale </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctuary project and I,</v>

914
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I suspect there'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

915
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:55.460
<v Speaker 2>a fairly large announcement soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe there'll be looking at a </v>

916
00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.401
<v Speaker 2>location in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Canada and they're going to build </v>

917
00:36:58.401 --> 00:36:58.401
<v Speaker 2>this thing though there will be a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>

918
00:36:58.401 --> 00:37:00.240
<v Speaker 2>which is a great place to do it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do that.</v>

919
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go coastal the course.</v>

920
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:02.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be in the ocean,</v>

921
00:37:02.851 --> 00:37:04.050
<v Speaker 2>you got a pen off an area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to.</v>

922
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of things to consider.</v>

923
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:07.170
<v Speaker 2>You got to make sure there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>water changes,</v>

924
00:37:07.171 --> 00:37:12.171
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of different things because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't keep the animal and something </v>

925
00:37:12.171 --> 00:37:12.171
<v Speaker 2>that's gonna stagnate and either the </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>

926
00:37:12.171 --> 00:37:16.490
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to be some sort of a cage </v>
<v Speaker 2>and assume a fence of sorts around that.</v>

927
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Maybe like a fjord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be a fjord if it's in Canada,</v>

928
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:23.901
<v Speaker 2>but like just imagine jump it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagined that they'll make certain </v>

929
00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:26.310
<v Speaker 2>that that's not going to be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it a while they can.</v>

930
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:28.440
<v Speaker 2>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen dolphins jump out of the pool.</v>

931
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.780
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

932
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got rushed in one morning to a called </v>

933
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.111
<v Speaker 2>them because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a dolphin jumped out of the </v>

934
00:37:38.111 --> 00:37:38.111
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit that,</v>

935
00:37:38.111 --> 00:37:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a wake up call when you get there</v>

936
00:37:39.061 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 2>and you see this thing flopping around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

937
00:37:40.441 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ and I didn't do well.</v>

938
00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.010
<v Speaker 2>You get the sling together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First.</v>

939
00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Authors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

940
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:49.460
<v Speaker 2>we have these different slings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you know to move these </v>

941
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:49.460
<v Speaker 2>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>

942
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I was alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a dolphin way.</v>

943
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 500 pounds,</v>

944
00:37:50.551 --> 00:37:51.800
<v Speaker 2>600 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case she was,</v>

945
00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:56.850
<v Speaker 2>she was a decent size female so I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>and grabbed the kid out in the ticket </v>

946
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:56.850
<v Speaker 2>booth or some shit cause it was too </v>
<v Speaker 2>early in the morning.</v>

947
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.310
<v Speaker 2>I had no staff there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

948
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:58.950
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

949
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:00.240
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got two guys.</v>

950
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:05.241
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gotta get this dolphin and these </v>

951
00:38:05.241 --> 00:38:05.241
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you've never done that before,</v>

952
00:38:05.241 --> 00:38:08.180
<v Speaker 2>your jaws on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking had these two steel poles all </v>

953
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.240
<v Speaker 2>my shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dolphin in the sling,</v>

954
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.530
<v Speaker 2>lifting her up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to you,</v>

955
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:12.150
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My back went backwards like this.</v>

956
00:38:12.151 --> 00:38:13.530
<v Speaker 2>It was the heaviest thing I'd ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>carried,</v>

957
00:38:13.531 --> 00:38:14.460
<v Speaker 2>but we got her back in.</v>

958
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.620
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

959
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:17.940
<v Speaker 2>jumped out of the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

960
00:38:17.941 --> 00:38:19.830
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a time in the summer,</v>

961
00:38:19.831 --> 00:38:22.500
<v Speaker 2>I remember where one of our dolphins was</v>
<v Speaker 2>teetering on the edge.</v>

962
00:38:22.501 --> 00:38:23.270
<v Speaker 2>What you would do is she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

963
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.660
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always spy hop and like this,</v>

964
00:38:24.661 --> 00:38:29.661
<v Speaker 2>looking over the edge of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain that to people that are just </v>

965
00:38:29.661 --> 00:38:29.661
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just listening.</v>

966
00:38:29.661 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 2>So imagine there's like a short wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you know,</v>

967
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:32.730
<v Speaker 2>they can look over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of spy hop in there,</v>

968
00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:33.960
<v Speaker 2>spying up to look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

969
00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:39.170
<v Speaker 2>One of our dolphins learned that she can</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually jump up on the ledge and </v>

970
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.170
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now she was on that.</v>

971
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:41.500
<v Speaker 2>That's like an eight foot drop to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>concrete on the other side of the pool.</v>

972
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 2>She's up there posing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing the crowd.</v>

973
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm backstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear the crowd going crazy.</v>

974
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

975
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll have fun doing this.</v>

976
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the dolphin that jumped up.</v>

977
00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:52.360
<v Speaker 2>So what we did was I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to take her out of this pool.</v>

978
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:57.450
<v Speaker 2>We took her out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put her in the back pool where no one </v>

979
00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:57.450
<v Speaker 2>would see her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

980
00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:57.450
<v Speaker 2>and that's the next day she actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped.</v>

981
00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:58.360
<v Speaker 2>So she'd be dead today if we hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved her.</v>

982
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Then of course all Marineland did was </v>
<v Speaker 2>put up more,</v>

983
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more obstruction,</v>

984
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:07.681
<v Speaker 2>things to keep keep me in the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now when you find her outside of the </v>

985
00:39:07.681 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 2>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long had she been outside for?</v>

986
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.430
<v Speaker 2>She was still wet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't so bad,</v>

987
00:39:09.431 --> 00:39:12.300
<v Speaker 2>but one a one dolphin was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We found her that she,</v>

988
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.500
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got stuck on the stage overnight and</v>

989
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:18.160
<v Speaker 2>when we got there her skin had become so</v>
<v Speaker 2>dry that it was,</v>

990
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:19.600
<v Speaker 2>it was starting to crack.</v>

991
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:24.600
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She actually has this permanent scar </v>

992
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:24.990
<v Speaker 2>from her having tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

993
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.260
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a chunk come out.</v>

994
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what she was probably </v>

995
00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.850
<v Speaker 2>thrashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking to her when you find or </v>

996
00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:32.850
<v Speaker 2>do you try to comfort her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

997
00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:32.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

998
00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:34.620
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hugging her and everything else.</v>

999
00:39:34.621 --> 00:39:39.621
<v Speaker 2>Let's say she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did she calm down when she realizes </v>

1000
00:39:39.621 --> 00:39:42.150
<v Speaker 2>people were trying to help her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like are they aware of what's going on </v>

1001
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.640
<v Speaker 2>or she in a pan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always fight.</v>

1002
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.820
<v Speaker 2>They always fight if they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this particular dolphin was a </v>

1003
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:47.820
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time we ever tried to put her in a</v>

1004
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:47.820
<v Speaker 2>sling and move on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1005
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:52.351
<v Speaker 2>one time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that I could go back in memories </v>

1006
00:39:52.351 --> 00:39:55.951
<v Speaker 2>and I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can remember my thoughts during these </v>

1007
00:39:55.951 --> 00:39:55.951
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1008
00:39:55.951 --> 00:39:57.220
<v Speaker 2>we had her in a sling hovering over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pool and the way the sling is just,</v>

1009
00:39:57.221 --> 00:39:59.440
<v Speaker 2>you've got two holes in the ceiling </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the pecs go in,</v>

1010
00:39:59.680 --> 00:39:59.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1011
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:02.860
<v Speaker 2>The pectoral fins and then one where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>genital split is.</v>

1012
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:05.040
<v Speaker 2>So if they shit it doesn't wind up stuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1013
00:40:05.041 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 2>in the sling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1014
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got a crane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a top.</v>

1015
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.360
<v Speaker 2>So now you've got this thing lifted over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pool.</v>

1016
00:40:09.361 --> 00:40:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's fighting like crazy and we can see</v>

1017
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 2>that there's a tear in the sling as </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's fighting,</v>

1018
00:40:14.561 --> 00:40:15.100
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

1019
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:17.280
<v Speaker 2>We get her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crane just gets rid of the pool,</v>

1020
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.940
<v Speaker 2>the sling rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's plunked into the pool.</v>

1021
00:40:18.941 --> 00:40:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've,</v>

1022
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:23.200
<v Speaker 2>we've slimmed out like 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>

1023
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.920
<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds killer whales over like 30,</v>

1024
00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:29.480
<v Speaker 2>40 feet in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine one of those drops.</v>

1025
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was sort of a wakeup call.</v>

1026
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Archaic Procedures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1028
00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:36.820
<v Speaker 2>moving these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

1029
00:40:36.821 --> 00:40:41.821
<v Speaker 2>the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially at a place like marine land </v>

1030
00:40:41.821 --> 00:40:44.011
<v Speaker 2>marina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you step through the doors and </v>

1031
00:40:44.011 --> 00:40:44.011
<v Speaker 2>hopefully you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you do,</v>

1032
00:40:44.011 --> 00:40:44.011
<v Speaker 2>it's like you've gone back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>

1033
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Has any of this hurt their business?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Attendance is a bismal over there.</v>

1034
00:40:50.171 --> 00:40:51.910
<v Speaker 2>They're crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live right.</v>

1035
00:40:51.911 --> 00:40:56.911
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched the sunset over marine land </v>

1036
00:40:56.911 --> 00:40:56.911
<v Speaker 2>from my front yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful site.</v>

1037
00:40:56.911 --> 00:41:00.540
<v Speaker 2>I drive by of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just about every day that their </v>

1038
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.630
<v Speaker 2>attendance is rocked and Nag or falls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were.</v>

1039
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Which is where murray lender is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is booming.</v>

1040
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:10.380
<v Speaker 2>The tourism is through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can it's shoulder to shoulder over </v>

1041
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:10.380
<v Speaker 2>there and greenland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seeing none of it.</v>

1042
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.640
<v Speaker 2>And you think it's because people know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the conditions.</v>

1043
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1044
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.560
<v Speaker 2>I've got a lot of support in the local </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

1045
00:41:14.561 --> 00:41:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Like people know exactly what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1046
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.220
<v Speaker 2>A tourist is a little more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

1047
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Niagara Falls welcomes millions of them,</v>

1048
00:41:20.141 --> 00:41:21.490
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to get a fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1049
00:41:21.491 --> 00:41:26.491
<v Speaker 2>but it is a fraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marineland is not benefiting from the </v>

1050
00:41:26.491 --> 00:41:26.491
<v Speaker 2>booming tourism there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're on their way out.</v>

1051
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.720
<v Speaker 2>They're on a clock for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

1052
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I'd be shocked to hear them opening in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2019 if I'm not going to make that </v>

1053
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.720
<v Speaker 2>prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would be shocked if it's that bad.</v>

1054
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.960
<v Speaker 2>But to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no investors that Marineland </v>

1055
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:40.960
<v Speaker 2>it's one soul controlling mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>owner who started with nothing.</v>

1056
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.440
<v Speaker 2>I started with 2000 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>built this thing.</v>

1057
00:41:42.441 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 2>He is indebted to nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1058
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's cash Richard Course and he's got a </v>

1059
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 2>lot of fucking money and not a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

1060
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.990
<v Speaker 2>So he's out to fuck shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be surprised to know a lot of</v>

1061
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:53.180
<v Speaker 2>time in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean he's like 84 years old now?</v>

1062
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1063
00:41:54.331 --> 00:41:55.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1064
00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be surprised to think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's rationalized in his mind to just </v>

1065
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 2>fucking sewer this thing like destroy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy all our lives.</v>

1066
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:07.100
<v Speaker 2>We're having spoken out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just tank the park in the process.</v>

1067
00:42:07.101 --> 00:42:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1068
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very defined.</v>

1069
00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:10.040
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

1070
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.220
<v Speaker 2>he's a very paranoid and defiant men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1071
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at 84 years old,</v>

1072
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.430
<v Speaker 2>what else does he have left to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplish?</v>

1073
00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I guess so you were saying they had 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>Beluga whales,</v>

1074
00:42:19.051 --> 00:42:20.540
<v Speaker 2>the plus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even 60 at this point.</v>

1075
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Beluga whales are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.140
<v Speaker 2>What is a big one way?</v>

1077
00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we ever actually weighed our big </v>

1078
00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:31.530
<v Speaker 2>metal gas at 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>

1079
00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 2>maybe five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got 50 of those 50 of them.</v>

1080
00:42:34.191 --> 00:42:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1081
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Try Catching one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1082
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:39.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to get tasked with,</v>

1083
00:42:39.021 --> 00:42:40.700
<v Speaker 2>here's your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's your scuba gear.</v>

1084
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A net the size of a football field.</v>

1085
00:42:42.921 --> 00:42:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catch that believable.</v>

1086
00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and my buddies would be like,</v>

1087
00:42:46.161 --> 00:42:47.510
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

1088
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be.</v>

1089
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.500
<v Speaker 2>He'd be it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really would be amazing to be able to</v>

1090
00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:56.620
<v Speaker 2>capture the things we've done on video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you recognize the difference in </v>

1091
00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 2>intelligence between killing whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins,</v>

1092
00:42:57.501 --> 00:42:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Beluga whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins,</v>

1093
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:04.270
<v Speaker 2>dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and killer whales are remarkably </v>

1094
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.270
<v Speaker 2>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just cunning.</v>

1095
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:07.631
<v Speaker 2>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You turn your back and they're </v>

1096
00:43:07.631 --> 00:43:07.631
<v Speaker 2>pickpocketing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are just.</v>

1097
00:43:07.631 --> 00:43:08.420
<v Speaker 2>And they're brats and I love brats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they just are bratty animal.</v>

1098
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.620
<v Speaker 2>They're having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're having,</v>

1099
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:14.650
<v Speaker 2>while they're fucking with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would like to make things </v>

1100
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:14.650
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they know,</v>

1101
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:15.170
<v Speaker 2>if they know how to frustrate you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to exercise that.</v>

1102
00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:20.171
<v Speaker 2>So it's always a mental game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're dealing with </v>

1103
00:43:20.171 --> 00:43:20.171
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Treating with that was a Beluga.</v>

1104
00:43:20.171 --> 00:43:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Whales are really timid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

1105
00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:26.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call him the canaries of the sea </v>

1106
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.641
<v Speaker 2>because it kind of skittish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if that's a reflection </v>

1107
00:43:27.641 --> 00:43:28.660
<v Speaker 2>of their intelligence necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would call them like maybe a,</v>

1108
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.850
<v Speaker 2>maybe a hint more dumb dumb than then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next one.</v>

1109
00:43:31.851 --> 00:43:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1110
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:34.940
<v Speaker 2>they're more scared shitless of either </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1111
00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't really want it.</v>

1112
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:38.610
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not as smart as dolphins are.</v>

1113
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's wrong me in some way,</v>

1114
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.460
<v Speaker 2>some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intelligent,</v>

1115
00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sort of sitting ducks out there.</v>

1116
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Blue Goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just mean like in the,</v>

1117
00:43:48.021 --> 00:43:48.650
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1118
00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:50.240
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the whale world,</v>

1119
00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.630
<v Speaker 2>the whales respond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they respond to verbal commands.</v>

1120
00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the case of pinnipeds absolutely.</v>

1121
00:43:58.341 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 2>So seals and walruses a clc lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they re,</v>

1122
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:07.010
<v Speaker 2>they respond to verbal a whales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1123
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't say for sure in my experience</v>

1124
00:44:11.061 --> 00:44:12.440
<v Speaker 2>that that was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1125
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:17.530
<v Speaker 2>in the case of just that announcement </v>
<v Speaker 2>last week of that animal mimicking the </v>

1126
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:18.200
<v Speaker 2>human sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means she hears him.</v>

1127
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.270
<v Speaker 2>So if you can hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the animal can hear you,</v>

1128
00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:24.740
<v Speaker 2>you can definitely create a queue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts to trigger behavior.</v>

1129
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's possible that they could know </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of our language.</v>

1130
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that they could recognize </v>
<v Speaker 2>commands.</v>

1131
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1133
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:36.750
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that they have dialects,</v>

1134
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:41.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know anything that they're </v>

1135
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.870
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1136
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.870
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1137
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:42.920
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's interesting is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1138
00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I sort of beat myself up wondering if in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact they're using a language that is to</v>

1139
00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:54.231
<v Speaker 1>be interpreted as words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences versus sounds that mean </v>

1140
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.020
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe that's what you're saying,</v>

1141
00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 1>but I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that's necessarily </v>

1142
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 1>decipherable you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1143
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you know what a dog's pissed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they grow.</v>

1144
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 1>A girl is different than a bark barks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barks out necessarily words.</v>

1145
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:08.700
<v Speaker 1>And if they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're fuck you,</v>

1146
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:13.701
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was listening to this thing about </v>

1147
00:45:13.701 --> 00:45:13.701
<v Speaker 1>monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1148
00:45:13.701 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Steven pinker's book </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were talking about,</v>

1149
00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the audio book.</v>

1150
00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:22.521
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about how monkeys have</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated the sound that they make </v>

1151
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.920
<v Speaker 1>if there is a tiger versus a sound they </v>
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>

1152
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.920
<v Speaker 1>If there's an eagle anytime I'm walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and I hear a squirrel in a tree </v>

1153
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.331
<v Speaker 1>making a certain sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a cat in a vicinity </v>

1154
00:45:35.331 --> 00:45:35.331
<v Speaker 1>that's probably one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a language,</v>

1155
00:45:35.331 --> 00:45:37.830
<v Speaker 1>like a very crude language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what they've done is taken the sound</v>

1156
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.350
<v Speaker 1>of an eagle and they play it near </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys.</v>

1157
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.790
<v Speaker 1>The monkeys look up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1158
00:45:41.791 --> 00:45:46.791
<v Speaker 1>and they play the sound of a monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to alert the fact that there's a </v>

1159
00:45:46.791 --> 00:45:49.320
<v Speaker 1>tiger in the area and the monkeys run up</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees and start looking down.</v>

1160
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because like </v>

1161
00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.570
<v Speaker 1>they have a few sounds that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeat and they know for a fact that </v>

1162
00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:57.180
<v Speaker 1>these monkeys know what they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1163
00:45:57.181 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 1>And monkeys even played jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a language with each other.</v>

1164
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.880
<v Speaker 1>They play jokes on each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if one monkey wanted a banana,</v>

1165
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 1>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man is a fucking eagle here,</v>

1166
00:46:05.881 --> 00:46:09.510
<v Speaker 1>and the monkey would run up the tree and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would get the banana like they would.</v>

1167
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.940
<v Speaker 1>They lie to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pretty fascinating.</v>

1168
00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.100
<v Speaker 1>It makes doing fucked up things to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much worse,</v>

1169
00:46:14.101 --> 00:46:18.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean monkeys a mean?</v>

1170
00:46:18.391 --> 00:46:23.391
<v Speaker 1>We know that they're intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they got a little tiny little tiny </v>

1171
00:46:23.391 --> 00:46:26.031
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little tiny has had little tiny brain </v>

1172
00:46:26.031 --> 00:46:26.031
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all I need orcas,</v>

1173
00:46:26.031 --> 00:46:27.750
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those giant.</v>

1174
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.520
<v Speaker 1>These are huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous brains.</v>

1175
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brains are dolphin.</v>

1176
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Brains are way bigger than ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to hear a fucked up story?</v>

1177
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I had to dig up a dead killer whale to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract a portion of its brain that we'd</v>

1178
00:46:37.701 --> 00:46:40.680
<v Speaker 1>missed during a necropsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to dig it up.</v>

1179
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was ground that was in the ground.</v>

1180
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.790
<v Speaker 1>He had been married for like 10 days to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1181
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd he die?</v>

1182
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.570
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember how candy died exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did.</v>

1183
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.830
<v Speaker 1>He died pretty young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1184
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember exactly what the final.</v>

1185
00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.640
<v Speaker 1>We never got that information as as </v>
<v Speaker 1>trainers,</v>

1186
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.140
<v Speaker 1>you sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always told,</v>

1187
00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:01.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1188
00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always a meningitis.</v>

1189
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.460
<v Speaker 1>It op.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died of meningitis or,</v>

1190
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:07.250
<v Speaker 1>or they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1191
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.750
<v Speaker 1>twisted and testing or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always came up with things that you</v>

1192
00:47:09.751 --> 00:47:12.480
<v Speaker 1>just know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kept you asking questions rather than</v>

1193
00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:14.730
<v Speaker 1>feeling like anything was ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusive in that regard.</v>

1194
00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:17.580
<v Speaker 1>But on this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in this particular case,</v>

1195
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:19.830
<v Speaker 1>the vet had pulled me aside and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1196
00:47:19.831 --> 00:47:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I gotta ask you something fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you go get two people sued them up.</v>

1197
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.700
<v Speaker 1>We got to go get a piece of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We missed of candy.</v>

1198
00:47:26.701 --> 00:47:27.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugh.</v>

1199
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't possibly impose</v>

1200
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:32.470
<v Speaker 2>upon someone to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

1201
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Deep Deepa had been buried like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>booked six,</v>

1202
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:37.000
<v Speaker 2>eight feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1203
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:42.810
<v Speaker 2>and you could just do that in the yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They allow you to just bury it in the </v>

1204
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 2>yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maryellen has mass graves in the back in</v>

1205
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 2>the exact place that they're claiming </v>
<v Speaker 2>development now,</v>

1206
00:47:47.261 --> 00:47:52.261
<v Speaker 2>which I've got some overhead shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've acted like paving roads pretty </v>

1207
00:47:52.261 --> 00:47:54.930
<v Speaker 2>close to it to where the bodies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>buried and what,</v>

1208
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:56.640
<v Speaker 2>like how many different things you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>are buried?</v>

1209
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands.</v>

1210
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean just in deer alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about.</v>

1211
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greenland breeds more deer and why do </v>

1212
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:05.040
<v Speaker 2>they breed dear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got.</v>

1213
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.580
<v Speaker 2>He's got a whole park of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different animals.</v>

1214
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:12.210
<v Speaker 2>That's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal cruelty charges stemmed from </v>

1215
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:14.041
<v Speaker 2>was actually was not marine mammals </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's no laws protecting them </v>

1216
00:48:14.041 --> 00:48:14.140
<v Speaker 2>so that they continue to live in a void </v>
<v Speaker 2>of protection.</v>

1217
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.100
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1218
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:17.470
<v Speaker 2>the deer's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bears.</v>

1219
00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.680
<v Speaker 2>There's no laws in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Canada yet.</v>

1220
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Speaker 2>It's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1221
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.440
<v Speaker 2>And I've been talking about this for </v>
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>

1222
00:48:23.441 --> 00:48:28.441
<v Speaker 2>We're almost there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm up against the fucking wall </v>

1223
00:48:28.441 --> 00:48:28.441
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on here.</v>

1224
00:48:28.441 --> 00:48:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand 13 was my first time here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:48:31.181 --> 00:48:36.181
<v Speaker 2>So that would have been four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have thousands of graves in the </v>

1226
00:48:36.181 --> 00:48:36.620
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of animals in,</v>

1227
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:38.830
<v Speaker 2>in large graves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this big hole for instance,</v>

1228
00:48:38.831 --> 00:48:41.100
<v Speaker 2>there's a big hole for the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all going in there.</v>

1229
00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.430
<v Speaker 2>The theory or the eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to back in Christmas,</v>

1230
00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the day when he used to,</v>

1231
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.120
<v Speaker 2>when the owner used to host Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties,</v>

1232
00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:54.121
<v Speaker 2>he'd go back and slaughter a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buys it and then feed burgers and make </v>

1233
00:48:54.121 --> 00:48:54.121
<v Speaker 2>food out of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they used to do that.</v>

1234
00:48:54.121 --> 00:48:54.340
<v Speaker 2>They don't do it no more.</v>

1235
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.160
<v Speaker 2>They actually used to be called a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1236
00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.500
<v Speaker 2>something in game farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then by,</v>

1237
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:03.400
<v Speaker 2>by being a farm classified as a farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was actually able to kill them,</v>

1238
00:49:03.401 --> 00:49:04.820
<v Speaker 2>produced food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's something I,</v>

1239
00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:07.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been told that happened now.</v>

1240
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Why did they kill deer back there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why go to a whole?</v>

1241
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1242
00:49:12.631 --> 00:49:15.220
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them die because their gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>

1243
00:49:15.221 --> 00:49:16.750
<v Speaker 2>when you got 500 deer in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1244
00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 2>in a pen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like disgusting.</v>

1245
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.900
<v Speaker 2>They're not all gonna get to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are going to get injured.</v>

1246
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:28.080
<v Speaker 2>These things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at night what would happen is </v>

1247
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.670
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say we'd drive around in his </v>

1248
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.670
<v Speaker 2>truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1249
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.670
<v Speaker 2>put the gun out the window and just eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1250
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Just go on the shooting sprees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiping out these animals in the morning.</v>

1251
00:49:35.801 --> 00:49:37.480
<v Speaker 2>The land animal care guys would show up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it'd be like,</v>

1252
00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:37.900
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1253
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:40.420
<v Speaker 2>go pick up the bodies and these poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

1254
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.630
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do it for a goof or what </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you do it because he's trying to thin</v>

1255
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 2>the population because there's too many </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

1256
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be anything like that.</v>

1257
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one case,</v>

1258
00:49:47.981 --> 00:49:50.440
<v Speaker 2>once the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the investigation came out in 2012,</v>

1259
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:53.380
<v Speaker 2>which revealed of course abuse with land</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals as well,</v>

1260
00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went on a calling spree,</v>

1261
00:49:55.901 --> 00:50:00.901
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they got rid of some of the </v>

1262
00:50:00.901 --> 00:50:00.901
<v Speaker 2>uglier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of less healthy animals.</v>

1263
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:01.970
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1264
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:04.720
<v Speaker 2>because marina actually breathes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>more beautiful deer off site.</v>

1265
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:08.050
<v Speaker 2>The more beautiful animals that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have on are not on display.</v>

1266
00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:10.420
<v Speaker 2>They're actually back there breeding off</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of display.</v>

1267
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:15.570
<v Speaker 2>That's where the two dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you recall when the </v>

1268
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:17.431
<v Speaker 2>owners shot those two labs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful little labrador dogs went </v>

1269
00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:20.911
<v Speaker 2>running into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and down the running up and down the </v>

1270
00:50:20.911 --> 00:50:20.911
<v Speaker 2>fence across from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1271
00:50:20.911 --> 00:50:20.911
<v Speaker 2>murraylands owner's house.</v>

1272
00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Which is where the offsite Penn is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he breathes the animals and that's</v>

1273
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 2>where he decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not calling anyone to come get these</v>

1274
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.930
<v Speaker 2>analysts do the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So heartbreaking.</v>

1275
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:31.820
<v Speaker 2>He just pulled out a shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kills one.</v>

1276
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.750
<v Speaker 2>The other one cowers because there was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>witness.</v>

1277
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Of course the witness never identified </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

1278
00:50:38.331 --> 00:50:42.490
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to be sued and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoots the other one and then he tells a</v>

1279
00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:45.440
<v Speaker 2>land animal care supervisor takes these </v>
<v Speaker 2>as take the collars off the dogs,</v>

1280
00:50:45.441 --> 00:50:47.660
<v Speaker 2>go bury him in the pit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1281
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I was there that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard the gunshots.</v>

1282
00:50:49.791 --> 00:50:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I was there when the vet got the phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>call and she's like,</v>

1283
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:53.090
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1284
00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 2>She hangs up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looked at me.</v>

1285
00:50:53.841 --> 00:50:55.370
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John just killed two dogs.</v>

1286
00:50:55.371 --> 00:50:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man?</v>

1287
00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Dogs that you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1288
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:02.170
<v Speaker 2>go back home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poppy's dude.</v>

1289
00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 2>They were beautiful dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a video.</v>

1290
00:51:03.831 --> 00:51:05.810
<v Speaker 2>It's since been taken down on the trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>star website.</v>

1291
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.840
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the videos are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of things are happening now on </v>

1292
00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.151
<v Speaker 2>account of these lawsuits and further </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the road that we've gone where </v>

1293
00:51:13.151 --> 00:51:13.151
<v Speaker 2>things are starting to disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

1294
00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:18.320
<v Speaker 2>it was a very powerful historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>website about marine and some of the </v>

1295
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.270
<v Speaker 2>owners history and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things are gone now.</v>

1296
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.240
<v Speaker 2>They're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1297
00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I can't allege as to why or what </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreements are.</v>

1298
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:26.330
<v Speaker 2>If there are agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't go down that road to suggest,</v>

1299
00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:29.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of these resources that I,</v>

1300
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.850
<v Speaker 2>that were very powerful are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are gone and disappearing now.</v>

1301
00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.620
<v Speaker 2>So he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This marine land has this giant yard,</v>

1302
00:51:36.621 --> 00:51:41.621
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many acres are you talking about </v>

1303
00:51:41.621 --> 00:51:41.621
<v Speaker 2>where there's thousands of animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>breed.</v>

1304
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:43.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the park is massive.</v>

1305
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more,</v>

1306
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.560
<v Speaker 2>there's probably three times undeveloped</v>
<v Speaker 2>land versus what's develop there.</v>

1307
00:51:48.561 --> 00:51:50.600
<v Speaker 2>And it's a big park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of barren.</v>

1308
00:51:50.601 --> 00:51:55.601
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His rides and you got to walk a mile in </v>

1309
00:51:55.601 --> 00:51:55.601
<v Speaker 2>between them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless,</v>

1310
00:51:55.601 --> 00:51:55.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the owner,</v>

1311
00:51:55.611 --> 00:51:56.490
<v Speaker 2>what do you like to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was,</v>

1312
00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:59.460
<v Speaker 2>was sort of acquire a lot of land over </v>
<v Speaker 2>his lifetime that,</v>

1313
00:51:59.461 --> 00:52:01.870
<v Speaker 2>that was his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He owns half an agora fault.</v>

1314
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.710
<v Speaker 2>I got to watch what the hell I stepped </v>
<v Speaker 2>because any given point,</v>

1315
00:52:03.711 --> 00:52:04.910
<v Speaker 2>if I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm on their land,</v>

1316
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:06.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting charged with trespassing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether I like it or not.</v>

1317
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.310
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city of Niagara Falls leased land to</v>

1318
00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:13.160
<v Speaker 2>marine land to keep protesters off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their site,</v>

1319
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:17.180
<v Speaker 2>which is absolute bullshit and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone's listening from city council,</v>

1320
00:52:17.181 --> 00:52:22.181
<v Speaker 2>I'm hope you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to fix that because that's </v>

1321
00:52:22.181 --> 00:52:23.711
<v Speaker 2>some horse shit right there and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you guys had been pandering to on </v>

1322
00:52:23.711 --> 00:52:23.711
<v Speaker 2>for too long.</v>

1323
00:52:23.711 --> 00:52:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean to keep us from being able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest.</v>

1324
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.310
<v Speaker 2>That's horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1325
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they just don't want to get </v>

1326
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.161
<v Speaker 2>sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a time when marine land and </v>

1327
00:52:33.161 --> 00:52:33.161
<v Speaker 2>owner were called like the king of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Niagara.</v>

1328
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.060
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marine land was a top.</v>

1329
00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:37.940
<v Speaker 2>The hill that was the falls came second </v>
<v Speaker 2>to marine land,</v>

1330
00:52:37.941 --> 00:52:39.230
<v Speaker 2>or at least marineland played the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1331
00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.210
<v Speaker 2>This idea that people came to Niagara </v>
<v Speaker 2>Falls,</v>

1332
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:46.450
<v Speaker 2>they would see the false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd say they'd look at him for 10 </v>

1333
00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:46.450
<v Speaker 2>minutes and then they would have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason to stay.</v>

1334
00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:50.680
<v Speaker 2>They were saying they're bringing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this business because people are now </v>

1335
00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:50.860
<v Speaker 2>going to a hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to restaurants and it's going</v>

1336
00:52:50.861 --> 00:52:53.390
<v Speaker 2>to marine land the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when did this change?</v>

1337
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:55.970
<v Speaker 2>When did marine land go to shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1338
00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:59.150
<v Speaker 2>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right when you left.</v>

1339
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.780
<v Speaker 2>So before then it was this thriving </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and just nobody knew about the </v>

1340
00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:05.030
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>

1341
00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:10.290
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were ignorant of people wouldn't have </v>

1342
00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:12.431
<v Speaker 2>known who's going to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not new for murraylands owner or </v>

1343
00:53:12.431 --> 00:53:12.680
<v Speaker 2>marina and the corporation to sue people</v>
<v Speaker 2>for speaking out.</v>

1344
00:53:12.681 --> 00:53:17.681
<v Speaker 2>They did it before and successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not in the sense that there was any </v>

1345
00:53:17.681 --> 00:53:17.681
<v Speaker 2>judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but successfully in that the people that</v>

1346
00:53:17.681 --> 00:53:20.780
<v Speaker 2>spoke had to pay a horrible price and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1347
00:53:20.781 --> 00:53:25.781
<v Speaker 2>essentially got silenced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no one wants to speak out against </v>

1348
00:53:25.781 --> 00:53:25.781
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1349
00:53:25.781 --> 00:53:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1350
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating it now.</v>

1351
00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:32.661
<v Speaker 2>It's been five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five years of everyday waking up </v>

1352
00:53:32.661 --> 00:53:32.661
<v Speaker 2>wondering if this is the one where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done,</v>

1353
00:53:32.661 --> 00:53:36.621
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've been embroiled in these </v>

1354
00:53:36.621 --> 00:53:36.621
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five years on,</v>

1355
00:53:36.621 --> 00:53:40.640
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sued me on Valentine's Day of 2013 </v>

1356
00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.541
<v Speaker 2>yet and nothing's been resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way that there could be a </v>

1357
00:53:44.761 --> 00:53:49.710
<v Speaker 2>resolve at this point is if I were to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sign a document and I'm,</v>

1358
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming at this point because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Murraylands sent nothing in terms of any</v>

1359
00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:58.041
<v Speaker 2>type of agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know down the road it's their </v>

1360
00:53:58.041 --> 00:53:58.041
<v Speaker 2>objective is to shut me up.</v>

1361
00:53:58.041 --> 00:53:59.280
<v Speaker 2>They want to wipe out the last 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my life.</v>

1362
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:01.620
<v Speaker 2>They don't want me to open my mouth </v>
<v Speaker 2>about anything in of course,</v>

1363
00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:06.621
<v Speaker 2>in the last five years and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>twelfth prior when I sort of revealed </v>

1364
00:54:06.621 --> 00:54:06.621
<v Speaker 2>everything that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to shut me up.</v>

1365
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.000
<v Speaker 2>They want me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want an injunction,</v>

1366
00:54:08.001 --> 00:54:09.470
<v Speaker 2>a permanent injunction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume they would.</v>

1367
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:15.110
<v Speaker 2>That to keep me from being able to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the park with this becomes very </v>

1368
00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:17.280
<v Speaker 2>conflicting for me because they have my </v>
<v Speaker 2>walrus sort of hostage there and I do.</v>

1369
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:22.370
<v Speaker 2>I do dream of a day of being reunited </v>
<v Speaker 2>with her and I imagine that would have </v>

1370
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:22.370
<v Speaker 2>to take place on marine land property </v>
<v Speaker 2>someday.</v>

1371
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:25.680
<v Speaker 2>So it's really not prepared to sign </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1372
00:54:25.681 --> 00:54:27.420
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told my lawyer just last week,</v>

1373
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:31.830
<v Speaker 2>it's a nonstarter and I'll remind marine</v>
<v Speaker 2>land now nonstarter.</v>

1374
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:33.330
<v Speaker 2>They'll never shut me up.</v>

1375
00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not signing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to eat shit forever,</v>

1376
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:40.700
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to sign it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where do you anticipate this all </v>

1377
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:40.700
<v Speaker 2>going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've been,</v>

1378
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prolong legal battle for five years now.</v>

1379
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Where do you anticipate this going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in April.</v>

1380
00:54:46.321 --> 00:54:47.940
<v Speaker 2>So last time I was here two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1381
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:49.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I solicited some,</v>

1382
00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:52.500
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some help resources to be able to pursue</v>

1383
00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:55.230
<v Speaker 2>murraylands owner in that I want him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be examined in court,</v>

1384
00:54:55.231 --> 00:55:00.231
<v Speaker 2>much like I have in the same capacity </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I had to forfeit all of my </v>

1385
00:55:00.231 --> 00:55:02.931
<v Speaker 2>communications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the same for the corporation and </v>

1386
00:55:02.931 --> 00:55:02.931
<v Speaker 2>I want to examine murraylands owner as </v>
<v Speaker 2>representative.</v>

1387
00:55:02.931 --> 00:55:05.040
<v Speaker 2>This proved very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took A.</v>

1388
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean we got the ordered only just last</v>
<v Speaker 2>April to examine him.</v>

1389
00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:13.821
<v Speaker 2>We got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won the order and since then we've </v>

1390
00:55:13.821 --> 00:55:15.600
<v Speaker 2>tried multiple times to schedule and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1391
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:20.720
<v Speaker 2>we're almost a year now of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule this man to come in for </v>

1392
00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.661
<v Speaker 2>examinations and he's not shown up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple times now and so at some point if</v>

1393
00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:29.400
<v Speaker 2>marine land doesn't want the facts out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and that's what I'm pursuing,</v>

1394
00:55:29.401 --> 00:55:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I want the facts out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have to,</v>

1395
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:38.010
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have to settle and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>how that ends with me,</v>

1396
00:55:38.011 --> 00:55:38.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1397
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not looking for money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could give a shit about trying to get </v>

1398
00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.221
<v Speaker 2>rich in this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you trying to sue them for money </v>

1399
00:55:46.221 --> 00:55:46.221
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm suing them.</v>

1400
00:55:46.221 --> 00:55:46.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a much.</v>

1401
00:55:46.221 --> 00:55:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers don't matter,</v>

1402
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.940
<v Speaker 2>but that's like a million and a half or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1403
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.800
<v Speaker 2>They defame the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest.</v>

1404
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:52.170
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1405
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.410
<v Speaker 2>so would the million and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never get it.</v>

1406
00:55:55.470 --> 00:56:00.470
<v Speaker 2>I'll never see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But would it be a predicated on you </v>

1407
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:02.280
<v Speaker 2>would have to shut your mouth if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't something that went.</v>

1408
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:04.350
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't a judgment that the judge </v>
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>

1409
00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:05.550
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to trial,</v>

1410
00:56:05.551 --> 00:56:08.580
<v Speaker 2>the judge makes their decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then if we settled beforehand,</v>

1411
00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:10.800
<v Speaker 2>it's because everyone wants to wash </v>
<v Speaker 2>their hands and walk away.</v>

1412
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:15.450
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to wash their hands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>me unless I feel,</v>

1413
00:56:15.451 --> 00:56:17.040
<v Speaker 2>unless I've got them properly cornered.</v>

1414
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.990
<v Speaker 2>The only way they want to get me is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1415
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:20.160
<v Speaker 2>of course they want to ruin me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1416
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.680
<v Speaker 2>How can you properly corn to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What be well,</v>

1417
00:56:23.681 --> 00:56:26.980
<v Speaker 2>if murraylands owners missed a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>examinations now how many until I can go</v>

1418
00:56:26.981 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 2>in and actually file a motion to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire statement of claim dismissed?</v>

1419
00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact is pretty soon,</v>

1420
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:37.060
<v Speaker 2>so my objective is to go and get this </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit thrown out.</v>

1421
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:42.090
<v Speaker 2>At which point they've only got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got the counterclaim for them to </v>

1422
00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:42.090
<v Speaker 2>work with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not suing me no more.</v>

1423
00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Now who's got the upper hand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my dream.</v>

1424
00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:44.890
<v Speaker 2>That's your dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

1425
00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:50.590
<v Speaker 2>if that doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems like five years is a </v>

1426
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:51.470
<v Speaker 2>long time to be in the prolong legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>battle.</v>

1427
00:56:51.471 --> 00:56:56.471
<v Speaker 2>Like at what point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does it become so absorbed that the </v>

1428
00:56:56.471 --> 00:56:56.770
<v Speaker 2>court throws it out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it just happened.</v>

1429
00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Now it's actually a new rule that as of </v>
<v Speaker 2>February 2018,</v>

1430
00:56:59.891 --> 00:57:04.891
<v Speaker 2>any lawsuit that hasn't been scheduled </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a four trial was administratively </v>

1431
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:11.340
<v Speaker 2>dismissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a new law and so that doesn't </v>

1432
00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:16.201
<v Speaker 2>affect mine unfortunately because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually fought to get a case </v>

1433
00:57:16.201 --> 00:57:18.961
<v Speaker 2>management,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a judge on our case be on my case </v>

1434
00:57:18.961 --> 00:57:19.270
<v Speaker 2>because like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greenland's acting the fool.</v>

1435
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:21.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't seem to get in front of a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's joke around.</v>

1436
00:57:21.611 --> 00:57:23.860
<v Speaker 2>So we went and won that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took a long time.</v>

1437
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:29.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the crazy thing about these </v>

1438
00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:29.010
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1439
00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I see now of course in 2012 was a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>more naive,</v>

1440
00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:31.840
<v Speaker 2>but all of the wins that I get in court </v>
<v Speaker 2>cost me.</v>

1441
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.460
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1442
00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I defend a motion against marine land.</v>

1443
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.730
<v Speaker 2>It costs me $7,500.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The judge says,</v>

1444
00:57:39.731 --> 00:57:41.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phil wins this round.</v>

1445
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Let's give them some money back on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>partial indemnity.</v>

1446
00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.000
<v Speaker 2>He gets 3,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks back.</v>

1447
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:49.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not just cost me four grand </v>
<v Speaker 2>murraylands owner Mrs.</v>

1448
00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Examination as as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to get what's called a </v>

1449
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 2>certificate of attendance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to send a lawyer 1200 bucks.</v>

1450
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:59.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how is all this funded now?</v>

1451
00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a public go fund me.</v>

1452
00:58:00.821 --> 00:58:05.821
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had several and how do people if </v>

1453
00:58:05.821 --> 00:58:08.131
<v Speaker 2>they want to donate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm sure a lot of people </v>

1454
00:58:08.131 --> 00:58:08.131
<v Speaker 2>listening to this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this man.</v>

1455
00:58:08.131 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 2>I got to help this guy saved </v>
<v Speaker 2>smooshy.com.</v>

1456
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I've got my documentary on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'd like to touch on a little bit.</v>

1457
00:58:10.871 --> 00:58:12.130
<v Speaker 2>It's great if you had a chance to look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at it,</v>

1458
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:12.550
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1459
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.600
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well if you get.</v>

1460
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.520
<v Speaker 2>If you manage to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1461
00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:15.730
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

1462
00:58:15.731 --> 00:58:17.740
<v Speaker 2>These kids from Ryerson University did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1463
00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Brave kids and how I know it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective law or a documentary is that </v>

1464
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:24.670
<v Speaker 2>marine land didn't sue them.</v>

1465
00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:27.010
<v Speaker 2>They know the danger of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>

1466
00:58:27.011 --> 00:58:32.011
<v Speaker 2>They know how powerful it is and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't sue him and that's how I know </v>

1467
00:58:32.011 --> 00:58:35.760
<v Speaker 2>that this is powerful and so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided that it's so good they have to </v>

1468
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:39.511
<v Speaker 2>leave it alone and just ignore it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if they sue them then it'll put </v>

1469
00:58:39.511 --> 00:58:39.511
<v Speaker 2>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1470
00:58:39.511 --> 00:58:40.360
<v Speaker 2>And so they made a small statement </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1471
00:58:40.361 --> 00:58:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is Phil just doing what Phil does.</v>

1472
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.170
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because the Ryerson </v>
<v Speaker 2>students turned out to be.</v>

1473
00:58:44.171 --> 00:58:45.550
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not true.</v>

1474
00:58:45.551 --> 00:58:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Like we came to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just went.</v>

1475
00:58:46.961 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 2>They actually wanted to do it five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

1476
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.470
<v Speaker 2>A personal profile of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

1477
00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:55.650
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to just do a quick interview </v>

1478
00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:55.650
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sure.</v>

1479
00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:55.650
<v Speaker 2>That morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1480
00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:56.190
<v Speaker 2>They come in the right day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1481
00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we spoke for hours and then they sort of</v>

1482
00:58:58.571 --> 00:59:03.571
<v Speaker 2>got back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know we want to do like maybe something </v>

1483
00:59:03.571 --> 00:59:03.571
<v Speaker 2>more with this.</v>

1484
00:59:03.571 --> 00:59:03.571
<v Speaker 2>I'm not asking you guys do whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell you want.</v>

1485
00:59:03.571 --> 00:59:03.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1486
00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:06.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm an open book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd give everything away.</v>

1487
00:59:06.731 --> 00:59:08.890
<v Speaker 2>You want something here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go go nuts with it.</v>

1488
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:10.810
<v Speaker 2>And so they did and they did something </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1489
00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:13.910
<v Speaker 2>It's really good and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1490

<v Speaker 2>that they're on the wrong side of </v>

1528
01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:47.960
<v Speaker 2>history and not just marine land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of these places,</v>

1529
01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:53.350
<v Speaker 2>all these places like there's gonna come</v>
<v Speaker 2>a time in the future where people look </v>

1530
01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:57.251
<v Speaker 2>back at this kind of captivity of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper intelligent social animals stolen </v>

1531
01:00:58.131 --> 01:01:01.670
<v Speaker 2>from their families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible,</v>

<v Speaker 2>terrible statement about human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing I love about,</v>

1534
01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:16.700
<v Speaker 2>is that I have support from hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have support from vegans.</v>

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:32.540
<v Speaker 2>complicated world and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

1606
01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.070
<v Speaker 2>she pulled on my heartstrings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1607
01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.630
<v Speaker 2>might've wanted to do it and couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to fall.</v>

1608
01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.120
<v Speaker 2>I see how crazy sort of her life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of things that go on in the end.</v>

1609
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1610
01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.360
<v Speaker 2>she's got a lot of family issues and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of other stuff too.</v>

1611
01:03:45.361 --> 01:03:46.260
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a bummer.</v>

1612
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:48.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just a bummer is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think uh,</v>

1613
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:53.360
<v Speaker 2>also people get involved with you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear the stories and then they get </v>

1614
01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.210
<v Speaker 2>scared of being sued themselves all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1615
01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should see it.</v>

1616
01:03:55.561 --> 01:03:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1617
01:03:56.191 --> 01:03:57.880
<v Speaker 2>even last week I contacted someone that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1618
01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean the media now and mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very different landscape now from</v>

1619
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:02.470
<v Speaker 2>2012,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2012.</v>

1620
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:07.470
<v Speaker 2>The media was against me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Corporate media was in Rhode and had </v>

1621
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:07.950
<v Speaker 2>them in their back pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was before blackfish.</v>

1622
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2014,</v>

1623
01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:10.860
<v Speaker 2>7:15</v>
<v Speaker 2>media's mine,</v>

1624
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:12.450
<v Speaker 2>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17,</v>

1625
01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:13.680
<v Speaker 2>18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the media is just,</v>

1626
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.630
<v Speaker 2>who knows what the fuck they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1627
01:04:15.631 --> 01:04:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Like it's all over the map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard to get any sort of.</v>

1628
01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.480
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marineland will sue them.</v>

1629
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:26.750
<v Speaker 2>So it's also an issue of after things </v>
<v Speaker 2>had been going on for so long and </v>

1630
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:27.600
<v Speaker 2>nothing's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people start going,</v>

1631
01:04:27.601 --> 01:04:28.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1632
01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.360
<v Speaker 2>What can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1633
01:04:29.361 --> 01:04:30.840
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people actually think </v>
<v Speaker 2>murraylands done.</v>

1634
01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.010
<v Speaker 2>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh dude,</v>

1635
01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:32.890
<v Speaker 2>congrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Murraylands dead,</v>

1636
01:04:32.891 --> 01:04:33.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1637
01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:35.040
<v Speaker 2>no man is still happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still being sued.</v>

1638
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:37.650
<v Speaker 2>It's all happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just less current account that it's</v>

1639
01:04:37.651 --> 01:04:38.700
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's exactly,</v>

1640
01:04:38.701 --> 01:04:40.260
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing.</v>

1641
01:04:40.261 --> 01:04:45.261
<v Speaker 2>That's our objective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think also the land fatigue and </v>

1642
01:04:45.261 --> 01:04:45.261
<v Speaker 2>people are tired of fucking hearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1643
01:04:45.261 --> 01:04:45.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of trying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1644
01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:50.350
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also the 11 different counts of </v>

1645
01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:50.350
<v Speaker 2>animal abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1646
01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:50.550
<v Speaker 2>they probably fought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1647
01:04:50.551 --> 01:04:52.270
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1648
01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I thought that that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they turn around a pseudo Spca,</v>

1649
01:04:55.531 --> 01:04:58.140
<v Speaker 2>which I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1650
01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:01.020
<v Speaker 2>it's all dark man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really dark.</v>

1651
01:05:01.021 --> 01:05:03.150
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that there's so many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved helping,</v>

1652
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.060
<v Speaker 2>it feels dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1653
01:05:05.061 --> 01:05:08.880
<v Speaker 2>it feels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like total violation of my life.</v>

1654
01:05:08.881 --> 01:05:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1655
01:05:10.561 --> 01:05:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to fight.</v>

1656
01:05:11.881 --> 01:05:16.881
<v Speaker 2>But it feels gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're at every turn being like fucked </v>

1657
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:22.350
<v Speaker 2>and all you can do all I can do and in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of times I'm not really allowed to </v>

1658
01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:22.350
<v Speaker 2>even speak of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1659
01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:23.650
<v Speaker 2>I may have even compromised things in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1660
01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always compromise things when I,</v>

1661
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.920
<v Speaker 2>when I speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1662
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:27.940
<v Speaker 2>that's what's choice.</v>

1663
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:31.590
<v Speaker 2>How do you compromise things here today </v>
<v Speaker 2>by telling true stories?</v>

1664
01:05:31.591 --> 01:05:36.591
<v Speaker 2>I'll find out tomorrow or Monday when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a whole deluge of fucking legal </v>

1665
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:37.800
<v Speaker 2>threats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1666
01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:42.801
<v Speaker 2>I've been threatened with more lawsuits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marine lands lawyers have in fact </v>

1667
01:05:42.801 --> 01:05:46.800
<v Speaker 2>threatened other whistleblowers lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're ready to sue lawyers.</v>

1668
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk about gumming up a </v>

1669
01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:53.940
<v Speaker 2>system that's over at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a lawyer who's another lawyer,</v>

1670
01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:57.631
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 fucking years and wasn't there </v>

1671
01:05:57.631 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 2>changes in the laws in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how you can sue people.</v>

1672
01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:01.240
<v Speaker 2>There was anti slap legislation that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>enacted years ago.</v>

1673
01:06:01.241 --> 01:06:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I spoke at Queens Park is something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were.</v>

1674
01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1675
01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:10.050
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then slap stands for strategic </v>

1676
01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:13.201
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit against public participation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I speak out against what's happening </v>

1677
01:06:13.201 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 2>at marine land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greenland to multicasts rich corporation</v>

1678
01:06:14.201 --> 01:06:17.530
<v Speaker 2>sues the shit out of me and strategic </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to try to silence you.</v>

1679
01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Ontario,</v>

1680
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:25.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>passed a legislation to make that </v>

1681
01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:25.260
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1682
01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:29.731
<v Speaker 2>at the time Ontario's premier was suing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the leader of the opposition.</v>

1683
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:34.950
<v Speaker 2>She took out the retro clause so it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>no longer retroactive to any lawsuits </v>

1684
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:39.570
<v Speaker 2>that are already in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm actually fighting against a </v>

1685
01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:42.611
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit that is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it were to be applied to my </v>

1686
01:06:42.611 --> 01:06:45.301
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had it been marina would be up against </v>

1687
01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:47.461
<v Speaker 2>some punitive damages like crazy just </v>
<v Speaker 2>for by fault of launching a malicious </v>

1688
01:06:47.461 --> 01:06:48.800
<v Speaker 2>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because it's not retroactive,</v>

1689
01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I sit back and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just continue to eat it.</v>

1690
01:06:50.981 --> 01:06:53.410
<v Speaker 2>And then other people that actually I </v>
<v Speaker 2>see it in the paper went.</v>

1691
01:06:53.411 --> 01:06:54.010
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1692
01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:55.630
<v Speaker 2>this corporation tried to sue this </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls.</v>

1693
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.670
<v Speaker 2>They owe her half a million dollars for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a while.</v>

1694
01:06:57.671 --> 01:06:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not have nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they all are some money for,</v>

1695
01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.460
<v Speaker 2>for having lost the suit.</v>

1696
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.810
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh dude,</v>

1697
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:07.060
<v Speaker 2>my dreams God damn man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel for,</v>

1698
01:07:07.061 --> 01:07:08.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't man,</v>

1699
01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.210
<v Speaker 2>you know what to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

1700
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I call it a sort of a curse and </v>
<v Speaker 2>blessing.</v>

1701
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:13.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1702
01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:15.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm here man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In what world would I be here?</v>

1703
01:07:15.341 --> 01:07:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I was started out as a fan of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started listening to you saying things</v>

1704
01:07:18.341 --> 01:07:20.710
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the hero of your fucking move yours,</v>

1705
01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:22.960
<v Speaker 2>whatever that quote was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did.</v>

1706
01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:25.570
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the idea,</v>

1707
01:07:25.571 --> 01:07:30.571
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get I each but shit starts to taste </v>

1708
01:07:30.571 --> 01:07:34.501
<v Speaker 2>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see the damage you're doing as </v>

1709
01:07:34.501 --> 01:07:34.501
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing for money now?</v>

1710
01:07:34.501 --> 01:07:36.850
<v Speaker 2>So I started the business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a summer business some years ago.</v>

1711
01:07:36.851 --> 01:07:41.851
<v Speaker 2>I've got an Airbnb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like was the best idea I've </v>

1712
01:07:41.851 --> 01:07:43.930
<v Speaker 2>ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy and blessed with this thing</v>

1713
01:07:43.931 --> 01:07:46.120
<v Speaker 2>because people come down and I host them</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1714
01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing I like to do the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a beautiful home on the water.</v>

1715
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:53.880
<v Speaker 2>It's leaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got nice doc converted where the </v>

1716
01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.060
<v Speaker 2>apartments into an airbnb in honor of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>cat that we spoke of.</v>

1717
01:07:55.061 --> 01:07:56.300
<v Speaker 2>In fact two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eugene.</v>

1718
01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:58.780
<v Speaker 2>So it's called the Eugene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1719
01:07:58.781 --> 01:07:59.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1720
01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:01.580
<v Speaker 2>that's a means to sort of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>helping me.</v>

1721
01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I go on occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked for a,</v>

1722
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:09.730
<v Speaker 2>for Canada post as a mailman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I sort of love in that.</v>

1723
01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:14.740
<v Speaker 2>It challenges me everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wake up in minus 20 degrees,</v>

1724
01:08:14.741 --> 01:08:19.741
<v Speaker 2>wind powerlink blowing snow like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to go spend like six to eight </v>

1725
01:08:19.851 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 2>hours walking in this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sucks.</v>

1726
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:26.360
<v Speaker 2>But that's challenge and you gotta wake </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and rise to it,</v>

1727
01:08:26.361 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1728
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:28.070
<v Speaker 2>you could just as well stay in bed all </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

1729
01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:29.000
<v Speaker 2>but that's not gonna help me.</v>

1730
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird thing about mail delivery</v>

1731
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still walking around.</v>

1732
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it.</v>

1733
01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:35.360
<v Speaker 2>It's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I love it.</v>

1734
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking 20 k a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1735
01:08:36.561 --> 01:08:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I lost a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling good.</v>

1736
01:08:38.151 --> 01:08:39.650
<v Speaker 2>It's how it helps me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really does.</v>

1737
01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:40.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

1738
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need my body moving.</v>

1739
01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.420
<v Speaker 2>I know one speed fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know I'm 40.</v>

1740
01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm slowing a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not that much.</v>

1741
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Surprisingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1742
01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.510
<v Speaker 2>hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully my run last for awhile,</v>

1743
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.850
<v Speaker 2>but it helps me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The voice in my head goes from,</v>

1744
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:56.600
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's abysmal and fuck to do.</v>

1745
01:08:56.610 --> 01:08:57.830
<v Speaker 2>You got this man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stick with it.</v>

1746
01:08:57.831 --> 01:08:58.760
<v Speaker 2>You got this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1747
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:00.290
<v Speaker 2>you listen to music and getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

1748
01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:01.280
<v Speaker 2>You're feeling good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1749
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:02.960
<v Speaker 2>It's just right for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

1750
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.450
<v Speaker 2>In a perfect world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where would you look all this to end?</v>

1751
01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:06.930
<v Speaker 2>I want the walters.</v>

1752
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dream is I'm going to free whales.</v>

1753
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:12.740
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a sanctuary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to free marine lends whales.</v>

1754
01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a hand in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to happen.</v>

1755
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really think that's going to happen.</v>

1756
01:09:16.401 --> 01:09:21.401
<v Speaker 2>You think they're gonna enact </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation that makes them release </v>

1757
01:09:21.401 --> 01:09:22.850
<v Speaker 2>those animals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

1758
01:09:22.851 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1759
01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:25.700
<v Speaker 2>What makes you so hopeful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As two or three,</v>

1760
01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:28.850
<v Speaker 2>they realized tried to kill this bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>for years.</v>

1761
01:09:28.851 --> 01:09:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Now they've not been able to in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time next week,</v>

1762
01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.100
<v Speaker 2>so the sucker should go that whale </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctuary.</v>

1763
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Sanctuary project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to build a whale </v>

1764
01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.141
<v Speaker 2>sanctuary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a place where </v>

1765
01:09:41.141 --> 01:09:42.701
<v Speaker 2>whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's in Canada and all the </v>

1766
01:09:42.701 --> 01:09:42.860
<v Speaker 2>exportation laws are that marine land </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get rid of their whales.</v>

1767
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:47.890
<v Speaker 2>There will only be one place for whales </v>
<v Speaker 2>if that business elects to evolve or if </v>

1768
01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:48.980
<v Speaker 2>there's any type of ownership changes.</v>

1769
01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I see this being explained to me how </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sanctuary would work.</v>

1770
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have an environment where is a pen</v>

1771
01:09:55.641 --> 01:10:00.641
<v Speaker 2>off in the ocean and I mean various </v>
<v Speaker 2>different pens for various different </v>

1772
01:10:01.581 --> 01:10:03.650
<v Speaker 2>procedures if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that you,</v>

1773
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:09.040
<v Speaker 2>if they can't be wholly released,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to place where they have</v>

1774
01:10:09.411 --> 01:10:10.830
<v Speaker 2>a sense assemblance of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1775
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:11.690
<v Speaker 2>of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

1776
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.600
<v Speaker 2>but it'll be an human care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be more of like,</v>

1777
01:10:14.601 --> 01:10:19.601
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a viewing platform where people will be </v>

1778
01:10:19.601 --> 01:10:21.701
<v Speaker 2>able to view the whales versus and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>big of an area we're talking about </v>

1779
01:10:21.701 --> 01:10:21.701
<v Speaker 2>massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1780
01:10:21.701 --> 01:10:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say the square footage.</v>

1781
01:10:21.921 --> 01:10:26.921
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because that nothing's </v>
<v Speaker 2>finalized so we're still under the </v>

1782
01:10:26.921 --> 01:10:29.501
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would they develop a bay or something </v>

1783
01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:32.441
<v Speaker 2>where they would want to ideally get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bay that has good water changeover that </v>

1784
01:10:32.441 --> 01:10:32.441
<v Speaker 2>you know that that works.</v>

1785
01:10:32.441 --> 01:10:36.670
<v Speaker 2>If you can find that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean the east coast is looking </v>

1786
01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:39.320
<v Speaker 2>really good these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a model that they've drawn up?</v>

1787
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1788
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:41.540
<v Speaker 2>there's models.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1789
01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:41.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1790
01:10:41.991 --> 01:10:43.660
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we look at something like this,</v>

1791
01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:45.460
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't got the whale sanctuary </v>
<v Speaker 2>project,</v>

1792
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you'll find tons of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1793
01:10:46.851 --> 01:10:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know how they're keeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ORC in those things.</v>

1794
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:51.530
<v Speaker 2>If you put a fence up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to go anywhere.</v>

1795
01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.300
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't jump the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

1796
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.400
<v Speaker 2>There's something about jumping out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1797
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:58.490
<v Speaker 2>when the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the wild captures happen,</v>

1798
01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:04.060
<v Speaker 2>what do we got here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the whale sanctuary point </v>

1799
01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.600
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A model sanctuary were kept whales and </v>

1800
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.801
<v Speaker 2>dolphins can reread habilitated and live</v>
<v Speaker 2>permanently in their natural </v>

1801
01:11:08.801 --> 01:11:09.200
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a step.</v>

1802
01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.500
<v Speaker 2>So this is a step between this and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wild.</v>

1803
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1804
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:19.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they going to free them and then </v>

1805
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:20.250
<v Speaker 1>release fish in there for them to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine there'll be all of that.</v>

1806
01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Every which way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be nice to the.</v>

1807
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Allow them to actually hunt and kill the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

1808
01:11:24.301 --> 01:11:25.920
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure that's what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1809
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they can feel the natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhythms of the sea.</v>

1810
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in tune with the senior in their</v>

1811
01:11:30.301 --> 01:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>environment that the pools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1812
01:11:31.471 --> 01:11:36.440
<v Speaker 1>please look what it says here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For medium survive,</v>

1813
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.480
<v Speaker 1>for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>median survival time in years for wild </v>

1814
01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.621
<v Speaker 1>caught orcas at a marine park for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thousand 100 square yards of space </v>

1815
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>and a large display tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a typical high end marine tank.</v>

1816
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred 14,600</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the minimum number of square yards </v>

1817
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 1>for the first whale sanctuary project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seaside sanctuary.</v>

1818
01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:03.980
<v Speaker 1>So this is 314,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>600 square yards.</v>

1819
01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:05.970
<v Speaker 1>So it would be a massive place.</v>

1820
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:12.010
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and five is the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>captive orcas and Balugas and North </v>

1821
01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:13.330
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that includes marine land.</v>

1822
01:12:13.331 --> 01:12:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Some marine land has half the Balugas in</v>
<v Speaker 1>North America.</v>

1823
01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:18.360
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1824
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:20.760
<v Speaker 1>And they fly under the radar because no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one wants to talk about them.</v>

1825
01:12:20.761 --> 01:12:25.761
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four slash seven round the clock </v>

1826
01:12:25.761 --> 01:12:25.761
<v Speaker 1>care care for the whales at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctuary.</v>

1827
01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:31.010
<v Speaker 1>That sounds beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murraylands threatened to sue these </v>

1828
01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:31.010
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people.</v>

1829
01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Somebody fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am dude,</v>

1830
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need more than just you.</v>

1831
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.250
<v Speaker 1>It seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

1832
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.800
<v Speaker 1>People listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please get involved.</v>

1833
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:45.870
<v Speaker 1>This is a great step though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this idea of this step,</v>

1834
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have something that's like a bridge</v>

1835
01:12:48.691 --> 01:12:53.691
<v Speaker 1>between the captive and the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also it would allow their atrophied </v>

1836
01:12:54.301 --> 01:12:58.020
<v Speaker 1>dorsal fins to reinvigorate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could start diving deep again.</v>

1837
01:12:58.050 --> 01:13:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean you know how deep it necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean at least a little bit and </v>

1838
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:03.050
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

1839
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:04.770
<v Speaker 1>You could train these animals to </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically take them for walks,</v>

1840
01:13:04.771 --> 01:13:09.771
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'd call him swims where you </v>

1841
01:13:09.771 --> 01:13:09.771
<v Speaker 1>will be able to leave and have them just</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow a boat and go for some exercise.</v>

1842
01:13:09.771 --> 01:13:10.110
<v Speaker 1>You can totally do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really.</v>

1843
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.020
<v Speaker 1>The things that this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

1844
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:18.021
<v Speaker 1>the opportunities for these animals is </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant and amazing and the board is </v>

1845
01:13:18.021 --> 01:13:21.051
<v Speaker 1>comprised of all your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your wild animal brilliant </v>

1846
01:13:21.051 --> 01:13:21.330
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the project.</v>

1847
01:13:21.331 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 1>This is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is the way to do it,</v>

1848
01:13:23.731 --> 01:13:28.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've always said when you go to </v>

1849
01:13:28.731 --> 01:13:30.561
<v Speaker 1>a place like sea world or whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at all those dolphins and </v>

1850
01:13:30.561 --> 01:13:32.070
<v Speaker 1>killer whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how would you get them free?</v>

1851
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.590
<v Speaker 1>How did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would have to be some intermediary</v>

1852
01:13:34.591 --> 01:13:35.790
<v Speaker 1>step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

1853
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exciting times,</v>

1854
01:13:40.231 --> 01:13:41.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they do that man.</v>

1855
01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:46.970
<v Speaker 1>It's comp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that because I feel like if </v>

1856
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:47.400
<v Speaker 1>there was a place where you could go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people could feed the killer whales like</v>

1857
01:13:47.401 --> 01:13:49.860
<v Speaker 1>released some fish or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and be there to watch,</v>

1858
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:53.940
<v Speaker 1>that would be way more exciting than </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching them in a swimming pool.</v>

1859
01:13:53.941 --> 01:13:58.941
<v Speaker 1>Watch a fucking killer whale fart in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild versus do a back flip in captivity </v>

1860
01:13:58.941 --> 01:13:59.950
<v Speaker 1>and you're watching that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1861
01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.960
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this thing is just music and </v>

1862
01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:04.960
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pulled over,</v>

1863
01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:04.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday morning.</v>

1864
01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.820
<v Speaker 1>I was in Malibu real early in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and uh,</v>

1865
01:14:06.821 --> 01:14:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I pulled over and watched some dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

1866
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I was told I was speaking with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1867
01:14:12.221 --> 01:14:12.910
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're here.</v>

1868
01:14:12.911 --> 01:14:14.200
<v Speaker 1>They're in Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1869
01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:16.040
<v Speaker 1>they're here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was um,</v>

1870
01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I was on the pch and I was driving under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corner of my eye,</v>

1871
01:14:19.271 --> 01:14:24.271
<v Speaker 1>saw something in the water and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw the tail going over a few of them </v>

1872
01:14:24.671 --> 01:14:27.490
<v Speaker 1>together and I pulled over and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

1873
01:14:27.491 --> 01:14:28.300
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

1874
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to live in mal books.</v>

1875
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared of tsunamis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you were there,</v>

1876
01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:37.860
<v Speaker 1>like right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like looking out your fucking bedroom </v>

1877
01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.380
<v Speaker 1>window and checking that out first thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

1878
01:14:38.381 --> 01:14:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I wish dolphins in your yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1879
01:14:40.901 --> 01:14:43.030
<v Speaker 1>And they're just wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a good old time.</v>

1880
01:14:43.031 --> 01:14:44.920
<v Speaker 1>They just feel different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1881
01:14:44.921 --> 01:14:48.040
<v Speaker 1>you see them in marine land or I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen him in marine land,</v>

1882
01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:52.840
<v Speaker 1>but you see him in any sort of captive </v>
<v Speaker 1>area and you just get this weird feeling</v>

1883
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:53.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1884
01:14:53.141 --> 01:14:54.640
<v Speaker 1>they're cool to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

1885
01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:56.260
<v Speaker 1>they're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not,</v>

1886
01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:58.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something missing there.</v>

1887
01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:03.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like the difference between seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cow in a pen versus a buffalo in the </v>

1888
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:03.490
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1889
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.770
<v Speaker 1>just this is where hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say they're really.</v>

1890
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:10.830
<v Speaker 1>This is where I get a lot of support </v>
<v Speaker 1>from hunters because didn't know </v>

1891
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:10.830
<v Speaker 1>hunters.</v>

1892
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean all you got to do is grab a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pigeon,</v>

1893
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:11.890
<v Speaker 1>just go on the corner of street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab a pigeon,</v>

1894
01:15:11.891 --> 01:15:13.720
<v Speaker 1>if you can grab it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in a cage and watch how depressed</v>

1895
01:15:13.721 --> 01:15:15.100
<v Speaker 1>you are in a half hour watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1896
01:15:15.101 --> 01:15:17.980
<v Speaker 1>this is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I love about.</v>

1897
01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:19.300
<v Speaker 1>The hunters are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>

1898
01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:20.800
<v Speaker 1>you got this thing right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck it.</v>

1899
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people have this erroneous idea that</v>

1900
01:15:23.261 --> 01:15:25.560
<v Speaker 1>hunters hate animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill Them.</v>

1901
01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.600
<v Speaker 1>They love wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love things to be wild.</v>

1902
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>

1903
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:36.160
<v Speaker 1>just a very depressing aspect of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature that we've chosen to go down this</v>

1904
01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:37.960
<v Speaker 1>route and that we did it a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

1905
01:15:37.961 --> 01:15:42.961
<v Speaker 1>I really truly believe that if there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>no dolphin and Orca captivity ever </v>

1906
01:15:42.961 --> 01:15:45.820
<v Speaker 1>previously before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would not be possible to do today.</v>

1907
01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would freak out.</v>

1908
01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.670
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in America,</v>

1909
01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:49.550
<v Speaker 1>the future is brandon.</v>

1910
01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids are repulsed by it already.</v>

1911
01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where they should be.</v>

1912
01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:56.590
<v Speaker 1>I go speak to schools and every kid in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful thing,</v>

1913
01:15:56.591 --> 01:16:01.591
<v Speaker 1>and I mean it sounds horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kids that go to marina and get </v>

1914
01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:01.591
<v Speaker 1>singled out pretty bad by the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

1915
01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:02.640
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a good time to bring your </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids to,</v>

1916
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:07.810
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a place like marina and lets your </v>

1917
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:07.810
<v Speaker 1>kids have your kids picked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about China?</v>

1918
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:08.920
<v Speaker 1>How is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's it so cool in China?</v>

1919
01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:11.020
<v Speaker 1>They just don't get it over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't know.</v>

1920
01:16:11.021 --> 01:16:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Fairly firm culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1921
01:16:12.221 --> 01:16:13.930
<v Speaker 1>it's fairly new for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cultural.</v>

1922
01:16:13.931 --> 01:16:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1923
01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1924
01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I just know that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be there for awhile yet.</v>

1925
01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The paradigm shift hasn't taken their </v>

1926
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:24.890
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll be a while.</v>

1927
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So save smooshy.com</v>

1928
01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.120
<v Speaker 1>for anybody who wants to go and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's where they can watch the </v>

1930
01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:37.740
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm listening,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm super appreciative.</v>

1933
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I hope in some way it gets people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>donate and to pay attention and to be </v>

1934
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:48.670
<v Speaker 1>aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And please folks watched blackfish.</v>

1935
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Just go watch that and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't make you crack up,</v>

1936
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:58.500
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't make you cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make you really sad that </v>

1937
01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.290
<v Speaker 1>people are capable of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1938
01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:00.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just wrong.</v>

1939
01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:01.900
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1940
01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not what we should be doing as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

1941
01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.730
<v Speaker 1>as a species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a race,</v>

1942
01:17:06.731 --> 01:17:11.731
<v Speaker 1>as a civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the wrong thing to do and one </v>

1943
01:17:11.731 --> 01:17:15.050
<v Speaker 1>day it will be looked upon very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very poorly.</v>

1944
01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.660
<v Speaker 1>The timing of people putting their eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on me now,</v>

1945
01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.550
<v Speaker 1>it's never been better.</v>
