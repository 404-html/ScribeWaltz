00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience from is taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adderall,</v>

2
00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dropoff at the end of the day was</v>

3
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>too much for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really starting to drive him</v>

4
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>crazy because he would feel great</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the day and be very</v>

5
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd have this big dropoff</v>

6
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>that's when you start your drinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocktail hour.</v>

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with adderall,</v>

8
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>but I am saying a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a lot of shit done or taken</v>

9
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just clean out,</v>

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>clean out my closets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I have never done in my whole</v>

11
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>fucking life because I can't focus to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

12
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like I said,</v>

13
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.293
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

14
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>fucking closet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm have shit in there from 25 fucking</v>

15
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>years that I was afraid to throw out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I counted.</v>

16
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I had something like 1700 black plain</v>
<v Speaker 1>black shirts.</v>

17
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

18
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you count those all I would have</v>

19
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>gave up after the first couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred because I was gay donating them.</v>

20
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

21
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I,</v>

23
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>that was pre adderall behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was pre adderall.</v>

24
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Adderall made me see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

25
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.600
<v Speaker 1>I had enough fucking black tee shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So adderall give you clarity</v>

26
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>on that because my kids are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get me off at</v>

27
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 1>my fucking kids like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put through Rehab now they're giving</v>

28
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>me shit about my fucking adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me.</v>

29
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

30
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I've never done math</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for,</v>

31
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two times I was married to Tom Arnold.</v>

32
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.830
<v Speaker 1>But aside from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

33
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I would never get into math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's nothing like</v>

34
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they've got it down to where</v>

35
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>it's very effective for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you one thing,</v>

36
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>it's real effective because I got the</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth of everything.</v>

37
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Two way mirror thing going on all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

38
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>It made me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to bite my nails so bad,</v>

39
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a down to nothing because my dad,</v>

40
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>he did it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

41
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I quit for a long time.</v>

42
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Then I went on adderall and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started biting my nails and then I had</v>

43
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>to keep it down to only two nails that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could buy.</v>

44
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I allow myself to bite only tune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it perfected my fucking nail biting</v>

45
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:31.580
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's like no nail left at all</v>

46
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>and all so good at it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you give yourself two nails.</v>

47
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you have specific nails?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

48
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>these two are my binders.</v>

49
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 1>So adderall let you save your other</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight fingers essentially,</v>

50
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>but it kind of forced me to do these to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

51
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's got its good and bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have clean closets and you know</v>

52
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>what else I</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned it from to write scripts.</v>

53
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I was able to find a fucking focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

54
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of things going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

55
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things going on in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and um,</v>

56
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I think we should acknowledge all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

57
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should acknowledge the,</v>

58
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mystery of it all.</v>

59
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the big things that drives</v>
<v Speaker 1>me crazy about someone when they say,</v>

60
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is this and that.</v>

61
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Is that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:23.640
<v Speaker 1>the way you should live is this and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way the government should do is that and</v>

63
00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>the way we're going to solve this is by</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like maybe not.</v>

64
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not like are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you really so sure that you're</v>

65
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to what the fuck is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on?</v>

66
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>We're flying through space like we're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spaceship spaceship was 100 feet wide.</v>

67
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>You'd be freaking the fuck out right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

68
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.140
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why you're not freaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

69
00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's like thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles wide,</v>

70
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's still a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on this spinning fucking thing</v>

71
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.290
<v Speaker 1>and at nighttime you could see the space</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're flying through and you're</v>

72
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.470
<v Speaker 1>spinning a thousand miles an hour in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle and you're floating around this</v>

73
00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>giant nuclear explosion and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>around other bigger rocks that are</v>

74
00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:01.651
<v Speaker 1>flying behind you and gas giants and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then other galaxies and other universe</v>

75
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>and an on and on and on and you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurdling through it while you're worried</v>

76
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>about what's on TV and why the walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead has so many commercials and why gas</v>

77
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>is $4.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you imagine,</v>

78
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>if this was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

79
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>put yourself in a position where this</v>
<v Speaker 1>really was a dream and you had a lucid</v>

80
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>dream where you're aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what you would want to do with</v>

81
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 1>your dream?</v>

82
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to sleep at night and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were saying you would worry about</v>

83
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>all of these inane things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never actually be in the present moment.</v>

84
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Never taken adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never go on a risk,</v>

85
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.480
<v Speaker 1>never love because you could get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

86
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.230
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this,</v>

87
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>if you really did treat this like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>

88
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>you would do as much cool shit as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

89
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put his,</v>

90
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>put as many good things into that dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you possibly could and not not be so</v>

91
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>fucking stressed out about all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

92
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.251
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

93
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>and I think we've been talking a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kinda been the theme of this</v>

94
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you actually did,</v>

95
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>if this was a lucid dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 1>you would live it in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would live it to have some fun and</v>

97
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 1>enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can I fly?</v>

98
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Because all my lucid dreams I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly or breathe under water.</v>

99
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Breathe under water is cool too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

100
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be very strange if one day it</v>

101
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was proven that we are really living</v>

102
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>in some sort of self created reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like really traumatizing for</v>

103
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:17.910
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that have fucked it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>

104
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>this is what I made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like remember when you were in</v>

105
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 1>school and like there was a project and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to use your hand and make a</v>

106
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Turkey and you put your hand down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drew around and then everybody did their</v>

107
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Speaker 1>own little Turkey painted it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the teacher would put them up and they</v>

108
00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>would all look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people's Turkeys looked like dog</v>

109
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked.</v>

110
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the fuck a Turkey</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like.</v>

111
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know how to draw around</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hand.</v>

112
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Like everything was a disaster.</v>

113
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 1>And other people that beautiful turkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>your life is a work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life is like a hand Turkey that you</v>

115
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 1>make in grade school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
