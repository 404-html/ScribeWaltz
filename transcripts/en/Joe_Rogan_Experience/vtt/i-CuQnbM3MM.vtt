4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.850
Ooh my God fucking hate UFC.
This is not,
it might be the podcast for you though.

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.720
Cause we don't know.
Like we might start talking about the UFC and it might,

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.720
it could go anywhere.
It usually does.
These podcasts are like bike companion.
We,

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.060
you always tell them that it's different and all that.
But all the podcasts,

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.950
the last fight companion,

9
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.920
we only talked about the main event for like 30 seconds.
Exactly.

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.680
Rest of them were talking about everything.
Sex and drugs and fucking friendship.

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.290
Then when it goes to decision,
oh I got Dario Shit.
I'm fucking,

12
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.530
and
I watched that UFC on Fox.

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.020
Oh my God.
What a fucking card.
First of all during the on it podcast.

14
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.370
Oh you guys did a fight companions.
Oh that's a great idea.
People are doing that.

15
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.660
Other fight companions like other podcast.
Awesome.
Why not

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.970
girlfriend Alex Jones did it.
Yes,
they're amazing.

17
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:16.680
Alex Jones was on doing a fight companion with Aubrey and that's amazing.
Crazy.

18
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.400
God.
Damn,
I got to listen to that now and we'll go back and listen to that dude.

19
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:25.190
He is so impressed with,
you know,
cause we knew Aubrey before on it,
you know,

20
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.230
and to watch him blow the fuck it was pretty insane.

21
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.950
And I mean I was blown away because for those of you that don't know 10 planet

22
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.460
Austin,
we had a grand opening.
It's,

23
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.830
it's at the honor and academy and a man.

24
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.100
I had never been there when I was fucking Florida.
That places is gigantic.
Crazy.

25
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.200
It's incredible.
[inaudible] doesn't do anything half assed.
No,
no.

26
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.270
You're puts his heart and soul and everything.

27
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:54.840
He's got a special knack for creating things and putting things together.

28
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.000
He's an executive producer man.
He puts him,
he's good at it and everything.

29
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.870
You go to dinner and it's like,
I've never had a dinner like this.

30
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.670
I was on a boat and there's just a hose everywhere.
I'm like,

31
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.900
never been on a boat like this for reals.

32
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.190
Never been on a boat like Ziggy smallest types.
Like,
this is how we do it.

33
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.220
His playlist has switched from the heavens.
I'm like,
can I have that playlist?

34
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:18.930
He's like,
sure,
he's the best.
He's just an unusual dude.
He really is very,

35
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:20.280
very unusual dude.
Yeah.

36
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:23.880
And so Alex wanted to do a piece on me cause he's got people that work for him,

37
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:24.960
that Dude Jujitsu.

38
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.430
And so he thought Alex found out that I was gonna be there and he decided to go

39
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:32.730
down and interviewed.
He had an info wars.
Mike,
he's that.

40
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.870
He's sitting next to me during the invitation or during the tournament,

41
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:41.790
which was fucking nuts.
And he's right there.
I was like,
Alex Jones,
like,
whoa.

42
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.920
It's pretty crazy.
That is crazy.
And you know,
him fell in love with Hugh Jitsu.

43
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.030
He was there for the whole place,
for the whole tournament.
Want her to stay,

44
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:54.200
stayed afterwards,
stayed for the podcast.
He was there for,

45
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.880
he wants to bring his daughters to Jujitsu.
That's he wants to do Jujitsu,

46
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.190
does 30 pounds,
you know,
uh,
bugs to be ripped.

47
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.910
You ever see what he used to look like?
Dude,
he was a stud.

48
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.200
He wants to get skinny and why don't I know this Guy Alex Jones infomercials and

49
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.680
for wars infomercials.
He says the most popular conspiracy theorist.

50
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.160
He's like the,
Oh yeah,
I definitely wouldn't know.
He runs well.

51
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.980
He used to be a radio DJ a long time ago.
He's,

52
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.610
he's still kind of doing radio but this now most of it is on the Internet but he

53
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:28.300
does a lot of it I guess on like am stations.
I still think he syndicated.

54
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320
He does both,
right.

55
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.490
He does like the radio part and then he does cause the dirty part.

56
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:36.560
The Internet part was when Joey came on and Joey was swearing.

57
00:03:36.561 --> 00:03:38.920
You remember you've seen that thing that's all on the Internet.

58
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:42.310
That's the only Internet version,
but he has a radio version too.

59
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.980
I just get this app and I just him anytime he's out there,

60
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.950
it's always been important to him and he's just been out conspiracy theory.

61
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.670
He's a conspiracy theorist guy,
like a heavy duty over the top,
but he's been,

62
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.560
I've known them.
I've been friends with them since 99 I did.

63
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.800
I did my,
I did a comedy DVD in Austin.

64
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.630
He and I put on [inaudible] we put on,
um,
George W.
Bush masks.

65
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.990
I was George,
I was Bush younger and he was Bush older.

66
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:11.470
He was Herbert Walker Bush.
And that was George W.
Bush is awesome.
And we,
uh,

67
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.920
we've ran around the fucking Capitol building,
like where the,
uh,

68
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:19.460
the State Capitol is in Austin and filmed,
it was just so retarded shit.

69
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.310
I became friends with them back then.
So I've,
we've known him for 16 years now.

70
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.530
I bet you and him just get balls deep and confused.

71
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.590
And we partied in Vegas one weekend.
Joe took them out to the UFC.

72
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:37.000
He flew in and man,
he does not,
you would think that he was like,
dude,

73
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.370
we're out partying.
Let's not talk about conspiracy theories.
Oh,

74
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:41.590
I was ready to go.

75
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.010
He's got so much fucking information,
man.
Right.
You know,
and that's a funny dude.

76
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.120
Yeah.
He's,
I love that dude.
That dude is so cool.
I fucking,

77
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:54.450
I could sit there and hang out with them for hours and just

78
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.840
good guy.
He's a really good guy.
He's just a fucking crazy wacko.

79
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.550
Everybody thought he was crazy back in the day,
but even the last time,
uh,
Joe,
uh,

80
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.910
was on his show,
on the phone.
You said,
man,

81
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.740
all of that stuff that people were,

82
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.550
were accusing you of being crazy about all that shit was coming to Alex.

83
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:17.440
You said that on the radio.
I like the NSA stuff.

84
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:20.230
Like he was the first one he was saying as long time ago,

85
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.590
the NSA was going to be monitoring everyone's phone calls.

86
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.490
It was going to be recording everything you do.
People thought he was nuts.

87
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:30.040
They're like,
you're out of your mind.
There's no way that's going to happen.
Also,

88
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.670
one of the big ones that I've found out from him was he had this,
this,
uh,

89
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.060
video called nine one one the road to tyranny,
I think it's called.

90
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.910
And a lot of it was about agent provocateur tours.

91
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.840
And what it's about is how they would go into a peaceful protest and they would

92
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:48.160
send these people,
whether they're cops or soldiers,
whoever the fuck they were.

93
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.370
They were in government issue boots and they would send them into these peaceful

94
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:51.881
protests.

95
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:55.750
They were aware masks and they would just start smashing things so they would

96
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:58.670
pretend that they were a part of the protest,
so they go in the protest,

97
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.780
they'd smash storefronts,
they'd smashed car windows,
create havoc.

98
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:07.781
Then the cops had move in and in the case of the World Trade Organization,

99
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:09.620
these agent provocateur guys,

100
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:12.200
these guys that got hired to go in and start smashing shit,

101
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.610
they all went into a house and waited and then the cops waiting outside,

102
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:17.570
they all negotiated.

103
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.300
Nobody rushed in and took these people and then they eventually let them all go.

104
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.240
Like there was some sort of behind the scenes conversation.
Yeah,

105
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.200
that's when they did it.
When they did it,
they stopped the entire protest.

106
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:29.510
They made it a protest free zone and they were literally,

107
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:31.880
and this is all on the news,
they were literally telling people,

108
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:36.680
you couldn't go in there with a badge on if you had a badge that said WTO on it

109
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:38.510
with a line through it.
They were telling people,

110
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.450
you can't have that badge on as you go on your way to work.
She said,

111
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.060
you're not allowed to protest.

112
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:47.690
It was a protest free zone all because of these government agents.

113
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.540
Now I thought like there's no way the government actually does that,

114
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.330
but it turns out once I read that or once I watched it and I started reading

115
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.780
about it,
and it's a common tactic forever.
It's technique.

116
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.880
It's just like there's a bunch of CIA whistleblowers,
ex CIA agents,

117
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:06.320
John Stockwell full a youtube search.
John Stockwell,
he's written books.

118
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.550
He says that it's just techniques.
The way they set people up,

119
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:13.820
the way they create Patsy's.
They'll bring in some crazy,

120
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.130
extreme radical people in the golf.
Okay,
well you want to,

121
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.100
you want to be in the CIA,
help us out.
And they set them up.

122
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:21.950
They got these dumb people that they always said it's called honey banking.

123
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.080
They want to,
if they want to comment,
honey dictate.

124
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.580
What they'll do is like exactly what Joe said.

125
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.080
They'll get like professionals to go in there,
cost some shit,

126
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.260
kill people.
I'm not making this up.
This is what John Stopped.

127
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.690
Well says that go in there and the more people they kill,

128
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:40.280
the more effective it is actually.

129
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.290
So what they'll do is they'll take professional,

130
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.830
like a dudes that go in there and take people out and then they'll put their

131
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:49.370
patsy in that boom,
blame them,
put some shit on the fucking media.

132
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:52.310
They run the media anyways and then they shoot those,
the patsies.

133
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:54.800
We got him some crazy people.
Lee Harvey Oswald.

134
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.340
That's the Lee Harvey Oswald Story.
Harvey Oswald was an idiot.

135
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.640
I mean he's definitely an idiot.
He was smart enough to Russia.

136
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.480
They set them up the whole time.
He was a seasoned,
set him up the whole time.

137
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.820
That guy was a nut.
He was.
He falls deep and conspiracy theories like,

138
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.600
you know what it is.

139
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.890
I get scared when it goes on and this shows us that he listened to us.
It's no,

140
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:21.830
you
know,
because when you,

141
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.230
when you mentioned Alex Jones and you'd never heard of them,

142
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.200
and then when we said he was a famous conspiracy,
there's you say,

143
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.670
that's why I don't know Mike,

144
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.660
but he just does stuff powerful.

145
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.930
I don't shit still know what I was going to say.
Eddie,

146
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:37.580
when you are on your rant is most people,

147
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:41.480
they only know him from his broadcast and they assume that he's just like crazy

148
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:45.020
guy who just is constantly looking for,
is can see conspiracies everywhere.

149
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.940
When you hang with him in person,
he's like a super nice guy.
Super Sweet.

150
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:51.620
He's fun.
Just doesn't shut up

151
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.110
Brendan.
All conspiracy theories are,

152
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.460
are the way shit really is.
The way shit really is.

153
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:07.250
Not every one of them.
Not everyone.

154
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.570
Just because,
just because not every conspiracy theory or rumor,

155
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.560
whatever's true.
Does that mean you just forget about the other ones?
No,

156
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.440
not at all.
No,
no,
no.
It doesn't.

157
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.870
But something unbounced about only looking for them when,
no,
no.

158
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.150
I know dudes that all they care about is conspiracy.
So they're so exhausted.

159
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:29.040
Again,
conspiracy theories are theories on how shit really is run.

160
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.310
Some people really like to know how their life,
every,

161
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:36.960
everything that these conspiracies theories,
uh,

162
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.180
all of them affect our lives every day.

163
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:42.510
And so when you think about it like that and you start thinking about my life,

164
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:45.960
this life is all because he has a big effect.

165
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.710
A big effect on my life was stuff like nine 11,
and all of these,

166
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.210
these events like these,
these shootings,
these,
all these false flag events,

167
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.080
our lives are affected and shootings do you think are false flag events?
Oh Man.

168
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.860
You're talking about sandy talking about mass shootings,
school shootings.
Hey,

169
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.830
you know what?
The teacher got fired for percent.
Listen to question.

170
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.280
We already know they're all crooks.
We know how they set them.
Who's there?
Um,

171
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.150
the people that are really running shit.
Okay,
let's go.

172
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.450
Okay.
They're not crooks.
Okay.
I take that back.
People that are somewhere,
yeah.

173
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.680
The people that have all the power generally are crux.
Not every single one.

174
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.420
Not every single on.
Of course we're talking in general terms.

175
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.580
One of the things that you'll find in government is they'll make laws that don't

176
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:39.870
make any fucking sense and that are evil and then they abide by those laws of

177
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:42.840
benefit.
There's a lot of crazy line,
actually gay.
Here's a good one.

178
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:47.670
The Supreme Court passed a ruling that allowed corporations to act as

179
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:48.510
individuals,

180
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.980
so they get essentially donate as much money to a campaign as they so choose.

181
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.190
So if a corporation wants to elect a president,

182
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.510
they can essentially bribe their way and get this person in the white.

183
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:04.320
It's insane.
It's nuts that they're allowed to spend any money.
How about that?

184
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.940
It should be the opposite.

185
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.180
It should be a person should be thought of as a person and individual.
We should.

186
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:12.390
We should be thought of as individual and a corporation should be thought of as

187
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:16.560
a sole entity,
a group where people get together and work.

188
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.260
It should never be thought of as an individual.

189
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:24.030
Like one thing that can act and its own interest,
like it's alive to stay alive.

190
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:26.230
It's going to bribe people to make sure it has the cushy.

191
00:11:26.231 --> 00:11:30.300
Has Rules and regulations.
So in that sense,
yeah,
those guys are crooks.

192
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.970
Like that's a crook move.
You know what I started watching.

193
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.930
It's really fucking good walking into a house of cards.
I heard it's really good.

194
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.550
It's fun.
What you love it.

195
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.520
You would love it because it's all about the president and his,

196
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:44.900
this guy becomes president.
No,
no spoiler alerts.
Uh,

197
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.120
Kevin's spacing and then you find out all the inner workings and I was like,

198
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.970
I'm not into politics or the,
it's,

199
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.990
I just find it like it's like watching a fixed game of base.
It's exhausting.

200
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.150
It's boring to me.
It makes me angry.

201
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.640
It makes me angry that these are our candidates.
It makes me angry.

202
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.730
This is no one that's really saying something that really resonates with me.

203
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.520
Everyone is saying something that's inside the parameters of the system.

204
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.880
So they,

205
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.230
they do this show and Kevin Spacey plays the president and shows all the inner

206
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.950
workings of like how deals are made and how they negotiate and all the behind

207
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.290
the scenes stuff.
That sounds dope.
It's fascinating.

208
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.800
It's fucking good cause it's really good.
Good writing and keep carrying me.

209
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:21.370
Shit going on,

210
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.610
pairing that you would love it and I had to bring it up cause I knew you would

211
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:28.450
love it and I'll never forget stuff.
All sorts of crazy deep,

212
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:31.360
dark undercover shit.
You would love it.
You would love it.
You'd go crazy.

213
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.830
And you know probably a lot of it is the case.
Like who the fuck knows man?

214
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.470
Who the fuck knows?
Maybe they paid Nate Diaz to go off on Fox.
Maybe there's a,

215
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.680
maybe there's a conspiracy there.
Maybe it is.
His manager is,

216
00:12:42.681 --> 00:12:46.000
what do we talk to him about?
UFC.
What is everyone talking about?
Ds.

217
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.290
We're not talking about those San Joe's.
We're not talking about Overeem.

218
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.250
It's all about new ideas.
That was where I was conflicted as a broadcaster.

219
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:59.251
I'm so conflicted because as a Nate Diaz fan and as a comedian and fell

220
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.990
marijuana advocate,
I was fucking howling.
Go.
Yes,
keep going,

221
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:09.790
keep going.
They're fucking screaming in my ear,
screaming in my ear,
cut him off,

222
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:12.730
cut him off,
take the microwave,
caught him off.
And that was,

223
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.440
I am not about to cut him off.
I'm not doing it.
Sorry,
I'm not pulling.

224
00:13:17.441 --> 00:13:21.480
That might go away.
I'm not being the man fucking screaming in my ear.

225
00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:25.150
Shut him off on my head and you're going to have to fire me if I'm not fucking

226
00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:29.000
tickets.
I deal with them to let him even get home.
The mind,
everybody.

227
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.160
It's you'd do.
We won.
I won and he looked amazing.
I agree.
Looked amazing,

228
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.900
but we know it's fucking Nate Diaz.
If if I'm,
if I'm Fox,
I'm like,
all right,

229
00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:42.700
you can interview.
Don't give ds the fucking room.
I figured they talked to him.

230
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.970
Listen,
he had a great fight.
I thought he was going to be chill.

231
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.950
I thought it was good to talk about Michael Johnson.

232
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:50.460
I didn't know he's going to talk about a be chill dude.

233
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.250
This is how bad ass Conor McGregor is.
Three fighters called them out.

234
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:58.300
Three dudes.
Three fighters.
Three.
You see his reply?

235
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.170
He Rolls Royce.
So good.
I love it.

236
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.650
That's the fight though,
is the fight.
Well,
he'd say very good fight.

237
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.410
If I'm dating a white,
I'm not saying what's the right thing to do.

238
00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:19.060
I'm saying if I'm looking for the biggest show,
the biggest numbers.
Oh yes.

239
00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:21.880
Can you imagine that world tour?
Oh my God.
Fuck.

240
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.120
And it's his first fight at one 55 so he can sell that.
Look at this,

241
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.260
line them up with their hands out on their knees with their hands out.

242
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:32.800
I want them to beg me in front of the honorable,

243
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:37.390
that's a phantom convertible son that's about $400,000 for the car.

244
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.480
Damn.
Damn.

245
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.250
This guy is so fucking unusual.
He's so unusually dudes called him out.

246
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.370
But it's so crazy that an MMA,
it took what,
15

247
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.640
<v 1>fucking years of of of of MMA popularity.</v>

248
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.530
I mean Emma is 20 what is it,
22 years old now.
What does it,

249
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.370
when did it start at 93 three so it's 22 years,
right?
That's not 22 years.

250
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.610
We're both retarded.
Almost 24 okay.
So let's think about that.

251
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.260
In that time in life to pass,
I'd say it's really popular for like,

252
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.370
since like the early two thousands when navy,
not really six 2005 okay,

253
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:19.400
let's give it 10 years.
So in 10 years of real popularity,

254
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.580
this is the first guy that emerges like this,

255
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:27.020
this first like superstar,
besides Brock Lesnar.

256
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.570
Brock Lesnar is pretty much a superstar,
but it was a different thing.

257
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.570
He was like a superstar coming over correct from the wrestling.

258
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:35.210
So he just carried all those fans over.
They wanted to see if he could do it.

259
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.060
And plus you look at him,
he'd go,
Jesus fucking Christ.

260
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.090
Like that's the guy that you with.
When you think of cage fighting,

261
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.610
you would think of a guy who looks like that you got a sore tattooed on his

262
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:47.940
chest.
It's not the best story.
It's not a good one.
Ever did that.
Ever did that.

263
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.840
But um,
right when he left,

264
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.740
you gotta see this Dick I put on Lesnar's just it's great.
Yeah,
but Connor,

265
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.510
there's never been a dude like that.

266
00:15:56.511 --> 00:16:00.020
Just all of a sudden everyone's talking about them.
Everyone's captivated.

267
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.480
I agree.
And he pulls it off.
That's the craziest shit.
He goes.
He,

268
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:08.590
he bet Dana white that he would knock out Chad Mendez inside of four rounds.

269
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:12.500
He wanted to bet $3 million,
but he called the round.
He said the second round.

270
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.100
He said second one.
Yeah.
Well it's the same thing he did with,
with um,

271
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.460
although he said he's going to knock him out inside of two minutes when we laugh

272
00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:24.170
at it.
Come on Dustin poray first a worldclass opponent.
He's going,

273
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:26.700
I'm gonna knock you out in the first round.
It's crazy.
And everybody's like,
what?

274
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.590
Me Ma crack it.
But there's some monster fights out there waiting for him.

275
00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:33.650
I just think if I'm Conor Mcgregor's manager,

276
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.950
I'm doing what's best for his career.
Frankie's a tough fight.

277
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:40.150
I'm not saying he can't win at Frankie's a very tough fight.
And uh,

278
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.180
dos Anjos is the toughest fight,
but then you got Dhea is in the middle,

279
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.350
have 55 huge payday,
great matchup stuff for Connor.

280
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.850
That's the fight I take.
First of all,

281
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:54.050
how good did Nate Diaz look physically best?
We've seen them look ripped,

282
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.120
shredded,
full six pack,

283
00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.530
looked in tremendous shape and didn't even come close to winning in that fight.

284
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.100
I mean,
now we're throwing down in that fight.
John Johnson was beat.

285
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:08.870
He got beat inside the cage.
If you listened to his corner,
they go,
don't quit.

286
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:12.800
Stick with it.
There's still room and Adam quit screaming.
Mom quit.

287
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:17.680
What Henry Hoof says that sometimes the guys,
he yelled that out too.
Um,

288
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.580
um,
rumble and rumble was getting beat up by DC.
He was yelling,
don't quit.

289
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:25.640
Don't quit.
That is not what you need to hear.

290
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.530
Maybe someone needs to talk to him.
He's a fucking fantastic kickboxing coach,

291
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:33.140
but you can't even put that out.
That was never in the coach.

292
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.890
My coach has vocab quick camp cut out there.
You can't put that out.

293
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.630
I'll probably can't help it because it's probably what he's thinking.
Well,

294
00:17:41.631 --> 00:17:46.490
it's probably thinking don't quit true but a little too,

295
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.920
when Michael Johnson in that fight could see you starting to,

296
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.100
and then we'll sit and Ryan from

297
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.050
<v 0>just eating one twos when Nate was popping them and then doing this,
do,
oh shit.</v>

298
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:58.650
I just rang your bell.
He just standing in front of him.
He goes,
Oh shit.

299
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.350
And he's pointing right at his face.
You could see Michael Johnson was like,

300
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:04.070
I can't even feel frustrated happening because he shouldn't be here.

301
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.010
He shouldn't be stemmed from you.

302
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:08.310
So athletic and she would use an angle is using his wrestling.
He did none of it.

303
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.060
I think people underestimated Nadya's that's what I feel.
Horrible idea.

304
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.800
But that he was an underdog in that fight,

305
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.930
like a pretty good underdog again idiot.

306
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.200
I just don't think anybody who made the line went and watched him train.

307
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:23.280
If you see what a good shape he was in and how good his hands look,
Jesus Christ,

308
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.770
that's as good as he's ever looked.
But before he fell the rankings,

309
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.830
what was e five four,
it took all that time off.

310
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.700
Dos Anjos beat the shit out of them a year ago.
Beat the brakes off that,
that,

311
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.550
that one of the things that I was thinking about was how heavy he stands on that

312
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:38.850
front leg.
You know,
he stands real heavy on that front leg and they'll sign,

313
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.290
just just lighten that leg up.

314
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.200
He was lighting that leg up cause Nate fight southpaw,

315
00:18:43.201 --> 00:18:45.450
right and dos Anjos fight southpaw.

316
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.680
So it opens him up to that back leg kick and he was just chewing up the outside

317
00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:53.280
of that fucking front leg.
Conner definitely be the favorite.
If they fight.

318
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.303
Great fight though.

319
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.760
I'll talk shit talking because Karma is not going to be able to go up to Nate

320
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:05.330
Diaz and go
no,
but that might be a problem.
Yeah.

321
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.230
Nate Diaz might actually punch him in the mouth.

322
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.700
There's no way may be is it's going to allow that.
No,

323
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:16.610
for him.
He'll wait for him in front of his fucking door in the morning sun.

324
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.800
Like he'll find out what room he's in and he'll wait in front of the door and

325
00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:22.940
punched him in the face when he goes to get breakfast.
He really different.

326
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.480
So brilliant with his shit talking.

327
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.490
What is he going to think of like for Nate Diaz specifically?

328
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.870
Is he going to go cause he goes real deep.
He,
he goes right to the core.

329
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.423
He brings,

330
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.720
it won't work on d as though to want to know what a work and what won't work,

331
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:40.381
but I'll tell you what.

332
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:44.850
No one has gotten eight more emotional or no one has gotten a cowboy mo more

333
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:48.570
emotional than Nate.
When cowboy starts shit talking Nate and knocked his hat,

334
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.500
or rather when Nate starts shit talking cowboy and knocked his hat off,

335
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:53.334
he was getting his face.

336
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:57.510
You could tell it was fucking with cowboys like his mind and he was,

337
00:19:57.511 --> 00:20:00.060
he was really emotionally wrapped up in the first round,

338
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:01.500
that fight he talked about.
He's like,

339
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:05.710
I'll never let that happen again cause I got inside my head.
I fucked up and up.

340
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.490
But it's the fact that Nate can do that to you.
I agree.

341
00:20:08.491 --> 00:20:12.750
He makes you reluctant to do it to Connor.
I will just let them not to be liked.

342
00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:15.780
Watch a shark in epic.
That's why we need this fight.

343
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.680
The greatest show would be just Nate Diaz and Conor McGregor.

344
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:20.940
Just give them 30 minutes,

345
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:23.810
have like a mediator a little bit and just you'd have kind of just let them go.

346
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.260
Overeem and Ben Rothwell in between.
I'm

347
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.900
a realist.
Talk.
Tell Ben Rothwell and Overeem.
Look,

348
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:39.150
you got a big bonus coming to you.
I gotta Reebok money,
Reebok money.

349
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.460
They would finish this thought.
Let them kill each other.

350
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:45.990
Double Reebok for both of you.
How about,
but they were my age.

351
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.310
She just put a fucking right there.
Then
you just,

352
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.800
you gotta get up.
You got to somehow know that.

353
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.390
Make it so they can't hit each other.
You've got to say,
listen boys,

354
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:57.470
there is millions of dollars in line for security.

355
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.360
You can put a fence up and put them on either side of the fence and just let

356
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:05.890
them go.
No,
that would be fucking amazing.
That's not a bad idea.

357
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.610
Just let him talk to the marketing.
Can you imagine the market?

358
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.550
You have four bad ass security guards.

359
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.660
All blacks in between while they're talking about,
you know,

360
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.020
all black black uniforms.

361
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.820
Some Hawaiians,
big guys,

362
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:26.821
big Samoan looking will fucking snap various ones cause they don't get her to

363
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:30.730
agree.
You can't really hurt.
It's like Mark Hunt

364
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.480
any more than he was in his prime.

365
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.360
He put them on a phone like they're in a prison.
You know what I mean?

366
00:21:37.361 --> 00:21:39.790
With the glass.
They just talk to each other on the fucking phone.

367
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.500
That's not a bad idea.
It's a prison glass shift.
That is actually a good idea.

368
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.720
Eddie Bravo at too strong ideas.

369
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.550
The prison.
You know why?
You know why?

370
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:53.140
Cause you're the only one that's not high here.

371
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.010
We're on the same level.
I'm not feeling,
I'm feeling as ideas.

372
00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:05.530
I'm screaming at the fucking phone he met to meet Blue Fox is going to go.

373
00:22:08.831 --> 00:22:13.390
Yeah,
it's like a Josie is would be the host.
That'd be brilliant

374
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:21.000
ideas start off the my God hilarious dude.
But uh,

375
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:26.100
Diaz wants to speak fight cause he's getting paid 20 and 20 that is that real.

376
00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:29.710
Have we have we,
we,
we sure I'm positive.

377
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.660
That doesn't solve the payouts at the commission.

378
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.210
Now he might not want to and you might have on just flows bonus.

379
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.380
But as far as contractually that we know it's 2020 now I'm not blaming the UFC.

380
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:40.120
I be,
I don't know what it's gotten me.
I don't,

381
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.630
hopefully he's not in the tough contract.
That's bad management though.

382
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.471
That's horrible.

383
00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:47.680
Manager as big of a star as he is that motherfuckers should we get in at least

384
00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:51.550
one 21 20th fight?
Yeah,
I agree.
And more than that,
probably.

385
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.150
He didn't fight for awhile.
Nate Diaz is a giant star.
Let me tell you this,

386
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.900
when he went out into that arena,
they went fucking crazy.

387
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.840
That crowd went fucking crazy.

388
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.130
When Nate Diaz is like raising his arms after every round,
they went fucking,

389
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:08.910
who are we talking about?
Think about all the stars on the car.
Who,

390
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.840
who's the number one most top click guy right now?
That one can do that one guy.

391
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.820
Well,
his performance,
first of all,

392
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.480
was outstanding against a guy in Michael Johnson who is an up and coming

393
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.740
lightweight who's been really on a tear.
Michael Johnson's look fantastic.

394
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.370
I thought his fight with Ben Neale Dariusz was a kind of a questionable
decision.

395
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.910
He probably should have won it.
Yeah,
maybe you could see it maybe that way.

396
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.100
I'm a dairy.
I'm a big dairy.
Who?
Shit,
he's a monk.
Neal dairy,

397
00:23:34.101 --> 00:23:37.120
which is a bad motherfucker,
but I'll fight is a fight.
Right.
Great.

398
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.300
And why did Nate Diaz get that knee bar at the end?
He fucking had it and he had,

399
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.150
his time was over bro.
He all,
you need one fucking second.
No,
no,
no,

400
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.840
<v 1>no,
no.
It's totally,
totally off.
It was after the buzzer.
Yeah.</v>

401
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:54.290
He grabbed it and then the buzzer went and he extended Johnson.
He was saying,

402
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:56.810
I had your knee or something like that.
He's like,
fuck with them.

403
00:23:56.811 --> 00:24:00.340
The middle was way over,
homie.
I don't know.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Trust me,

404
00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.690
we watched it in the truck over and over again.
It's definitely,
it was okay.

405
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.450
And then here's all,
I love it.
And then John,
cause I was like,

406
00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:12.710
why did Johnson kick him?
And then I saw another angle is way I'm looking at him.

407
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.310
I'm looking at them from eye height.
Right?
So where my eyes are,

408
00:24:16.311 --> 00:24:18.260
that's where their body is on the other side of the cage.

409
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.240
I couldn't see the knee bar and I'm like,

410
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:22.820
why would Michael Johnson kicking into the fight is over?

411
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.190
And then I saw the whole thing.
I go,
oh,

412
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:29.810
he deserved it because he has the 400% he's home.
Nick didn't hurt him.

413
00:24:29.811 --> 00:24:33.650
I think he was just fucking with my further,
he was having a good time.
Look,

414
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.000
we're all talking about him,

415
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.200
but I wonder how much of v I wonder if you can get fined because

416
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.730
the FCC,
the FCC,
Rick,

417
00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.660
I was asking someone on online about this today cause it's like radio,

418
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.010
like there's raw,

419
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.760
there's rules now and I think a lot of them got passed after Howard stern

420
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.820
because what happened with Howard stern was Howard Stern.

421
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:59.570
He got fine for questionable subject matter,

422
00:24:59.571 --> 00:25:02.300
which is fucking insane.
And it's,

423
00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:06.500
it was one of the weirdest moments in like free speech time because really

424
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.950
everybody should have stood up and said something about it.
The New York,

425
00:25:09.951 --> 00:25:12.920
I mean every fucking magazine should have been talking about what a travesty it

426
00:25:12.921 --> 00:25:16.610
is that you're trying to stop a show that's on the radio than anybody could turn

427
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:19.460
one way or the other.
And he's not even swearing he's playing within your rules.

428
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.250
But for subject matter that they were finding him like huge money,

429
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.220
the subject matter,
whatever you talk about,

430
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:28.940
whenever anything sexual or anything they felt felt was offensive,

431
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.450
they were getting him on subject matter.
Super Weird rules.
Like you can just,

432
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.370
you can say Dick,
but if I say I put my dick in your mouth,
you get fined.

433
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.700
Do you know you can say Jesus,
but if you say Jesus Christ,

434
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.770
you're not supposed to.
Jesus Christ.

435
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:47.630
Like there was a tennis match where one of the,
um,
one of the kit,

436
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:51.140
there was like two people playing tennis and one of them had to forfeit the

437
00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:55.400
match because they said Jesus Christ,
when they missed Jesus Christ.
Exactly.

438
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.420
Like just saying that alone,
like I,
I saved it.

439
00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:02.600
It was so a story from years ago and I always wanted to do a bit about it,

440
00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:05.030
but I would get so mad when I would read it that I'm like,

441
00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:06.080
this isn't even gonna be funny.

442
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.780
There's nothing funny about a blessing in disguise though,

443
00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:12.760
because that was a big reason why he went to Syria.

444
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.870
Radius loves.
I just got an,
I had it for the last year.
I love it,

445
00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:21.650
man.
Just resigned a five year deal.
Huge.
Such a good show.

446
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.990
He has the best interviews because interviews are excellent man.

447
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.380
Lately it seems like he's bigger than ever.
She just keeps getting,

448
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:33.470
he's getting serious.
You can't get any stars to be interviewed.

449
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:36.830
I mean he's,
it's a DFS at that point.

450
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:40.280
Is the DSD get fined for that until late kick?
Don't know.

451
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.490
Well he didn't kick him.
Well that's right.

452
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.030
Johnson kicked holding that and he didn't hurt them with that,

453
00:26:45.031 --> 00:26:49.290
so that's super cool shit.
But the,
but the swearing on the air,

454
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.110
if you do it on purpose,
I think you can get in trouble.

455
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.210
I don't know what the rules are.
I'm just talking out my ass.

456
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:57.690
But I've been told click on live radio that if you,

457
00:26:57.691 --> 00:27:01.470
if you chose to swear on live radio,
if they went after you,

458
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:03.720
they could find you and they can find you a lot of money.

459
00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:07.410
Like hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
That's a bummer.

460
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.670
What's this dark man?

461
00:27:08.671 --> 00:27:12.510
It's just dark that they can take money from you and it goes where?
Where do you,

462
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.300
where's it go?

463
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.770
Does it go anywhere helpful or was it just takes that and up by your red tape.

464
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.250
Fucking overrun system.
What?
I mean,
where's that money go?

465
00:27:20.251 --> 00:27:21.540
You're just stealing money from me.

466
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.620
You're going to steal it and then pump it out into this machine.
Well,

467
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.670
it doesn't make any sense.
Even if they charge him,

468
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:27.960
I don't think he's gonna get fine.

469
00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:31.320
Let's say they find them $100,000 but he gets the Conor McGregor fight.

470
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.230
It's worth every penny.
Right?
Oh,
it's brilliant.
Brilliant.
Yeah,

471
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:37.110
it's probably worth it.
Some reason three dudes are calling condom out,

472
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:39.800
cause that's the payday.
That's the cash or other,
his brother with the,

473
00:27:39.801 --> 00:27:40.634
the pot charge,

474
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.800
they find them $165,000 and then they kept him out of fighting for five years.

475
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.950
That was the rule.
It's insane.
It's beyond silly.

476
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.200
Where do you see Tony Ferguson in that mix?

477
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.020
I could see Tony and he's right there.

478
00:27:55.070 --> 00:28:00.060
That's to the Barboza Fine Tony and cowboy dude.
He be Barboza.
Holy Shit.

479
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.530
Dude finished up that people are scared of Edson Barboza.

480
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:07.830
No one has confident when they go into that fight,
they're like,
oh shit.
He's got,

481
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:11.060
in my opinion,
the fastest kicks I've ever seen.
Barboza man,

482
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:15.060
100% he's so fast.
He's switch kick off his front leg.
Amazing.

483
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.340
It's the fastest switch kick I've ever seen in my life.

484
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:22.260
I've never seen anybody faster.
He's like a like 130 pound taekwondo guy.

485
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.800
Like a little tiny Korean guy that moves like lightning.
That's how good he is.

486
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:30.540
I can switch.
Kick is just,
it's insane.
It's like,
well it's fast.

487
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:35.210
I could see Tony and cowboy fight.
Fuck yeah.
That's a phenomenal tongs.

488
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.930
Ready for those guys right there.
100% I said 2016 is Tony's.
Yeah.

489
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.810
I think he's a guy where everyone's like,
fuck,
I don't want to fight that dude.

490
00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:45.600
He can't sleep on neuroma commando off either.
That fucking guy.

491
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:47.430
If he can get help on him cause he's not healthy.

492
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.650
But if he can get healthy and he could figure out a way to stop,

493
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:53.160
they get injured like he does to me.
They get,
the last one was a rib,

494
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.740
which you can't really control,
but the knees,
he's,

495
00:28:55.741 --> 00:28:59.040
he's done his knees a couple of times now and I think he's done his knees.
Um,

496
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:03.120
after surgery.
I think he hurt his knee,
got it fixed and then heard again,

497
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.790
which is never good.
So people are a little bummed out if he's healthy.

498
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.180
Remember he slammed the champ around like Gus Antos.
Yeah,
he broke him.

499
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:13.890
He just tossed them around,

500
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.620
just did whatever he wanted to and once it got ahold of him,
he's a nightmare.

501
00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.000
If he gets healthy,
they're all fun.

502
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.600
It's almost though like he's too tough for his joints,
you know,

503
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.120
it's almost like he's his,
his style so hard and he put,

504
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.920
he's got so much fucking strength and technique and it's so much torque.

505
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.390
Like when he rag dolls guys,
it's a very unique kind of rat dose of Rag Dong.

506
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.530
It's also Lee's rag down guys and no one rag dolls.
I agree.

507
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.390
Like when he ragdolled dos Anjos that was like,
whoa.

508
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.870
Like I ain't never seen anybody do this to dos Anjos and sane man Clegg.

509
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:43.540
We'd have beat him,

510
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.140
but he'd got a broken jaw and clay finished him with his jaw broken cause club

511
00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:50.020
member.
A clay was doing like an arm triangle.
Yes,
and he he,

512
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.530
he had a broken jaw and he just says the Russian you're talking about?
No,
no,
no,

513
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:56.240
no.
Joe Santos,
but I was in Denver think so.

514
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.960
We're talking about number of Madoff.
Habib number.

515
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:03.370
Good man off the way he ragdolled he beat him.
He just threw him around.

516
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:06.880
Man beat is that threw him around.
How long ago was that?
Two years.
Two years.

517
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:08.950
The champ.
The same thing.
New Champion.
Yeah.

518
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.610
It was the last last loss on dosign [inaudible] no one wants to fight him and

519
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.400
you got to remember cowboy was supposed to fight them.
Who else has he fine,

520
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.000
but I got to say,
I don't think that dos Santos is the same dose sign.

521
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.980
Just we're looking at,
and I agree 100% his,

522
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:25.810
his strength and conditioning program is fucking gnarly.
He looked phenomenal.

523
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.720
You've got to talk to nick,
curse on,
you should have him on your podcast.

524
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.570
He's that speed of sport guy.
He works with Fabricio over doom,

525
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.640
rue salon providing a cough.
He works with a lot of Olympic athletes.
Oh,

526
00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.610
person's tell me about him.
Yeah,
and Joe Shillings working with them now too.

527
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.970
He Ha he has these guys doing all these crazy plyometric drills.

528
00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.230
Everyone swears by him.

529
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.580
Did I tell you I had this guy in and I talked to him and I was super impressed.

530
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:48.940
Huh?

531
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.870
Super impressed with his knowledge with is understanding and with his philosophy

532
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.240
and I was like,
what is the big difference?
Like what do you,
what do you,

533
00:30:55.241 --> 00:30:58.360
what's the most important thing?
He's like foot strength.
I was like,
whoa.

534
00:30:59.080 --> 00:30:59.471
He's like,

535
00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:03.340
it's all about covering distance and all about the ability to move and balance

536
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.240
in movements and it's all about figuring out how to close the distance quicker.

537
00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:09.580
And he was saying that when he fought pedis they'll sign.

538
00:31:09.581 --> 00:31:11.950
Joss was just that much quicker at every exchange.

539
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.630
He pulled the trigger that much faster,

540
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.600
landed that much faster and he's like get over the course of a fight.

541
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:18.730
Even though he's only that much better over the course of the fight,

542
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.630
that adds up.
You get fucked up.
And that's what you saw last night though,

543
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:25.000
Sandra [inaudible] who just jumped the gun.
He was just there.

544
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:29.200
I think it's a combo things I think talking,
you know,
no knowing,

545
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:32.050
knowing cowboy,
as long as I've known him,
he,
he just,

546
00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:35.530
and he even said it in his post fight interview,
he just said,
listen,

547
00:31:35.531 --> 00:31:38.020
I didn't show up.
And in this business,
when you don't show up to work,

548
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:39.730
you don't feel like fighting,
get your ass whooped.

549
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:44.470
So I think he didn't feel like fighting.
He said that he's been there before too,

550
00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:47.740
man.
He's been there before and he ended up Kale and dudes.

551
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.300
Cowboys always had a problem in the back.

552
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.220
The reason I didn't like this for cowboy is because of the time off cowboy.

553
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.810
An Act of guys who didn't have to think about it.
You give him six months,

554
00:31:55.811 --> 00:31:57.580
that's trouble for cowboy.
You know,
man,

555
00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.760
I don't know if any of that would have mattered the way dos Anjos pulled the

556
00:32:00.761 --> 00:32:04.390
trigger.
I agree 100%.
I think Dos dos Anjos looked phenomenal.

557
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.070
But I do have to say that,
um,
there has to be some,

558
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.060
some sense made out of when fights gets stopped and when fights don't get

559
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:15.370
stopped.
I'm not saying that fight shit had been stopped,

560
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.150
but I am saying the Chris Weidman versus Luke Rockhold should have been stopped.

561
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.260
I agree.
I think we have to figure out how,
what is the win?

562
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.660
What's the win?
I mean I don't know when it is,

563
00:32:25.661 --> 00:32:30.661
but I felt like cowboy was covering up and eating shots and although I'm not

564
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.120
unhappy with the stoppage,
like I didn't protest it.
I was like,
man,

565
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:38.110
I don't know it is for a title,
but referees there he sees what he sees.
I don't,

566
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.050
um,
there's a giant difference between doing that.

567
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.530
And then what was happening at the end of the round where Rockhold was mounted

568
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:49.160
on Weidman and just beating his brains and I agree that was bad.

569
00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.000
Well the fact that felt to me like I was like Jesus Christ and I even,

570
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.030
I think I even said,
what does it take to stop fighting?
I agree because it,

571
00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:58.340
he's shots.
Can he take the,
the thing is with cowboy,

572
00:32:58.341 --> 00:33:02.990
why at least her Bullock talked to his coach leaser bowling and he goes,
man,

573
00:33:02.991 --> 00:33:06.050
he think he was stopped early.
And I said,
I don't,

574
00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:08.630
because cowboys man the game long enough.

575
00:33:08.631 --> 00:33:11.810
He knows when he's in turtle like that and he's getting punched.

576
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:14.720
Cowboy knows man,
that's they're going to stop.
They go,

577
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.840
they give you one do something or I'm going to stop the fight.
Right.

578
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:22.040
If cowboy would just roll to guard and manage distance or grabbed him,
you know,

579
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:23.690
and control them,
the fight would have carried on.

580
00:33:23.691 --> 00:33:27.560
But when I don't see cowboy responding,
I don't want to say he wanted out,

581
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:31.490
but he knows what's going on.
Trust me,
I've,
I shoot like that happen.

582
00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:32.750
So when he's covering up,

583
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.710
you think what he really should have been doing is moving and scrambling.

584
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.350
He should just show.
So by just staying there and covering up,

585
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:43.340
he basically invited yes.
Stoppage.
Yes.
I'm not saying he wanted out.

586
00:33:43.341 --> 00:33:47.150
He might have been hurt.
He probably was her and it's kind of like,
you know,
man,

587
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.310
they come in the back of there.
Listen,
if I tell you to move,

588
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.910
I'm close to stopping it.
Right.
And you can hear it clear as day.

589
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.340
Like my last fight with Travis Browne,
I turned the Rep,

590
00:33:55.341 --> 00:33:56.960
I said I'm fine because I know he's going to,

591
00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.000
I know where it's going to get stopped.

592
00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:01.910
I know when I'm in trouble and they're about stop it.
I turned my go.
I'm good.

593
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.990
It's tough man.
Yeah.
And so cowboys has so much experience.

594
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.450
If you just went to guard,
you would have bought him some time.

595
00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:09.940
But tell you what man,
he,

596
00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:14.970
he had to be wrong because go San Joe's just teed off on it to the body that

597
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:16.940
need of the body was nasty.

598
00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:20.750
And then the kick and then he on corks in cowboy said the kick didn't land.

599
00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.120
I think he means the kicked didn't hurt him.
It definitely landed,

600
00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.960
landed hundred percent.
But I think he meant it didn't hurt him.

601
00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:30.560
I thought he said the knee is what did it.
I think the knee like really hurt him.

602
00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.260
And then the kicker was just icing on the cake.
It wasn't,
you know,

603
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.640
wasn't what put them away.

604
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:39.410
But that barrage of punches to or he's fucking terrifying.
Terrifying man.

605
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.770
You know what's cool about him too?
We watched him get better.

606
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:44.480
Like we saw him against Jeremy Stevens.

607
00:34:44.481 --> 00:34:48.440
He got Kod against Jeremy starts phone too in the UFC.
Yeah.
I mean he's a,

608
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:51.140
he's a guy who's just fucking kept on work.

609
00:34:51.141 --> 00:34:55.570
He's the nicest guy in the world.
When I was in Brazil,
man,
I'm telling,

610
00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.370
no one gave me the time of day.
This dude took me around,

611
00:34:58.371 --> 00:35:00.530
introduced me to different jails.
Great Dude,
man.

612
00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:05.120
I've talked to him many times backstage.
She's so calm and polite,
friendly.

613
00:35:05.121 --> 00:35:08.630
He's got like,
he's at peace,
you know,
like he's like,
he's an interesting guy.

614
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.810
Like he's like,
he's just like,
you know,
just trying to heal my knee up,

615
00:35:11.811 --> 00:35:15.290
trying to get him to,
when you root for,
if you know that you root for him to win,

616
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.090
I took,
not that I took heat and I say this,
whether the Brazilian or not,

617
00:35:20.091 --> 00:35:23.760
I say the x factors and this is everyone and it's not dos Angeles.

618
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.090
I never said those Angeles was on stuff.

619
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.230
But to me when I was picking Dos Anjos and cowboy I said the x factor is if

620
00:35:30.231 --> 00:35:31.250
someone was taking shit,

621
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:34.790
we're going to see different fighters now it can be for cowboy or dos Anjos but

622
00:35:34.791 --> 00:35:37.650
that's all around the board.
I'm not saying anything new.

623
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.630
If steroids wasn't an issue,

624
00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.780
a performance enhancing drugs when an issue the UFC want to implement it.

625
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:45.420
The strictest drug testing ever in the history of sports.

626
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.740
It's true and I want to say something um,

627
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.600
without implicating anyone k cause this subject gets brought up a lot.

628
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.750
All the people were always like you guys are talking shit and you don't know

629
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:55.590
what you're talking about.

630
00:35:55.770 --> 00:36:00.510
Let me just say that everyone behind the scenes,

631
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.270
all the trainers,
all the coaches,
all the managers,

632
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.320
everyone is having this conversation.

633
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:09.360
These conversations that we're having on this podcast are not unique in that

634
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:13.170
sense.
These are not ideas that we have.
These are not theories that we have.

635
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:13.950
Look Jay,

636
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.970
Jeff Novitsky is sniffing up these dude's ass is and he's not playing games.

637
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:20.970
And why do you think that is?
Because the EOC was like,
you know what?

638
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:24.180
Let's just make it the strictest drug testing of all time.
Hell No.

639
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.740
There was a real problem then.
Well,

640
00:36:25.741 --> 00:36:29.280
there's definitely a real problem or was a real problem,
but the,

641
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.710
the idea that it's only us that's talking about it,

642
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:35.280
it's crazy because we're the only ones talking about it as publicly as we do,

643
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.090
but behind the scenes is a constant conversation.
Oh,

644
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:41.670
anytime I talked to anyone that game,
it's the conversation.

645
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.400
When we get done here,
I'll text from coaches other five.

646
00:36:44.401 --> 00:36:46.830
We can't even name names where there's sometimes people come up to us and

647
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:47.371
they'll say,

648
00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:50.040
someone's going to have a hard time because he's off the shit 100% and then

649
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.530
they'll go in there and they'll get crushed and we'll go,
whoa,

650
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.300
this is nuts and dot.
The thing is with with all that,

651
00:36:55.301 --> 00:36:56.310
I took so much shit for that.

652
00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.550
You've got to realize he was the fighter at the present time.

653
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:01.740
When we're talking about this,
I'm not singling out though.

654
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.990
I never said all those on steroids.
I said,

655
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:06.570
there's some things to me that were suspicious.
Never.

656
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.150
What he's done for the sport is great.
He's one of my favorite fighters.

657
00:37:09.151 --> 00:37:12.090
He's phenomenal.
Whether he's on shit or not,
it doesn't matter.

658
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.550
My favorite fighter of all time was probably on shit.

659
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:18.180
Vandelays like if I had to choose like one guy who had the most fun watching the

660
00:37:18.181 --> 00:37:21.630
Vandelay and the pride days,
he was a Goddamn Berzerker.

661
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:25.210
Every fight you'd fucking back rabid pillows.
Me.

662
00:37:25.211 --> 00:37:30.000
How many times did we watch Vandelay fight in pride?
Just screaming like Cro,
cop,

663
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.300
Cro,
cop.
My favorite fighter of all time.
He just got busted last week.

664
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.790
Yeah and he got busted.
Yeah,
he got busted too.

665
00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.970
Why do you suppose the Japanese didn't care about steroids?

666
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.960
They wanted you on steroids cause you haven't performed.

667
00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.300
Why want a free shot better?
They want the freak show too.

668
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.590
Well they also want you to fight like crazy.

669
00:37:46.591 --> 00:37:49.880
They want you to fight like a wild man.
They don't want you to win like a,

670
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.950
like a really close decision.
They don't want you to do that.

671
00:37:52.951 --> 00:37:56.290
They want you to go out fucking Vandelay style where shogun style are named just

672
00:37:56.291 --> 00:37:59.550
style.
They want you to go out on your shield and they wanted you on steroids.

673
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.050
They literally wanted you on.

674
00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:03.240
So we know when we have a friend that went over there to,

675
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:07.860
they offered him a fight at 185 pounds.
He's like,
I fight at one 55 now we know.

676
00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.360
They're like,
dude,
you got some shit that's going to fix that.
Said,

677
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.100
how much do you weigh now?
He's like won like 71 75 goes,

678
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.170
you have a good frame for a oneness 85

679
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:24.060
I'm terrible.
Yeah,
that's a good boy.
It's great.

680
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:30.000
But 75 you have to do it.

681
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:32.760
It's like Bobby Lee's act.

682
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:37.210
You can be one 85 no problem.
No,

683
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.870
Bobby Lee do his dad.
That's what he does.
He ask God everything.

684
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:45.010
Um,
but you,
you want to talking about pds,

685
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:49.370
especially when you're talking about Overeem Endo,
Santos,
oh yeah,
man,

686
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:51.940
Overeem was on some shit.
We all know this.

687
00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:53.530
So it was a hundred percent hundred percent.

688
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:56.540
So the x factor was when he got caught.
Yes,
it's,
yeah.

689
00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.100
I'm not saying anything that's not out there.
So the x factor was how,

690
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:01.780
like what kind of room are we going to get?

691
00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:05.620
I'm still a big fan of over like telling you why I'm a huge fan and you know,

692
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:07.240
people think that because you,
here's the thing,

693
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:11.170
like if there's this other sports where if you accuse the guy cheating,

694
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.180
everybody hates that guy.
Like you know,

695
00:39:13.181 --> 00:39:17.260
people will talk about certain athletes that that got caught doing something and

696
00:39:17.261 --> 00:39:19.930
then people go,
fuck that guy,
man.
He's fucking cheater.

697
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.840
Like I heard the dude's talking about what was the deflate gate guy?

698
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.230
What's his name?
Tom Brady.
Tom Brady.
But he's a fucking cheater.
He's a cheater.

699
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.400
Nobody gives a fuck in MMA.
They don't give a fuck.
They know.

700
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.480
But they want to know cause we're all suspicious.

701
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.590
Like why does over him look so much different?
Safety.
God say it,

702
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:39.550
but even forget it or not.
He's fucking awesome dude.
It's phenomenal.

703
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:43.030
I was so impressed with Overeem on Saturday night.
That was a tough guy.

704
00:39:43.031 --> 00:39:46.090
Damn fight.
And did you see the thing was doing the Wim Hoff method.

705
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.200
He got in 40 degree water for 30 minutes and he's,
he's breathing.
He's over him.

706
00:39:50.201 --> 00:39:51.910
Hoff Co coaching.
I'm,
yeah,
Jesus.

707
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:56.911
I didn't see the Wim Hoff is from Holland as is and they got together and he's

708
00:39:57.011 --> 00:40:00.580
like teaching them these methods to optimize his body and I'll tell you what
man,

709
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:03.220
just talking to Wim Hoff makes you feel like you can go run around naked in the

710
00:40:03.221 --> 00:40:05.730
snow.
I listen to that shit.
I started holding my breath.
He's a man.

711
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.460
He's a motherfuck.
What is that?
What techniques do you use?

712
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.540
I use the breathing technique before I go on stage.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

713
00:40:11.541 --> 00:40:15.820
I do it for about 10 minutes before I go on stage.
I get high as fuck.
Whoa,
crazy.

714
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:20.390
You get like oxygen high taking you taking,

715
00:40:20.391 --> 00:40:24.880
did you take a gigantic breath and you only let out like half of it and then you

716
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:27.850
have flooded up again.
You take the biggest breath you can.

717
00:40:27.851 --> 00:40:30.220
You only let out a little bit of it and you keep doing that.

718
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:31.570
You keep doing that for minutes.

719
00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:36.130
I do for two minutes at a time and then he stopped.
I mean stage.
Yeah,

720
00:40:36.131 --> 00:40:38.830
like five minutes before.
So like right before.

721
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:43.070
So easy and yet so yes,
he is.

722
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.340
Shit ever.
I like special,

723
00:40:45.341 --> 00:40:50.080
weird and breathing is just gigantic breasts.
That's it.
Can you,

724
00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.350
can you do the easiest shit for three minutes and still,
I don't know it.
I do it.

725
00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:56.170
If I start feeling sick to avoiding a feel rundown or something like that,

726
00:40:56.171 --> 00:40:57.050
I'll do it for a few minutes,

727
00:40:57.051 --> 00:40:59.200
so I'll just sit down and do it for like two minutes.
You know what?

728
00:40:59.201 --> 00:41:00.730
I really started doing it seriously too.

729
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.670
I started doing it after you and I talked about on the phone when you go like,

730
00:41:03.671 --> 00:41:05.560
have you been doing that Wim Hoff method?
I go,
Nah.

731
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:10.180
And you were saying the same thing.
We're so lazy.
Nobody does it.
I said,
yeah,

732
00:41:10.181 --> 00:41:12.580
you know what?
I'm going to start doing it before shows.

733
00:41:12.581 --> 00:41:17.080
I just do it before shows.
Oh my God,
I love it.
I had a dude off Abbot Kinney,
big,

734
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:21.550
big dude bald.
He goes,
Bro,
listen to Rogan's podcast with,
what's the dude's name?

735
00:41:21.551 --> 00:41:25.480
Wim Hof,
Wim Hoff.
He goes,
hey man,
what are you doing tomorrow morning?
I'm like,

736
00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.150
you know,
I got shit to do,
man.
He goes,
well,

737
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:31.030
every morning at four 30 we meet on the beach and we do these breathing

738
00:41:31.031 --> 00:41:33.690
techniques.
Oh yeah.
Cool.
See you there man

739
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:38.390
<v 0>for 30 fuck no.
Oh,</v>

740
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:43.070
can you scale to me for never?
Yeah,
why don't you get in the water pussy?
Yeah,

741
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.810
I think they do.
I think they do.
Yeah.

742
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:46.790
They do that breathing shit and they're so cold.

743
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.180
That water in the Pacific and the woods.
Good.
So cold.
Feels fucking good.

744
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.390
I don't like water.
My eyes though.
Does it salt water?

745
00:41:53.391 --> 00:41:56.870
Fuck with your eyes hardcore.
No,
Yoga does.
That's interesting.

746
00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:00.890
In the square care products,
do you have haircare care?
No.
Real?
No,

747
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.150
I don't do this.
Yeah.
You know,
when I used to fuck with me,
hard dude,

748
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.230
when I used to do fear factor,

749
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:09.410
I used to put your sunscreen on so I'd have sunscreen in my head and then I

750
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:12.920
would go on stage that night and the sunscreen would drip because I would sweat

751
00:42:12.921 --> 00:42:17.210
on stage.
Some Korean,
you drip in your eyes and it's fucking fire.
It's awful.

752
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.160
That shit burns.
It's really bad for your eyes to like fuck with your vision.

753
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.890
It's super bad for like,
I sweat so much during yoga.

754
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.150
All the sweat gets in my eyes.

755
00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:29.480
So for the for like the next day I'm like blink trying to get it out.

756
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.840
That's normal.
No,
I definitely get swept my eyes.

757
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:37.320
But sweat is just like so much better than sweat with uh,
with sunscreen.
Yeah.

758
00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:39.890
That's going to burn.
Yeah,
man.
Um,
I think that uh,

759
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:44.150
that whole getting in the ocean thing like is probably something people have

760
00:42:44.151 --> 00:42:48.020
been doing forever to refresh their body.
Like,
I think it's instinctive.

761
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.500
Like th you know how they do those ice plunges,
those people,
those younger,

762
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.340
were there people part of the polar bear club?
My aunt does that shit.

763
00:42:55.341 --> 00:42:57.290
Polar bear club in San Francisco son.

764
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.900
You know how it feels when you get out of that a Cryo tank.

765
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.270
You feel fucking amazing,
man.
I feel amazing.

766
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.050
And I think now mix that with the ocean.

767
00:43:04.051 --> 00:43:08.600
There's energy in the ocean and it's cold.
I love it,
man.
It's the oceans alive.

768
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:13.780
Did you see that video in San Francisco Bay right next to the dock?

769
00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:17.770
A shark.
Merck's a seal.
Berkshire.
Merck's.

770
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.800
It just leaves this gigantic puddle,
but I'm just like a movie scene.

771
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:26.430
The shark comes out of the water with the seal and it's a big gesture.
Yeah.

772
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:30.980
Jamie.
Jamie,
play this thing.
Yeah.
It's like all these fucks.
Clam chowder.

773
00:43:30.981 --> 00:43:34.520
12 foot shark.
Right?
So shoot.
It's watched it.
Watch this.
Damn.

774
00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:37.310
He had a right on cue.
Yeah.
Watch this.
This is fucking a mate.
Jamie's the,

775
00:43:37.311 --> 00:43:40.490
we'll get the binge.
I mean,
come on,
sign and look at all that blood.

776
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.200
But he gets away.
Oh yeah.
The little seals like not today,
motherfucker.

777
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:48.970
He's dead now.
He's,
you'll see eating like crazy.
Oh no,
he's in trouble.
Shark.

778
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.520
Probably just bit a giant chunk.
Adam sees on the top,
he's dead.

779
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:56.150
Look all the blood,
not doc.
He gets a lei.
I understand,

780
00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:59.210
but look at all that block.
I mean he's not going anywhere.
He's,

781
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:03.620
he's kind of moving away a little,
but he's not going.
I appreciate the effort.

782
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:06.020
Could Lord look at that puddle?
I agree.

783
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:10.220
Look at all these fucks running over from the clam chowder.
Oh yeah man.

784
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:14.150
I would be,
I'd be like,
oh shoot that's all I want to see in life.
Fuck.

785
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.830
I'd love to see something like that.

786
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.640
So crazy that it's right there and that's what,
that's just,

787
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:22.090
it opens your eyes as to what that's really like cause we,

788
00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.260
if we were just outside of the woods right and you would sit in your outlook,

789
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:31.010
he hits him again,
boom look at this and now he's dead.
Okay now he's dead.

790
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.270
He's been dead.
I think that things just wiggling.

791
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.810
Well he's kind of doing the damn thing.
Thing is going to get away with one fin.

792
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:41.370
I wonder what is happening.
Maybe like lets it go or like Oh my God look at this.

793
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.840
We're watching this folks and this is like maybe 30 feet away from people.

794
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:49.620
It looks like jaws 30 he's getting away though and,
but then he gets,
we don't,

795
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:52.840
I don't know what's happening there.
I just see some motion,
motion and harder.

796
00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.350
Do you think he is 100% do you think he's,

797
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.680
there's more than one seal just doesn't seem like that thing could bleed that

798
00:44:58.681 --> 00:45:02.220
much luck.
He's up here now.
You know what more there might be a bunch of seals,

799
00:45:02.221 --> 00:45:06.450
Joe.
He must be just checking seals.
Oh God.

800
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.070
That's insane.
Never gets old.
It never gets old to that seal.
Looks so little.

801
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:12.930
Do that again Jamie.
Like watch how he's,

802
00:45:12.931 --> 00:45:15.600
he's got it in his mouth when he flies out of the water.

803
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.630
I think there's way better footage than that.

804
00:45:18.631 --> 00:45:21.900
It's just in South Africans just go yes,

805
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.510
but clam chowder.
Shark attack.
Yeah,

806
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.740
but I'm saying is like if better like here,
watch this.
Watch this one more time.

807
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:32.580
Watch this up close thing.
Boom little it is.
See how little it is.

808
00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.460
It looks like a puppy and there's blood everywhere

809
00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:41.280
like a puppy because maybe we just can't tell because of the,
no,
it's too,

810
00:45:41.281 --> 00:45:43.470
it's so little.
Look how little we'll go one more time.

811
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.500
It's so little in his mouth.
Like watch when it comes out of the water,

812
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:49.290
it's got it in his mouth.
See that?
Look at that.
That's a little,

813
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:53.310
that thing's dead as fuck.
Look at all that blood.
Can't get enough of it.

814
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.340
I think that there's probably a gang of them in there and he's just swimming

815
00:45:56.341 --> 00:46:00.870
around jacking him just fucking full on buffet.
Golden could just eat.

816
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:03.940
I don't think they've stopped getting hungry.
He's probably just eat.

817
00:46:03.941 --> 00:46:08.880
Is there any like ultimate footage it could pop throw up like from South Africa?

818
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:10.043
Oh yeah.

819
00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:15.460
There's some shit like crazy be flying out of the [inaudible] away from a

820
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.780
hundred people just sitting there watching.

821
00:46:18.781 --> 00:46:22.590
I'm Sherman's wharf chilling and this fucking great whites next to you.

822
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.480
But like I was saying,
like if you looked in your backyard,

823
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:29.510
your backyard was right there and you watched some crazy like crocodile tearing

824
00:46:29.851 --> 00:46:33.780
apart a zebra rec right in your backyard.
You'd be like,
what the fuck?

825
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:37.710
I'm not going out there.
Absolutely.
But people like,
let's go in the ocean,

826
00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:41.130
let's go swimming around.
Hey.
You know,
and I Love My,
I love surfing.

827
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.870
I love surfing cause it makes the,

828
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.750
well I'm standing on look a lot like seals and sharks eat.

829
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:51.750
Get my flippers in arms look like flippers.

830
00:46:51.751 --> 00:46:54.710
When I'm lying on a surfboard,
I wear all black.

831
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.180
I like to wear a wetsuit because it looks like a seal.

832
00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.200
Like Mother Nature,
like looks out for me man,

833
00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:08.340
that you think they'd make the wetsuits white or something.
Oh my God.

834
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:13.200
Jesus Christ.
That is scary.
Fucking animals.

835
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:16.400
Nothing scarier than that.
Nothing that could,
that Jesus.

836
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.880
And it's really easy to get those shots.
They're just,
I mean,
they're everywhere.

837
00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:25.580
And so what they're doing is they're dragging a fake.
See that?

838
00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:30.760
A fake seal that they pull in water sharks like who caught up in the water?

839
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:35.320
Oh good Lord.
Oh I want to do something like that,
man.

840
00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:38.560
Fuck South Africa's Oh shit.
Fuck that.

841
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:43.510
Jesus Christ.
Quickly you would,
you would die.
He died.

842
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.930
<v 1>Is that where the show him?
He does.
He's an idiot.
Do to be good.
Way to go.</v>

843
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:50.440
It'd be a dope way to go.
Are you kidding me?
Way to go,
Bro.

844
00:47:50.441 --> 00:47:52.400
I'm going to go like this.
Mad.

845
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:57.010
You're like 85 and they take you out there in a little boat.
A little boat.

846
00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.830
When did they first feel will realize that they jumped out of the water?

847
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.760
I want to say that that wasn't that long ago like like a couple of decades ago.

848
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:07.210
I think there's just rumors that sharks jumped out of the last hit shark week

849
00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:10.550
like two years ago.
We're like,
holy fuck,
they can fly.

850
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:15.130
I don't think they really necessarily,
wouldn't it be crazy?
How about this?

851
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.650
Wouldn't it be crazy if they just started doing it recently?

852
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:20.980
Like you know how we always like to think of human evolution and we think of

853
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:24.400
human evolution as being like something that is like completely and totally

854
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.960
unique.
Like we got really smart.

855
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:28.600
We figured out cable and the Internet and no other animals are ever going to

856
00:48:28.601 --> 00:48:31.570
figure that out.
But what they're starting to say now about chimpanzees,

857
00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:34.290
and it was a theory about this,
that um,
these,
these are,

858
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:38.230
these scientists were debating whether or not chimpanzees are beginning to enter

859
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:39.340
into the stone age.

860
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:44.110
Meaning whether or not chimpanzees are starting to experiment with tools to the

861
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:47.260
point where it can be thought of as a natural trait and whether or not they're

862
00:48:47.261 --> 00:48:52.090
going to start teaching each other that we know that human beings at one point

863
00:48:52.091 --> 00:48:55.090
in time used to be some sort of an ancient primate.

864
00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:00.300
And we evolved and we developed and we grew and we became what we are today,

865
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.690
right?
We know we weren't this way.
No.
Oh,
was 4 million years ago.

866
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.940
We became this over time.

867
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.760
Why would we assume that other animals are doing the same thing?

868
00:49:09.761 --> 00:49:12.880
And if they are doing the same thing,
we're seeing that right now at champs.

869
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.000
Imagine if we're seeing that shit with sharks too.
Imagine if they go,

870
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:17.470
you know what?
It looks cool as fuck dude.

871
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:21.760
When you jack a seal and fly out of the ocean just to let those cons,
no,

872
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:24.340
look at me.
You pitch calm,
surf.

873
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.770
It's like,
think about like what things people do to show off.

874
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.980
Like those flips that those BMX bikers do.
I agree.

875
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:36.100
Couldn't do that 10 years ago or 20 years ago,
they didn't do it.
Nobody did it.

876
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.660
All of a sudden they do it well.

877
00:49:37.661 --> 00:49:40.120
These fucking sharks are starting to jump out of the water.

878
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:43.480
What if like it was like 10 years ago,
they just didn't do it.

879
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.150
What if one shark did it and the other sharks were like,
oh,

880
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:49.480
sharks shark got a lot of shark pussy and the other sharks.

881
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.160
Like I got to start doing that too.

882
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.750
<v 0>Talking some smoked yourself retarded.</v>

883
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:03.410
It wouldn't be the first time.
Did you see that this year?
Conspiracy theory,

884
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:07.190
there's a visual that I just saw last week on Facebook.

885
00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.080
He had like a Zillion gazillion views,

886
00:50:09.081 --> 00:50:13.260
but there's a monkey sitting in front of a screen with all these squares and a

887
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.660
sequence of numbers.

888
00:50:14.661 --> 00:50:18.500
One through 10 pops up in the squares and you see it all mixed up just for a

889
00:50:18.501 --> 00:50:22.610
flash.
And the chimp goes,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine,

890
00:50:22.611 --> 00:50:26.570
10 I couldn't do it.
Now I don't know if it's a hoax.
I was trying to do it,

891
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.620
but I remember I couldn't put them in order.
But the monkeys apparently,

892
00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:32.300
unless it's a hoax video,
it could be.

893
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:37.470
It says chimps have a better short term memory then humans are,

894
00:50:37.551 --> 00:50:39.350
it's just me because I couldn't do it.

895
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.940
They figured out how to do it to get food and they teach them these sequences

896
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:46.940
over a long period of time that she's your mad to do it and then they know

897
00:50:46.941 --> 00:50:48.900
they're going to get food,
but they've been doing it for awhile.

898
00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:53.150
And then I give him a treat.
Dude,

899
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:56.630
you remember when that dumb bitch and a patch a Pansy,
but look at the code.

900
00:50:56.631 --> 00:50:58.670
It's just one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine.

901
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:04.010
It's not like some super secret code.
Watch the beginning.
See it's one,
two,

902
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:07.040
two oh well here's what's going on though.
They block out the number.

903
00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:10.010
So you can't see what the numbers are exactly first.
But look at it.

904
00:51:10.011 --> 00:51:10.791
At first he does it,

905
00:51:10.791 --> 00:51:15.791
you see the numbers and then they do it again and then they hide the nub.

906
00:51:15.921 --> 00:51:18.560
They show it to him briefly for a moment and then they hide the numbers.

907
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:21.800
Look how fast,
look at this.
I couldn't have done that.
I wouldn't have done it.

908
00:51:21.801 --> 00:51:26.730
You know that that's challenging.
It's still true.
The human.
Yeah.

909
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.730
And it's in different orders guys.
Two different order.
Look,

910
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.440
get the wash that type shit.
Watch him walking on the tight bro.
Watch this again.

911
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.050
This is what's bananas.

912
00:51:35.051 --> 00:51:38.930
Watch and walk on this fucking telephone cord or whatever.
They're terrifying.

913
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.540
They're terrifying.
That planet of the ape shit.

914
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:44.820
Oh imagine they got just smart enough to be like those things and planting the,

915
00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:47.990
you got to take him out before that happens.
Oh,
we'd have to take 'em out.
Uh,

916
00:51:47.991 --> 00:51:52.540
remember that.
Remember that lady who had like the boyfriend chimpanzee,
she,

917
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:54.920
he was chilling in a robe and shit drinking wine.

918
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:58.610
And then one day he said Nah bitch ripped her face off her face,

919
00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.940
her friend's face.
Cause her problems cost rocking.
That's what it is.

920
00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:04.780
I think that chimp was getting some pussy.
That's what I think's happened.

921
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.790
100% Shanken is banging him.
What are you doing over there?

922
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:11.680
Eddie Bravo on the microphone.
Chocolate with Bacon and it here.

923
00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:15.790
Well that sounds good.
Definitely not opening it on the money.
I need.

924
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:18.320
I need a pair of scissors.
You got you teeth man.

925
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:23.030
I tried to steal paper so that,
so with that lady.
I see.

926
00:52:23.031 --> 00:52:27.560
I thought it was heard.
I got fucked up.
Oh Shit.
Powerful teeth bite.

927
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:31.610
Bite in and man,
I'm good.
I'm good.
Let's just take that wrapper off though.

928
00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:34.250
So it doesn't make everybody get angry at us.

929
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:41.420
So the friend was cock blocking.
That's what it was.
The frank came on was like,

930
00:52:41.421 --> 00:52:43.700
Yo,
what's up chicken?
I'm trying to get,

931
00:52:43.701 --> 00:52:48.530
my dad shocked anytime he went crazy after he ripped her face off.

932
00:52:48.531 --> 00:52:52.610
I wonder if she like said,
hey you get out here.
If she got threatening to him.

933
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:57.380
I wonder what,
like if there was like an exchange or if he said,
all right,

934
00:52:57.381 --> 00:53:00.140
enough of this cock block and I'm just going to pull this bitch his eyes out.

935
00:53:00.141 --> 00:53:04.190
She had a robe on Bro.
I forget a diaper robe in the diaper.

936
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.650
Do you see the pictures of him and a rope?
She like dressed him up and shit.

937
00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.730
And then finally he's like,
I want to see this fall.

938
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.050
Well this pictures of her too,

939
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.350
she got fucked and he like rip her face and more sats or something toward face

940
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:17.720
apart completely.
And the chicks on the phone,
right?

941
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:22.940
Like she's fucking monkey just killed 200 pounds.
He was huge.

942
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.210
I mean he was eating lunch in her bed.
I slept in her bed.
She gave me,

943
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:31.800
she gave him Xanax and she gave him red wine.
So even if he wasn't fucking her,

944
00:53:31.801 --> 00:53:35.040
which he probably was fuck hundred percent yet a giant Dick,
giant chimp,

945
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:37.440
Dick and John Chimp balls.
And it's probably horny all the time.

946
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:40.110
So maybe she just jerked him off every now and again.
You know,

947
00:53:40.111 --> 00:53:42.120
maybe who knows what the fuck happened,

948
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:46.640
but that chimp was our companion like he loved that was her man,
her man.

949
00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.940
We're like,
he's like,
it wasn't fixed matter if that happened.

950
00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:56.080
He wasn't fixed while Chris in a row.
Think of a dude,
a horny dude,
and he's,

951
00:53:56.081 --> 00:53:58.740
he's cutting them with this girl all the time and he's never getting any pussy.

952
00:53:58.741 --> 00:54:01.200
And then a friend comes over right when he thinks he's about to get the pussy.

953
00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:03.890
The friend comes over and like,
you're asleep with a monkeys.

954
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.850
Like you fucking con you gotta Rip Pervasive Tears are apart fucking pitch.

955
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.810
Oh God.
What a monster.
What a terrifying thing and intelligent,

956
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.260
super powerful primate that rips your face apart.

957
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:19.440
That sips wine in his fucking chilling and Xanax.

958
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:21.260
She was giving it to someone who knows what the fuck man,

959
00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:23.310
how hard he fucked her after the wine.

960
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:30.210
Probably have a lower tolerance and human hammered the drunken monkey sex.

961
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.900
I wonder if she gave him wine in Xanax.
He's going to rip that asshole.

962
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:36.030
You know what I mean?
No wonder she's living that.
It's like,

963
00:54:36.031 --> 00:54:39.810
you ain't going fucking nowhere.
You're staying here.
There he is.
There he is.

964
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.710
Look at her face son.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

965
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:48.870
Oh my God.
Like if when you guys called me was like,
Yo man,
I got this chip.

966
00:54:48.871 --> 00:54:53.790
Come and see it.
No,
I'm not fucking going.
And he's terrifying.
Oh,

967
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.470
literally tore her face apart.

968
00:54:55.471 --> 00:55:00.270
Razia Shim chilling in her room and should lead the family photo there in the

969
00:55:00.271 --> 00:55:03.960
yellow blue.
I don't mean to laugh.
It's so scary.

970
00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:07.230
Fuck crazy bitches this.
Well,
you know,

971
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:10.530
people were allowed to have wild animals that they shouldn't be allowed to.

972
00:55:10.531 --> 00:55:12.690
They just haven't changed the laws in certain places.

973
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:16.560
There's actually a documentary called the elephant in the living room that's all

974
00:55:16.561 --> 00:55:20.550
about people that own wild animals,
like dangerous wild animals.

975
00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:23.700
And there's parts of the country where you could just like Ohio.

976
00:55:23.701 --> 00:55:25.380
There was this guy that had a bunch of them.

977
00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:27.720
He had tigers and lions and elephants and shit.

978
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:31.200
And then he opened up the gates and shot himself in the head.
He was like,

979
00:55:31.201 --> 00:55:35.490
fuck this.
Open the gates,
let the animals out and then fucking iced himself.

980
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:39.060
And so the cops came and the cops had to just start shooting these animals.

981
00:55:39.061 --> 00:55:42.810
They had a fine of a shoot them,
but they're all this wandering down the street.

982
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.190
They don't know where the fuck they're going.

983
00:55:44.191 --> 00:55:47.610
They've been in these fence cages their whole life.
It's horrible.
Oh,

984
00:55:47.611 --> 00:55:50.850
it's so crazy,
dude.
How about the,
uh,
the kid who his parents are?

985
00:55:50.851 --> 00:55:55.170
I think it was his mom owned like a crazy,
a snake,
a pet shop,

986
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.600
and he committed suicide by Luna Cobra by them.

987
00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:00.900
The Cobra bit him eight times the I commit suicide.

988
00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:05.820
Jesus cause some largely shit,
man.
Again,
good way to go.

989
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.990
I don't know about all that.
I'm seeing kinks or way to go gangster.
Yeah,

990
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:13.110
it's insanely painful.
I think it was.
I can't be good.

991
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.050
Speaking of suicide guys,
dude,
seriously?

992
00:56:17.051 --> 00:56:20.900
You guys got to watch soaked in bleach,
dude.
I've seen it with,
oh my God.
Oh,

993
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.610
it's the brand new Kurt Cobain documentary about Courtney love.

994
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:29.250
Courtney love doing this.
She did it.
Do these.
He got tissue dude.

995
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:34.410
She killed him.
Yes.
A hundred percent dude in this doc.

996
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:39.260
It's this,
she hired dude.
One more time,
but Internet,
it's going to explode.

997
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:43.370
Going freak out on they're mind boggling.

998
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:47.380
People.
History.
History is going to be rewritten on how,
uh,

999
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:51.670
like a Jimmy Hendrix type,
I mean rockstar.
It's been out for a while.

1000
00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.190
Then they got to change.
No,
this year it came out the year 2015.
Dude,

1001
00:56:56.950 --> 00:57:00.640
that's one of the stories that is so crazy that when you start telling people

1002
00:57:00.641 --> 00:57:03.280
you have to do the mop just to get them prepared for it.

1003
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:09.860
You got to prepare.
You've got to do it.
How bad is it too?
I agree to you.

1004
00:57:09.861 --> 00:57:13.540
Almost like with all your dudes.
I get like more and more prepared for credit.

1005
00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:18.250
2015.
Yeah.
Yeah,
but,
but what,
but what they do is they have to do,

1006
00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:18.940
but they had her out.

1007
00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.880
They have the private investigator that Courtney hired to make her look good,

1008
00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:25.720
but she just went through the yellow pages and hired a motherfucker.

1009
00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:29.140
She hired like the detective,
all detectives.
What was,

1010
00:57:29.141 --> 00:57:32.350
what was going through was the guys in Kurt Cobain,
Kurt Cobain,

1011
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.980
had her sign a prenup and has all come,
this is all real shit.
When he watches,

1012
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:39.490
he was divorcing her and writing her out of the will.

1013
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:42.010
He was in the process of writing out of the will and since she,

1014
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.820
she signed a Prenup,
she wasn't going to get that much and he,

1015
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:48.090
she was totally fucked up on how,

1016
00:57:48.091 --> 00:57:52.840
and he was trying to clean this shit up according to this documentary.
And then,

1017
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:57.280
um,
if she,
if she had something,
it looks,

1018
00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:02.340
it appears that she had something to do with his murder based on that

1019
00:58:03.101 --> 00:58:07.190
documentary.
It fucking dude,
they got,
oh dude,
here we go again to the,

1020
00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:12.870
when he shot himself,
yes.
When he shot himself,
he didn't shoot himself.
No,

1021
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:13.661
they're saying he did,

1022
00:58:13.661 --> 00:58:16.960
but they're saying he didn't do it because he had too much heroin in his body.

1023
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:20.470
How much hair and they found in his blood system could operate a gun.

1024
00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:25.390
There's no heroin in his body to cause 10 overdoses on people.

1025
00:58:25.391 --> 00:58:28.760
It was just like,
it was crazy.
Let me ask you this.
Um,

1026
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:32.580
is it possible his tolerance was so high that he could just do it when you,

1027
00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.431
when you listen to it,

1028
00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:36.340
when you listen to all the shit that's private and she hired a private

1029
00:58:36.341 --> 00:58:39.910
investigator to find this missing car.
We don't know where he's at.

1030
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:42.670
He bought a shotgun and he's going to,
he's suicidal.

1031
00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:44.200
She was just putting it all out there.

1032
00:58:44.201 --> 00:58:47.410
And from day one there's private investigator started taping.
Everything goes,

1033
00:58:47.411 --> 00:58:51.160
this girl's full is,
she was calling like TMZ leaking all this stuff cause the,

1034
00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:56.290
that scalar TMZ that she's calling like the MTV TV whenever Courtney was calling

1035
00:58:56.711 --> 00:59:00.160
MTV saying he's suicidal,
he's got a,
she bought it.
A detective was like,

1036
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:02.370
how the fuck is this getting out?
And then he traits,
traits about,

1037
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:06.280
he's like this bitch is releasing it.
And then with that,
with the evidence,

1038
00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:11.710
the way he shot himself,
if according to how he would do it,
that they found them,

1039
00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:15.280
the way the shotgun shell fell is all wrong.
It should have felt the other.

1040
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:18.940
Beyond that though,
all this conversation to tape conversations,

1041
00:59:18.941 --> 00:59:23.330
he taped everything mad him.
And,
and her lawyer,

1042
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:25.790
him and her,
and this is the shit she would say,

1043
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:30.250
she'd be all fucked up on heroin in her voice would say,
see,
you know,
they're,

1044
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:32.810
they're supposed to be looking for Kurt,
but she knows where he's at.

1045
00:59:32.811 --> 00:59:35.990
She's calling the rehab 13 times a day and he won't take her calls.

1046
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.390
She's freaking out.
She's going to get written out of the will.

1047
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:41.270
She needs his ass dead.
That's the way it looks.

1048
00:59:41.271 --> 00:59:44.960
She says shit like this to the private investigator on tape.
She'll say,
you know,

1049
00:59:44.961 --> 00:59:49.710
my album's coming out and,
and um,
I started this rumor that I had an Odi.

1050
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:52.490
She's saying this,
she goes to,
but what should I go with this?

1051
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:54.530
Should I say it was an odi or should I say no,

1052
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:56.270
it wasn't an Eau de that was twisted.

1053
00:59:56.271 --> 00:59:59.630
It was actually me being suicidal because I can't find Kurt.
What do you think?

1054
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.270
And the private investigators go on.
I think that's a really,

1055
01:00:02.271 --> 01:00:04.670
really bad I did cause,
but it's,
it's publicity.

1056
01:00:04.671 --> 01:00:08.810
It's for my album is one of the best documentaries.
It's amazing.

1057
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:11.090
She's a piece of,
it's all on tape.
How about,

1058
01:00:11.091 --> 01:00:13.690
how about their own daughter didn't invite her to her wedding.
She

1059
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:16.580
got married to anybody.

1060
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:18.540
<v 2>It's a little bit do a little bit of a,</v>

1061
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.060
not mockumentary but there's some reenacted.

1062
01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.213
<v 0>Yes.</v>

1063
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.530
That's all nasty hate though still,
but

1064
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.650
make no mistake about it.
Still.
It's a documentary with,
with evidence.

1065
01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:38.320
Every forensics,
a bonding,
the actual evidence.

1066
01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.320
I just fucking hate reenactments to drive me back and it doesn't look like her.

1067
01:00:42.321 --> 01:00:43.154
Nobody.
I'm like,

1068
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:46.990
what I love when they have those fucking TV shows like 48 hours or something

1069
01:00:46.991 --> 01:00:50.440
like that and they have a reenactment and then the reenactment dude doesn't look

1070
01:00:50.441 --> 01:00:53.620
nothing like they're like,
show up with the gun.

1071
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:56.260
Pretty good job though with like the Courtney and they did it go.

1072
01:00:56.261 --> 01:01:00.690
They had a fake Kurt Cobain's.
No,
no,
no.

1073
01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:05.050
That's not in the movie.
No,
you don't understand.

1074
01:01:05.051 --> 01:01:06.940
It's an actual documentary with me.

1075
01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.910
It's not the whole thing like that.
Why didn't the little missing pieces,

1076
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:16.900
photos of Kurt Cobain instead of Courtney wouldn't release anything to him.

1077
01:01:16.901 --> 01:01:21.260
Courtney tried to stop in this documentary from coming out.
She tried.

1078
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:26.620
She her voice scheming and lying to this private investigator.

1079
01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.590
She knows where he's at.
She's pretending that he's missing,

1080
01:01:29.591 --> 01:01:33.470
she keeps saying that he's suicidal.
He bought a shotgun,
Jesus.

1081
01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.420
And then the cops like the former police chief of Seattle where all this

1082
01:01:37.421 --> 01:01:41.110
happened.
He's on the documentary saying this was,
they got to reopen this thing.

1083
01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:45.790
They want a real [inaudible].
All my friends are sober.

1084
01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.500
Jamie sober.
Jamie.

1085
01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:50.800
<v 2>So a really good at detective.</v>

1086
01:01:50.801 --> 01:01:54.940
I think he's from la or he's been in a lot of major cases and he's essentially

1087
01:01:54.941 --> 01:01:55.690
the head.
He's right here,

1088
01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:59.350
like wrote the book on how to look at it in a murder investigation and he's

1089
01:01:59.351 --> 01:02:03.190
saying,
look at this case again and why they don't.
It's like a little corruption.

1090
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.860
<v 0>She paid,
she was paid it all wrong.
They did it all wrong.</v>

1091
01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.530
He said usually for them to say it was a suicide,

1092
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.920
there's like all the stuff that goes into it.
They literally,
Shit.
Nope.
Suicide.

1093
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.470
The even that detector was like,
what the fuck?
That quick,

1094
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.530
no one's going to do any research.
How do you go about bribing cops?

1095
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:22.140
Tiny pill son,
but can you just do that?

1096
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:26.880
Like if a high profile case like that where Kurt Cobain commit suicide,

1097
01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:30.990
who the fuck would she talk to to hook up some sort of a bribery?

1098
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:35.190
How do you do something like she was a zillionaire hold on.
It was a lot of,

1099
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.410
dumbness does a lot of bad procedure and a lot of circumstantial dumb things

1100
01:02:40.411 --> 01:02:40.861
that happened.

1101
01:02:40.861 --> 01:02:43.620
Sort of like the Jonbenet Ramsey case where they just kept getting fucked up.

1102
01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:47.910
They fucked up a bunch of stuff and evidence and then finally like got to

1103
01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.560
suicide with the guy,
the head detective,

1104
01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:53.970
the guy that was in charge of everything,
he soon got fired or quit,

1105
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:58.530
forced to quit for some other scandals and she was known for paying people off.

1106
01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:02.600
She was just crazy.
He got,
he got in trouble for other shit as well.

1107
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:06.870
The guy in charge,
the guy who didn't want to look into anything,

1108
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:10.470
there was a private investigator.
The guy who put the shit together,

1109
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.100
he went to the lead detective.
He was a former cop describing and that scares me.

1110
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.910
He knows he knows proper procedure.
He goes up to the guy and says,
hey,
listen,

1111
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:20.910
I been,
uh,
I was hired by Courtney love.

1112
01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:25.860
I've been on this case for the last month.
You,
you need to talk to me.

1113
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:29.100
And I got a lot of shit and the guy didn't want to talk to him.
Wow.

1114
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.450
You wouldn't talk to it's true.
Like w the hedges taken me.

1115
01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:37.140
I don't want to watch that.
Oh No.
You want to walk into her somewhere?

1116
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:40.080
We're going to have to kill her dude.
I think the world is going to turn on her.

1117
01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:43.430
I know it's going to turn on her to get her to the world is going to turn on
her.

1118
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:48.150
Thank God this is a comedy podcast
is because we're just finding out about it,

1119
01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.190
but when did it come out?
I saw it on the laptop.

1120
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:57.270
Now it's almost over 2015 has become in 2006 they jump.

1121
01:03:57.271 --> 01:03:59.250
They just made it available talking about it now.

1122
01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:02.040
They just made it available and I heard about it on a,

1123
01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:04.260
the opiod channel earlier this year.
They interviewed the director.

1124
01:04:04.261 --> 01:04:07.290
How long ago was this?
The summer.
See that's what I'm worried about.

1125
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.040
But just like Netflix just now,
it just sitting there.
Well that might just be it.

1126
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:14.310
Netflix is the motherfucker motherfuckers when it comes to spreading shit and

1127
01:04:14.311 --> 01:04:17.150
then jre and when we're talking about it right now.
That's right.

1128
01:04:17.151 --> 01:04:20.960
We're talking about on the GRE.
I said we send a chimp shells,

1129
01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:29.700
fucking jug of wine and a bottle of pills to what's up about what bottle of

1130
01:04:29.701 --> 01:04:33.070
Viagara Nirvana shirt.
Blue Steel.

1131
01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:38.880
Oh my God.
With the one with the baby and the water.
That shirt.
Fuck it,

1132
01:04:38.881 --> 01:04:42.600
man.
I can't believe you really think that she,
you know what's crazy to me?

1133
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:45.720
I mean,
I've done my best and we've all fucked up in life,

1134
01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:50.730
but I've done my best to try to avoid total nightmare type relationships like

1135
01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:54.420
that.
That seems like not just a nightmare relationship with a nightmare.

1136
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:59.480
If that is true with a completely insane person who's willing to not just fake

1137
01:05:00.091 --> 01:05:02.760
things for publicity,
but possibly,
you know,

1138
01:05:02.761 --> 01:05:06.120
they're insinuating allegedly killing them.
There's a lot of jealousy there too.

1139
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:09.450
But look out a brilliant fucking musician.
He was,
oh,
it's amazing.

1140
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.650
It just kills you.

1141
01:05:10.651 --> 01:05:15.540
The idea that it's some unbelievably brilliant guy gets shacked up with some

1142
01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:20.320
knucklehead,
drove everybody crazy about Yoko Ono and John Lennon.
Like how,

1143
01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:24.340
how,
how was that the way,
I don't know if that was the wedge and the Beatles.

1144
01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.530
We weren't there.
I'm just guessing.
But that's what everybody says.

1145
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:31.510
Anyone could pick a hot towel and he didn't even talk about the suicide note.
Oh,

1146
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.810
check this out.
Reach Eti.

1147
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:37.360
The suicide note there was supposedly [inaudible] Jamie.

1148
01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:43.310
It was the first,
the first half of it.
It wasn't even about it.

1149
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.220
It's like about his music and all this shit wasn't,

1150
01:05:45.221 --> 01:05:49.210
it didn't sound like a suicide note.
Then at the end she pieced it together.

1151
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:51.640
Practices,
signature inner backpack.

1152
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:55.630
They found her practicing or practicing.

1153
01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:59.770
She wrote that Shit.
Oh my God.
So a lot of it was other stuff.

1154
01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:01.630
And then she love you.
I love you.
I love you.

1155
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:03.880
He was divorcing her and riding her out of the will.

1156
01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:09.300
He was divorcing and that's a fact in nirvana to supposedly,
yeah.

1157
01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.220
Whoa.
So she watched son,

1158
01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:16.060
she washed his handwriting on the paper and wrote something.

1159
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.060
At the bottom of a paper that he had written on it.

1160
01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:21.430
It doesn't even match up saying forensic scientists say it doesn't match up.

1161
01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:25.000
She wanted to make it seem like it was something that he really wrote,

1162
01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:28.090
so she was trying to blend it all in together.
Oh my God,

1163
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.170
that is fucking some dark shit,
man.
This is possible.

1164
01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.970
So I mean there's a reason.
There's a reason.
Dave Grohl,
Dave's Dave grow man,

1165
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:42.010
I'm 100% convinced she was involved in it.
Somehow.
I'm 100% and I'm not.

1166
01:06:42.011 --> 01:06:43.940
She says there,
he got him 100% sure.

1167
01:06:43.941 --> 01:06:46.150
I think this is going to be like chapter will be the Jenks.

1168
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:50.890
How the Genx took down that murderer do that TV shows.
Yes.
You think so?

1169
01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:55.570
How crazy would it be in our lifetime if all of a sudden Courtney love winds up

1170
01:06:55.571 --> 01:06:58.750
getting arrested and convicted for Kurt Cobain's Martin murder and then you

1171
01:06:58.751 --> 01:07:01.000
start thinking about all the guys that publicly dated her.

1172
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:03.700
I'm like Ed Norton at Norton,
the whole tribe,

1173
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.690
a fucking guy was dating her after the suicide alleged to have a lot of rock

1174
01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:13.100
stars.
Billy Corgan,
twiggy Ramirez,
well didn't need it.

1175
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:16.360
It was all over the park and have a giant falling out with her after like he

1176
01:07:16.361 --> 01:07:21.340
helped her write that one brilliant first album that Kurt wrote that that's,

1177
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:26.050
that's a nirvana.
How's that?
Which one is Tom was in it.
A doll parts.

1178
01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:28.580
Oh that's under,
that was a great outcome.

1179
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:32.290
And every people on the inside know that Kurt put that shit together for him.

1180
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:37.170
It seems like it cause she didn't want to do,
he dies that how blows up.

1181
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:41.730
It was all perfect timing.
She becomes this huge star.
Doesn't want to put out,
um,

1182
01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:46.750
I think it was the doesn't want to put out another album and she's banging Billy

1183
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:48.580
Corgan.
This is according to Billy Corgan on Howard Stern.

1184
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:52.690
He said that he had to convince her to make another album.

1185
01:07:52.691 --> 01:07:55.290
She was afraid of course,
cause she knew I wasn't going to live for samples.

1186
01:07:55.870 --> 01:08:00.190
So Billy put that album together and we're all most of it in and he convinced

1187
01:08:00.191 --> 01:08:03.780
her to do it and help her put it all together.
He's an,
he's a brilliant role.

1188
01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.930
Doesn't even fuck with her.
Like he don't take the,

1189
01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:07.870
there's an Hbo Kurt Cobain Documentary,

1190
01:08:07.871 --> 01:08:10.870
which is brilliantly at the way it was done was amazing.
But he will even take,

1191
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:13.300
you want nothing to do with it.
This one or that one.

1192
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:17.240
He wanted nothing to do scary.
It is scary shit.
Scary Shit.
Yeah.

1193
01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:21.440
That's scary that someone can become a murderer and just integrate right back

1194
01:08:21.441 --> 01:08:25.440
into pop culture.
And no one,
no one away with keeping up.

1195
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:27.470
She got away with it.
But this isn't,

1196
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:31.350
this isn't the first documentary I remember I'll watch one a few years back when

1197
01:08:31.351 --> 01:08:33.340
there was another guy that was accusing her of a,

1198
01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:37.710
of murdering and in that documentary it was all conspiracy theory,
uh,

1199
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:42.580
status back then.
Uh,
this private investigator,
he piled a little taller,

1200
01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.220
but he didn't,
he didn't release any of the tapes.
He had all the tests.

1201
01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:49.010
He has hours and hours of their conversations were her just bullshitting and

1202
01:08:49.011 --> 01:08:52.730
design the whole time.
He catches her in so many lies.
Yeah.

1203
01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:57.560
This is so scary.
I'm getting nervous.
I get nervous when I talk about this.

1204
01:08:57.561 --> 01:09:01.130
I imagine like that someone alive that does that pull in,

1205
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.440
fills them up with heroin and writes his love,

1206
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:06.200
can't do it twice the suicide note and blows his brains out.

1207
01:09:06.201 --> 01:09:08.010
Whatever the fuck once.

1208
01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:12.620
If she really did do it once and that happened.
And what year was that happen?

1209
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:13.010
What do you have?

1210
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:18.010
A 94 93 but check this out in their nanny there nanny was that guy that used to

1211
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:23.980
fuck her preach.
Come on,
come on.
Yes,

1212
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.740
they married or before they were,
while they were married.
Oh my God.
Wow.

1213
01:09:30.741 --> 01:09:34.270
They were married.
Oh,
the darkness continues.
Our roles.

1214
01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.660
Kurt Cobain,
really great dude.

1215
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:41.690
When you hear her voice conniving and she knew she's a master at handling the

1216
01:09:41.691 --> 01:09:45.740
press.
Oh Shit.
She's a pace with it.
But back then was coming from MTV,

1217
01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:48.110
like all the news and it was all coming from her directly.

1218
01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.450
She was all over that shit.
So she was putting out all this.

1219
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:53.120
Everybody that knows him,
everybody that knew him really well,

1220
01:09:53.121 --> 01:09:55.670
said he was not suicidal her for his family.

1221
01:09:55.671 --> 01:09:59.820
They interview his family and friends like Kirk was 100% not suicidal like he,

1222
01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.840
he put on this whole light grunge thing.
He was not suicidal.

1223
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.650
They said a lot of times like he,

1224
01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:09.970
he killed himself because he had that stomach issue that was gone.
Yeah.

1225
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:13.100
He didn't have that.
That was cured.
Which stomach issue?

1226
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.500
He had a stomach problem and he would say,
man,
test.
Sorry.

1227
01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:19.413
Would,

1228
01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.390
there was a statement he made that said that it made him want to kill himself,

1229
01:10:23.391 --> 01:10:27.300
the pain,
so that's when he started doing it.
Exactly,
exactly.
I mean,

1230
01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:29.540
she ran with it.
She would run with that stuff.

1231
01:10:29.541 --> 01:10:32.280
But you saying he was cured at that time.
It was all coming from her.

1232
01:10:32.650 --> 01:10:37.350
You got to watch it.
We just have the whole fucking plot.
Spoiler alert.

1233
01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.850
He dies at the end.
What?
Yes.
Yeah.
She did it though.
He's,

1234
01:10:40.851 --> 01:10:42.680
you ever see the photos that they released on the Internet?

1235
01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.970
That was the autopsy photos I get into.
It's almost,

1236
01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:49.250
it's almost like what if you found out that Jimmy Hendrix is murdered by the CIA

1237
01:10:49.251 --> 01:10:52.760
or something.
You know there's a Jimi Hendrix book,
Jimi Hendrix,

1238
01:10:52.761 --> 01:10:57.761
former bodyguard is a guy who says that Jimi Hendrix was murdered by his former

1239
01:10:58.131 --> 01:11:01.730
manager because he was leaving his manager and that same manager killed Jimmy

1240
01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:04.040
Hendrix girlfriend.
God,
Jimmy,
Jimmy,

1241
01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.180
after Jimmy Hendrix died after Jimi Hendrix died,

1242
01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:11.420
his girlfriend was thrown off a roof and Soho.
Yeah,

1243
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.220
they said she committed suicide but this guy says they threw

1244
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.730
<v 1>her off a roof cause she knows that they kill Jimmy because Jimmy was leaving</v>

1245
01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:20.400
his manager.
This is one thing the manager did do.
Okay.

1246
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:25.260
The manager had Jimmy kidnapped,
had Jimmy kidnapped and then rescue them.

1247
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:29.270
Oh your show him to show him that Jimmy needed him CISA.

1248
01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.360
So the manager had Jimmy Hendrix fucking kidnapped this factor.

1249
01:11:33.361 --> 01:11:38.060
Conspiracy theory.
No,
I wasn't there obviously.
But this is according to this,

1250
01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:42.300
this guy and apparently the kid naps door has been said before,

1251
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:45.570
but the kid next door has been said before but this a shame isn't bounce.

1252
01:11:45.571 --> 01:11:48.390
Brilliant,
brilliant artists was that happens though.
These,

1253
01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:52.920
these manager characters,
especially in the old days of show business.
I mean,

1254
01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:56.490
think about what we're talking about in the sixties the sixties is just 20 years

1255
01:11:56.491 --> 01:11:59.550
removed from the fucking 40 sure.
You know what I'm saying?

1256
01:11:59.551 --> 01:12:02.310
I mean think about the Ford of the forties or just 20 years removed.

1257
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:05.250
We can go back and back until we get to gangs of New York.
Right.

1258
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.890
Let the crazy fucking movie with a brilliant,
yeah,

1259
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:10.290
they Louis where they killing each other with that.

1260
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:14.430
We're talking about a different era of humanity.
Okay.
So easy to kill people.

1261
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:18.010
Back then 1960s the people that were running show Biz,

1262
01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.140
there was a lot of gangsters in the music business,
like legitimate gangsters.

1263
01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:25.420
They would get involved in the career of Frank Sinatra.
Yeah.
They'll get in the,

1264
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.840
in the career of a lot of different artists.
It was very,

1265
01:12:27.841 --> 01:12:31.560
very common cause they can make a lot of money and they like being big shots and

1266
01:12:31.561 --> 01:12:35.070
they liked saying,
hey,
I'm Jimmy Hendrix manager,
let me in the door please.

1267
01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:38.850
And these fucking people infiltrated like that fucking guy that was in the

1268
01:12:38.851 --> 01:12:42.990
producer that was in with the Beatles.
The guy who shot the chicken the mouth.

1269
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:47.250
They'll guy wore the crazy wigs.
What the fuck is his name?
Wall of sound guy.

1270
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.790
The producer.
What's up the specter?
Yes.
Phil Spector.

1271
01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.640
Here's the guy who we used to always pull guns on people.
He was,

1272
01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:56.610
he was a producer for the fucking Beatles.

1273
01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:59.790
He had a very distinctive style of recording music.

1274
01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:02.210
They used to call the wall of sound.
Right?
Is that my same,

1275
01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:04.650
the real reason they quit?
Well,
this got shot.

1276
01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.980
He shot a fucking woman in the mouth in Hollywood a few years back.

1277
01:13:07.981 --> 01:13:08.970
I took her back to his place,

1278
01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.270
put a gun in her mouth and pull the fucking trigger and Blueberries,
Christ man,

1279
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.270
some Hati that he picked up at,
um,
at,
uh,
like,
uh,

1280
01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:18.210
was it like house of blues or something or Skybar or something like that.

1281
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.350
But right across the street from the comedy store,
she's where he met her,

1282
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:25.160
took her up to his mansion,
blew her fucking brains out.
And they,
you know,
they,

1283
01:13:25.161 --> 01:13:26.550
they tried him and convicted him,

1284
01:13:26.551 --> 01:13:29.880
but this guy was probably doing that his whole career.
Cause that was,

1285
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.940
that was the rumor was that he would strong arm people with guns.

1286
01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:35.880
I think that was like super common in the music business.

1287
01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:41.130
I think violence and the threat of violence kept a lot of people in business.

1288
01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:44.460
I think what?
Like people allege that I'm shook night did.

1289
01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:46.590
I think that's just a rap version of it.

1290
01:13:46.591 --> 01:13:50.100
I think people have been doing that forever.
It's crazy,
man.

1291
01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:55.140
So what she's done,
what she did is it's probably been done before if she did it.

1292
01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:58.420
I agree.
Well you guys think she did it.
Hundred percent.
God,
that's great.

1293
01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:02.400
You know the John Lennon assassination conspiracy theory,

1294
01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:05.430
you know that the CIA had him killed.
There's,
there's,

1295
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:10.350
there's a lot of shit on that.
Oh Man.
Did you see the,
the guy who did it though?

1296
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:15.350
How crazy is in his [inaudible] you can get someone who's crazy to do things for

1297
01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:17.620
you.
Like here's a perfect example.

1298
01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:22.890
The FBI arrested this guy in Dallas for making a fake bomb and a,

1299
01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:26.770
and trying to detonate it,
but the FBI gave him that bomb.

1300
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.970
It's the whole stories.
Hilarious.
They found some really fucking stupid dude.

1301
01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.450
They talked him into doing something you probably never would have done.

1302
01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:38.590
They literally sold him all the equipment to go and do this,

1303
01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:41.510
or they gave him all the equipment.
They gave him a cell phone to act to do it.

1304
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:44.380
Not well,
it was going to blow up some building.
God dammit.

1305
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:48.040
But here's the to here's,
but here's the thing.
He never was going to,

1306
01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:50.830
it was never his idea.
They talked him into doing it.

1307
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:53.590
They scheduled the whole thing.
They got him the equipment.

1308
01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:56.920
Then they arrested him.
Yeah,
but he's like,
they created a crime.
Yeah,

1309
01:14:56.921 --> 01:14:59.980
but you don't think with John Lennon,
this homeboys crazy.
He,

1310
01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:03.880
you don't think he's going to see we got a prison.
You got to look into it.

1311
01:15:03.881 --> 01:15:06.130
Who knows?
He's got to look into it.
Well,
listen,
here's the thing.

1312
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:08.710
You don't get the sang if they don't let you talk.

1313
01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:11.620
When was the last time you saw an interview with the guy?
He's done it though.

1314
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:15.160
Has he done it since you passed the murder?
Yeah.
Well,
well,
no,

1315
01:15:15.161 --> 01:15:17.320
you got to look into it.
It's just,

1316
01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.580
it's also you have to realize just as crazy as the soap and bleach,

1317
01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:24.640
you know what I mean?
I don't look into it.
If someone would tell you about it,

1318
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.370
you'd be like,
oh,
I don't know.
You don't think you don't think he was crazy?

1319
01:15:27.371 --> 01:15:31.300
He was like,
let me hear you.
Let me say this.
I don't think,
I don't have any,

1320
01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.970
I don't even have an opinion on the John Lennon thing.

1321
01:15:33.971 --> 01:15:36.610
I've never heard it before until Eddie brought it up.
I never,

1322
01:15:36.611 --> 01:15:39.350
I mean I might've peripherally hurts.
Someone said the sea.
I had no,

1323
01:15:39.351 --> 01:15:43.060
no details though.
None.
Zero,
Zilch.
But that said,

1324
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:45.310
if they wanted to kill someone,

1325
01:15:45.311 --> 01:15:50.290
eat one of the best ways would be get some crazy person and infiltrate them.

1326
01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:53.830
Even without their knowledge.
You can provide them with a weapon,

1327
01:15:53.831 --> 01:15:56.690
talk them into doing it.
And there's a lot of fucking morons out there.

1328
01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:01.030
And the guy,
the guy who allegedly killed Robert F.
Kennedy,

1329
01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:05.230
he doesn't have any recollection of of it happening.
He,

1330
01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:09.400
what he says is everyone says that I shot him,
so I probably did.

1331
01:16:09.401 --> 01:16:12.310
Everyone said they saw me shoot him,
but I don't remember anything.
Well,

1332
01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:15.820
how about that scope?
Paula means stuff that Colombian devils,

1333
01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:21.040
what do they call it?
Columbia and devils.
Dust.
Dust.
Devil's breath.

1334
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:23.980
There's this devil's breath.
Thank you.
There's this shit that they can blow.

1335
01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:26.380
They literally can blow it in your note.
They blow it on you.

1336
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.200
If you breathe it in,
you become a Zombie.

1337
01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:31.750
You do what they tell you to do and you have no memory of it.

1338
01:16:31.751 --> 01:16:32.950
Like I blow it on you.
I'll say,

1339
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.950
Brendan Schaub helped me move my couch and then all of a sudden you're fucking

1340
01:16:35.951 --> 01:16:40.360
Karen a couch up the stairs.
I'm not bullshitting,
man.
It's real.
100%,

1341
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:43.480
a hundred percent real.
You'll put the couch down.
Now here's what's really crazy.

1342
01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:47.800
That same stuff that they use is the same shit they put in drama mean and those

1343
01:16:47.801 --> 01:16:49.930
little patches,
when you get seasick,

1344
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.140
they give you like a little patch and it's like a little tiny amount of this.

1345
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.570
I think it's called scope Paul and me and think that's how you say it,

1346
01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.050
but it's the same active ingredient as those patches that they give you to keep

1347
01:16:59.051 --> 01:17:03.520
you from fucking getting seasick.
Jesus Christ.
Man,
devil does well.

1348
01:17:03.521 --> 01:17:06.230
This was stuff I didn't get my hands on.
If they have a blog,

1349
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:10.070
they blow it in your face and they think that that might have been where

1350
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.450
<v 0>the legend of zombies came from and that's why zombies like it was always like a</v>

1351
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:19.180
Haitian thing.
There was,
we talk about zombies,
Haitian Columbia,
like they were,

1352
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:21.920
I don't know if it's this area that had this plant,

1353
01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:25.850
but they think that people have been using this on people for years and it

1354
01:17:25.851 --> 01:17:29.360
wasn't until like really recently that they realize the effects of this stuff.

1355
01:17:29.361 --> 01:17:33.420
Like pharmacologists started to examine the effects of blowing this shit on peas

1356
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.830
or a short video on a advice has a whole documentary on it and have a whole

1357
01:17:36.831 --> 01:17:41.720
thing on your trip,
your balls.
I think I did see it.
It's scary stuff,

1358
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:45.980
but I thought,
Lord illegal,
but I didn't see,
I didn't see in a documentary.

1359
01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:49.730
I didn't see like a test like testing people are,
it's a good point.
He kind of,

1360
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.310
I don't remember.
It was quite quite a while ago where I saw it.

1361
01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.170
I've watched too many documentaries.
They all go in and now I've found

1362
01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.390
there's no room.
I have no room in my hard drive.

1363
01:17:59.570 --> 01:18:02.660
I've got to start deleting memories of my childhood,
who I'm filling my shit up.

1364
01:18:02.661 --> 01:18:06.620
I'm trying to hang out with you guys.
Fill it up.
Yeah,
but the problem is like,

1365
01:18:06.621 --> 01:18:09.350
stuff goes in and out now.
It's like some stuff stick,

1366
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:13.040
like MMA stuff seems to stick like glue and there's a few things about other

1367
01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:14.210
things that stick like glue,

1368
01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:17.300
but then there's occasional documentaries that are really interesting that just

1369
01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.600
had no room.
You know what's weird is when I was a kid,
I collect uh,

1370
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.280
football cards and I can remember almost to a t every player.

1371
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:26.420
What college you played in.

1372
01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:29.570
It's useless information for the reason it stuck with me.

1373
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:33.230
I remember looking weird,
man.
I remember weird shit.
We all do.

1374
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:36.410
There's like stuff that doesn't make any sense.
Why do I know this?
A shirt?

1375
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.920
Why don't remember this elite,
you know,
come on man.
Let's go here.

1376
01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:43.760
Like the plot line of like a Tom Selleck show.
You know like Magnum Pi.

1377
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:46.760
I can remember whole plotlines my grandma,
why do I need that?
It's why do I need,

1378
01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:50.630
wow,
the fucking dude who for the helicopter and he's helping them out and then

1379
01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:53.840
there's the Butler guy lets him use the Ferrari and he gets in trouble with it.

1380
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:57.140
Most of my vocabulary is from Acer chill or Adam Sandler.

1381
01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.780
How fucking weird is that?
That's hilarious.
My brain was like,
Yo,

1382
01:19:01.781 --> 01:19:05.910
let's download this.
He might not the slice Ventura literally like what?

1383
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:10.460
I'll use all of it man.
Like what?
A couple of,
yeah.

1384
01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.870
All righty.
Then when he does the thing where he's like,

1385
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.890
he has a dream and he's like,
you bit me right here.
And he was like,
wow.

1386
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:23.330
I do that all the time.
Literally all the time.
If I was you,
I'd say for sure.

1387
01:19:23.331 --> 01:19:27.910
Stop doing that.
I know,
I know I sent,

1388
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.900
you want to stop doing that?

1389
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:34.530
I constantly quote Hollywood shuffle,
man.
Have you ever seen that?
I have not.

1390
01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.450
It's lands and Robert Townsend,

1391
01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:41.510
their first movie that they put together with credit cards and shit.

1392
01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:45.470
Super Crazy low budget.
It's fucking hysterical.

1393
01:19:45.471 --> 01:19:48.180
It's called Hollywood shuffle.
You remember?
I'm going to get you Sucka.
Yeah,

1394
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:52.450
that's when they started making money because of Hollywood shuffle.
That kind of,

1395
01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:57.150
it was an underground hit shop phones in dude.
He was,
he has,

1396
01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:01.340
he had a hit TV show.
He probably has $1 billion.
Yeah.
But I mean that guy,

1397
01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:05.530
what his TV show do you have,
what is it called?
The parenthood.
Yeah,

1398
01:20:05.730 --> 01:20:08.030
the WB just started up.
It

1399
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:11.810
<v 1>definitely didn't make it,
the WPA Pena.</v>

1400
01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:15.420
He used to do like these comedy specials,
like Robert Townsend presents.

1401
01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:16.080
And they were like,

1402
01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.930
Damon would go on and do like 10 minutes and all these different comics go on.

1403
01:20:18.931 --> 01:20:22.000
But he was a famous like celebrated guy back then.

1404
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.370
Go tired of the bullshit man.
Maybe just got tired of the spotlight.

1405
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:28.350
I said fuck it.
And it happened to a lot of those guys.

1406
01:20:28.351 --> 01:20:30.520
They realize it's not working shit cause I didn't,

1407
01:20:30.521 --> 01:20:33.780
well it could cause that's a Keenan's doing a keynote now behind the scenes.

1408
01:20:33.781 --> 01:20:37.760
Yeah,
they probably get tired of the bullshit man.
Constant scrutiny.
Yeah,

1409
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:40.530
they would go,
what?
What is the benefit of this?
Yeah,
like Dave Chappelle.

1410
01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:43.830
Look at him and what he's doing.
Man.
Stop doing anything.

1411
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:46.320
He doesn't put anything out.
He'll specials.

1412
01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.950
He's doing standup kills it still doing spec snail.
It's still writing.

1413
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:53.370
I'll never have got to go see him live to see it,
which is kind of crazy.

1414
01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:56.370
That's kind of cool.
The one time he showed up at the comedy store,

1415
01:20:56.371 --> 01:21:00.300
maybe eight years ago at them in the main room.

1416
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:04.440
Man,
I never seen you so blown away.
He was never seen.

1417
01:21:04.690 --> 01:21:08.140
Usually you're in the pack on this guy fucking eats Dick's or something

1418
01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.520
pressing,
but it's very hard to impress you.
That does.

1419
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:19.120
That's a gross Smith MS characterization of how I look at comedians like bad
one,

1420
01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:23.520
but very few are really good that I'll sit down there and watch.
Yes,

1421
01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:28.340
but like for every one that like I'm just exaggerating.
Well that's for me,

1422
01:21:28.341 --> 01:21:30.400
that's not an exaggeration because yeah,

1423
01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:33.930
there's like guys that I'll definitely go see if they're there.
Like bill burr.

1424
01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:35.760
I'll see him every time he's there.
It's hilarious.

1425
01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.490
It's like there's a few guys like open.
Right?
Cause that's what I,

1426
01:21:38.491 --> 01:21:39.840
that's what I meant.
Well course.

1427
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:42.240
Well you're not going to steal one ship shall come on dude.

1428
01:21:42.241 --> 01:21:45.510
You when it was over we were dying.
So when it was over,

1429
01:21:45.511 --> 01:21:47.490
you turned around and you had this look on you.

1430
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.440
You walked down to the comedy store and he said,

1431
01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.110
I'd never been so inspired in my all my life.

1432
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:55.380
You just want her to go home and write jokes and shit.
You were really spicy.

1433
01:21:55.381 --> 01:21:58.290
Someone really good.
That's the first instinct,
right?
It's like,
man,

1434
01:21:58.291 --> 01:21:59.790
I want to hit another level now.

1435
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.600
I want to go home and write and want to get my fucking thoughts in order.

1436
01:22:03.601 --> 01:22:05.030
And like when you see someone that just,

1437
01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:08.670
that's one of the best things about living in La and you get to see all these

1438
01:22:08.671 --> 01:22:12.180
like really great guys go up.
They'll get to see these people go up and you go,

1439
01:22:12.181 --> 01:22:16.320
God,
I really think everybody likes sort of feeds off each other in that regard.

1440
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.020
You know like you'll,
you'll watch like,

1441
01:22:18.021 --> 01:22:21.030
like Louis C K did two nights at the comedy store this week.
You know,

1442
01:22:21.031 --> 01:22:24.470
we did like,
I think he did Sunday and Monday night and then you know like a,

1443
01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.800
they'll have a show on Tuesday or Wednesday nights a girl be there are,
you know,

1444
01:22:28.801 --> 01:22:33.420
some of the other great guys that are in town B.
So this is one of the places,

1445
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:36.000
one of the few places maybe there's only one other one.

1446
01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:39.870
I think maybe New York we that could happen on a regular basis.

1447
01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:43.290
You'll see like top level headliners like over and over and over.

1448
01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:46.170
What you say it's the best time I think is the best time for comedy.

1449
01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:50.220
I think there's no,
there's never been more really funny comics than right now.

1450
01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.280
Like as far as like me as a fan,

1451
01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:55.940
like say if I never did stand up again or I've never did it at all,

1452
01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:00.060
just watched it.
I just looked around and I compare this era to any other era.

1453
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.040
Even people.
I don't,
people I don't know like could take rei,

1454
01:23:04.090 --> 01:23:06.600
the Max and Joey out of the and all the people that I think are hilarious.
Yeah.

1455
01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.230
I still think is the best time ever.

1456
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.650
I think I look around at all these fucking people.
There's so many.

1457
01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:16.700
It'll be due to Stan hope and power and Dave Attell and Louis C K and Chappelle

1458
01:23:16.721 --> 01:23:17.321
and you fucking,

1459
01:23:17.321 --> 01:23:19.980
you could keep going Ian Edwards or pull a lot of people don't even know about

1460
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:22.960
he and Edwards.
He's a beast.
He's a fucking monster.
He saw,

1461
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:27.160
he saw and there's a bunch of those guys,
man.
There's guys like that in Austin,

1462
01:23:27.161 --> 01:23:30.580
Texas.
It's guys like that in Denver.
There's guys like that in New York,

1463
01:23:30.581 --> 01:23:34.120
these guys like that in Boston.
This is a a really unusual time.

1464
01:23:34.150 --> 01:23:35.440
Super unusual time.

1465
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:38.920
I think it's because of the Internet because people can watch other people do

1466
01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:42.070
stand up now.
Like you could see like everybody set ever.
You know,

1467
01:23:42.071 --> 01:23:45.190
like you could watch like a Richard Pryor thing than it the Eddie Murphy thing

1468
01:23:45.191 --> 01:23:46.930
and every guy you mentioned,
right?
That,

1469
01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:51.430
I wish I had a youtube video that was a good three hour video of just all the

1470
01:23:51.431 --> 01:23:54.580
guys you said.
Cause anybody that impresses you,
that's the one thing I knew.

1471
01:23:54.581 --> 01:23:57.940
If they impressed you,
they gotta be good.
Well they're on youtube.
Betty

1472
01:24:00.230 --> 01:24:02.530
video,
a mix of all those guys.

1473
01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:06.870
Burn presses the fucking shit out of me right now as the Stan home.
Anytime.

1474
01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.100
Every time I see Stan hope I want to go right.
You know,

1475
01:24:09.101 --> 01:24:10.870
he's another guy that inspires the shit out of me.

1476
01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.920
We had burr on the podcast today and I love Comedians,
man.

1477
01:24:14.921 --> 01:24:16.570
I watch all of their stuff.
All you guys,

1478
01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:20.800
and I think it was the f is the first podcast where it's the least amount of

1479
01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:25.390
time I've ever spent talking.
He just went,
oh yeah,
you're fucking,
he's uh,

1480
01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:28.900
he does out of my podcast too.
He's,
he's uh,
he'll joke around about it,

1481
01:24:28.901 --> 01:24:32.800
be an OCD or Adhd or whatever the fuck he is,
but it's real.
It's real.

1482
01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:37.210
He'll go from one subject to the next subject to the next subject before you

1483
01:24:37.211 --> 01:24:40.210
even get a word in.
He like just keep changing the subject,

1484
01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:44.740
but it's one of the reasons why is because he does his own podcast by himself.

1485
01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:47.440
He's one of the few guys that does a podcast.

1486
01:24:47.441 --> 01:24:50.170
He does it called the Monday morning podcast.
He does it on Thursday too.

1487
01:24:50.410 --> 01:24:54.340
And what he does is he just turns on his iPhone or his microphone and just

1488
01:24:54.341 --> 01:24:57.910
starts talking,
goes and just go.
You go for like an hour and a half bill burr.

1489
01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.590
So for an hour and a half,

1490
01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:04.120
he just aid DDS the fuck out and talks about heal to a fucking,
I can't,

1491
01:25:04.150 --> 01:25:06.070
I don't watch football,
so I don't pay attention.

1492
01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:09.640
But he'll do fucking an hour on the patriots,
you know,

1493
01:25:09.641 --> 01:25:13.540
and just go off about shores and he's crazy.

1494
01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:18.130
But whole areas,
his,
uh,
his podcast is good.

1495
01:25:18.131 --> 01:25:22.720
His standup is amazing.
His standup is amongst the best ever right now.

1496
01:25:22.770 --> 01:25:26.050
You know,
he's one of the best ever.
And I think that,
uh,

1497
01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.620
between him and like I said,
you can just keep going down the line.

1498
01:25:29.621 --> 01:25:33.940
Like Kevin Hart,
he's the most successful guy ever.

1499
01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:38.560
Most successful tour ever,
ever,
ever,
ever.
By far,
I think.

1500
01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:41.140
I think he's doing a thing in Philadelphia.
We did it.

1501
01:25:41.141 --> 01:25:43.240
I don't know if he's going to do it or it did do it.
It's going to do it.

1502
01:25:43.241 --> 01:25:46.660
50,000 seats and it had already sold like 40,000 seats,

1503
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:50.830
like three months out and it's insane.
He's giant.
He's just giant.

1504
01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:53.840
Who's that black comedian that kind of went crazy for a lot of hymns.

1505
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:58.510
Katt Williams.
What's he,
what's his current status?
He did a special like,

1506
01:25:58.511 --> 01:26:01.900
um,
I want to say a year and a half ago with spike Lee.

1507
01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:04.130
Spike Lee directed it and it was pretty good.

1508
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:07.420
<v 0>It was pretty good.
Um,
but you know,
he had,</v>

1509
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:10.430
he went through a real bad spell where he was,

1510
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:14.420
he seemed like he's kind of losing it in mine.
My mom live in Bakersfield band.

1511
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:19.160
Oh yeah.
He had a melt recently or no,
this is when all that shit was going down.

1512
01:26:19.161 --> 01:26:20.900
Maybe two years or just saw him have a meltdown.

1513
01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:27.130
There was no comedy going out because he was on drugs or anything.

1514
01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:31.770
That's why he filmed a special,
I think.
No,
no,
no.
Right here.

1515
01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:35.720
Ontario,
Ontario,
California.
Oh No,
no,
this was Bakersfield man.
He really,

1516
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:40.260
he was just sweating and doing pushups on stage and running out in the audience.

1517
01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.910
No jokes.
He was just like,
ah,
this is pretty crazy.
Yeah.

1518
01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.550
So how long did this go on for?
We,
me and my wife left.
I'm like,

1519
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:50.030
he's losing his mind.
This is not,
this is not even a show.

1520
01:26:50.031 --> 01:26:54.590
He wasn't even doing what your audience doing.
Like they weren't laughing.
So how,

1521
01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:59.540
like how long did he do it for?
How long did you left?
I left after a half hour.

1522
01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:00.374
I couldn't take it.

1523
01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.130
So for a half an hour he's just doing pushups and running.

1524
01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.370
Donny was like setting up the show and he's wondering around and he's talking

1525
01:27:08.371 --> 01:27:09.910
about gout and it,

1526
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:13.310
he lost his mind 100% and that's when all that shit was going down.

1527
01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:16.790
I don't know what it should night involved.
Somehow something was going down,

1528
01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:20.660
I don't know.
Funny bit.
Got a funny bit and it's special.
You know,

1529
01:27:20.661 --> 01:27:24.320
you're fucked up when you're getting arrested and shook nights right next to
you.

1530
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:32.690
He's hilarious.
He's very funny.

1531
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:37.400
Very funny.
Before that happened,
he was on fire.
I couldn't wait to see him.

1532
01:27:37.401 --> 01:27:41.510
I'm so excited.
I love Cat Williams.
He's hilarious.
So good.
When he was on,

1533
01:27:41.511 --> 01:27:44.910
he was one of the best.
What about Pablo Francisco is,
he's still around.
Uh,

1534
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:48.440
I saw Pablo may be four or five months ago at the comedy store.
Yeah.

1535
01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:53.210
Tracy Morgan's back.
Teresa than that.
He's um,
he started doing standup again,

1536
01:27:53.211 --> 01:27:56.060
but I don't think he's torn.
I know he did the comedy cellar.

1537
01:27:56.090 --> 01:28:00.750
It was like the first time since the accident he did that place accident.

1538
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:01.603
Exactly.

1539
01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:06.560
They got hit by a guy who fell asleep while he was driving a semi Walmart.
Right.

1540
01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:11.780
Got Hit by a semi.
They got hit in their limo by semi.
Yeah.

1541
01:28:11.781 --> 01:28:14.060
And one of the guys with them died.
His boy died,

1542
01:28:14.061 --> 01:28:17.900
his buddy died and another guy has some pretty significant brain damage.

1543
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.420
And one of the other ones that is like,
he can't remember anything.

1544
01:28:20.421 --> 01:28:23.090
He's all fucked up.
And then cat,
our cat,

1545
01:28:23.170 --> 01:28:27.260
Tracy got a broken leg and some serious other injuries.

1546
01:28:27.261 --> 01:28:29.770
He got really jacked,
like real bad.
Like he's,

1547
01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:33.470
I think he's still walking with a cane.
Got a huge settlement.
He has,

1548
01:28:33.670 --> 01:28:38.270
he has a funny commercial for beats that can't be enough coma for a year.

1549
01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.660
I come out and they got these headphones.

1559
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.090
Now she's white.
She was on the podcast like,

She's smart.

1560
01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:22.270
She's brilliant.
She's very cool too.
She's at the comedy store all the time.
Um,

1561
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:25.980
I was going to say Sarah Silverman.
God Damn,
she's fine.
She know she's,

1562
01:29:25.981 --> 01:29:28.470
I mean she's always been funny,
but I saw her recent set,

1563
01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:31.470
but she did a set at the comedy store like maybe month and a half,

1564
01:29:31.471 --> 01:29:32.670
two months ago.
Sarah suffered

1565
01:29:35.730 --> 01:29:40.470
murdered.
She just super murdered.
She's,
and she's on right now.
You know,

1566
01:29:40.471 --> 01:29:43.620
comics go through like stages sometimes where they're inspired or maybe they're

1567
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:46.870
doing too much other shit,
like maybe doing some acting.

1568
01:29:46.871 --> 01:29:50.300
She broke into the big time a little bit for awhile there.
Um,
well she's doing,

1569
01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:54.900

1571
01:29:58.041 --> 01:30:00.480
it was on the flyer slash injures the piece too.

1572
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:03.600

I've run into her,

1573
01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:06.840
but I haven't seen her doing a set in a long time.
She went last comic standing.

1574
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:08.940
Yeah,

1575
01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:14.350
She has a podcast to Eliza.
I was first witnessed the,

1576
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:18.390

She's hilarious right now.
She's aware and she works hard.
Dude,

1577
01:30:18.391 --> 01:30:21.750
that girl grinds,
I always see her at the store going over notes.

1578
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:23.680
She's always like improving bits and it,

1579
01:30:23.690 --> 01:30:26.550
she doesn't like settle for the way a bit is.
She makes them better.

1580
01:30:26.551 --> 01:30:29.760
She twists them around.
She adds things or work ethic is cray cray.

1581
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:32.610
Well we talked about is like she comes from the world of athletics.

1582
01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.730
Like she's used to working hard.
She's,
we used to working hard for things,

1583
01:30:35.731 --> 01:30:39.180
you know,
like,
so she treats it like almost like a competitive thing.

1584
01:30:39.181 --> 01:30:41.550
Most people don't know.
I mean she's a writer for two broke girls.

1585
01:30:41.551 --> 01:30:44.700
She developed two broker.
She's an executive producer.
It's her show.

1586
01:30:45.610 --> 01:30:49.590
She said she's a gangster dude.
Yes,
she's does documentaries on the side.

1587
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:53.460
She contacted me about a documentary on violence,
on head trauma,

1588
01:30:53.461 --> 01:30:55.920
just do a documentary on the side for easy man,

1589
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:59.160
like Woo fucking directs documentaries on the side.
But we,

1590
01:30:59.161 --> 01:31:01.020
she's really open about how nuts she is.

1591
01:31:01.021 --> 01:31:04.740
So she needs to constantly fill our time with productive activities because

1592
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.200
productive things make her feel good about herself.

1593
01:31:07.201 --> 01:31:12.060
So she's addicted to progress.
Yeah,
pretty much.
She's really good.

1594
01:31:12.090 --> 01:31:14.310
She's smart as shit.
Dude.
I had to look up a couple of words.

1595
01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:17.160
I should drop some words on you like that,
but she's not fucking with you.

1596
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:20.430
She's not like her.
Yeah.
She's not doing it just to make you like,

1597
01:31:20.431 --> 01:31:24.270
when people drop a word on me and I know what they're doing and I go,

1598
01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:28.050
I know what you're doing.
But she was,

1635
01:33:40.150 --> 01:33:42.880
If you do that over a course of a few years,
you can build a market.

1636
01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.650
Like there was a couple of places that I did that,

1637
01:33:44.651 --> 01:33:48.100
like Houston before I ever had anything really going on.
Um,

1638
01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:50.410
but Tom was doing that and doing really well.

1639
01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.780
Then all of sudden he does his Netflix special.
Boom.

1640
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:55.890
Now he's selling out theaters.
That was the tip.
Yeah,

1641
01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:58.060
well he had the product,

1642
01:33:58.061 --> 01:34:01.030
he had the tiny comedy and Ari,

1643
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:05.500
Ari just sold out 1200 seats in Toronto.
Holy Shit.

1644
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:10.300
1200 seats you should fear.
That's incredibly no.
And I was like,

1645
01:34:10.301 --> 01:34:13.690
dude,
what was that like?
And we were talking about it.
He's like,
it's amazing.

1646
01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:17.680
Like Ari was ready to throw in the towel just a few years ago with life.

1647
01:34:18.050 --> 01:34:22.750
Whose lives suicidal.
Yeah,
he was unhappy,
you know.
And one of the things that,

1648
01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:26.010
I don't know,
I think pretty sure he's talked about this on the podcast,
but um,

1649
01:34:26.050 --> 01:34:28.570
he was taking Propecia and Propecia.

1650
01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:30.880
One of the side effects for some people is depression.

1651
01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.740
I fucking told Callen it's bad.

1652
01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.310
It's a depressing is cal and taking that shit and that's when he's been kind of

1653
01:34:36.311 --> 01:34:39.930
fucking him.
You see this here lately?
Yeah.
Shave his head.
I agree.

1654
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.440
He doesn't want to and wants to,

1655
01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:47.940
who wants to act and wants to stage it has to be on the stage.

1656
01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:52.090
The stage.
He doesn't wanna admit it,
but he loves it.
He's like,
I need to do it.

1657
01:34:52.091 --> 01:34:54.200
He loves good at it.
Keep doing it.
Make,

1658
01:34:54.201 --> 01:34:59.120
I'm on sitcoms and television shows and in um,
in,
in movies like those parts,

1659
01:34:59.121 --> 01:35:01.850
he does great.
Bachelor or not matched with the hangover.

1660
01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.080
Hang all this fucking funny.

1661
01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:07.970
It's really cause Chicago he'd fucking ripped my soul apart,
man.
His fucking,

1662
01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:12.020
he was on fire.
That's my point is that his standup is really what he's best at.

1663
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:16.400
Yeah.
That's his gift.
And the more,
it's like one of those things,

1664
01:35:16.401 --> 01:35:19.880
it's like he likes doing it,
but it's,
it's,
it's tricky.

1665
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:24.200
Like the more time you spend doing other things like acting,
like acting,

1666
01:35:24.201 --> 01:35:27.910
especially like 16 hour days on set,
that's a like if,

1667
01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.190
especially if you get a sitcom or something like that.
Yeah.

1668
01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:32.000
There's a lot of times we don't get to do stands out.

1669
01:35:32.001 --> 01:35:35.300
He's doing that are podcasts and motherfucker now with everything we got going

1670
01:35:35.301 --> 01:35:38.730
on,
just how often do you guys go wait two or three times a week and then we,

1671
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:40.620
we have the digital series,
which that,
you know,

1672
01:35:40.630 --> 01:35:45.470
that takes me doing two or three times a week.
Yeah.
Wow.
That's crazy,

1673
01:35:45.471 --> 01:35:47.960
isn't it?
Isn't it crazy that podcasting was just like a goof?

1674
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:52.280
Just to a little while ago,
just started his wife beaters in Brian's garage,

1675
01:35:52.281 --> 01:35:56.010
just like fucking around.
Like,
this is a terrible idea.
I don't want to do this.

1676
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:58.730
These things work to wife beaters,

1677
01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.880
these things work because you're fucking around like a show.

1678
01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:05.820
If this was produced on television,
right?
And your show was,
uh,

1679
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:07.790
someone came up to you and they said,
this is our idea.

1680
01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:10.830
We're going to dress you up in the finest fashions and we're going to light you.

1681
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:13.790
I'm going to put your makeup on and then we're going to tell you what to talk

1682
01:36:13.791 --> 01:36:14.624
about.
Ready?
Go.

1683
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:18.170
You'd never be able to call yourself big Dick bandaids and start singing stupid

1684
01:36:18.171 --> 01:36:21.320
songs and Kalyn would start singing a song about something and they would cut

1685
01:36:21.321 --> 01:36:24.890
you off.
Cut.
You can't,
it can't sing a song about the muscles in your back,

1686
01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:26.780
you know,
they would say,

1687
01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:30.350
but since it's just you guys and you're just fucking around,

1688
01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:34.070
then it becomes what it is.
And then after it becomes what it is,

1689
01:36:34.071 --> 01:36:37.670
it gets bigger and bigger until someone comes along and says,
Hey,
um,

1690
01:36:37.730 --> 01:36:41.540
why don't you guys do that for us?
It's crazy.
It's insane.
It is insane.

1691
01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:43.070
Oh you guys.
Thank baby.

1692
01:36:43.071 --> 01:36:45.170
Do you guys ever got to get in trouble for anything you say?

1693
01:36:45.690 --> 01:36:49.130
Not Fox because our numbers have been so good.
They're kind of just like,

1694
01:36:49.131 --> 01:36:49.970
let them do their thing.

1695
01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:54.140
I don't know if they like they tried to get you guys to stop swearing.
Oh yeah.

1696
01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:57.710
Which is hilarious.
Yes.
We had a meeting to like,

1697
01:36:57.711 --> 01:37:02.250
is there any way you can say Dick less and stop swearing?

1698
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:07.420
That means,
is that at all possible?
I mean kind of like,
no.
If you sensors,

1699
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:10.740
we got to go somewhere else.
They can't,
they can't do your thing.
They can't stop.

1700
01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.690
Once things get big,
they can't stop it.
It starts rolling.

1701
01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:19.370
They can't stop it and then once and then once you stop fighting for the UFC,

1702
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:23.870
nobody,
nobody can tell you what to do.
It's weird.
It's like now you can,

1703
01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:27.410
there's no strings.
You're like fucking Pinocchio.

1704
01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:31.550
Half up strings to hold me down to make me sad.

1705
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:35.090
But now I'm free.

1706
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:42.130
Hi Ho.
The mammy.
Oh,
nothing ever bothers me

1707
01:37:45.670 --> 01:37:48.920
to know.
It's weird man.

1708
01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.310
This time last year,
uh,
you know,

1709
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:56.340
I was trying to decide what the fuck I'm going to deal.
You know,

1710
01:37:56.610 --> 01:38:00.630
<v 3>it gets tricky man.
Trying to plot your life out.</v>

1711
01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:02.820
It's like when things start getting going,

1712
01:38:02.850 --> 01:38:05.090
then it's like once you find something and starts getting gone,

1713
01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:08.400
Dennis just fall through with it and stay on it and stay focused.

1714
01:38:08.401 --> 01:38:11.040
Stay the course.
But for a lot of people,
like young guys,

1715
01:38:11.041 --> 01:38:14.940
like I got a nephew and talking to my nephew about like what he wants to do.

1716
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:18.200
I'm like,
you got to find what you want.
Like what is it you'll want.
Yes.

1717
01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:22.530
But for a lot of people it's hard to find a thing and once you find a thing then

1718
01:38:22.531 --> 01:38:24.420
you're like,
fuck,
I'm going for it.
You know,

1719
01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:27.300
like once you find a thing and go for it.

1720
01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:29.490
But it's hard to find that thing for a lot of people.

1721
01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:33.510
And this is a lot of people that have a Gig.
So they have a thing that they love,

1722
01:38:33.511 --> 01:38:35.460
like maybe like tattooing or something like that.

1723
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:39.300
But they got this job so they can only tattoo on like Saturday mornings and

1724
01:38:39.301 --> 01:38:40.740
their wife gives him a hard time.

1725
01:38:40.741 --> 01:38:43.870
And then I'm thinking about becoming to talk to is oh ah.

1726
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:51.330
You know,
and they have a hard time ever finding their thing and making it a Gig.

1727
01:38:51.690 --> 01:38:53.730
So when you get something like what you guys have,

1728
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:57.330
you found a thing and it's taken off and now you're selling out of all these

1729
01:38:57.331 --> 01:38:59.960
shows.
Like you guys are killing it everywhere.
Yeah.

1730
01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:02.760
They're selling out everywhere.
They're selling out all over the country.

1731
01:39:02.761 --> 01:39:05.880
They do these live fire in the kitchen.
I see.
I follow them on Instagram.

1732
01:39:05.881 --> 01:39:09.790
You know what?
Uh,
I like your flyer.
That was my favorite so far.

1733
01:39:09.791 --> 01:39:14.791
Has Your face on Collins and his face on your head?

1734
01:39:15.451 --> 01:39:20.310
Hideous Alex fucking freaky.
That uh,
someone Photoshop that fan.

1735
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:24.600
Is it Photoshop stone?
I don't know who it was.
It might be,
I don't know.
Yeah,

1736
01:39:24.601 --> 01:39:28.720
cause it's really good.
It was weird.
I was like,
Bob,

1737
01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:31.080
you thinking like I look like a pedophile.

1738
01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:35.620
I looked like they sell subway sandwiches.
I look terrible.
I look terrible.
Yeah,

1739
01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:39.680
things are good man.
We barely talked about fighting.
You know what's interesting?

1740
01:39:39.690 --> 01:39:40.930
We haven't at all great whites.

1741
01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:44.040
You know it's interesting man is how the UFC hasn't done their own podcast yet.

1742
01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:46.620
Like we talked,
I talked to them about doing it a while back.

1743
01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.360
I think there was some mention about it,

1744
01:39:48.361 --> 01:39:51.060
but I think the swearing thing was also an issue with them.

1745
01:39:51.630 --> 01:39:53.190
Like there was some concern.

1746
01:39:53.850 --> 01:39:58.770
Meanwhile Terena swears they're all podcasts as far anymore.
That's just there.

1747
01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:01.050
He doesn't anymore.
Father said,
bitch please.

1748
01:40:01.051 --> 01:40:03.740
He very rarely swears like he used to like you,

1749
01:40:03.741 --> 01:40:06.720
you know you used to have those press conferences and he would swear.

1750
01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:11.230
I think he probably still does a little every now and then maybe beer.

1751
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:15.450
But I think he also realizes it just causes more problems than it is.

1752
01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:19.500
It's like the freedom that you get from speaking your mind saying whatever you

1753
01:40:19.501 --> 01:40:22.860
want.
It's almost like it's not worth it because it causes so many,

1754
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:25.330
so many hassles.
And so many fires that you have to put in.

1755
01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:27.680
You want to be taken serious.
You don't see like,
uh,

1756
01:40:27.710 --> 01:40:30.180
you know Roger Goodell cussing about Tom Brady.

1757
01:40:30.410 --> 01:40:34.620
I don't think people would look at the sport if you kept doing that.
That's true.

1758
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:39.570
Well,
you know what,
man,
I don't want his job.
Dana White's job is fucking brutal.

1759
01:40:39.571 --> 01:40:43.290
That guy works so hard and he's constantly working and shit is constantly

1760
01:40:43.291 --> 01:40:47.610
falling apart.
There's always constantly like a new blow out,
a new,
this,
a new,

1761
01:40:47.611 --> 01:40:51.570
that a new fucking fire he has to put out.
It never stops.
It never ends.

1762
01:40:52.410 --> 01:40:54.100
That's a,
it's a pays

1763
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:57.000
<v 1>well,
but like 40 million a year.
That's pretty good.
Yeah.</v>

1764
01:40:57.010 --> 01:41:00.290
I don't know what it pays.
I never asked figure things out.
What'd you,
you fight?

1765
01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:04.660
You take that Gig?
Uh,
no you wouldn't.
You'd go right back to podcasting

1766
01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:11.140
podcast everywhere
though,
right there.

1767
01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:12.760
Well,
I think,
you know,
I mean,

1768
01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.830
I like the freedom to do what the fuck I want to do.

1769
01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:18.610
You wouldn't get that kind of money unless you did what he did,

1770
01:41:18.611 --> 01:41:20.980
which was like build it from the beginning,

1771
01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:23.980
but you don't get that money if you come in as a fucking executive now,

1772
01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:25.690
like if they got to hire some new guy,

1773
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:30.520
the guys getting a good salary,
I'll make some good money.

1774
01:41:30.521 --> 01:41:34.380
But the Dana white effect is when the sport is like nonexistent.

1775
01:41:34.530 --> 01:41:39.390
He got to rich friends,
rich friends,
they put up mad cash,
they lose a fuckload.

1776
01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:43.210
They were 44 million in the hole before it turns around with the ultimate

1777
01:41:43.211 --> 01:41:45.340
fighter and then it takes off and becomes this giant support.

1778
01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:49.900
The rich friends were key though.
Gigantic,
not just rich friends,

1779
01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.840
but Eddie and I talked about this.
It's almost like,

1780
01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:58.330
it's almost like we're in a movie because we would always say the same thing.

1781
01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.700
We would always say the same thing.
What we'll used to say.

1782
01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:04.690
There's no way the sport isn't going to take over.
It's impossible.
Yeah,

1783
01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:06.100
but what did we say?
We said,

1784
01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:10.900
this is what the sport needs to super rich dudes that are worth billions of

1785
01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:11.740
dollars that don't give a fuck.

1786
01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:15.500
Just throw all this money at the sport and make it big.
Yup.

1787
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:18.850
And that's exactly what happened.
Found them.
That's exactly what happened.

1788
01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.440
And they fucked up along the way.

1789
01:42:20.441 --> 01:42:23.530
They hired Carmen Electra to be their spokesperson at one point in time.
See,

1790
01:42:23.531 --> 01:42:27.460
I dug that.
Remember that?
Oh yeah,
I dug that.
Was Paris Hilton involved as well?

1791
01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:30.810
No.
What?
No,
he's coming with that date.
Yeah.
No,

1792
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:36.130
they really draw the line.
So I don't even think chuck was press was,
uh,
the,
um,

1793
01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:39.850
the,
the king back then.
I think chuck wasn't the champion.
I think Tito was,

1794
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:41.190
I mean,
you gotta mix things out.

1795
01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:44.740
Remember when they had girls to impose flight interviews for awhile?

1796
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:49.010
I'm sure it did.
They had a few,
that was funny.
I forget who they were.

1797
01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.130
Very nice girl.

1798
01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:54.410
So it's Carmen Electra with Tito and [inaudible] do,

1799
01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:59.110
she was a dime piece.
It was like light,
light,
heavyweight.
Vidor fuck.

1800
01:42:59.111 --> 01:43:03.670
Yes.
Yeah.
Wow.
Crazy.
I am not mad at that.

1801
01:43:05.710 --> 01:43:09.160
Yeah.
Interesting.
Um,
they tried a bunch of different things.

1802
01:43:09.161 --> 01:43:12.640
He just tried to get people to pay attention to it and it wasn't until the

1803
01:43:12.641 --> 01:43:15.910
ultimate fighter.
What's crazy is the ultimate fighter almost didn't even made,

1804
01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:18.310
almost didn't get made.
They had to pay for the whole thing.

1805
01:43:18.330 --> 01:43:20.380
It's basically like a giant infomercial.
Right.

1806
01:43:20.381 --> 01:43:22.270
They had to essentially pay with spike TV.

1807
01:43:22.271 --> 01:43:24.290
Nobody give a fuck about spike TV back time.

1808
01:43:24.850 --> 01:43:28.300
And then they put together this show and they're losing so much fucking money.

1809
01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:30.520
Yeah.
Take risks though.
And then um,

1810
01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:34.480
they get to the finals and Forrest Griffin is fight and Stephan Bonner and the

1811
01:43:34.481 --> 01:43:37.480
whole fucking world tunes and then it takes off.

1812
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:41.860
It just grows.
It was like the seed that got planted.
Look at that.

1813
01:43:41.861 --> 01:43:46.770
Carlos Newton who pull,
forget Randy.
We get Isil.

1814
01:43:47.290 --> 01:43:51.800
Oh my goodness.
Pedro,
his L.
Wow.
Civ Pedro just fought his last fight.

1815
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.140
Just retired a couple of months ago.
Get ready for a lesson in submission.

1816
01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:00.590
That's a fucking,
that's the whole leg.

1817
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:06.560
That's the biggest moose knuckle 11 knuckle.
That's the whole thigh.
It's a moose.

1818
01:44:06.561 --> 01:44:10.820
Ham to CI is a design.
She was very hot.

1819
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:13.400
Which is very nice too.
I did a spike TV thing with her.

1820
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:17.180
We hosted this car show together.
She's super like down to earth.

1821
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:21.980
She's really nice.
She married now.
I don't know,
I'm not a gossip pound.

1822
01:44:22.730 --> 01:44:26.720
Jamie is,
I'll ask him.
He probably knows she taken to them.
She's older.

1823
01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:32.300
She's probably still hot as fuck.
Oh I agree.
She did post fight interviews.
Right.

1824
01:44:32.301 --> 01:44:34.310
And didn't like there was a playboy playmate.

1825
01:44:35.890 --> 01:44:40.320
There was another one I forgot Casey case.
His daughter did carry case him.
Yeah.

1826
01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:44.240
You know,
you gotta try and get a swing.
You're not doing,
they were just,

1827
01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:47.480
they were doing a bunch of different things.
They got on best damn sports show.

1828
01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:50.900
Remember that?
Yes.
And uh,
Leanne Tweeten,
uh,

1829
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:53.450
did a part of that as well.
It was also

1830
01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:59.690
super nice too.
She's super cool.
Very smart,
too smart.
She's very,

1831
01:44:59.691 --> 01:45:02.990
she's fucking sharp.
So she was a,
she,

1832
01:45:02.991 --> 01:45:06.730
but she was only involved in one because it was with best damn sports show.
Well,

1833
01:45:06.750 --> 01:45:09.740
what's up with,
I don't know if you can talk in a jail cause dominant.

1834
01:45:09.741 --> 01:45:12.320
They trying now we're this,
the first time ever had a main event.

1835
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:14.950
They had Dominick Cruz in there with the three.
It was awesome.

1836
01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:18.620
I would like to do it with them all the time.
He's fucking great.
He's great.

1837
01:45:18.621 --> 01:45:21.230
And he got me fired up.
We did the smart dude.
He's great.

1838
01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.730
He's a smart dude and he's,
his knowledge of MMA is just fucking outstanding,

1839
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.900
especially footwork and positioning and,
and,
and striking technician.

1840
01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:34.940
Super Technical.
And we,
uh,
did the Fox sports prelims together or the,
excuse me,

1841
01:45:34.941 --> 01:45:37.700
the fight pass prelims together and you look at for the joint,

1842
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:45.230
where's the line?
Um,

1843
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:48.260
we did the F I was one right in front of you,
dude.
Oh Shit.

1844
01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:53.330
We did the fs one,
no fog,
fight pass,
fight,
pass,

1845
01:45:53.331 --> 01:45:56.480
prelims together,
three prelims.
And he was outstanding man.

1846
01:45:56.510 --> 01:46:01.070
And we also did a lot of talking back stage.
He and I talked,
um,
we,
uh,
we,

1847
01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:05.380
we shared philosophies.
No,
I'm good dude.
We were talking about,
um,
uh,

1848
01:46:05.410 --> 01:46:08.520
upcoming matchups like how we thought about this fight or that fight and what
he,

1849
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:13.190
he really favored cowboy over a dos Anjos which I thought was interesting.

1850
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:16.700
I think.
Yeah,
I think a lot of people did.
Yeah,
I thought it was,

1851
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:18.410
who the fuck knows.
Fight me too.

1852
01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:21.530
I felt like do with the pressure that dos Anjos put on Pedis.

1853
01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:24.260
I felt like that's gonna fuck with anybody man.
I agree.

1854
01:46:24.261 --> 01:46:28.300
It can be tough to beat that guy.
Very tough.
Yup.

1855
01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:33.500
He's on the ground so I'm going to have to catch him when he's making that mad

1856
01:46:33.501 --> 01:46:33.891
charge.

1857
01:46:33.891 --> 01:46:37.160
And I think someone with like the kind of footwork that Connor has might have

1858
01:46:37.161 --> 01:46:40.770
the best chance,
but we're going to,
if those to do match up,

1859
01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:43.610
you're going to see pressure that Connor's never experienced before.

1860
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:48.050
And he's also got hot fail Codero which,
who's a phenomenal striking coach.

1861
01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:48.980
One of the best in the world.

1862
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.940
He's going to break down like what Connor's doing and Connor's movement tracking

1863
01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:53.910
him down.
You're right.

1864
01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:56.670
Cause we haven't seen enough footage to really break that down and we haven't

1865
01:46:56.671 --> 01:47:00.180
seen Connor would that pressure.
You know what I'm saying?
The other thing is,

1866
01:47:00.181 --> 01:47:03.330
is when Connor hits people that left hand,
it's game over.
Oh,

1867
01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:08.070
I don't think it's game over for Dos Anjos he's too big.
My Guy.
It might be,

1868
01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:09.013
but yeah,
that's tough.

1869
01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:12.000
You're talking about a different weight class now at the power.

1870
01:47:12.210 --> 01:47:15.840
Does he take the power totally into the lightweights and then he loses it at

1871
01:47:15.841 --> 01:47:16.241
welterweight?

1872
01:47:16.241 --> 01:47:19.410
Could he's still knock out welterweights will be knocked down versus a knocked

1873
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:22.920
out Benson and Benson is fighting welter weight and he fought Brandon thatch and

1874
01:47:22.921 --> 01:47:24.300
fact.
She's a big fucker.

1875
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:28.020
He's big and he hits hard as a welterweight and it and put away Benson.

1876
01:47:28.290 --> 01:47:31.110
But dos Anjos did Dosantos just fucked him up.

1877
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:33.090
He was the first guy to stop Benson.
Yes.

1878
01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:37.140
Dosantos has like the kind of power that he takes wherever.

1879
01:47:37.141 --> 01:47:40.380
Like he probably won 55 is probably optimum.

1880
01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:42.630
He does look very thin though on the weigh ins.

1881
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:46.020
He's definitely suck in some weight,
but no ivs either now.

1882
01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:48.920
But he looked amazing.
Amazing.
You know,

1883
01:47:48.930 --> 01:47:52.110
and the other thing is like people are talking about people looking different,

1884
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:56.280
um,
before the,
the ped scare or before the,
uh,
the testing.

1885
01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:59.580
He can't say that about him.
He looks exactly the same.
He looks better than ever.

1886
01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.380
I agree.
And you also,

1887
01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.530
there's no radical change from the first time he was in the UFC.

1888
01:48:04.531 --> 01:48:06.210
What you see with dos Anjos is a slow,

1889
01:48:06.211 --> 01:48:09.930
steady progression until like the nick curse on days.

1890
01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:14.350
Then you see like a little,
a little stronger,
a little faster,
like,

1891
01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:19.050
and then you see the um,
the Pettis fight,
just phenomenal cardio.

1892
01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.660
That's the thing that blew me away the most about that fight.

1893
01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:25.860
The amount of cardio that he had to have to put that pace on pedes for five

1894
01:48:25.861 --> 01:48:29.180
rounds.
I mean that's just,
you got to be in insane conditions.

1895
01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:30.330
We tough to beat that guy.

1896
01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.020
Then you find out that in that fight for the two weeks before the fight,

1897
01:48:34.021 --> 01:48:37.080
he fucked his knee up.
He had to do airdyne sprints.

1898
01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:39.660
That's all he did for like the two weeks before the fight.

1899
01:48:39.661 --> 01:48:44.070
He couldn't do any sparring and bill put it to them since like there was nothing

1900
01:48:44.071 --> 01:48:48.240
wrong.
And then you saw him in this fight.
100% healthy.
He's a fucking monster.

1901
01:48:48.810 --> 01:48:51.960
I've talked to Ryan Parsons about him and Brian Parson said he was telling him

1902
01:48:51.961 --> 01:48:55.590
two years ago,
he's like,
if you keep going,
you are the champion of the world.

1903
01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.750
Like it's just a matter of time.
Ryan Gnosis Shit.

1904
01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:01.350
Ryan knows his shit and Ryan was telling me he was watching him and no names but

1905
01:49:01.351 --> 01:49:02.820
just fuck dudes up.

1906
01:49:03.090 --> 01:49:07.740
Dudes that are like really high level UFC caliber fighters and dos Anjos just

1907
01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:09.800
fucking them up in the gym.
He's,
he's,

1908
01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:13.850
he's a horrible matchup for anyone including college.
It's a tough matchup.

1909
01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.790
Well he's your tie with that pressure and can grapple and nasty power man's

1910
01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:19.680
powers,
nasty.
There's question is,

1911
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:24.660
would he be able to have that same kind of approach on Connor who's very
elusive,

1912
01:49:24.661 --> 01:49:27.920
very light on his feet.
Like you see what we saw with the Aldo fight,
how he's,

1913
01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.080
he's moving,
he's moving back,
he's throwing side kick to the legs.

1914
01:49:31.081 --> 01:49:32.580
He's moving back.
Like,

1915
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:37.790
would he be able to just do what he did with cowboy to uh,

1916
01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:40.860
to Connor?
Will you be able to do that same approach?

1917
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:43.860
Like look for that straight shot.
He throws that straight left hand a lot.

1918
01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:46.470
The other thing to take into consideration,
this is a big thing,

1919
01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:51.380
is that this will be Connor fighting a southpaw,
a super dangerous southpaw.
Sure.

1920
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:54.040
And one of the things about southwest,
fuck you up,
man.

1921
01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:57.280
They confuse the shit out of you.
Everything is coming from the wrong side.

1922
01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:01.390
Everything's weird that the,
the right hand is now the jab.

1923
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:05.110
The Jab is the right hand.
Like why there's a lot of huge factors.
Yeah.
Ey,

1924
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:07.860
it can dos Anjos deal with Connor speed.

1925
01:50:08.230 --> 01:50:12.460
Does Conor have the knockout power at 55 against a bigger guy?
I think he does.

1926
01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:16.730
I think he does because he's not going as much weight and his power.

1927
01:50:16.731 --> 01:50:21.340
So substantial and angles.
He surprising guys with his ankles.
Yeah.
There's,

1928
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:25.090
there's a lot that goes into that fight man.
And again,

1929
01:50:25.091 --> 01:50:27.460
I'm not taking theme of Dos Anjos.
He's amazing champion.

1930
01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:31.120
I don't know if that's the marquee fight though.
As crazy as that sounds.

1931
01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:33.220
But here's what the thing,

1932
01:50:33.221 --> 01:50:36.880
it might be after Fox because you got to think that UFC on Fox,

1933
01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:41.490
you got millions of people to watch and we saw a destroyer and doe Sandra,

1934
01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:43.420
what did we talk to him about?
What's everyone talking about?

1935
01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:45.520
Diaz you are talking about Dhea.
So it is true.

1936
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:48.030
That is true because of that post fight interview.

1937
01:50:48.410 --> 01:50:52.360
But I still think people were talking about those angels too a little bit cause

1938
01:50:52.361 --> 01:50:56.470
he just Kinda merch cowboy and they both work.
But Nate Diaz,

1939
01:50:57.270 --> 01:51:01.990
uh,
just,
you know,
does San Joe's has the belt,
you got daddy,
you know,

1940
01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:06.220
but it makes sense that you go with Nate Diaz because of all the ship talk and

1941
01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:09.760
all that.
And maybe that makes sense.
And,
and also,
you know,

1942
01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:11.410
you maybe,
you know,

1943
01:51:11.411 --> 01:51:15.220
some people say you can't go up in weight and get in and contend for the belt

1944
01:51:15.221 --> 01:51:19.930
right away.
It's a good a fight before it does.
The thing is it puts one,

1945
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:22.630
a 45 in limbo.
The,
yeah.

1946
01:51:22.690 --> 01:51:26.110
The one of the things about the UFC though is they don't give up.
Fuck,

1947
01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:27.710
you don't have to follow the rule.

1948
01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:32.940
One of the good things about not being constrained by like a WBC and Ibf like

1949
01:51:33.131 --> 01:51:34.420
boxing good and bad.
Yeah.

1950
01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:36.640
Well they were talking about the Vladimir Klitschko fight.

1951
01:51:36.641 --> 01:51:41.641
Did they stripped Vladimir of not Tyson fury fury who beat Wladimir Klitschko

1952
01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:44.980
they stripped him of one of his titles like immediately cause he didn't want to

1953
01:51:44.981 --> 01:51:46.870
fight the mandatory number one contender.

1954
01:51:46.990 --> 01:51:49.380
So the immediately stripped him like within two weeks,
right?
Yeah.

1955
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:53.550
It's like really quick and that wouldn't have it in the UFC just not going to

1956
01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:54.910
happen.
And in the UFC,

1957
01:51:54.911 --> 01:51:59.520
like there's the mandatory contender is whoever the fuck they say.
Yeah,
yeah.

1958
01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.460
If they say yes,

1959
01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:06.480
this is all about making money and Nate Diaz some fun and I have no complaints

1960
01:52:07.301 --> 01:52:10.990
about that.
I like that.
Yeah.
But if you are a fighter that would drive you crazy,

1961
01:52:11.050 --> 01:52:13.450
it drive you fucking now the viewer number one.

1962
01:52:13.630 --> 01:52:16.690
But if you are the number one contender like Frankie Edgar and you'd been beaten

1963
01:52:16.691 --> 01:52:19.720
dude's acids and you've been fucking up everybody and you can just knocked out

1964
01:52:19.721 --> 01:52:24.721
Chad Mendez in spectacular fashion and before that you beat Uriah Faber clearly

1965
01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:28.030
and then beat the brakes off cub Swanson and submitted fifth.

1966
01:52:28.050 --> 01:52:32.920
Remember light champ and before that you beat the fuck out of paint j pen.

1967
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:33.783
It's normal but it's,

1968
01:52:33.810 --> 01:52:36.610
but it's not going to happen right now and it should happen right now.

1969
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:40.000
If you're Frankie Edgar and you've been a respectful guy who just been going out

1970
01:52:40.001 --> 01:52:43.750
there and fighting his ass off and beating guys asses,
you're like,

1971
01:52:43.751 --> 01:52:46.730
that fucking guy deserves his at the title about Josie,

1972
01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:50.540
he gets fucked out of all this.
Yup.
My bad.
I was undefeated for 10 years,

1973
01:52:50.690 --> 01:52:54.440
one of the best champions of all time and I don't deserve a shot.
Nope.

1974
01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:58.010
You know what?
Here's the thing about that because here's the problem with that.

1975
01:52:58.011 --> 01:53:01.190
The only problem with that is in business,
Connor can fight right away.

1976
01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:04.610
Connor knocked him out with one punch.
He's fine.
Josie,

1977
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:09.440
for all intents and purposes should take a long time off like you're least five

1978
01:53:09.441 --> 01:53:12.430
or six months.
Right.
Agree.
He has to,
I mean you,

1979
01:53:12.431 --> 01:53:14.150
you really should because if you don't,

1980
01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:18.050
you got flatlined like that and you come back quick.
We all know what happens.

1981
01:53:18.150 --> 01:53:21.320
You can't take a shot.
So when he's healthy he should get a shot.

1982
01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:26.270
But this is where it does like contractual agreements have to fall into play

1983
01:53:26.271 --> 01:53:28.410
when it comes to champions.
Right.
Because,
uh,

1984
01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:30.500
if this was any other like situation,

1985
01:53:30.501 --> 01:53:34.070
like I guarantee you if Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao,

1986
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:37.310
if Floyd Mayweather,
they got knocked out by Manny Pacquiao,

1987
01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:40.640
there's gotta be some shit in the contract that says that Floyd gets an

1988
01:53:40.641 --> 01:53:43.610
immediate rematch and he gets it within,
I think he said he is,

1989
01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:48.140
I know what the contract was.
So if Manny one,
there have to be two more fights.

1990
01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:52.580
If Manny one,
if Floyd went,
there's no more fight in con Delta contract.

1991
01:53:52.581 --> 01:53:57.350
They signed.
How well you would think that all though would,
but you can't,

1992
01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:00.010
it's not that they don't have the power.
That's the thing goes,

1993
01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:03.200
here's your contract,
sign it.
There you go,
and you're going to get paid.

1994
01:54:03.201 --> 01:54:06.320
And I'm sure he got paid.
I'm sure he made 1 million bucks at least.
Although,

1995
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:11.210
yeah.
How much do you think Conor man,
oh,
he probably made guessing.

1996
01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:15.770
I would guess that that's what I've been,
I've never,
I haven't asked.

1997
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:18.720
I know too much that I can't talk about and I,

1998
01:54:18.850 --> 01:54:22.580
but I haven't asked his actual sour,
but he got paid a lot of money.

1999
01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:25.990
I would guarantee you.
But he wants even more than it deserves more now.
I mean,

2000
01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:28.150
shouldn't fight for anything less than 20 million dude.
He,

2001
01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:32.600
he shows a photo of his underwear on Instagram.
It gets 100,000 likes.
I mean,

2002
01:54:32.601 --> 01:54:34.970
he can do whatever.
He was the biggest star we were head.
If I'm Connor,

2003
01:54:34.971 --> 01:54:38.390
I'm in his management and I don't give a fuck what his current contract is.

2004
01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:41.110
I say,
I'm not doing anything till I get 20 million of flight.

2005
01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:44.840
He was a giant star before he knocked out all don't.
Now he's a mega star.

2006
01:54:44.841 --> 01:54:46.640
He's like,
he's eating sons.

2007
01:54:46.690 --> 01:54:49.690
He's the biggest thing we've ever wallowing up galaxies.
Three,

2008
01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:54.710
three ass has called them out every three in one car one night.
Yeah.

2009
01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:59.800
Dos Anjos um,
uh,
Nate and Charles Olivera,
he's,

2010
01:54:59.830 --> 01:55:02.750
he's the Floyd Mayweather of the UFC right now.

2011
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:05.090
Everyone wants to fight them for the seat for the payday.

2012
01:55:05.190 --> 01:55:08.660
But he's way different though because he's knocking guys,
not the same fighter.

2013
01:55:08.661 --> 01:55:12.170
I'm saying as far as you want to fight him to make that money.
Yeah.

2014
01:55:12.171 --> 01:55:13.280
But even that,
like,

2015
01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:17.810
do you ever remember a boxing match where three winners called out Mayweather?

2016
01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:21.410
Like that's never happened before.
This is like everybody sees like,

2017
01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:26.110
they're all like your shirt,
scrooge McDuck scrooge McDuck like,
come on son.

2018
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:32.750
It's true man.
Never seen anything like it.
You know,
they want all the stardom.

2019
01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:33.710
They want all the perks.

2020
01:55:33.711 --> 01:55:36.410
They want all the cash and they want and they think that they could beat him.

2021
01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:40.120
Look at that.
This is hilarious.
Yeah.
He says that,
uh,

2022
01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:44.040
people think that it was a,
it was a clean knockout,

2023
01:55:44.041 --> 01:55:46.170
but it's actually a fight against multiple attackers.

2024
01:55:46.171 --> 01:55:48.630
How he's hipping away from a big John.

2025
01:55:48.930 --> 01:55:53.910
These were big John [inaudible] in the face.
Now he didn't even in the face.

2026
01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:58.120
I seen it.
His Shin brushed over the top of all those face.

2027
01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:00.570
It looks like he hit him hard.
John's the best in the business.

2028
01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:02.550
That's crazy to look at it isn't it?

2029
01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:06.840
That he just knocked them dead with one shot saying wack.

2030
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:12.350
It's interesting that there's this new emergence of this one guy who shit talks

2031
01:56:15.150 --> 01:56:19.230
and it sort of changes everyone's approach.
Boy,
did we need him though?
Oh my boy.

2032
01:56:19.231 --> 01:56:22.020
You did the UFC need.
Everybody needed him every,
every,
I mean,

2033
01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:26.760
I think the Ireland needed him to,
you know,
they needed like a hero,

2034
01:56:26.761 --> 01:56:30.930
like this world needed.
Um,
the,
well,
the UFC,

2035
01:56:30.990 --> 01:56:34.550
the UFC is a better place with Conor McGregor.
I can't say that about sliders,

2036
01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:38.240
but here's the thing,
okay.
When we talk about like Rhonda,
right?

2037
01:56:38.241 --> 01:56:42.900
Like Rhonda did a lot of shit talking to and Rhonda was over the top
personality,

2038
01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.830
but when she lost,
like there was so much hate against her,

2039
01:56:46.831 --> 01:56:50.040
so much backlash for her behavior.
She brought down her.
She did.

2040
01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:55.280
But my point is Holly emerges as this perfect opposite of that.

2041
01:56:55.770 --> 01:56:58.260
Perfect opposite of that.
She's super nice,

2042
01:56:58.410 --> 01:57:01.320
like she's really friendly and respectful and it's legit.

2043
01:57:01.530 --> 01:57:04.620
Like when you talked to her,
no,
there's no fakeness off camera.

2044
01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:05.820
She's exactly the same way.

2045
01:57:05.821 --> 01:57:10.560
Super confident and also like really nervous about letting anything guild who

2046
01:57:10.561 --> 01:57:13.170
her head like she's talking about I want to get back in the gym.

2047
01:57:13.171 --> 01:57:15.930
I don't want to hate her dude.
She's like,
I don't even want to talk about this.

2048
01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:19.080
I don't even like all this attention because I don't want to get carried away.

2049
01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:24.210
But isn't that like that?
Do UFC needs that too?
Like the UFC needs.

2050
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.080
Someone comes along like Holly now and they also need someone who comes along

2051
01:57:28.081 --> 01:57:33.081
and shows the multifaceted approach of MMA that we all know and and see every

2052
01:57:33.801 --> 01:57:38.040
day in the men's divisions is now making its way to the women's division at a

2053
01:57:38.041 --> 01:57:38.910
very high level.

2054
01:57:39.330 --> 01:57:42.720
Instead of having the one person like hoist Gracie was and the early UFC is

2055
01:57:42.721 --> 01:57:45.660
would dominate with Jujitsu.
Right.
Nobody knew what the fuck was going on.

2056
01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:48.630
He would dominate.
Nobody else could keep up with them.
Technique wise,

2057
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:51.060
there's a very similar situation with Rhonda.

2058
01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:53.670
Rhonda is dominating all these girls with armbars.

2059
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:56.130
Everybody knows the arm bars are coming,
they can't stop it.

2060
01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:57.360
So she starts to evolve.

2061
01:57:57.361 --> 01:58:00.990
Her game starts knocking out people like Sarah McMahon and Alexis Davis and her

2062
01:58:00.991 --> 01:58:04.560
game starts to evolve and then someone comes along who has the perfect solution

2063
01:58:04.561 --> 01:58:04.981
for that.

2064
01:58:04.981 --> 01:58:08.640
And that perfect solution is very similar to what we saw in the men's divisions

2065
01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:10.740
when men learn how to sprawl and brawl,

2066
01:58:10.741 --> 01:58:13.800
and we saw worldclass kickboxers like story Smith.
Yes.

2067
01:58:14.130 --> 01:58:17.130
When Maury Smith into the UFC against Mark Coleman and we went,

2068
01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:19.140
oh look at this,

2069
01:58:19.290 --> 01:58:21.930
and then we see this sort of progression and now you see you in the women's

2070
01:58:21.931 --> 01:58:26.010
division in the women's division too.
It's like girls wanting to fight Ronda,

2071
01:58:26.011 --> 01:58:29.220
but they weren't.
It's not like the Connor effect where if you fight Conor,

2072
01:58:29.250 --> 01:58:33.900
you're making fucking bank.
The girls,
a lot of them,
they got smoked so fast,

2073
01:58:33.901 --> 01:58:36.990
they got maybe a couple hundred grand,
maybe not,
not even that,

2074
01:58:37.170 --> 01:58:40.200
and just get smoked.
It was more of the Rhonda Show,
you know what I'm saying?

2075
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:43.660
It was a different animal.
Well shoes that dominant,
she was that dominant.

2076
01:58:43.661 --> 01:58:47.800
And I don't think you can compare at all competition wise,

2077
01:58:47.801 --> 01:58:52.801
what's available to a man's hundred 45 pound champion versus a women's 135

2078
01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:58.390
close.
That's why when people,
Ali Frazier,
no,
it's not even a car.
There's nowhere,

2079
01:58:58.391 --> 01:59:01.990
nothing like it.
There's some good talent in the division is shaping up.

2080
01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:04.710
You've got that new Russian check that just entered the multiple,

2081
01:59:04.711 --> 01:59:09.340
like she's a 17 time boy twirled Moy Thai champion.
She,
she,
she be sorry.

2082
01:59:09.341 --> 01:59:11.050
And Jay check 17,

2083
01:59:12.250 --> 01:59:16.600
17 different titles and org different organizations that the chick that Sarah

2084
01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:19.330
Kaufman I didn't notice was that earns that sound difference.
Yes.

2085
01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:22.800
She fought Sarah crop on an eight days,
knows crapping out crap with her.
Yeah.

2086
01:59:23.090 --> 01:59:27.040
And she just kept,
stayed in the gym.
Luckily she was in pretty good shape,

2087
01:59:27.041 --> 01:59:29.290
but to take a fight on TV,

2088
01:59:29.530 --> 01:59:33.100
seven days notice for the women's division,
she really good.
And her,

2089
01:59:33.101 --> 01:59:37.990
her striking is fucking super high level,
super high level striking.
And,
uh,

2090
01:59:37.991 --> 01:59:40.810
you know the,
you're going to see those is my point.
You're going to see these,

2091
01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:44.560
these Maury Smith types that now the enter into MMA.

2092
01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:47.140
You're going to see the Kira Gracie's like grace Gracie doesn't want to do it.

2093
01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:49.150
Like,
I don't think she has a desire to do MMA,

2094
01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:51.220
but you're going to see someone die.
She stopped training.

2095
01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:53.960
I don't think she wants a fight.
I don't know if she's a fighter.

2096
01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:58.720
She's been training.
She's so pretty.
She's smart.
She would just keep training.

2097
01:59:58.750 --> 02:00:02.470
Yeah,
I read them.
I don't start saying that.
She's not into fighting now.

2098
02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:04.300
Not Anymore.
I mean maybe it was just a bad,

2099
02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:06.940
I don't know what translation she changed your mind.
I don't know.

2100
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:08.830
I know she was into it for awhile,

2101
02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:11.590
but I dunno end if we haven't heard anything from her,

2102
02:00:11.591 --> 02:00:14.500
it's probably a smart thing right on her behalf.

2103
02:00:14.501 --> 02:00:16.290
Just disappear and go train for a few years.

2104
02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:20.830
But just imagine if you get someone like a female Gary Tonin who decides like,

2105
02:00:20.831 --> 02:00:23.230
you know what,
I'm just going to start strangling bitches.

2106
02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:24.880
I'm just going to make my way into MMA.

2107
02:00:24.881 --> 02:00:27.090
And these girls can't fuck with my jujitsu noise.

2108
02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:31.680
What if you get a Serena Williams?
Exactly.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.

2109
02:00:31.681 --> 02:00:33.580
Somebody like,
let me see the arm bar.
Got It.

2110
02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.170
But dues just ripping bitches faces off.
Yeah.
If you get to that level,

2111
02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:42.760
that level athlete who commits to it or a Marion Jones like and they go,
wait,

2112
02:00:42.761 --> 02:00:45.370
I can make money over here.
Yeah,
I'm going to do this.

2113
02:00:45.450 --> 02:00:48.460
How about one of was track and field chicks and teach him how to kick.

2114
02:00:49.150 --> 02:00:53.010
Good fucking Lord know that's the big thing is about all the ticks us,

2115
02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:55.420
but that was one of the things about Aldo.
You know all,

2116
02:00:55.421 --> 02:00:56.770
they'll start off playing soccer.

2117
02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:59.920
It's one of the reasons why he's fucking leg kicks were so nasty.
Anchor.

2118
02:00:59.921 --> 02:01:03.640
Then Jujitsu and then he started picking up,
stand up.

2119
02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:09.040
His leg kicks were fucking ridiculous and it's because of this kind of fuck that

2120
02:01:09.041 --> 02:01:13.210
he gets kind of left out of it.
He's like,
he gets fucked in this.
What?

2121
02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:17.260
What do you do when a guy gets knocked out like that in 13 seconds in the

2122
02:01:17.261 --> 02:01:19.540
fairest world possible.
As soon as he's ready to go,

2123
02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:22.780
he gets to fight for the belt.
But you owe it to them.
You do.

2124
02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:28.320
But do you allow him to choose between a rematch with Mcgregor or if Frankie

2125
02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:32.200
Beats Mcgregor,
he fights Frankie for the belt again,

2126
02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:37.120
he fight no matter who has it.
Do you let a fight happen in between his fight?

2127
02:01:37.121 --> 02:01:41.830
Do you give him the time to recover or do you do,
do you put the belt aside,

2128
02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:45.830
put it on hold and say the belt does not get five for until Aldo comes back?

2129
02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:49.070
That's what you're doing with Rhonda.
It is what you're doing with Rhonda.
It is,

2130
02:01:49.330 --> 02:01:52.570
this is exact what you don't say.
You know,
not saying you I'm saying screws me.

2131
02:01:52.630 --> 02:01:56.900
Right.
But that is how they look at it.
They're looking at,
in terms of finances,

2132
02:01:56.901 --> 02:01:58.940
they think that if you look at Holly,

2133
02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:03.570
Holly almost lost Raquel Pennington and her pro debut or a UFC debut,
rather.

2134
02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:08.480
Yeah,
she won a split decision to recall in a qualified then,
uh,

2135
02:02:08.481 --> 02:02:12.830
she fought Marion renew is that who she fought and beat her and beat her

2136
02:02:12.831 --> 02:02:16.900
decisively,
then just pull out the fucking performance of a lifetime.
Again,

2137
02:02:16.901 --> 02:02:19.760
it's a charging opponents.
I'm gonna really played into her strengths.

2138
02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:22.100
If you look at the aggression that Rhonda had,

2139
02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:24.050
none of the other fights that she had,
no one,

2140
02:02:24.051 --> 02:02:27.590
no one was that aggressive chasing after people were much more respectful of her

2141
02:02:27.591 --> 02:02:29.810
striking ability.
But Rhonda just charged right out.

2142
02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:34.250
She also didn't fight Peyton price high level Rhonda district?
No,
no,
not at all.

2143
02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:38.210
They're all very amateur in.
If you look at like at least on paper,

2144
02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:39.410
like credential wise,

2145
02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:44.330
no one's as high levels as Holly in MMA and in the women's division other than

2146
02:02:44.331 --> 02:02:48.910
you want to,
you and Jay check and this,
uh,
this,
this new,
um,
um,

2147
02:02:49.070 --> 02:02:52.220
Shahab Chanko it's a tough and amen.
Yeah,
it's rough.

2148
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:56.130
There was a couple tough ones on that.
Um,
yes,
on that card.
But uh,

2149
02:02:56.150 --> 02:02:58.280
but Holly is like a 19 time.

2150
02:02:58.550 --> 02:03:01.070
How many times did she will at nine time world boxing champion,

2151
02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:04.830
this chick's 17 time world champion.
Then you've got um,
uh,

2152
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:07.520
you want to know Jay check six time world Moitai champion.

2153
02:03:07.521 --> 02:03:12.140
I just think with Joe's out of what he's done for the sport,
give him time off,

2154
02:03:12.141 --> 02:03:15.340
let them feel,
and then let everything else figure itself out.

2155
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:18.410
Make these huge fights and then when Josie goes,
I'm ready year from now.

2156
02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:20.480
You give him the title.
She,
everybody's jumping.
No,

2157
02:03:20.481 --> 02:03:23.540
that's what I was going to say.
Have they made the decision to run?
No.
No.

2158
02:03:23.541 --> 02:03:26.000
I don't think they think everybody kind of jumped in there.
Yeah.

2159
02:03:26.090 --> 02:03:31.090
Then wasn't there a quote that Dana said the winter of Serone Dasani Hill gets a

2160
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:32.330
call.

2161
02:03:32.330 --> 02:03:36.590
I think what he said was that Conard could fight for the lightweight title next.

2162
02:03:36.591 --> 02:03:40.850
That could be a fight.
They do.
He never guaranteed anything,
but even if he does,

2163
02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:44.280
they take it back.
It doesn't show was Misha was guaranteed the tie shoes.

2164
02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:49.010
If she beat Jessica,
I,
She Beats Jessica and they look like we're good.

2165
02:03:50.430 --> 02:03:54.910
Change of plans.
Yeah.
They just changed it on her.
Look,
ma'am,
but you know,

2166
02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:58.760
you know Diaz get say,
you know Deanna said Joe still make it happen.
I think,

2167
02:03:58.761 --> 02:04:01.930
I think he might've been high as fuck when he said that.

2168
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:06.680
He said in their interview right after he goes,
he goes,
Joe Silva guaranteed me.

2169
02:04:06.681 --> 02:04:08.600
I get caught.
I'll tell you one thing,
I'm shit.

2170
02:04:08.630 --> 02:04:12.980
I gotta give props to Jeff Novitsky not just for what he's done.

2171
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:16.190
Scare the fuck out of everybody and make them all and get off the sauce.

2172
02:04:16.191 --> 02:04:17.840
Cause he's definitely done that.
That's the word.

2173
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:23.050
But also he was outspoken about Nick Diaz about Nick Diaz is a suspension,

2174
02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:25.580
not refined bullshit.

2175
02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:29.440
Here you've got a guy who's the fucking us Ada you,

2176
02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:33.380
you sought a drug guy and he's saying it's bullshit and he's saying it's a

2177
02:04:33.381 --> 02:04:36.140
bullshit decision.
Fuckers.
You're talking about bare bonds land.

2178
02:04:36.141 --> 02:04:40.130
So I'm showing big.
Marion says,
yeah.
Yeah,
he went after everybody.

2179
02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:44.970
That sounds good.
Weed and cycling.
Is there,
would you say,

2180
02:04:44.971 --> 02:04:47.520
is there a test for wheat and cycling?
I think they do.

2181
02:04:47.670 --> 02:04:50.550
You know there was a study recently that showed that ultra marathoners benefit

2182
02:04:50.551 --> 02:04:53.450
from Wade.
I think they eat it and then they eat it.

2183
02:04:53.470 --> 02:04:56.520
It helps them run more [inaudible].
Not all of them.

2184
02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:02.850
Not all of them.
Well,
not all marathon runner smoke weed.
No,
no,
no,

2185
02:05:02.851 --> 02:05:04.650
but the ones that do benefits them,

2186
02:05:05.010 --> 02:05:08.250
you say not all of them mean something to eat wheat and it doesn't do shit for

2187
02:05:08.251 --> 02:05:13.020
them.
They run off track like that.
Joshua trees I watched,

2188
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:19.410
it sounded like you said all marathon runners.
No,
I said ultra,
ultra,
ultra,

2189
02:05:19.530 --> 02:05:21.420
ultra marathon runners.
Here it is.

2190
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:24.180
The debate over running wild hot for ultra marathon runners.

2191
02:05:24.181 --> 02:05:28.500
Marijuana has enormous benefits,
but is it ethical?
What does this in a Jamie,

2192
02:05:28.501 --> 02:05:32.330
what's The uh,
Wall Street Journal.
Wall Street Journal.
That's pretty powerful.

2193
02:05:32.370 --> 02:05:36.450
Wall Street Journal.
It's going to be some bullshit.
World's changing.
Eddie Bravo.

2194
02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:39.780
Since you first got me high 15 years ago,

2195
02:05:39.810 --> 02:05:44.400
the world has changed radically and he Bravo's the catalyst.

2196
02:05:44.401 --> 02:05:47.640
That's El Diablo right there.
Hello?
Right,
their first joint.

2197
02:05:47.730 --> 02:05:51.450
We had an ice cream Sundae.
Where's that devil dust?

2198
02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:57.000
That Colombian trying to get on that shit.
The crazy stoner man.
I was like,
God,

2199
02:05:57.001 --> 02:06:00.990
I got to get Joe.
If I could get Joe fucking stone,
they won't think I'm crazy.

2200
02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:05.430
I mean Shit.
Well,
there was so many misconceptions.

2201
02:06:05.610 --> 02:06:07.290
So many people have misconceptions to this day.

2202
02:06:07.410 --> 02:06:10.320
[inaudible] culture that kind of fucked,
but you know what it is,
man.

2203
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:14.310
There are some people that are just fucking lazy and the idea is that pot gets

2204
02:06:14.311 --> 02:06:18.270
you lazy.
It's not true.
You know?
I think it does the opposite to me,

2205
02:06:18.271 --> 02:06:19.790
at least everybody into your reaction,

2206
02:06:20.250 --> 02:06:23.520
but to me it makes me paranoid of being lazy.
How about that?

2207
02:06:23.970 --> 02:06:26.130
So am I get high and I want to get things done.
I'm like,
oh,

2208
02:06:26.131 --> 02:06:27.420
I gotta clean my office.
Wow.

2209
02:06:27.450 --> 02:06:31.500
Some people get high and just don't move and eat Cheetos and then blame it on

2210
02:06:31.501 --> 02:06:31.740
that.

2211
02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:34.300
Really believed those people would just do the same because they're lazy you,

2212
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:35.550
no matter what I really do.

2213
02:06:35.551 --> 02:06:37.590
I really think there's a lot of people that are just lazy.

2214
02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:41.320
There's also a lot of people that have just not thinking right.
They just,
they,

2215
02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:45.960
they just not like you don't enjoy rest unless you deserve it.

2216
02:06:46.410 --> 02:06:49.920
That's the reality of life.
If you just fucking off your whole life,

2217
02:06:50.010 --> 02:06:54.730
it's not as fun.
Like rest is fun when you deserve it.
Yes.

2218
02:06:54.830 --> 02:06:57.000
Like it feels good to eat after you work out.

2219
02:06:57.330 --> 02:07:01.500
Like if you lift and you fucking beat your ass in the gym and then you go have a

2220
02:07:01.501 --> 02:07:05.520
steak.
Ah,
it's the most delicious food ever.
But if you just have a stake,
yeah,

2221
02:07:05.521 --> 02:07:09.570
it's delicious,
but you don't even know how good it is.
Don't all good.
It is.

2222
02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:14.040
If you just pushed your body before you ate it,
you would enjoy it so much more.

2223
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:17.430
I mean,
he might not be in the lifting or any kind of working out.

2224
02:07:17.431 --> 02:07:18.390
That might not be your thing.

2225
02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:21.900
But my point is it like if there's some things that you really need to do and

2226
02:07:21.901 --> 02:07:24.950
you say you fuck off and you don't do them and you get late,

2227
02:07:24.951 --> 02:07:26.170
you're going to hate yourself.
Yeah.

2228
02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:28.500
It's going to be a part of you that knows you didn't do the shit you were

2229
02:07:28.501 --> 02:07:29.334
supposed to do.

2230
02:07:29.490 --> 02:07:32.760
And if you fuck off and you get too lazy and don't accomplish things,

2231
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:36.060
you're not gonna enjoy the rest as much as you do when you accomplish this.

2232
02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:39.550
<v 0>Like you talk about it like you get home from class,
you work all day,</v>

2233
02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:42.160
teach class,
you get home and you've watched.
Netflix is a joy.

2234
02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:46.940
I love among Muslim with breaking bad.
I always,

2235
02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:49.750
I always wait,
so a hundred people tell me,
dude,

2236
02:07:49.751 --> 02:07:51.580
you got to see it do you haven't seen it,
dude,

2237
02:07:51.581 --> 02:07:55.330
you gotta it's the greatest show on TV,
Bro.
I got to hear that a hundred times.

2238
02:07:55.331 --> 02:07:57.250
I'm like,
cool.
I want it to be true.

2239
02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:00.970
I just need to hear it because I can't get into it.
I watched one breaking bed,

2240
02:08:00.971 --> 02:08:02.680
now you gotta you gotta go back,

2241
02:08:02.710 --> 02:08:06.580
go back and watch the first one to write the pilot to mommy neither.

2242
02:08:06.610 --> 02:08:09.640
But people kept saying,
you got to give a time period of time.
Yeah,

2243
02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:11.740
the characters.
It's a great show.

2244
02:08:11.741 --> 02:08:14.710
I watched the whole first season was getting my right arm done while I was

2245
02:08:14.711 --> 02:08:18.100
getting my right arm tattooed.
You love watching it all on the IPAD.

2246
02:08:18.101 --> 02:08:22.000
That's the best.
Is it getting tattooed while you're watching a good show?

2247
02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:26.350
Because you don't even notice.
It was annoying thing on my arm.

2248
02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:32.460
I look over at Ou and then go ahead and I just started walking and just started

2249
02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:37.200
walking.
Dead's good.
You really liked it.
I love it.
That.
No,
no.
You haven't seen.

2250
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:40.510
I've seen what good.
It shits the bed for one season though.

2251
02:08:40.511 --> 02:08:42.850
I'm gonna tell you this right now and I want to tell you when there's a part in

2252
02:08:42.851 --> 02:08:45.610
time.
I was like,
these motherfuckers,
I'm ready to leave this show.

2253
02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:49.330
And then they fired everybody and they hired all the new writers and they just

2254
02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:53.420
brought it back from the dead.
He redeemed them.
So,

2255
02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:57.130
and it hit a rough spot where a lot of glucose,
but they recognized that.

2256
02:08:57.131 --> 02:09:01.020
Of course,
that's all.
No,
no.
I haven't seen narcos.
Are you kidding?

2257
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:04.510
It's going to be hard at lunch.
No,
seriously.
You have no,

2258
02:09:04.850 --> 02:09:07.270
I'm in the middle of this fucking president show though.

2259
02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:10.960
I'm in the middle of the cost of cars right now.
Okay,
I'll jump on that.
Dude.

2260
02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:13.210
I'm [inaudible] to episode one and a half.
Actually,

2261
02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:15.290
I watched it on the plane and American Airlines,

2262
02:09:15.291 --> 02:09:18.520
they got the little screen thing in front of you.
They had Netflix on TV's back.

2263
02:09:18.521 --> 02:09:23.130
We're all excited about TV.
TV sucks.
No,

2264
02:09:23.131 --> 02:09:26.290
it brought it in HBO and the Internet uncensored.
That's what,

2265
02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:27.190
that's what made it back.

2266
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:30.850
Even when like you watching those shows like breaking bad,
it's cable.

2267
02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:33.790
They can say things you can never say on network and she can't,

2268
02:09:34.050 --> 02:09:37.900
can't say everything,
but they can get close like walking dead.

2269
02:09:37.930 --> 02:09:40.780
They get close their way.
They could get away with way more,

2270
02:09:40.781 --> 02:09:44.680
but they still have commercials like commercials,
fuck everything up.

2271
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:49.360
You gotta you gotta watch it on Netflix or on uh,
on,
um,
apple TV.

2272
02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:54.460
I subscribe to those apple TV,
man.
That's the shit.
The best new show,

2273
02:09:54.461 --> 02:09:58.340
man.
We were all excited about show.
I'm telling good.

2274
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.290
How's the cards?
One episode,
10 minutes into the first episode,
I was like,

2275
02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:07.300
oh yeah,
it's good.
I need that.
I gave up on the last man on earth,

2276
02:10:07.301 --> 02:10:11.680
man.
It sucks.
I got to like a season and a half and I'm like,
fuck,

2277
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:16.520
I can't do it.
All right.
It started off really good.
Yeah.
You know the,
the,

2278
02:10:16.521 --> 02:10:20.710
the performance that the head guy,
he's fucking brilliant.

2279
02:10:20.711 --> 02:10:24.730
So far so good.
But he's so good at that annoying you.

2280
02:10:24.731 --> 02:10:27.370
You hate that character so much that it,

2281
02:10:27.371 --> 02:10:30.650
then you end up hating the shell cause you hate him so much.
He's like,
wow,

2282
02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:34.610
he's the,
the biggest douchebag.

2283
02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:38.690
<v 1>However,
he's the last man on earth he's got from Saturday night live.
Right.</v>

2284
02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:42.620
Uh,
I don't know if it Saturday night live.
What he did,
Tim and Eric stuff.
He is,

2285
02:10:42.650 --> 02:10:46.280
Oh shit.
You know what else is really good?
The new Bob and Dave show,

2286
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:51.470
like the guys who did Mr show with Bob and Dave.
Bob and Dave.

2287
02:10:51.730 --> 02:10:54.620
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bob Odenkirk and Dave Cross.
Yeah.

2288
02:10:55.070 --> 02:10:58.820
The new one is fucking hilarious.
It's really good.
I watched one episode of that.

2289
02:10:58.821 --> 02:11:01.690
That's another Netflix.
I was balls deep in the wire for awhile.

2290
02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:04.720
She watched the wire.
I watch one episode.
I never got into it.
Why?

2291
02:11:05.150 --> 02:11:07.940
I know it's supposed to be awesome.
I think I went into second episode,

2292
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:12.000
but it was years ago and everybody keeps saying that and that's the back burner.

2293
02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:17.090
I know I need to,
Jamie's nodding.
I know.
Legit as fuck.
I know I need to,

2294
02:11:17.091 --> 02:11:19.160
but I need to watch all these goddamn documentaries too.

2295
02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:22.230
Everybody's always calling.
My favorite thing.
Ductless mini documentary.

2296
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:24.380
People tweet me a good documentary.

2297
02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:27.770
Oh you're going to get overwhelmed but well I'll just stay here for the fucking

2298
02:11:27.771 --> 02:11:31.330
cavalcade of chem trail documentaries.
No,
no,
I'm not into that.

2299
02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:35.120
I don't mean conspiracy to phone right now.

2300
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:41.720
Let me ask you this.
Heavyweight.
What?
Where do you put a Alistair Overeem now?

2301
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:45.500
He just knocked the fuck out.
Junior dos Santos to guy.
Not only dad,

2302
02:11:45.501 --> 02:11:48.320
he's the first guy to ever fight junior and not take any damage.

2303
02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:49.880
Who to fuck hero.
Damn.

2304
02:11:49.881 --> 02:11:53.660
What the fuck else has ever fought junior dos Santos and not taking any damage.

2305
02:11:53.661 --> 02:11:58.460
She had great footwork,
Dude.
Very smart.
They avoided each other.

2306
02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:02.340
But you know was that he baited them in mark.

2307
02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:05.510
Cause we started opening up and that second round people were booing.

2308
02:12:05.511 --> 02:12:10.490
But you try fight in a knockout artists with the smallest margin of error you

2309
02:12:10.491 --> 02:12:13.670
make,
you turn,
you dodge left instead of right.
The night's over.

2310
02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:15.380
So when I see that,
I'm like,
I get it.

2311
02:12:15.381 --> 02:12:18.020
They're just trying to get a vibe here and people are booing.
I'm like,
no,

2312
02:12:18.021 --> 02:12:19.730
just fucking wait for it.
Not only that,

2313
02:12:19.731 --> 02:12:23.820
but junior is like taking his time too and he's just,

2314
02:12:24.610 --> 02:12:27.960
he's bald up looking to uncork bombs.
It's respect.
Yeah.

2315
02:12:27.961 --> 02:12:32.410
And when Jr's throwing those punches or they're whizzing by my daughters,

2316
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:34.950
they all have def on,
there's no feeling out with those.

2317
02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:38.120
So I respect that first round.
And then the second round,

2318
02:12:38.121 --> 02:12:40.060
I mean that left Hook was from weekend.

2319
02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:42.370
He opened them are a bunch of shit and that around,

2320
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:44.810
first of all we started off selling.
He started off Orthodox.

2321
02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:49.070
He started killing that front leg.
He hit him with some zippers.

2322
02:12:49.071 --> 02:12:52.970
He's a free agent now.
He's a free agent.
Ooh,
that's big.

2323
02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:55.970
And then that body shot.
Oh my God.
He kept hitting him.

2324
02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:57.860
He was switching stances real good.

2325
02:12:57.890 --> 02:13:02.090
And he was constantly moving and he was saying,
he said to me after the fight,

2326
02:13:02.210 --> 02:13:04.700
first thing he said is that Wim Hoff breathing stuff works.

2327
02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:08.150
Like we were talking about it before.
I did the interview with him and he goes,

2328
02:13:08.151 --> 02:13:10.850
that Wim Hoff stuff works.
That's dope.
He wants to do the podcasts.

2329
02:13:10.851 --> 02:13:12.920
We gotta I gotta get him on the park.
He'd be worth talking about it.
Yeah.

2330
02:13:12.921 --> 02:13:16.130
Well that'd be great.
You want to talk about a guy who's been stopped a lot?

2331
02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:19.710
You know,
it's amazing.

2332
02:13:19.711 --> 02:13:22.820
Like he's far as far as he's gotten.

2333
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:27.020
If you go back and watch kickboxing and then strike force,

2334
02:13:27.230 --> 02:13:30.240
or not strike force,
but he didn't get stopped.
Hey ones.
But he died.

2335
02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:31.950
He got stopped and pride.
I

2336
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:35.520
<v 3>mean,
you look at the stoppage losses that he got in k one and in prod and strike</v>

2337
02:13:35.521 --> 02:13:37.440
force.
He was the champ.
He never lost in strike force.

2338
02:13:37.441 --> 02:13:39.690
I believe he beat for doom and Strikeforce.

2339
02:13:39.870 --> 02:13:43.650
He fucked up Brett Rodgers fucked up.

2340
02:13:43.770 --> 02:13:47.830
That was when he goes [inaudible] who's a totally different animal route.

2341
02:13:47.890 --> 02:13:48.920
Brett Rogers to the ground,

2342
02:13:49.290 --> 02:13:53.010
he kicked Brett Rogers in the beginning of the first round with a,

2343
02:13:53.011 --> 02:13:56.100
with a right leg kick where you see the look on Brett Rogers face.

2344
02:13:56.101 --> 02:13:58.980
He was just realizes,
oh shit.

2345
02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:02.430
It was just a completely different level of striker that he'd ever faced because

2346
02:14:02.431 --> 02:14:03.700
he had beaten,
um,

2347
02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:07.550
our Lawsky but he caught our Lawsky like nervous and tentative Arlovski you

2348
02:14:07.551 --> 02:14:10.510
standing in front of them and it was scared.
[inaudible] you know,

2349
02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:13.830
our Lasky had this period of time where he was in a rut before he went with

2350
02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.120
Jackson.
He's train with Freddie Roach.
He just was,
he was in a Rut.

2351
02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:19.290
He was in Chicago.

2352
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:23.100
He wasn't training with Jackson and Winkeljohn down in Albuquerque.

2353
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:27.720
And then they took him on and he even had a big loss when they took him on.
Um,

2354
02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:30.450
Keratan off Sergei carrot top tough fights,

2355
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:33.300
especially at the time when he fought him.
Taniff was on father,
fuck,

2356
02:14:33.330 --> 02:14:34.680
he was on fire,
knocked him out.

2357
02:14:37.850 --> 02:14:40.490
[inaudible] [inaudible]
Tano.
Karatani

2358
02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:48.300
I'd like to point out that that was Brennan Chavs.
Eddie Brown eyes.

2359
02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:54.540
Um,
I don't know.
I think he fought in glory.
Right.
Then you find the glory.

2360
02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:57.480
I don't know what he's doing these days.
He did some kickboxing for a while.

2361
02:14:57.481 --> 02:15:00.570
I think he had a back injury to that.
Set him back a bit.

2362
02:15:00.930 --> 02:15:03.930
I don't know what he's doing these days.
Hearing Yellowbook pages or some shit.

2363
02:15:03.931 --> 02:15:04.764
He's just eight.

2364
02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:08.250
How about fate or his opponent just gets announced like a day ago.

2365
02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:11.280
The worst market of all.
When did that get announced?
He's irrelevant now.

2366
02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:14.730
I don't give a fuck fighting that kickboxing.
The Indian kickboxing guy,

2367
02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:16.260
people thought it was a joke when they announced it.

2368
02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:21.180
I know that there's no way no one available.
There's no one available.
It's silly.

2369
02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:25.100
What if they made the Overeem versus fate or Phi surrogate?

2370
02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:29.040
Cartano I'm currently negotiating with UFC belt tour and glory.
Oh,

2371
02:15:29.041 --> 02:15:33.630
today thicker than a snickers.
Start getting a lot of sausages.

2372
02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:37.830
He looks scary as fuck.
Well,
he's dangerous.

2373
02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:42.770
Come on mother fucker Barnett.
Fuck them up though.
Yeah,
he did Barnett.

2374
02:15:42.830 --> 02:15:45.780
Fuck that.
Got Him down.
Fucked him up.
But you know what,
I remember,
man,

2375
02:15:45.810 --> 02:15:49.590
I remember him holding semi Schilt down and and Hammerfest in him and his

2376
02:15:49.591 --> 02:15:50.150
eyeball.

2377
02:15:50.150 --> 02:15:53.950
She and me that he said that shit shelters screaming as he's hammer fisting and

2378
02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:57.240
st the same bullshit and he's like mounting them.

2379
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:59.890
He's like mounting them high on the chest cause semi wasn't like the best

2380
02:15:59.891 --> 02:16:00.601
grappler in the world.

2381
02:16:00.601 --> 02:16:05.601
He was just nasty kickbox great risk control giving up dudes that would mount

2382
02:16:05.841 --> 02:16:09.770
him and he would just hold the wrist.
He was so long and he would punch back,

2383
02:16:10.290 --> 02:16:11.550
strike off his back.

2384
02:16:11.610 --> 02:16:15.600
Pete Williams had them in the mount was he couldn't do shit to him and he

2385
02:16:15.601 --> 02:16:19.350
survived the round ended next round 70,

2386
02:16:19.351 --> 02:16:21.810
she'll throw some front kids.
We never seen that before.

2387
02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:24.120
Front kicks to the body to the body,
boom.

2388
02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:28.500
And we thought it's because he's seven foot tall.
No,
nobody,

2389
02:16:29.370 --> 02:16:30.203
you know with the

2390
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:32.710
<v 1>uh,
with normal legs can get away with shit like that.</v>

2391
02:16:32.830 --> 02:16:36.130
Once I started learning crazy how that's taken off like that.

2392
02:16:36.250 --> 02:16:40.420
The earliest ever kicked that you learn in traditional martial arts is like one

2393
02:16:40.421 --> 02:16:43.960
of the most recent kicks that people are successful with.
That's crazy.

2394
02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:46.720
No one was throwing.
There was a video just a few years ago,

2395
02:16:46.721 --> 02:16:49.380
have you and I and my garage,
you're asking me about front kicks

2396
02:16:51.370 --> 02:16:52.270
throw.

2397
02:16:55.390 --> 02:16:59.770
Throw that Bruce Lee kick like that to the pool and that was my thought was
like,

2398
02:16:59.771 --> 02:17:04.570
man,
you got to talk to the John Anderson Silva.
God,

2399
02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:05.620
it was downloaded.

2400
02:17:05.621 --> 02:17:10.270
That data that's slow motion of vittores head snapping back from that front kick

2401
02:17:10.271 --> 02:17:13.570
and his legs buckling and him going down.
Anderson beaten on him.

2402
02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:17.380
Oh yeah,
he's AMISOM cause vetoed.
It doesn't want to fight him.

2403
02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:19.090
He's not going to find a veto.
I won't fight them.

2404
02:17:19.091 --> 02:17:20.740
And Rockhold is calling out Vituro,

2405
02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:24.760
which is very fascinating because what do you do there?
Here's a good question.

2406
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:29.230
Do you have a rematch with Weidman or do you have him fight EOL before UL turns

2407
02:17:29.231 --> 02:17:33.310
50 nope,
you'll do.
Well is 63 years old.
It's got a fight.

2408
02:17:33.570 --> 02:17:37.230
He's going to fight for the title has to be like now like tomorrow,
no bullshit.

2409
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:40.880
He's 38 like at what point in time?
I mean if he clean,

2410
02:17:40.881 --> 02:17:43.730
he didn't do enough for me to earn that title shot.

2411
02:17:44.350 --> 02:17:49.350
I think Weidman Rockhold too is the fight 100% that's the fucking fight because

2412
02:17:49.550 --> 02:17:54.550
if if Weidman that though that terrible spinning kick where the fuck that was.

2413
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:57.050
You don't throw that we have different fight on our hands.
Yeah.

2414
02:17:57.051 --> 02:18:00.430
People give me a hard time about the difference between saying turning sidekick

2415
02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:02.590
and spinning back kick.
You're totally right.

2416
02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:05.680
I say spinning back kick cause that's what everybody calls it.

2417
02:18:06.130 --> 02:18:09.190
But the real spinning back,
it was like a donkey kick.
It's like heal up.

2418
02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:11.410
I always call us turning side kick,

2419
02:18:11.710 --> 02:18:15.850
a spinning back kick or sometimes people throw it like a spinning sidekick but

2420
02:18:16.390 --> 02:18:19.090
the different people also give me a hard time about the wheel kick spinning hook

2421
02:18:19.091 --> 02:18:19.361
kick.

2422
02:18:19.361 --> 02:18:22.480
Like I had a conversation with this dude about it online but that's the same

2423
02:18:22.481 --> 02:18:25.180
kick.
That difference,
you know Hook kick and a wheel kick is like the difference.

2424
02:18:25.181 --> 02:18:28.210
You don't have long left hook and a short left hook is the same kick you're

2425
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:32.560
spinning using the heel.
But there's two different types of wheel kicks.

2426
02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:36.760
There's a wheel kick that's like with the leg is bent and then there's a stiff

2427
02:18:36.761 --> 02:18:41.260
leg.
We'll kick which a low Stewart and missed,
right?
No,

2428
02:18:41.290 --> 02:18:44.970
he landed it on hunt company kind of calf dump.
Whoa.
No,

2429
02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:49.630
he tried it against over him.
If you remember,
you're writing Mr.
Yes.
Yeah.

2430
02:18:49.770 --> 02:18:54.040
Um,
but the stiff leg we'll kick is very rare.
You have to have a sucker.

2431
02:18:54.250 --> 02:18:57.070
Like you have to go.
I have a guy who was like really standing in front of you,

2432
02:18:57.071 --> 02:19:00.500
but it's so powerful to stuff like have you seen me throw a stiff leg?

2433
02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:04.900
One on the bag,
but they happen when they happen.
There's deflect ones rare.

2434
02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:09.510
Usually it's a,
it's a bent one,
like the one with Terry,
m and M and a.

2435
02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:13.240
What does that symbol?
That's what I said.
He throws the wheel kick.

2436
02:19:13.241 --> 02:19:15.550
It's a bat lag.
Here's what happens.

2437
02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:20.700
It's bent up until like the point of contact and then it sort of snaps out.

2438
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:24.580
And with a stiff leg one like you see me through it on a bag,

2439
02:19:24.700 --> 02:19:27.920
your leg becomes stiff way earlier.
It's way earlier,

2440
02:19:27.930 --> 02:19:32.300
your leg gets stiff like halfway.
And again,
this is like,
this is a big,
big time.

2441
02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:36.710
Technicalities are basically the same kick but the backache and the turning side

2442
02:19:36.711 --> 02:19:39.860
king,
they are different.
Like chocolate.
Dell throws the back kick,

2443
02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:41.060
he would throw it like he did.

2444
02:19:41.061 --> 02:19:44.510
He's like throwing it on bags but we're like shows people like holding the path

2445
02:19:44.511 --> 02:19:47.200
forward and he'll throw it.
And so he throws it like um,

2446
02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:50.450
donkey kick style up toes are down.

2447
02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:52.610
This the way Barboza throws it,

2448
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:56.900
he throws it spinning sidekick or turning side kick where the foot is flat and

2449
02:19:56.901 --> 02:20:00.270
the heel and toes are parallel to the floor.
Nasty.
It's nasty.

2450
02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:01.910
To answer your question about over email,

2451
02:20:02.390 --> 02:20:07.390
you can make a good argument that he deserves the title shot cause he's won four

2452
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:10.340
of his last fight.
He's marketable as fuck.

2453
02:20:10.370 --> 02:20:14.270
But Ben Rothwell knocked him out just a couple of fights ago and he's unbeaten

2454
02:20:14.290 --> 02:20:18.200
too.
But Ben Rothwell Flights Barnett.
Yes,

2455
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:21.410
he fights Barnett and maybe the winner of that fight,

2456
02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:26.920
then they decide because Barnett versus Ben Rothwell is in New Jersey in

2457
02:20:27.381 --> 02:20:30.650
January.
Right.
[inaudible] it's a very good point.

2458
02:20:30.651 --> 02:20:32.450
What do you do with [inaudible] if he wins that fight?
Well,

2459
02:20:32.451 --> 02:20:36.940
Steve Bay went to war with Jr,
right.
Fought five hard rounds,
went to war,

2460
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:38.480
lost of real close fight,

2461
02:20:38.481 --> 02:20:43.320
but got dropped and it legitimately lost the head of junior now,
by the way.
Oh,

2462
02:20:43.810 --> 02:20:46.600
I don't know about that.
That doesn't make any sense.
[inaudible] so,
uh,

2463
02:20:46.670 --> 02:20:51.090
it goes cane one,
right for dooms Champ Keynes won or lost keys too steep,

2464
02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:56.020
steep ace three.
I forget him.
For us,
that doesn't make any sense to me.
Um,

2465
02:20:56.090 --> 02:20:58.100
I think of junior beat him.
Junior should be ahead of him.

2466
02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:03.230
Even if jr just got knocked down.
Allister.
Allister is ranked behind junior.
No,

2467
02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:05.300
k.
That's insane.

2468
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:08.810
That's insane that those ratings are fucking bananas.

2469
02:21:09.530 --> 02:21:14.000
Here's even worse than this.
Um,
when Conor McGregor knocked out,

2470
02:21:14.010 --> 02:21:18.970
although there's a Brazilian judge or writer or whatever the fuck journalists,

2471
02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:23.750
whoever gets to vote on these things that voted Conard down four spaces on the

2472
02:21:23.751 --> 02:21:27.800
pound for pound.
That was his joke.
But that makes that guy,

2473
02:21:29.220 --> 02:21:31.940
he is no longer credible.
You cannot have that guy vote anymore.

2474
02:21:32.180 --> 02:21:33.170
That's a disgrace.

2475
02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:38.260
It's gotta be able to fish if you go back and has over him under its current.

2476
02:21:39.111 --> 02:21:41.710
This is current,
even though he just knocked out Joe Santos,

2477
02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:44.200
he's still ranked below him and Holly Holm is resume.

2478
02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:49.370
She knocked Rhonda and that's automatic.
Automatic Fox is old.
How the fuck?

2479
02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:52.910
Oh No,
Eddie.
That's not something that I did,
man.
You don't understand.
There's,

2480
02:21:52.911 --> 02:21:56.570
they have like some goofy system of how they do this thing and there's a bunch

2481
02:21:56.571 --> 02:21:59.780
of dummies out there that somehow or another think Rhonda should be ranked above

2482
02:21:59.781 --> 02:22:03.080
Holly after Holly knocked her out because Ron has beaten so many people.

2483
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:06.860
That's the same insanity,
the same silly hose.

2484
02:22:06.861 --> 02:22:11.030
Wait for us to do these podcasts and so they can talk shit about us.

2485
02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:14.450
Well,
this is,
this is clearly the most nutty thing ever.

2486
02:22:14.451 --> 02:22:15.950
If you look at the heavyweight division,
Jamie,

2487
02:22:15.951 --> 02:22:18.950
scroll down for the heavyweight division please.
Who Do you got on the rematch?

2488
02:22:18.990 --> 02:22:21.650
But hold on,
let's,
let's,
we'll go over this real quick.
Look at this.

2489
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:25.470
Cain Velasquez makes sense.
Of course he was the champion.
He lost it.
Brief CEO.

2490
02:22:25.471 --> 02:22:28.590
He's beating everybody else.
Right.
That makes sense.
The champ are Lasky.

2491
02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:33.360
He's done really well.
Um,
but uh,
number two,

2492
02:22:33.420 --> 02:22:36.390
boy,
that's a tough sell.
There's tough sell.

2493
02:22:36.391 --> 02:22:37.710
When you look at the difference between the guys,

2494
02:22:37.711 --> 02:22:41.190
he's beaten and then you look at the guys that Allister's beaten.

2495
02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:43.380
If you look at Alster just beating junior,

2496
02:22:43.381 --> 02:22:46.390
I think you got to put him right up there with our loss.

2497
02:22:46.391 --> 02:22:50.880
Brown or Laskey beat Travis.
That's true.
That's a good point.
That's a good point.

2498
02:22:50.910 --> 02:22:55.050
Junior beat bay.
It's fucking,

2499
02:22:55.140 --> 02:22:59.820
it's tough because junior like in our laps key never fought.

2500
02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:02.580
That's how you know it'd be a great fight.

2501
02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:05.070
That's the fight that's going to happen.
If Andre Loses,

2502
02:23:05.130 --> 02:23:08.940
if Andrea loses 100% boy who knows what's gonna happen with junior now though,

2503
02:23:08.941 --> 02:23:11.960
when junior get CalEd like that,
you've got to take some time off.

2504
02:23:11.961 --> 02:23:16.260
I have to say to me after the cane fights,
he's just took too much.

2505
02:23:16.850 --> 02:23:19.350
Too much.
Honestly,
I look at the fight with our laughs.
Can you,

2506
02:23:19.351 --> 02:23:23.370
that's a super close fight that was so close.
That was anybody's fight.

2507
02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:28.140
Anybody could've won that fight.
People say job one and then,
I mean most people,

2508
02:23:28.141 --> 02:23:32.520
I mean everyone and then our lab skis last fight against Frank Mir.

2509
02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:36.880
That was another like knocked out,
remarried after me.
Knocked up Travis Browne.

2510
02:23:36.900 --> 02:23:40.320
He knocked out big foot,
which was beautiful.
Mayor Travis Browne,

2511
02:23:40.430 --> 02:23:43.170
he's fighting Steve Bay.
We didn't knock out Frank Mir.

2512
02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:47.480
Him and Frank Mir had the one.
That's right.
Really Boring.
Really Boring fight.

2513
02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:49.440
Let's do it again.
Absolutely not.

2514
02:23:49.441 --> 02:23:52.920
So that's two fights that he had that were like really like slow to pull the

2515
02:23:52.921 --> 02:23:54.060
trigger and not much happens.

2516
02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:57.270
Travis just went after him and he went after Travis.

2517
02:23:57.271 --> 02:24:01.020
And I think a lot of that might've been familiarity because both those guys knew

2518
02:24:01.021 --> 02:24:03.270
each other really well from the gym,
from training together.

2519
02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:07.560
And the word was that our Lawsky would get the better of Travis and sparring

2520
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:10.590
when there's nothing on the line,
it's all just skills,
right?

2521
02:24:10.620 --> 02:24:15.390
When you're just in the the cage,
you're training together,
there's no pressure,

2522
02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:17.220
there's no media,
there's no nothing.

2523
02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:21.690
Then you just see skills are Lawsky has some vicious fucking striking skills.

2524
02:24:21.691 --> 02:24:23.220
Like if you go back to just skills,

2525
02:24:23.430 --> 02:24:27.120
you go back to his early fights and you watch his knockouts when he was the UFC

2526
02:24:27.121 --> 02:24:31.920
heavyweight champion.
Fun Dude,
dude,
his right hand was up piston.

2527
02:24:31.950 --> 02:24:33.420
Well there was no fat to it.

2528
02:24:33.570 --> 02:24:37.680
He would just uncork that motherfucker on dudes and just slowly,
well black.

2529
02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:41.760
I think the reason a why my fight and Arlovski's was so boring,

2530
02:24:41.790 --> 02:24:44.790
it's we trained a lot together too.
And they were,
I mean you,
it was a,

2531
02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:49.490
if judges are scoring,
it was the same fight.
It was very like super close,
right?

2532
02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:50.333
So we knew each other.

2533
02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:53.820
So we were both so nervous when we fought because it's when you're going in,

2534
02:24:53.821 --> 02:24:58.770
you're like,
fuck,
anything can happen.
It can be tough.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2535
02:24:58.771 --> 02:25:02.250
And our Lawsky knowing that he had that advantage over Travis Browne from

2536
02:25:02.251 --> 02:25:04.800
training looked real confident in that fight too.

2537
02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:09.240
He looked real relaxed in that fight.
What a fucking crazy slug fest that was.

2538
02:25:09.330 --> 02:25:13.050
Ooh.
The Travis Browne and Arlovski fight might've been one of the greatest first

2539
02:25:13.051 --> 02:25:16.080
rounds or one rounders ever in the history of the heavyweight division.
I agree.

2540
02:25:16.081 --> 02:25:18.790
Especially where they're ranked.
And now you got Brown verse,
uh,

2541
02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:20.820
[inaudible] that's a motherfucker for a fight.

2542
02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:24.060
Travis Browne's fight in Montreal and Boston son on Tj

2543
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:26.830
<v 3>and,
uh,
your boy cruises card.
Whoa.</v>

2544
02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:30.460
That's brace yourself to get advice.
A lot of people are overlooking that.

2545
02:25:30.461 --> 02:25:33.280
It's a great fight,
I feel like.
Made sure on was finding Sony else.

2546
02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:37.240
That's a great fight.
Ooh,
that's a standup war.

2547
02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:41.920
You know what else is a great fight that's happening in,
um,
in,
um,
New Jersey,

2548
02:25:41.921 --> 02:25:46.530
Roy Nelson and no,
I'm sorry,
Josh Barnett and Big Ben Rothwell.

2549
02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:49.270
It's a great fight.
That's a great fight of veterans.
Ooh,

2550
02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:53.140
that's especially after Josh Barnett looks so good against Roy.

2551
02:25:53.380 --> 02:25:58.230
He looked fantastic.
It was amazing.
Five we got taken on a bunch.
What?

2552
02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:02.020
Nothing happened.
You know you got Roy verse,
Jared Rochelle.
Yeah,

2553
02:26:02.021 --> 02:26:04.480
that's a good fight too.
It's not really a blockbuster.

2554
02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:06.060
I'm just saying you go shots.
Got A,

2555
02:26:06.130 --> 02:26:08.980
you know he's got a minus p's and q's against Roy.
Yeah,

2556
02:26:08.981 --> 02:26:11.290
cause it's going to be in a front.
He's going to be in front of Roy.

2557
02:26:11.350 --> 02:26:13.990
He's been knocked up before and he's going to be in front of Roy.

2558
02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:18.280
You know he's not going to be Alistair Overeem and yet the way Overeem fought

2559
02:26:18.281 --> 02:26:18.790
Roy,

2560
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:22.600
he got knocked down to remember that you're very good wrestler and he can put,

2561
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:26.380
he might,
we might see Willie Nelson on his back a lot.
You're right,
you're right.

2562
02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:30.610
We might remind it's his game plan.
100% it's really,
he's the point man.

2563
02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:33.250
High level wrestling right there.
Yeah.
That fights.

2564
02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:35.440
Not going to break any records for our style points.

2565
02:26:35.470 --> 02:26:38.770
I can promise you that unless Roy just knocks him to fucking next week.

2566
02:26:38.771 --> 02:26:42.760
Did you see that fucking new dude and canoe?
The,
the French guy,

2567
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:46.810
Bobby dog laws or DJ from street fighter.

2568
02:26:46.990 --> 02:26:51.880
He looks like he was bodied up so that guy is fucking big.

2569
02:26:52.030 --> 02:26:55.660
He got on the scale and for all I could look at it as the size of his feet.

2570
02:26:56.260 --> 02:27:00.970
I was like,
this guy's got canoes.
He's got canoes under his ankles.
Fucking,

2571
02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:05.350
he hits hard too.
But he got taken down off of a kick.

2572
02:27:05.530 --> 02:27:09.130
But the dude who took them down couldn't do anything with him and then he got

2573
02:27:09.131 --> 02:27:13.840
back up and just boxed him up.
Man.
NASC him.
That DJ is a DJ.

2574
02:27:13.841 --> 02:27:18.670
Louis the beast.
Him and Dj need to play some black on black crime.
The boxer?

2575
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:21.820
No,
no.
You know the,
the,
the Louis who knocked out

2576
02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:26.110
his chest and they call out Mitroville and Mitchell.
I was like,
Huh.

2577
02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:31.150
And like knock them out like 30 seconds.
Derrick Lewis,
right?
Yes.
Oh my God.

2578
02:27:31.151 --> 02:27:33.220
Black on black crime.
Yeah.

2579
02:27:33.250 --> 02:27:36.670
But this dude is in no was a nasty strigoi bodied up.

2580
02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:40.690
He's also really good,
bad.
His striking his fucking strong.

2581
02:27:40.810 --> 02:27:43.360
I really enjoyed watching his striking.
I was like,
Ooh,

2582
02:27:43.361 --> 02:27:45.700
this guy with a few fights under his belt houses,
ground game.

2583
02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:49.090
Well he had good defense.
He got taken down.
You're right.

2584
02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:52.540
He got taken down and he got a control on the ground but not,

2585
02:27:52.541 --> 02:27:54.760
not much happened to him there.
And once he got up,

2586
02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:59.380
good lord he hit that dude with the left upper cut that just shut the lights
out.

2587
02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:02.590
99 he came right through the arms to right through the guard.

2588
02:28:02.591 --> 02:28:05.230
Like right up the middle.
There's a better upper cut over the weekend.

2589
02:28:05.231 --> 02:28:06.100
Not to change subjects,

2590
02:28:06.101 --> 02:28:09.250
but did you see your teasers Jennings and the heavyweight belt?
Yes I did.

2591
02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:14.050
Jennings has never been knocked down or teases.
The upper cut was fucking filthy.

2592
02:28:14.110 --> 02:28:18.530
Yeah,
he's nasty man.
He's a 36 year old Cuban.
No one wants to fight South Paul.

2593
02:28:18.990 --> 02:28:20.230
Everyone's like,
what the fuck?

2594
02:28:20.231 --> 02:28:22.090
And they couldn't believe Jen's took the fight cause he's over like

2595
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:24.530
<v 1>350 amateur fights.
Well Jennings was a,</v>

2596
02:28:24.531 --> 02:28:28.070
he fought Klitschko to a decision and it had a real good fight with them.

2597
02:28:28.071 --> 02:28:30.190
And you know he's got to take that fight because this is a,

2598
02:28:30.430 --> 02:28:32.000
and this is a fight that if he beats us to it,

2599
02:28:32.001 --> 02:28:35.030
it tends to set some right back up.
The only thing is they're saying with rts,

2600
02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:39.080
like no one really knows him.
He's super dangerous.
South Paul 350 amateur fights,

2601
02:28:39.081 --> 02:28:43.790
just this monster and Cuba.
This the technique so clean.

2602
02:28:43.791 --> 02:28:48.110
He is fucking nasty.
So good.
He's older so it's time to get going.
Yeah,

2603
02:28:48.111 --> 02:28:51.170
well they're broken.
I feel about Yoel Romero but Yoel Romero.

2604
02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:53.630
Is there a guy alive built better than that man?

2605
02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:57.110
I mean if Mr Universe was real,
I agree.

2606
02:28:57.140 --> 02:29:00.740
Like if it wasn't some free could just shoots the ball into his dick hole until

2607
02:29:00.741 --> 02:29:01.970
his fucking neck explodes.

2608
02:29:02.190 --> 02:29:06.170
If it was actually like what's like the best look in body for an athlete,

2609
02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:10.130
it's Yoel Romero or woodly Woodley's right up.
He's right there.
He's right there.

2610
02:29:10.370 --> 02:29:13.670
You'll ever marrows weirder though.
He's weird or cause Woodley.

2611
02:29:13.671 --> 02:29:16.820
It almost makes sense.
It's all like,
it seems like he's fortunate.

2612
02:29:16.821 --> 02:29:19.520
He's like really well built,
but it all makes sense.
It looks like a super,

2613
02:29:19.521 --> 02:29:21.680
like first of all,

2614
02:29:21.681 --> 02:29:25.240
he's got all this extra neck and shoulder muscle Ninja turtle salt,

2615
02:29:25.260 --> 02:29:28.280
like built up like a shell,
like an end to turn in.

2616
02:29:28.281 --> 02:29:31.820
His waist is like that small and his,
his abs just retarded.

2617
02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:34.670
They don't even make sense and ask for boom.

2618
02:29:34.890 --> 02:29:36.620
It's like if you saw him in a comic book,
you'd be like,

2619
02:29:36.621 --> 02:29:40.100
why don't they make more realistic representations of men knows these

2620
02:29:40.101 --> 02:29:44.080
unrealistic images.
You're fucking with our body images.
You're ruining Madison.

2621
02:29:44.110 --> 02:29:48.680
So racist hasn't racist fuse that you got to race.

2622
02:29:49.010 --> 02:29:52.100
He looks just like the country.
How's that racist?

2623
02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:55.040
I don't think he gets the title shot though.
I fight was to boy,

2624
02:29:55.310 --> 02:29:58.400
they should make them fight.
He fought sick.
Apparently he had the flu.

2625
02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:02.540
So they were saying they're saying he was sick right up until the colts foot was

2626
02:30:02.541 --> 02:30:06.020
about to fall off.
And he still did it.
Hit Staff?
Yes.
Horrible staff.

2627
02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:11.510
Anyone by stoppage?
Yes.
So the rematch,
if you're the,
if you are,

2628
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:15.890
I'm Shoba while you were either one,
whoever makes the call,

2629
02:30:15.891 --> 02:30:20.300
I gotta be squished in Mexico.
Okay.
If you,
if you're scrooge,
what do you think?

2630
02:30:21.210 --> 02:30:25.280
Weidman Rochel too.
I could see that easy,
easy.

2631
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:27.710
Everything else doesn't make sense.
And it's in a big fight.

2632
02:30:28.250 --> 02:30:31.910
The only thing I would like to see Yoel Romero fight for the title because of

2633
02:30:31.911 --> 02:30:34.040
his age.
I feel so good.

2634
02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:37.310
He's so good and he's doesn't have much time left.

2635
02:30:37.330 --> 02:30:41.990
I had at that level when you're that level and also he relies on speed and

2636
02:30:41.991 --> 02:30:44.360
athleticism.
You're not talking about it.
Bernard Hopkins,

2637
02:30:44.660 --> 02:30:48.710
that's like this super crafty technician.
There's once that goes stops.
Yeah.

2638
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:52.300
Bernard like he the perfect example,
the difference between Bernard and like,

2639
02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:56.530
like say Roy Jones Jr like Roy Jones Jr was athleticism and speed and,
and,

2640
02:30:56.570 --> 02:31:00.350
and all this crazy power and technique.

2641
02:31:00.770 --> 02:31:04.070
But he wasn't like the classically trained box or like Bernard was,

2642
02:31:04.071 --> 02:31:06.770
so he beat Bernard early in his career,

2643
02:31:07.340 --> 02:31:09.140
but then when they fought late in the career,

2644
02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:14.100
Bernard was older than him by several years.
Yeah,
man.
And,
and,
uh,

2645
02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:18.500
Bernard beat him and Bernard just outboxed him just fought with better technique

2646
02:31:18.501 --> 02:31:20.070
when Roy and

2647
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.680
<v 3>power was all gone and his chin wasn't the same.</v>

2648
02:31:23.010 --> 02:31:26.460
Did you see him just get knocked out?
Last week he bought again.
Dude,

2649
02:31:26.461 --> 02:31:31.020
he got not dead.
How Nok in Russia?
Fourth Round.
Do we have a video of that?

2650
02:31:31.050 --> 02:31:34.710
There's like 18 people in the crowd.
Oh No,
no sir.
He's popular in Russia.

2651
02:31:34.711 --> 02:31:37.800
How old is he?
He fought a cruiserweight contender.
That's the problem.

2652
02:31:37.801 --> 02:31:41.610
How does it shit?
190500190 five he was the champion.

2653
02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:44.790
He's a champion at one 75 and then of course he went up to heavyweight.

2654
02:31:44.791 --> 02:31:48.450
He fought.
John Ruiz won the heavyweight title.
But see,

2655
02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:52.470
wasn't that 20 years ago?
A long time ago.
He's 46 I think.

2656
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:57.270
It's not that old.
No,
he was in his path was old.
It's old.

2657
02:31:57.271 --> 02:32:02.271
47 46 year old Roy Jones jr knocked out in first bout as a Russian citizen.

2658
02:32:02.730 --> 02:32:06.060
That's so rough.
They had to throw a Russian citizen there.
Note the red,
white,

2659
02:32:06.061 --> 02:32:10.830
and blue theme of bloody elbow.com
has red,
white,
and blue.

2660
02:32:11.010 --> 02:32:13.550
It's like they,
they're like fucking,
it's like this,

2661
02:32:13.880 --> 02:32:17.190
that statement along with their color layout.
It's just coincidental,

2662
02:32:17.280 --> 02:32:19.780
but it's almost like,
fuck you.
You fucking trader.
Yeah.

2663
02:32:22.650 --> 02:32:26.310
It's a bummer to see him get knocked down.
They paid him.
Oh,
they knocked down.
No,

2664
02:32:26.311 --> 02:32:29.310
no,
no,
they don't.
No,
you don't think that's not a legend.
They would never know.

2665
02:32:29.311 --> 02:32:33.120
He doesn't need money.
Well,
no.
It was a good fight up until he got,
he got tagged,

2666
02:32:33.121 --> 02:32:35.100
Dude.
I mean it's real.
You want to see it?

2667
02:32:35.250 --> 02:32:38.880
I would love to sign it and find the video behind the air.
That fucks him.
Well,

2668
02:32:38.881 --> 02:32:41.940
he first got dropped with an uppercut yet around.
He found a real good guy.

2669
02:32:41.980 --> 02:32:46.060
You fought a legit contender in the cruiserweight division and finding a cruiser

2670
02:32:46.061 --> 02:32:48.060
weight is like,
you know,
here it is.

2671
02:32:48.210 --> 02:32:52.530
The duty fought his fucking good and the guy's long and it was a good fight for

2672
02:32:52.531 --> 02:32:55.410
a while.
But like look at Roy's body.
Like what happened?

2673
02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:58.980
He's 46 fucking I know,
but look,

2674
02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:03.900
Bernard Hopkins is 49 and he doesn't have as wide a waste is Roy does.

2675
02:33:03.930 --> 02:33:07.950
That doesn't look like a man is in shape.
Wow.
He just doesn't look in good shape.

2676
02:33:07.951 --> 02:33:11.910
It looks like an HBO commentator trying to fight a fucking monster.
I mean,

2677
02:33:11.911 --> 02:33:16.500
he's still very smart,
but this is,
this is not look good to me.
Like I'm not,

2678
02:33:16.590 --> 02:33:19.110
he doesn't look like he's in the best shape.

2679
02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:24.260
Like being 49 doesn't keep him from losing body fat or 46 it doesn't help.

2680
02:33:25.380 --> 02:33:27.870
It doesn't help.
But how come Bernard looks so much good?

2681
02:33:27.871 --> 02:33:31.190
Or did I just say good or you did?
I'll take it though better,

2682
02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:32.760
but I wasn't in the wrong syllable.

2683
02:33:32.761 --> 02:33:35.610
Bernard genetically is a freak and nasty left hook to the body.

2684
02:33:35.611 --> 02:33:38.910
That dude just through,
meanwhile,
I don't even know that dude's name.
Kevin.

2685
02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:42.270
Nick died.
He gets knocked down.
I looked at the crowd like,
Nah,
I'm good man.

2686
02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:46.350
And homeboys like,
Nah.
Who Remembers Kevin McBride?
You remember Kevin McBride?

2687
02:33:46.410 --> 02:33:51.380
I don't,
he's the guy retired Mike Tyson.
Nobody remembers God.
Dang.
Yeah,

2688
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:53.880
we don't want to remember him.
Well,
it's rough.
I mean,

2689
02:33:53.881 --> 02:33:55.980
he's Tyson quit on stool against this guy.

2690
02:33:56.040 --> 02:33:59.160
So Roy is still trying to same old tricks like without leaping left hook,

2691
02:33:59.190 --> 02:34:02.040
but he's just an here comes,
here comes the uppercut dude.

2692
02:34:02.041 --> 02:34:06.840
Get some in the corner here.
What'd you do?
How dare you?

2693
02:34:07.050 --> 02:34:10.200
Oh,
there it is.
Boom.
See now,
watch him.
When he gets the crowd,

2694
02:34:10.470 --> 02:34:14.370
he still has the ego.
You got to love it.
Look at him.

2695
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:18.550
He's like this dude.
It's all good.
I don't think you look in the crowd.

2696
02:34:18.551 --> 02:34:23.050
I think he's like seeing 30 stuck his tongue.
Like it's all good baby.
Yeah,

2697
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:24.400
he stuck his tongue out to the crowd.

2698
02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:26.920
Did he stick his tongue out or is he trying to put his mouthpiece back in?

2699
02:34:27.410 --> 02:34:32.270
Not sure.
Watch.
He's smiling.
He's smiling.
Oh yeah,

2700
02:34:32.271 --> 02:34:33.380
you're right.
He stuck his tongue out.

2701
02:34:33.660 --> 02:34:36.610
But he might've been like moving his jaw too.
It might've been like this line.

2702
02:34:36.850 --> 02:34:40.620
He's talking in the RAF.
He said I'm fine.
He was looking butterflies.

2703
02:34:40.850 --> 02:34:44.590
But look at this.
Yeah,
this dude [inaudible] it's behind the ear.
That fucks on.

2704
02:34:44.591 --> 02:34:46.140
Yeah.
Being,
being,
being.

2705
02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:49.940
Look how he mixes his combinations to upper cut and here's the right hand behind

2706
02:34:49.941 --> 02:34:53.180
him.
Think.
Ah.
It's so hard to watch.

2707
02:34:53.181 --> 02:34:56.700
My bomber man is hard to watch him get filled like that.

2708
02:34:56.701 --> 02:35:00.290
It's like watching get beat up and then the guy does the cross thing to make

2709
02:35:00.291 --> 02:35:01.160
sure he doesn't die.

2710
02:35:01.610 --> 02:35:02.443
<v 4>Huh.</v>

2711
02:35:04.170 --> 02:35:08.860
<v 3>And he's like groaning and moving around while he's on his back.
Super fucked up.</v>

2712
02:35:08.861 --> 02:35:12.690
I don't like looking at his legs like look at his legs.
Those are like soft,

2713
02:35:12.691 --> 02:35:14.970
mushy legs.
You know what I'm saying?

2714
02:35:14.971 --> 02:35:19.830
Like when I think of a guy like Roy Jones jr I think of like [inaudible] sinewy

2715
02:35:19.831 --> 02:35:23.070
fast twitch,
muscle fiber.
I think of a guy in shape.

2716
02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:26.340
I'm looking at his legs and I'm like,
that's a guy not in shape.

2717
02:35:26.580 --> 02:35:29.250
Like isn't the best boxer all thug.
Look at the definition.

2718
02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:32.520
Like it's all missing like look at his body,
but a lot of boxes.

2719
02:35:32.521 --> 02:35:36.300
I like George Foreman,
George Foreman,
he flat.
Muhammad Ali was fucking jacked,

2720
02:35:36.410 --> 02:35:37.890
right?
Play,
got super fat.

2721
02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:42.270
The difference is George Foreman was a heavyweight and heavyweight who gets fat

2722
02:35:42.300 --> 02:35:44.490
is not giving up any weight.
You know?

2723
02:35:44.491 --> 02:35:49.170
I mean George still using muscle 300 pounds.
Yeah,
but he was enormous.

2724
02:35:49.171 --> 02:35:53.100
Even when he was fat.
Enormous muscles.
Big Boy.
When I'm looking at here,

2725
02:35:53.101 --> 02:35:55.080
it's like a guy who looks like he's out of shape.

2726
02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:58.230
He just doesn't look at all like he's in shape.

2727
02:35:58.350 --> 02:36:02.100
He looks like he's an analyst for HPL that jumped in there with a killer.

2728
02:36:02.190 --> 02:36:04.100
It's just exactly what's going on.
You know what it is.

2729
02:36:04.110 --> 02:36:07.380
I'll get this fucking uppercut.
Look at this.
Look in this guy's face too.

2730
02:36:07.381 --> 02:36:10.870
He's looking at murder.
I look at it as,
oh my God,

2731
02:36:10.871 --> 02:36:15.190
that right hand and put them away is terrifying.
Show that one more time.

2732
02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:20.340
God Damn the way that looks at slow motion.
Look at this.
Look at him.

2733
02:36:20.350 --> 02:36:25.220
Just a killer.
Look at her eyes and he just uncorked the perfect right hand.

2734
02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:27.250
The side of the Royce had watches him drop.

2735
02:36:28.390 --> 02:36:33.390
It's same story that plays itself out time and time and time again.

2736
02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:36.670
That's fighters though,
right?
They go out on the shield,
man.
Most guys,

2737
02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.240
I mean do they become,
they'll become fighters because they don't enjoy this,

2738
02:36:40.241 --> 02:36:44.170
you know,
but it's just so weird to watch.
It's so weird to watch it happen.

2739
02:36:44.171 --> 02:36:47.230
A Roy for whatever reason here,

2740
02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:51.730
do me a favor and put on Roy Jones Jr versus Virgil Hill.

2741
02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:53.680
Let's go back to the prime.

2742
02:36:53.710 --> 02:36:57.250
Go back to when he was the light heavyweight champion and he iced Virgil Hill

2743
02:36:57.251 --> 02:37:00.870
with his right hand.
I like real,
yeah,
go the highest highlight.
Yeah,

2744
02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:05.320
go to Roy Jones.
Highlight reel.
That's even better.
That's how this song,
dude,

2745
02:37:05.350 --> 02:37:10.270
the this,
I mean,
who the fuck was like this guy the best of all time?
To me,

2746
02:37:10.330 --> 02:37:14.200
I love him.
He's my favorite.
My favorite to watch for sure right up there.

2747
02:37:14.290 --> 02:37:17.030
You know,
the only other guy that,
uh,
was one of my favorites to watch,

2748
02:37:17.031 --> 02:37:19.970
but for a different reason.
Well,
Roberto Duran for sure,

2749
02:37:20.210 --> 02:37:24.590
but also look at the speed,
but I'm looking at his body son.

2750
02:37:24.591 --> 02:37:27.570
Look at him dancing robot.
He was amazing,

2751
02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:29.770
but he also had a weird body work.

2752
02:37:29.771 --> 02:37:34.030
He had like giant bicep muscles like his biceps were giant.
Look,

2753
02:37:34.050 --> 02:37:35.750
Jesus Christ,
look at that left hook.

2754
02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:42.170
He was just so fast,
but he relied on this.
Look at that.
Come on son.

2755
02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:45.950
Fast and powerful.
But once that goes away,
it's not a fucking me,

2756
02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:47.960
but look at the bike.
Look at his body.

2757
02:37:48.410 --> 02:37:52.790
Look at his body here and compare it to the body of the dude that we just

2758
02:37:52.791 --> 02:37:56.100
watched get knocked out.
I mean this is a fucking,
yeah,

2759
02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:00.140
he was 46 bro.
I know,
I understand.
No,

2760
02:38:00.141 --> 02:38:02.090
I mean I'm not saying that you know,

2761
02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:05.910
he has some sort of a work in the past.

2762
02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:09.080
I'm not saying it was a work ethic prom or anything like that.

2763
02:38:09.081 --> 02:38:12.830
I'm just saying it's just so fucked up to see no way he could train the same no

2764
02:38:13.490 --> 02:38:18.080
mini pads.
The ends that they had around where Vinny didn't land that one punch.

2765
02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:22.580
It was the only time ever in copy box history that the opponent didn't land a

2766
02:38:22.581 --> 02:38:25.610
punch.
It all dude.
He was insane.

2767
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:29.240
He would punch you and just be nowhere near you and you wanted to punch her
back.

2768
02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:33.650
It was just on another level speed and and like reflex wise,

2769
02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:37.520
completely different level than anybody ever is that white boy doing.

2770
02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:42.820
It's just so sad to see this guy become the guy that we just watched because I

2771
02:38:43.251 --> 02:38:46.970
mean he was out.
That's what happens,
right?
If you keep fighting.

2772
02:38:46.971 --> 02:38:51.410
This happens to everyone yas,
man,
I just don't happen to,
I don't understand why,

2773
02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:53.840
especially when you're a famous as him,
he can fight whenever you want.

2774
02:38:53.841 --> 02:38:58.070
This is like when nobody knew who he was.
Dude,
he was insane.

2775
02:38:58.730 --> 02:39:00.380
He was so,
I was there for that fight.

2776
02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:03.170
I was there live for this really is that I forgot to do.

2777
02:39:03.171 --> 02:39:05.000
His name was like this light skinned black dude.

2778
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:07.970
I saw that dude fight somewhere else too.

2779
02:39:07.970 --> 02:39:12.860
I saw that guy fight live in Mount Vernon,
New York or Malvern or White Hill,

2780
02:39:12.890 --> 02:39:16.130
white plains,
rather one of these local boxing events.

2781
02:39:16.131 --> 02:39:18.050
I saw him fight and I was like,
wow,
this guy's good.

2782
02:39:18.051 --> 02:39:22.610
And then I remember years later,
remember if I knew horn role Dan.
Oh yeah,

2783
02:39:22.611 --> 02:39:26.420
man fought them.
He fought one role.
Dan.
Wow.
I can't remember that.
I thought,

2784
02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:30.230
I know I didn't hack or fight him.
God.
One role,
Dan,

2785
02:39:30.910 --> 02:39:33.740
that he's one of those names like Mustapha hom show.
You've got to go.
Oh,

2786
02:39:33.741 --> 02:39:38.660
you know what?
Maybe it was.
Maybe it was,
uh,
who'd you say Marvin?
Hagler Ma,

2787
02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:42.410
I might be remembering it was,
I think it was,
but I,
I'm not,

2788
02:39:42.610 --> 02:39:46.220
I don't remember either.
I feel like Monreal Dan was from a different era.

2789
02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:49.700
[inaudible]
Marvin Hagler.

2790
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:53.990
Can Marvin Haggars record such a monster?
Man,
one of my face off.

2791
02:39:53.991 --> 02:39:56.480
I thought he thought Roy Jones,
but I could be wrong.
It might be right there.

2792
02:39:56.481 --> 02:40:00.060
I don't get early in as Roy John's career could want all down with her anyway.

2793
02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:05.030
Oh,
Marvin Hagler Marvin Hagler.
Yeah,
I think that was quite a few years earlier.

2794
02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:10.230
Now.
Check uh,
Roy Jones Jr.
Yeah.
One role.

2795
02:40:10.260 --> 02:40:12.330
Dan,
let's just keep showing Ron role.

2796
02:40:12.331 --> 02:40:16.230
Dan versus Hagler and Hearns different fights.
Yeah,
he fought Hearns too.
Huh?

2797
02:40:17.370 --> 02:40:21.570
Thomas Hearns versus Juan role.
Dan,
while enrolled.
Dan was a tough motherfucker,

2798
02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:25.110
so it was Mustapha hom show.
There's a lot of tough guys boxing.

2799
02:40:25.111 --> 02:40:26.970
It's good right now,
man.
It's great right now.

2800
02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:31.500
I saw this was the name Walters Walters versus Sosa.

2801
02:40:32.010 --> 02:40:36.690
Bullshit decision though,
man.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2802
02:40:36.691 --> 02:40:41.040
I mean blocks and stuff that,
that was a bad decision.
It was really bad.
I was,

2803
02:40:41.250 --> 02:40:43.410
I was watching,
I was like this doesn't even make sense.

2804
02:40:43.410 --> 02:40:45.810
How the fuck did that happen?
And Max Kellerman was like,

2805
02:40:45.811 --> 02:40:47.250
what the fuck are we doing?

2806
02:40:47.310 --> 02:40:51.540
Where do you fit a watching and the main your in your schedule,

2807
02:40:51.570 --> 02:40:54.630
like where does it go?
How do you guys retain all this?

2808
02:40:54.631 --> 02:40:57.600
You must be watching these fights at least twice,
right?

2809
02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:00.480
It depends on what the fights like obviously I do it for a living.

2810
02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:03.840
So the UFC gym watches,
right?
I watched the,

2811
02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:08.160
I watched the Cowboy dos Anjos fight three times.
Okay.
Yeah.

2812
02:41:08.161 --> 02:41:10.890
I just wanted to watch it again because I was just so impressed.
I'm so,

2813
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.530
he's just such a destroyer.

2814
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:17.610
Like the way he unquote like the combination that he threw when he had cowboy

2815
02:41:17.611 --> 02:41:21.280
hurt up against the cage.
Nasty and tight.
Like no,
it's what,

2816
02:41:21.330 --> 02:41:24.960
no wild stupid shit controls just controlled aggression.

2817
02:41:24.990 --> 02:41:28.290
Just super so super aggressive.
Super fast guys.

2818
02:41:28.291 --> 02:41:31.220
You see get home wild cause she didn't finish it.
He stayed composed.

2819
02:41:31.221 --> 02:41:33.740
Beat the fuck man.
You guys are on top of boxing too.

2820
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:37.170
Well I watched this last night.
I came home last night and I watched the fight,

2821
02:41:37.171 --> 02:41:41.850
man.
Yeah,
I recorded everything.
I watch a lot of fights.
Kickboxing.
I'm deep in.

2822
02:41:41.970 --> 02:41:44.280
That's my favorite shit.
My favorite show.
His glory.

2823
02:41:44.450 --> 02:41:46.890
This is my favorite shit to watch right now is my favorite right now.

2824
02:41:47.940 --> 02:41:52.350
More than MMA.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Come on.
No,
no,
no,
no.

2825
02:41:52.351 --> 02:41:57.351
The fuck are you guys talking about MMA is 100% number one of other shit.

2826
02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:01.750
What?
I should have clarified that other shit.
Glory is my favorite.
Oh,
boxing.

2827
02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:04.590
Okay.
Rico Verhoeven.
Did you see as a his last fight?

2828
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:09.900
The Monster Lord do it.
He's a motherfucker.
He's a motherfucker dude.

2829
02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:13.040
And for guys like,
like standup,
you like only watching like,

2830
02:42:13.090 --> 02:42:17.310
like get mad when UFC fights go to the ground.
Watch glory.

2831
02:42:17.730 --> 02:42:20.850
Watch that man.
Those fucking fights or barn burners.

2832
02:42:21.420 --> 02:42:25.050
They are good to me.
There's just so many matches to make him box.

2833
02:42:25.470 --> 02:42:30.230
There's so much good shit.
Yeah.
About tans.
Crawford.
Watch that dude.
Yeah man.

2834
02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:33.990
Good Lord.
Good God.
Damn that dude's good.
Woo.
Really good.

2835
02:42:34.170 --> 02:42:37.430
He's such a good adjuster to adjust in fights and switches.

2836
02:42:37.470 --> 02:42:41.310
Stance is really well from Orthodox to southpaw.
You see his last fight?
Yeah.

2837
02:42:41.311 --> 02:42:44.040
As soon as he realized he switched southpaw and caught that dude with a right

2838
02:42:44.041 --> 02:42:46.950
hook.
It's like,
oh,
we're going to be fighting like this from now on,
sir.
Yeah,
man.

2839
02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:49.620
This beat the fuck out of the dude is a brass.
Yeah.

2840
02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:53.160
Close fight in the beginning of the first round until he found the rhythm and

2841
02:42:53.161 --> 02:42:55.500
then figured it out and I said,
oh,
I'll just switch stances up on this.

2842
02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:58.620
He thought he was going to get a mega fight next against Floyd or something.

2843
02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:01.440
They're all scared of him.
Nobody wants that.
No one wants to buy and fuck that.

2844
02:43:01.530 --> 02:43:03.690
Nobody knows who he is outside of Nebraska.

2845
02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:05.250
Everybody in Nebraska knows who he is.

2846
02:43:05.251 --> 02:43:07.440
A lot of hardcore boxing fans know who he is.
Yes,

2847
02:43:07.490 --> 02:43:10.170
but like the average Joe on the street,

2848
02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:14.020
the average person they know Floyd Mayweather is and it'll pack hours.

2849
02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:16.290
That's the next fight.
I guarantee.

2850
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:20.050
I guarantee you I'm going to make a prediction.
This is my prediction.

2851
02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:23.050
In April they're going to fight again.
I saw pictures of Manny Pacquiao.

2852
02:43:23.051 --> 02:43:26.380
He's trip back to training again.
Many pack y'all on his Instagram page.

2853
02:43:26.381 --> 02:43:29.320
Today's hitting pads.
So he had a shoulder surgery.

2854
02:43:29.530 --> 02:43:32.320
They probably shot him up with the same shit they shot me up with.

2855
02:43:32.590 --> 02:43:37.510
He probably healed 50% quicker.
They fucking stem cells.

2856
02:43:37.570 --> 02:43:40.690
I know a lot of dudes are doing that now.
I've ever since.
I,
um,

2857
02:43:41.230 --> 02:43:43.720
got my stem cell shots and I started talking to him about it.
Swear by it.

2858
02:43:43.721 --> 02:43:46.440
A bunch of other people started talking to me about stem cells to,
yeah,

2859
02:43:46.570 --> 02:43:49.840
look at Manny Pacquiao shoulder surgery a few months ago.

2860
02:43:49.841 --> 02:43:53.260
He's full blast and Charles Manz ads.

2861
02:43:54.670 --> 02:43:57.580
Full blast power punching on pads now man,
come on.

2862
02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:02.500
That's what you're supposed to wait like a year.
Probably Joost.

2863
02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:06.550
Thankfully they probably whacked on what?
The secret sauce,

2864
02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:10.700
the secret sauce that only a fix you up when you're talking about a big mess and

2865
02:44:10.701 --> 02:44:13.630
they ain't got no,
this ain't the UFC bitch ain't no drug test.

2866
02:44:13.631 --> 02:44:15.280
Test and son not in between.

2867
02:44:15.310 --> 02:44:18.610
That's one of the beautiful things about these guys too.
In between camp.

2868
02:44:18.611 --> 02:44:22.450
Like they get injured.
That's what steroids are for.
Boom.

2869
02:44:22.570 --> 02:44:25.930
What's what they're for.
They're supposed to get you back out there quicker.

2870
02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.240
Do for football player or um,

2871
02:44:28.270 --> 02:44:31.120
any sort of an athlete in another sport that doesn't get tested outside of

2872
02:44:31.121 --> 02:44:35.620
seasons.
You're supposed to do steroids.
They make you look at it.
He's back.

2873
02:44:36.260 --> 02:44:39.820
A little tiny baby scar to tea.
They think of you a little baby scars.

2874
02:44:39.821 --> 02:44:44.210
Now they go,
that's a lot of filtering jack.

2875
02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:46.810
That's Photoshop,
Bro.
I can put my head on that.

2876
02:44:46.990 --> 02:44:50.310
They're going to put a Eddie Bravo was head on that tonight.
Guaranteed.
Hey,

2877
02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:54.370
question.
When you had that goatee,
good luck honey.
Dick in the fans and doe.

2878
02:44:54.371 --> 02:44:58.990
Floyd.
Man,
it's going to happen.
There's my nowhere.
Nowhere.
I may be wrong.

2879
02:44:58.991 --> 02:45:01.720
I'm wrong about a lot of shit,
but here's my prediction.

2880
02:45:02.110 --> 02:45:04.480
They're in to open up that new arena in April,

2881
02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:08.770
the new arena in Vegas and in April they're going to,

2882
02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:13.420
they're going to have a Floyd Mayweather,
Manny Pacquiao dose I lot shit.

2883
02:45:13.421 --> 02:45:15.230
I like it.
I think I'll buy the five thing.

2884
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:19.690
I think Floyd Mayweather starts talking.
It's right now it's December.

2885
02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:24.290
I think he starts talking somewhere around January,
the end of January.

2886
02:45:24.350 --> 02:45:28.180
I like start saying,
you know what I'm thinking about coming back.

2887
02:45:28.210 --> 02:45:29.050
And then he hunting Dick's,

2888
02:45:29.051 --> 02:45:33.310
Terrence Crawford and Canelo Alvarez and everybody else hunting digsau cause

2889
02:45:33.311 --> 02:45:37.930
Canelo Alvarez little cool dude.
He little good against Miguel.
Cotto good.

2890
02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:40.900
You look good.
And I thought it looked real good.
Codos a motherfucker,
dude.

2891
02:45:40.901 --> 02:45:45.580
He's a crafty,
he's older.
He's still very good.
Yeah,
I think,
uh,
I think,

2892
02:45:45.610 --> 02:45:47.980
and then Manny Pacquiao,
you know,

2893
02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:51.940
they start going over the fact that he got the shoulder surgery and they show

2894
02:45:51.941 --> 02:45:54.910
him hitting the pants to get everybody to believe again.

2895
02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:58.370
He starts talking about Jesus.
He says all,

2896
02:45:59.430 --> 02:46:04.000
he starts doing the cross thing and everybody's like,
you have a chance.

2897
02:46:04.001 --> 02:46:08.770
The first time,
the first time he was injured,
I'm that guy.
I'm that guy.

2898
02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:10.210
They can get me.
I watched

2899
02:46:10.210 --> 02:46:14.020
<v 0>one countdown show I am and take my hundred dollars.
You know what I like?</v>

2900
02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:16.700
I liked the ones with Max Kellerman when they sit him across the table and then

2901
02:46:16.701 --> 02:46:19.040
make them talk to each other,
they soft.
Those are my favorite.

2902
02:46:19.250 --> 02:46:22.820
And Max Kellerman says like,
he said that you are this like you.

2903
02:46:22.850 --> 02:46:24.860
He said you have no chin.
How do you respond to that?

2904
02:46:25.170 --> 02:46:27.470
And then it's usually some dude's speak in Spanish,

2905
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:32.670
this motherfucker and they say say it in Spanish like ac Slater with the chair

2906
02:46:32.721 --> 02:46:36.380
backwards steering each other.
It's sick.
Those are great.
I love those.

2907
02:46:36.470 --> 02:46:40.310
Those are fun ma'am.
The UFC needs to do something like that.
Oof.

2908
02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:42.650
Well that's the thing we're talking about like Nate Diaz and Conor,

2909
02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:47.680
I think Eddie's got the best idea to eat glass phone.

2910
02:46:47.780 --> 02:46:49.190
Any problems.
Got It.
Right.

2911
02:46:49.220 --> 02:46:52.880
No prison glass with a phone or through [inaudible] and gentlemen.
Joey hosting.

2912
02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:56.390
No.
Yeah,
but the problem with three giant dudes in between them,

2913
02:46:56.570 --> 02:46:59.780
it's not good and I might still sucker punched him.

2914
02:46:59.810 --> 02:47:02.710
That's going to hype the fight up even more at DC.
John Jones,

2915
02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:05.810
why are you against this?
Why are you against it?

2916
02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:09.970
What do you like better?
Do you like animals?

2917
02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:14.400
I kind of like your prison glass even better.
You can't sell breaking.

2918
02:47:14.430 --> 02:47:16.700
That'd be breaking the fucking phone and shit.

2919
02:47:16.701 --> 02:47:19.760
They have to have a tech like a bunch of them.
Maybe a bunch of booze

2920
02:47:21.570 --> 02:47:23.090
or the cage.
Just put a fence up.

2921
02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:30.620
We'll leave the Joe Silva told Nate Diaz the Conor McGregor is next or do you

2922
02:47:30.621 --> 02:47:34.220
think that Nate Diaz is being real smart and talking some shit and getting

2923
02:47:34.221 --> 02:47:35.960
people show silver as a smart guy?

2924
02:47:35.961 --> 02:47:39.600
He knows damn well I didn't have the power to make that fun.
You know damn well

2925
02:47:41.110 --> 02:47:46.070
please.
Danny goes,
Huh?
That's not the fight.
All right.
Dana,

2926
02:47:46.071 --> 02:47:48.800
probably text him.
Did you tell him that joke,
right?
No,
I didn't sir.
What?

2927
02:47:48.801 --> 02:47:52.880
What Bob Buck Ninja versus Ninja Dss.
UFC match.
Yeah.
That's what we just said.

2928
02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:56.090
Yeah.
I just don't,
I don't,
I don't see him doing that.

2929
02:47:56.540 --> 02:47:59.870
I think Nate's being smart.
I think he's talking shit and gets great.

2930
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:05.180
I think he's talking shit talking shit that should,
who?
Frankie Edgar.

2931
02:48:05.540 --> 02:48:09.770
He should be.
He did.
He said,
he said,
if you're scared,
get a dog.
Yeah,
I saw that.

2932
02:48:09.810 --> 02:48:13.370
You gotta.
You gotta be relentless though.
You know what I'm saying?
I know.

2933
02:48:13.371 --> 02:48:14.780
I guess it's not his style.

2934
02:48:14.781 --> 02:48:16.700
It's not as thought was fighting should speak for itself,

2935
02:48:16.701 --> 02:48:18.590
but that's not the type,
that's not the game plan.

2936
02:48:18.591 --> 02:48:21.170
Now I feel like there's only one fight to make it further.
Wait,

2937
02:48:21.410 --> 02:48:25.370
there's only one fight.
It's 100% Frankie Edgar hundred percent.
I couldn't,

2938
02:48:25.371 --> 02:48:29.540
couldn't be more emphatic about that,
but fucking as a fan.

2939
02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:33.620
That's what I'm saying.
As a fan,
I don't mind this fucking Nate Diaz fight.

2940
02:48:33.950 --> 02:48:38.290
I know I,
and I love Frankie.
I want Frankie to get the shot.
12 frank,

2941
02:48:38.330 --> 02:48:42.140
if you're the king,
what do you do it?
If I'm screwing me up,
Dana,

2942
02:48:42.141 --> 02:48:45.430
like all the fucking calls,
but no,
I'm dating.
I'm not knowing.
I mean,

2943
02:48:45.431 --> 02:48:46.264
I don't even mean,

2944
02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:50.360
I don't even mean you're not even Dana because Dana has talked to Lorenzo.
Okay.

2945
02:48:51.050 --> 02:48:55.180
What if you are,
you're just the king.
You're the king.
What's the call,
ma'am?

2946
02:48:55.270 --> 02:48:57.530
You get in trouble here.
But if I'm trying to get,

2947
02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:00.770
if I'm trying to sell the fight,
I want as much money possible.

2948
02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:05.840
It's Diaz Conor on a world tour.
But if I'm a good man and I have morals,

2949
02:49:06.020 --> 02:49:08.160
I make Frankie Edgar,
uh,

2950
02:49:08.220 --> 02:49:11.970
<v 1>Tanner,
and then the winner that fights Josie.
Well,
when Josie gets healthy,</v>

2951
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:16.680
here's the question though.
Can they tell Connor who to fight now or as Connor?

2952
02:49:16.681 --> 02:49:20.590
So meteoric,
hazy,
so out of control as he,

2953
02:49:20.591 --> 02:49:25.200
so off the charts would have,
Connor says,
I want to be a promoter,
would have,

2954
02:49:25.201 --> 02:49:28.100
Connor says he wants to go money team.
He wants a coat.

2955
02:49:28.101 --> 02:49:32.750
Promote and do like he has the power.
He almost does.
He does.
Does he?

2956
02:49:32.820 --> 02:49:37.650
80,000 Dublin.
What?
Oh,
he could tell that out in about a minute.

2957
02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:40.210
Literally a minute.
A minute.
Yeah.
It sounds like Ron is,

2958
02:49:40.590 --> 02:49:43.680
nobody was going to ruin their credit card information.

2959
02:49:43.890 --> 02:49:46.710
And then at the stroke of midnight,
1159,

2960
02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:50.250
they're all going to press enter the same time.
The computer's going to overload.

2961
02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:52.650
All the servers are going to crash.
I for reals,

2962
02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:57.630
I'm terrified to fly because I says I'm fucking,
I'm there buying it front row.

2963
02:49:57.810 --> 02:50:01.380
Fucking what I'll do.
You'd be my guest.
You'd have to come.
It'd be amazing.

2964
02:50:01.410 --> 02:50:04.110
It'd be amazing.
Congress has the power to.
If they go,

2965
02:50:04.111 --> 02:50:07.890
we want to fight dos Anjos he goes,
Nah,
I'm good.
Notorious Promotions.

2966
02:50:08.230 --> 02:50:11.780
He's going to,
he's going to have his own fight and the Torres Koto Aria.
Yeah.

2967
02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:16.140
Look man,
I don't know.
He can't for the sport.
Here's what's,
here's what's crazy.

2968
02:50:16.290 --> 02:50:19.470
It's almost like he can't get any bigger.
So what happens now?

2969
02:50:19.471 --> 02:50:21.540
Does he just go v since you go parallel?

2970
02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:24.490
Cause he just keeps staying the whole time.

2971
02:50:24.940 --> 02:50:27.580
Fucking saint enough Hollywood going,
come in.

2972
02:50:27.910 --> 02:50:30.870
I want to do final fucking furious fast.

2973
02:50:32.850 --> 02:50:37.050
Come here.
Let's fuck your career and he's going to ruin it to put you in fucking

2974
02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:39.240
transformer.
13 next thing you know,

2975
02:50:39.241 --> 02:50:43.110
he's dating black chicks with big juicy acids and a lot of jewelry.

2976
02:50:43.410 --> 02:50:47.250
Dododo does.
That sounds awesome.
That sounds ideal.

2977
02:50:48.030 --> 02:50:49.700
And he's driving a Mustang off the top of it.

2978
02:50:52.410 --> 02:50:57.040
It's a fucking crazy moving.
Hopefully sewn isn't as aired.

2979
02:50:57.041 --> 02:51:00.060
Tell him it's fun.
It's a fun time.
It's fun time to be an MMA fan,

2980
02:51:00.061 --> 02:51:03.180
that's for sure.
Especially if you're Conor McGregor.
If I'm scrooge MCDUCK,

2981
02:51:03.360 --> 02:51:05.580
I'm the king of the world.
I make the Frankie Edgar fight,

2982
02:51:05.581 --> 02:51:06.660
or at least I make an attempt to,

2983
02:51:06.690 --> 02:51:08.340
I don't know how much influence they have over him,

2984
02:51:08.490 --> 02:51:13.170
but what I would say is I would say honestly your future probably as 155 pounds.

2985
02:51:13.171 --> 02:51:18.000
He struggled to make one 45 but your legacy will be complete if you beat frank.

2986
02:51:18.420 --> 02:51:21.000
What if common goes one 45 too tough for me.

2987
02:51:21.001 --> 02:51:25.080
I haven't found any band band and the hundred 45 pound title and move up and

2988
02:51:25.081 --> 02:51:30.000
fight who?
Josie Aldo meets Frankie Edgar rematch.
Okay.
For the title.
I like that.

2989
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:34.560
And um,
Frankie or,
and then Nate Diaz.
Then you have Nate Diaz versus Conor.

2990
02:51:34.561 --> 02:51:37.110
It's first fight at 55 if he gets past Nate Diaz,

2991
02:51:37.111 --> 02:51:41.080
you 100% having fight dos Anjos correct.
Dos Anjos fight to be remembered.
Madoff.

2992
02:51:41.130 --> 02:51:45.780
In the meantime,
if it,
why not?
Is it fun for every he's been injured.

2993
02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:50.040
That's true.
That's true.
If anything,
Tony Ferguson.
Exactly.

2994
02:51:51.990 --> 02:51:56.500
Don't forget about Tony Ferguson.
Dos Anjos.
That's a motherfucker.
That's true.

2995
02:51:58.600 --> 02:52:02.700
Especially on the Fargo is a fight.
That's true.
That's true.

2996
02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:06.010
What about Tony Versus Cowboy?

2997
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:08.370
<v 3>It's already,
they already made it look at that.
Damn.</v>

2998
02:52:08.371 --> 02:52:13.290
They Photoshop do's don't fuck around him.
Hell No.
That's legit.
Too quick.

2999
02:52:15.060 --> 02:52:18.940
No Holy Shit.
Fans around.
Give the guy credit,
whoever,

3000
02:52:18.941 --> 02:52:23.770
whoever the guy was he fine with the guy was oh snap listening his name.

3001
02:52:23.771 --> 02:52:27.400
Say just casual casual.
It's can't hear Mommy's on TV.

3002
02:52:27.401 --> 02:52:31.530
That's your motto with the titties.
Get on TV.
Yeah,
that's my message boards.

3003
02:52:31.570 --> 02:52:36.130
Awesome message boards filled barbarians.
Really their animals in a good way.

3004
02:52:36.220 --> 02:52:40.060
Yeah.
Um,
oh what was I gonna say?
Uh,
okay.

3005
02:52:40.061 --> 02:52:43.800
So Tony Ferguson,
you have fight dos Anjos snacks.
Totally agree with that.
Yeah.

3006
02:52:43.990 --> 02:52:47.290
Great fight.
Great man.
Like for the money though,

3007
02:52:47.320 --> 02:52:51.220
the real big money fight for dos Anjos is obviously Connor,

3008
02:52:51.430 --> 02:52:55.930
but outside of Connor,
who's a big money fight,
Habib,

3009
02:52:56.110 --> 02:52:58.510
we don't even know when he'll be,
he was going to be back.
Right.

3010
02:52:58.980 --> 02:53:02.300
So do you have to give,
give Habib uh,
uh,

3011
02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:07.060
fight against the top guy before he gets a title shot to fight again.
Okay.

3012
02:53:07.180 --> 02:53:10.270
So if so,
who do you give him?
God,
Tony Ferguson.

3013
02:53:10.271 --> 02:53:12.640
Cause they were supposed to fight,
right?
Who's Pettis fighting again?

3014
02:53:12.641 --> 02:53:16.960
Pedis is finding someone
that's on the Fox card.

3015
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:21.430
The FX fs one in Boston?
Correct.
Wow.
That's Ben Saunders.

3016
02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:26.530
Patrick co-tenants.
Right.
I'll be there.
I was going to be in Boston for Boston.

3017
02:53:27.060 --> 02:53:29.310
Yup.
I get there on site.
That's a motherfucker.
That's a,

3018
02:53:29.360 --> 02:53:33.460
that's a weird weekend for me.
I'm not there for the Wayans.
I've got um,

3019
02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:35.193
Atlanta,

3020
02:53:35.390 --> 02:53:39.040
a theater in Atlanta and then the theater in Tampa and then I fly into Boston.

3021
02:53:39.090 --> 02:53:43.150
You,
you don't another fight that could sell like hotcakes at 55,

3022
02:53:43.151 --> 02:53:48.130
Connor and pedis pedis gets by Alvarez.
Boy,
that's a,
that's another blockbuster.

3023
02:53:48.190 --> 02:53:50.800
There's so many blockbuster.
That's a good fight.

3024
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:53.430
That's a good fight for um,

3025
02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:59.320
pedes versus a Connor is a good fight as far as like styles and on paper and

3026
02:54:00.881 --> 02:54:04.510
stuff.
I think that's a really good fight.
But man,
it's a tough sell.

3027
02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:09.630
After Namaka Madoff or after a dos Anjos rather beat up pedis pedis has got to

3028
02:54:09.941 --> 02:54:13.520
get a victory under his belt in order to,
he gets,

3029
02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:18.170
let's say,
get,
gets a head kick,
Kol like,
Oh shit.
Yeah.

3030
02:54:18.171 --> 02:54:20.860
If he beats him like he beat Lowe's on or something like that.

3031
02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:25.330
Or Cowboy in Japan.
Yeah.
I mean look,
pedes when he loses,

3032
02:54:25.390 --> 02:54:27.280
usually comes back away.
Better fighter.

3033
02:54:27.310 --> 02:54:29.440
And then that's what happened when he fucked like Weda Click,

3034
02:54:29.450 --> 02:54:32.250
we'd have stuffed him,
shut them down.
He came back a way better pedis,

3035
02:54:32.251 --> 02:54:35.590
one of my favorite fighters to watch ever.
He's spectacular.
Fucking ridiculous.

3036
02:54:35.591 --> 02:54:39.400
Why did they separate the prelims and the main card of it's on the same channel?

3037
02:54:39.970 --> 02:54:40.241
Um,

3038
02:54:40.241 --> 02:54:43.960
just so that people can time it so that it's like there's two different blocks

3039
02:54:43.961 --> 02:54:48.040
of shows.
So instead of having a six hour block of fights,
um,

3040
02:54:48.130 --> 02:54:52.000
they have a two,
three hour blocks.
In this case it seems like less than that.

3041
02:54:52.001 --> 02:54:55.420
It seems like two hours,
cause it's only four fights in four fights.
First of all,

3042
02:54:55.421 --> 02:54:57.310
you have Felder,
verse Kruk Shawl,

3043
02:54:57.340 --> 02:55:02.340
crank Shell at the Frank Sean Crookshank Cruickshank the Detroit superstars.

3044
02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:05.750
That's a mother fucking great fights son.

3045
02:55:05.900 --> 02:55:08.990
That's your fight of the night on that card.
Well,
you know another candidate,

3046
02:55:09.140 --> 02:55:12.290
Ross Pearson versus a Francis coach.
Rinaldo.
I'm not mad at that,

3047
02:55:12.291 --> 02:55:14.790
but that's a good fucking fight right there.
Otay Sanders,

3048
02:55:14.820 --> 02:55:18.560
this card stack Saunders.
Ben Saunders.
Eddie Bravo student.

3049
02:55:18.561 --> 02:55:21.760
How dare you saw it was a bad motherfucker to ties him off that,

3050
02:55:21.761 --> 02:55:26.690
that dude's a bad motherfucker.
Has that name.
Was he fighting?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's,

3051
02:55:26.750 --> 02:55:31.040
he's nasty man.
Dude rose over back Tyson some.
Have you seen that guy fight?

3052
02:55:31.041 --> 02:55:35.720
He's um,
he trains out of a Pooh cat.
He's one of those.
Um,
when the Russians,

3053
02:55:36.020 --> 02:55:39.860
yeah.
Um,
uh,
tiger Muay Thai.
He's a tiger Muay Thai guy.
Bladder Russians.

3054
02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:44.030
Right to take over.
It's begun to mention,
I think we're at a time.

3055
02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:49.010
Are we out of time to that card's a mother fucker,
mother fucker.
So it was time.

3056
02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:51.590
That was three hours.
We're talking about fights for 20 minutes.

3057
02:55:51.620 --> 02:55:53.330
We talked about sharks for an hour.

3058
02:55:53.480 --> 02:55:58.430
We talked about Kurt Cobain for two hours and the fights for 30 seconds.

3059
02:55:58.970 --> 02:56:03.340
We're talking about if it's the CIA killed John Lennon and uh,

3060
02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:07.070
we've made a few steroid out allegations.
Just,
we tried it,
we cleared it up.

3061
02:56:07.100 --> 02:56:10.640
We want to get the MMA media and give him some fruit.

3062
02:56:10.670 --> 02:56:13.730
There's your headline's a little hose.
Can I get out of everybody?
We love you.

3063
02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:14.270
See you.
