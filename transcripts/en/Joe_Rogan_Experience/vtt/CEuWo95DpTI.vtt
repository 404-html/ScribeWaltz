24
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.110

<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

25
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were always in show business </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you ran the Riviera,</v>

26
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>but to go from that to being on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>soprano's I remember hearing about it </v>

27
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 1>and then seeing it and the sopranos was </v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite show at the time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was so weird watching a guy like you </v>

147
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I sing in a phone booth.</v>

150
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.790
<v Speaker 1>He didn't care at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

152
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 1>He just turned 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like 1990.</v>

153
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So that was probably the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>

154
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Right before he started losing a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a teleprompter onstage,</v>

155
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was reading though,</v>

156
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't completely out of it,</v>

157
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he died in [inaudible] 99 if I'm</v>

158
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:54.390
<v Speaker 1>not mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

159
00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would forget his lyrics.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

164
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 1>I just think he was getting older and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think to be honest,</v>

165
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>my opinion that kept them out there too </v>

166
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think whoever the powers may be,</v>

167
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:14.411
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he stayed a little too long </v>

168

<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

217
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>they always exaggerate things for shows </v>

<v Speaker 1>I of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

219
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:11.910

<v Speaker 1>I don't know where they got it from,</v>

220
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:13.030

<v Speaker 1>They don't deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

350
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just so crazy to me.</v>

351
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus if I want to get treated good,</v>

352
00:14:31.301 --> 00:14:36.301
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be a plumber from encino and </v>

353
00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 1>throw a few bucks around and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get treated like a king for,</v>

354
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it take?</v>

355
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what that whole town is about.</v>

356
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:46.530
<v Speaker 1>At least it wasn't when it was built on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kind of took that away because a </v>

357
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:51.031
<v Speaker 1>lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it started with Steve when a lot of </v>

358
00:14:51.031 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a big one.</v>

359
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:57.030
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought they would make it too much </v>

360
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.030
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The deal is the waitresses,</v>

361
00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 1>the captains in the show room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a 90 year old friend,</v>

362
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:02.840
<v Speaker 1>was the captain in the showroom during </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elvis at the Hilton.</v>

363
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 1>He was making $800 a night cash in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

364
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 1>A lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably like 8,000</v>

365
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:14.310
<v Speaker 1>in Vegas at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your cost,</v>

366
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.540
<v Speaker 1>it still doesn't cost a much to live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>

367
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:22.541
<v Speaker 1>But then of course nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these guys were buying land and they </v>

368
00:15:22.541 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 1>were invested in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

369
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:28.991
<v Speaker 1>and going out at night and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trickling down really well when stopped </v>

370
00:15:28.991 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's the first guy to do the numbered</v>

371
00:15:30.651 --> 00:15:31.620
<v Speaker 1>seeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he.</v>

372
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what he did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer.</v>

373
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 1>He got rid of all those captains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maitre d's,</v>

374
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 1>waitresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.480
<v Speaker 1>he days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

376
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.830
<v Speaker 1>he got there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They no longer.</v>

377
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.600
<v Speaker 1>When you have a show in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a number ticket to get in?</v>

378
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people know where they're going.</v>

379
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.490
<v Speaker 1>It didn't used to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You used to buy,</v>

380
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.340
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to go in and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you tip the Maitre d,</v>

381
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 1>$20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$30,</v>

382
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:55.010
<v Speaker 1>$40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get a good seat.</v>

383
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what Vegas was built on for years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and years and years.</v>

384
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.610
<v Speaker 1>He stopped all that same thing with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealer.</v>

385
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.210
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want them to make as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they put it on the check.</v>

386
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Now they all pull no matter whether you </v>
<v Speaker 1>work hard enough,</v>

387
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.720
<v Speaker 1>so when you go into a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to a blackjack game and you </v>

388
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.870
<v Speaker 1>got to deal with that's a prick and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw this bitch,</v>

389
00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give her anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't tip.</v>

390
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.990
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a nice guy and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

391
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 1>He's a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give him $100.</v>

392
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the night,</v>

393
00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:26.480
<v Speaker 1>that all goes into a big pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four hours a day.</v>

394
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Every deal splits them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds ridiculous,</v>

395
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.230
<v Speaker 1>is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some guys are slack is and they go,</v>

396
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:38.860
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't got out of this is going to go </v>

397
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:38.860

<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

399
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.140
<v Speaker 1>And no personality and flair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what.</v>

400
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.110
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.240
<v Speaker 1>So that whole Steve Wynn decided to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because I think he thought people </v>

402
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:54.410
<v Speaker 1>tip and big make it too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money that could have been instead of </v>

403
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 1>tip and he'll make the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

404
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:58.730
<v Speaker 1>instead of me giving the Maitre d $100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a good seat,</v>

405
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.390

<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to get the money.</v>

406
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.590
<v Speaker 1>That's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dice took a lot of shit for a long time </v>

444
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:25.840
<v Speaker 1>and now it's finally coming around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool to like dice again.</v>

445
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.920
<v Speaker 1>You know why it went so bad in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>place I don't solve it was MTV and </v>

446
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:35.790
<v Speaker 1>political correctness and it was just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different time back then.</v>

447
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Like they were trying to get away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

448
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.730
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to move away from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of humor that he was doing.</v>

449
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

450
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.850
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're a comedian who's to say,</v>

451
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:50.370
<v Speaker 1>who could say what onstage and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

452
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>

453
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 1>And we could go round and round and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't make a joke about this.</v>

454
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the whole thing's about.</v>

455
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you know a guy like Buddy Hackett and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those old comics that you should do </v>

456
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Polish jokes and a Chinese jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese jokes?</v>

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>white people.</v>

463
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.560
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's totally acceptable and you can't,</v>

464
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.140
<v Speaker 1>you can't make fun of black people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

465
00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:22.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

466
00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:22.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

467
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Even light skinned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black people have a hard time making fun</v>

468
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:27.300
<v Speaker 1>of black people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GotTa very careful.</v>

469
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

470
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get all that,</v>

471
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:36.720
<v Speaker 1>but that swung so far joe sometimes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a political guy.</v>

472
00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's so broken in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

473
00:19:39.451 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 1>It can't be fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

474
00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:45.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is I think is more people have </v>

475
00:19:45.981 --> 00:19:47.871
<v Speaker 1>opinions now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people can express their opinions </v>

476
00:19:47.871 --> 00:19:47.871
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different world.</v>

477
00:19:47.871 --> 00:19:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Whereas there's so much coming at you </v>
<v Speaker 1>from so many different angles and then </v>

478
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.310
<v Speaker 1>people realize they can express their </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>

479
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.400
<v Speaker 1>So many people realize that if they say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something on facebook,</v>

480
00:19:56.401 --> 00:19:58.710
<v Speaker 1>it'll get a bunch of likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if they say something on twitter,</v>

481
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy to do that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous.</v>

482
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to though,</v>

483
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:05.520
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't want to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous,</v>

484
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.490
<v Speaker 1>but they all do it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that two people that could just,</v>

485
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:15.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker you from now until forever </v>

486
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:15.020
<v Speaker 1>and you don't even know who the guy is.</v>

487
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.080
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they see it,</v>

488
00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 1>they still know they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why they're doing it.</v>

489
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.510
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it to get attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if the attention doesn't directly </v>

490
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.510
<v Speaker 1>come to them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it doesn't come at their name.</v>

492
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 1>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know that fuck face 69,</v>

494
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.080
<v Speaker 1>they make that and so when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying something nasty about you,</v>

495
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 1>they know that they're the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote it and he responded and tell their</v>

496
00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:38.890
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

497
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.400
<v Speaker 1>it's just people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a new thing.</v>

499
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a new thing to be able to reach out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

500
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a new thing to be able to protest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to comment</v>

501
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.890
<v Speaker 2>on people and to be able to organize </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like very easily.</v>

502
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Like if a comedian,</v>

<v Speaker 2>television show.</v>

507

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens over and over and over.</v>

00:21:28.241 --> 00:21:30.320
<v Speaker 2>this guy could share a bathroom with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your daughter.</v>

521
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.350
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

522
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.310
<v Speaker 2>that is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in,</v>

523
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.590
<v Speaker 2>in someone not admitting that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't help anybody.</v>

524
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't,</v>

525
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.690
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't help.</v>

526
00:21:44.691 --> 00:21:47.770
<v Speaker 2>But goddamn thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is possible.</v>

527
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Like you could get a fucking nut bag who</v>
<v Speaker 2>wears a dress and what's a whip his cock</v>

528
00:21:52.401 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 2>out in front of women and says there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman that that is a real thing.</v>

529
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not saying that it should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

530
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not saying that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority,</v>

531
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 2>but we got to define what's a woman and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's not a woman.</v>

532
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:10.310
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to allow transgender </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to transition and become a the </v>

533
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 2>other gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's woman to Male,</v>

534
00:22:11.231 --> 00:22:13.150
<v Speaker 2>male to female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta,</v>

535
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 2>we gotta make some sort of a standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we know that that's exactly what's</v>

536
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:17.830
<v Speaker 2>going on in this.</v>

537
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Not just someone who's a crazy fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to wear a dress,</v>

538
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.460
<v Speaker 2>but how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great question.</v>

539
00:22:23.461 --> 00:22:24.550
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

540
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:29.551
<v Speaker 2>that's why the idea of making people go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a bathroom that is their gender,</v>

541
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.010
<v Speaker 2>what they're born with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their sex,</v>

542
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:38.080
<v Speaker 2>what's their chromosomes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not preposterous and everybody's </v>

543
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.371
<v Speaker 2>making it seem like it's bigoted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>force people to use a bathroom that </v>

544
00:22:41.371 --> 00:22:44.710
<v Speaker 2>matches their chromosomes and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of crazy.</v>

545
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:50.160
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not saying that you should </v>

546
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.530
<v Speaker 2>discriminate against transgender people </v>
<v Speaker 2>or people who feel like they were born </v>

547
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:52.530
<v Speaker 2>in the wrong sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

548
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:57.450
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we need to have three fucking </v>

549
00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:57.450
<v Speaker 2>bathrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

550
00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably the easy one.</v>

551
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it should be male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>female and go for it until you do </v>

552
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.350
<v Speaker 2>remember in crazy girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you remember the girl </v>

553
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.350
<v Speaker 2>that was the MC.</v>

554
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John was steel.</v>

555
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:14.160
<v Speaker 2>She was a got a buzzard chopped or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>

556
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I do remember because we met her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was.</v>

557
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:24.500
<v Speaker 2>And I met her and she showed it to joey </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Joey said it looked like a bat with </v>

558
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:24.500
<v Speaker 2>its mouth open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

559
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.510
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she was,</v>

560
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was friendly with.</v>

561
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 2>She was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had the mind of a guy,</v>

562
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.230
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

563
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.720
<v Speaker 2>we met with a lot of different guys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was very funny.</v>

564
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 2>She's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very funny.</v>

565
00:23:37.691 --> 00:23:39.790
<v Speaker 2>She looked a lot like a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

566
00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:44.791
<v Speaker 2>If I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I would've known if I would have </v>

567
00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:44.791
<v Speaker 2>known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

568
00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:44.791
<v Speaker 2>And this is 19.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it,</v>

569
00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:47.830
<v Speaker 2>90 or something or even before that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

570
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom,</v>

571
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.920
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line about that kind of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you're not allowed to even talk about</v>

572
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:55.010
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

573
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 2>If you talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a bigot.</v>

574
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Speaker 2>Like we have to leave open the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

575
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:03.920
<v Speaker 2>There's some crazy fucks out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some guys that would just decide</v>

576
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:06.710
<v Speaker 2>that all they have to do to hang on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman's room is dressed like a woman.</v>

577
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.250
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that there's aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They aren't real transgenders.</v>

00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:35.800
<v Speaker 1>if you've got some money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the worst place in the world to</v>

741
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:40.810
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to have money because it's </v>

742
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:40.810
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's changed too?</v>

743
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:45.661
<v Speaker 1>It's become like bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a buddy of mine was talking about </v>

744
00:30:45.661 --> 00:30:46.510
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be a Judah Judah freelander.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

746
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Judy was saying that it used to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of artists,</v>

747
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.120
<v Speaker 1>but now this is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in 20 years when like the rent </v>

748
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:59.581
<v Speaker 1>control shit expires and people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to be wealthy to </v>

749
00:30:59.581 --> 00:31:03.691
<v Speaker 1>live in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to be literally </v>

750
00:31:03.691 --> 00:31:05.761
<v Speaker 1>wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all the kids that want to become </v>

751
00:31:05.761 --> 00:31:08.191
<v Speaker 1>comics and artists and actors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dancers and they get out of high school </v>

752
00:31:08.191 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 1>and college can't afford to live there </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they have rich parents or parents</v>

753
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:12.940
<v Speaker 1>that could help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't afford.</v>

754
00:31:12.941 --> 00:31:16.510
<v Speaker 1>So they living in bedstuy and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods,</v>

755
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:18.850
<v Speaker 1>which is good for the neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're changing.</v>

756
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.510
<v Speaker 1>But they live in four and five to a two </v>
<v Speaker 1>bedroom apartment.</v>

757
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A buddy of mine got a place in Bedstein </v>

758
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:27.780
<v Speaker 1>because he was working for a production </v>
<v Speaker 1>company in New York.</v>

759
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said they started a cleaning.</v>

760
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:35.161
<v Speaker 1>The house happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found with all the paint and the </v>

761
00:31:35.161 --> 00:31:35.161
<v Speaker 1>house was lead and he had a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

762
00:31:35.161 --> 00:31:37.390
<v Speaker 1>we gotta get the fuck out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this paint.</v>

763
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:39.970
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go further out to Queens,</v>

764
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.450
<v Speaker 1>further out to Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

765
00:31:41.451 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 1>where it's still affordable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

766
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:46.480
<v Speaker 1>to an hour into the city clock that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know by train.</v>

767
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:51.660
<v Speaker 1>But if you could look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in that and I bought a condo </v>

768
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:51.660
<v Speaker 1>years ago or three bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

769
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.380
<v Speaker 1>got a nice place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could afford it,</v>

770
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:56.650
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at some point,</v>

771
00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.790
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't stop places are out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>business stores,</v>

772

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Well it's just the whole landscape of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the city is changing and when I talk to </v>

777

<v Speaker 1>changing too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you better have a rich mother and father</v>

797
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:04.900
<v Speaker 1>lived there.</v>

798
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I lived in new Rochelle because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't afford to park my car and I </v>

799
00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:10.180
<v Speaker 1>needed a car for a road gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

800
00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.560
<v Speaker 1>But it was not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was ridiculous back then.</v>

801
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:17.561
<v Speaker 1>It was expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I moved there in 91 or 92,</v>

802
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.350
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I lived there.</v>

803
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I lived in new Rochelle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept an apartment there for three </v>

804
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:26.860
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 90 to about 90,</v>

805
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:32.590
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around 95 ish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that apartments that were </v>

806
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.590
<v Speaker 1>double.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.600
<v Speaker 1>it was a small little shitty place in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird neighborhood.</v>

809
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just gotten way out of control and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these land lodge.</v>

810
00:33:39.481 --> 00:33:42.290
<v Speaker 1>And I tell you that the blasio's is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really split the city.</v>

811
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:42.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just saying I'm not,</v>

813
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't get into politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that.</v>

814
00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that was his intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

00:33:50.331 --> 00:33:55.331
<v Speaker 1>he's big friends without shopped and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shopped and sometimes I wonder if this </v>

<v Speaker 1>guy's running the city.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why do they do that?</v>

819
00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:03.180
<v Speaker 1>They do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a political calculation that like </v>

820
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:03.180
<v Speaker 1>they think like this is the way to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the black vote.</v>

821
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white people are just going to go </v>

857
00:35:38.231 --> 00:35:38.231
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One night he was walking down the street</v>

858
00:35:38.231 --> 00:35:42.710
<v Speaker 1>walking right in front of the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>store and me and a bunch of other </v>

859

865
00:35:58.851 --> 00:36:03.771
<v Speaker 1>if you go back to his history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no white guy would have ever </v>

866
00:36:03.771 --> 00:36:03.771
<v Speaker 1>gotten away with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would.</v>

00:36:03.771 --> 00:36:06.270
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was he got into the public's eye because</v>

868
00:36:06.271 --> 00:36:10.140
<v Speaker 1>of false rape accusations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally made up stories.</v>

869
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:13.150
<v Speaker 1>He's never admitted to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

870
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Bullying was proven.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

877
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.040
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so broken.</v>

878
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Can't be fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to drop out of sight.</v>

879
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>

880
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska is.</v>

881
00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think an accurate China like it up </v>

882
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii.</v>

883
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous Sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The waves.</v>

884
00:36:45.361 --> 00:36:47.980
<v Speaker 1>The fucking you'd go anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

885
00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in the middle of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too dangerous.</v>

886
00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:56.541
<v Speaker 1>Although it has been there for thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years and I won't be here for </v>

887
00:36:56.541 --> 00:36:56.541
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's tempting in that regard.</v>

888
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 1>We're doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doomed.</v>

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:04.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We auditioned for something.</v>

974
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.730
<v Speaker 1>It was a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

975
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.390
<v Speaker 1>not the same role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a movie guy,</v>

976
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Dave Sheridan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 1>who's that fucking guy?</v>

979
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:21.210
<v Speaker 1>And you and I don't know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the star of the movie and he </v>

980
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:21.210
<v Speaker 1>heard us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about it.</v>

981
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I got that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

982
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:26.560
<v Speaker 1>I talked about that story because not </v>
<v Speaker 1>not you auditioning,</v>

983
00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:28.810
<v Speaker 1>but that whole movie story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that kid was talented.</v>

984
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was funny as shit.</v>

986
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:38.221
<v Speaker 1>Dog Shit.</v>

987
00:40:38.221 --> 00:40:40.141
<v Speaker 1>shit because all of these executives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was funny and they made him </v>

988
00:40:40.141 --> 00:40:43.891
<v Speaker 1>the star of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a nobody as far as like </v>

989
00:40:43.891 --> 00:40:44.110
<v Speaker 1>people didn't know who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all were telling them what to do.</v>

990
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Like I watched a guy with a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolex on and expensive move in </v>

993
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Because I did a movie with a producer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I did his movie before that did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie where he was trying to put a hit </v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked for an attorney.</v>

00:41:20.171 --> 00:41:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I think I bought him return well when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on the set,</v>

1004
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.090
<v Speaker 1>like the kid was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really talented.</v>

1005
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:29.320
<v Speaker 1>He's a very funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like real slapsticky big like Jim Carrey</v>

1006
00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>style comic actor and this guy with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rolex and the cufflinks and the tailored</v>

1009
00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's telling this kid like </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally when you come in,</v>

1010
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 2>when you come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to go,</v>

1012
00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.180
<v Speaker 2>he's acting it out and he's like telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>them how to do it and then he sits there</v>

1013
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:52.610
<v Speaker 2>in front of the camera and make sure the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy does it exactly the way he wants her</v>

1014
00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:53.780
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see Dave,</v>

<v Speaker 2>naturally funny.</v>

1017
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:03.850
<v Speaker 2>And when you got someone who's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the last thing you want to do is </v>

1018
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:04.280
<v Speaker 2>tell them how to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just leave them the fuck alone.</v>

1019
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Make them feel comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make them feel comfortable telling them </v>

1020
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.150
<v Speaker 2>about somebody would come and cents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they just have so much money.</v>

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.650
<v Speaker 2>They have so much money and they have so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much influence and they want to,</v>

1022
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:16.600
<v Speaker 2>they want to make that monkey dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1029
00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:31.620

<v Speaker 1>A guy manages of the club.</v>

1030
00:42:32.371 --> 00:42:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Used to tell them what to try to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>their act.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I never told the guy ever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>know that you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not a classically trained actor.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I've always told people it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking hard.</v>

1091

1141
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock said you're still dipping </v>
<v Speaker 1>your toe</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hard?</v>

1145
00:46:44.981 --> 00:46:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Is it to fuck a book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three comics a week.</v>

1150
00:46:58.831 --> 00:46:59.080
<v Speaker 2>important part of what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the getting a different perspective</v>

1151
00:46:59.081 --> 00:47:00.700
<v Speaker 2>or a guy like Kendall feeney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would,</v>

1152
00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:05.730
<v Speaker 2>you'd imagine he was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would imagine that he probably </v>

1153
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:05.730

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1227
00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I think Jimmy Smith's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read years ago and ypd he said he </v>

1228
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:48.950
<v Speaker 1>couldn't take it was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 hour days and yeah,</v>

1229
00:49:48.951 --> 00:49:51.340
<v Speaker 1>it was making a fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said I couldn't do it anymore.</v>

1230
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1231
00:49:51.911 --> 00:49:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1232
00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I've had friends that have been on </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramas before and there's the same </v>

1233
00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:57.300
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would tell me that they just,</v>

1234
00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.990
<v Speaker 1>they just couldn't do it and they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1235
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.390
<v Speaker 1>would be when the season would wrap </v>
<v Speaker 1>their to go,</v>

1236
00:50:01.391 --> 00:50:05.530
<v Speaker 1>this has got to be my last season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I a point with the money now,</v>

1237
00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing,</v>

1238
00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:10.210
<v Speaker 1>what I love about blue bloods is there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of characters,</v>

1239
00:50:10.211 --> 00:50:11.220
<v Speaker 1>so there's different stories.</v>

1240
00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:12.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1241
00:50:12.301 --> 00:50:13.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite nice.</v>

1242
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:17.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful show and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

1243
00:50:17.021 --> 00:50:21.220
<v Speaker 1>the writing's good network show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1244
00:50:21.221 --> 00:50:22.570
<v Speaker 1>with Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he worked with,</v>

1245
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:23.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

1246
00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 1>like a dirty secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Working with an acting coach isn't,</v>

1247
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.000
<v Speaker 1>that's a dirty little secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't want it.</v>

1248
00:50:29.001 --> 00:50:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't want to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're a bigger,</v>

1249
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I think pachino works with somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't know why there would be a </v>

1250
00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.701
<v Speaker 1>dirty secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that would be just </v>

1251
00:50:39.701 --> 00:50:39.701
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a good.</v>

1252
00:50:39.701 --> 00:50:39.701
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think like,</v>

1253
00:50:39.701 --> 00:50:43.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like guys don't want to admit that I'm </v>

1254
00:50:43.441 --> 00:50:43.750
<v Speaker 1>asking for him right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys say if I could ask this are,</v>

1255
00:50:43.751 --> 00:50:48.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians have a thing about that with </v>

1256
00:50:48.751 --> 00:50:49.370
<v Speaker 1>writers working with writers like </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian working with a writer.</v>

1257
00:50:49.371 --> 00:50:54.371
<v Speaker 1>It's like other comedians will shake </v>
<v Speaker 1>their head and look down on you really </v>

1258
00:50:54.371 --> 00:50:54.371
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1259
00:50:54.371 --> 00:50:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that you write all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own stuff obviously because your </v>

1260
00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.640
<v Speaker 1>stuff is very personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were all guys that it's </v>

1261
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.750
<v Speaker 1>impossible for them to keep writing new </v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

1262
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Well these guys that are very personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have someone to work with.</v>

1263
00:51:05.421 --> 00:51:10.421
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Hart has guys that work with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he has ideas and he bounces them </v>

1264
00:51:10.421 --> 00:51:10.830
<v Speaker 1>off these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1265
00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 1>he's got these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas off these guys and then they</v>

1266
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:15.110
<v Speaker 1>work on them together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll,</v>

1267
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:19.100
<v Speaker 1>he'll brainstorm with guys on his act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is nothing wrong with it.</v>

1268
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:24.101
<v Speaker 1>Chris rock used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

1269
00:51:24.101 --> 00:51:24.101
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's guys like say a Leno or</v>

1270
00:51:24.101 --> 00:51:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Rodney who I was a big rodney </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerfield.</v>

1271
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody just comics,</v>

1272
00:51:29.421 --> 00:51:31.730
<v Speaker 1>facts and stuff into him all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1273
00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leno.</v>

1274
00:51:33.531 --> 00:51:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was doing the show.</v>

1275
00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.820
<v Speaker 1>He's busy in his monologue there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in this stuff,</v>

1276
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.340
<v Speaker 1>but not as standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when Lento does it stand up.</v>

1277
00:51:40.341 --> 00:51:42.580
<v Speaker 1>His standup is pretty much all leno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all him.</v>

1278
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:48.190
<v Speaker 1>But Rodney for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there was a lot of guys like Bob </v>

1279
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Hope had five,</v>

1280
00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:49.070
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

1281
00:51:49.071 --> 00:51:51.020
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a staff of writers.</v>

1282
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I know one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would pay $50 a joke and then the </v>

1283
00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:59.010
<v Speaker 1>only tip 37,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$50 job.</v>

1284
00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Mothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest guys ever the fuck it was,</v>

1285
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.970
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would ask for a,</v>

1286
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need whatever,</v>

1287
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:08.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever the event was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1288
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I need jokes about trump or </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother-in-law,</v>

1289
00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:12.060
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1290
00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:18.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess comics don't want to admit to </v>

1291
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:18.090
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are comics that by no,</v>

1292
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there definitely are.</v>

1293
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.390
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1294
00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.150
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor,</v>

1295
00:52:23.151 --> 00:52:25.700
<v Speaker 1>who was the greatest of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Mooney wrote farm forever.</v>

1296
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And other guys wrote for him.</v>

1297
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:32.560
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock was also one of the greatest </v>

1298
00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.200
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris had a bunch of writers and smart.</v>

1299
00:52:33.201 --> 00:52:38.201
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to make the best comedy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily always just with </v>

1300
00:52:38.201 --> 00:52:39.440
<v Speaker 1>your own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes it's so hard.</v>

1301
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy for someone else to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>your voice,</v>

1302
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.160
<v Speaker 1>so you have to find those guys and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not easy because she,</v>

1303
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1304
00:52:46.401 --> 00:52:47.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write me either.</v>

1305
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes like when I have to hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1306
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:55.300
<v Speaker 1>like I hosted this a thing on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I'm not making believe </v>

1307
00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:56.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm a stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a standup comic,</v>

1308
00:52:56.181 --> 00:52:59.270
<v Speaker 1>nor would I even attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more like a monologue,</v>

1309
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I have to host a charity event,</v>

1310
00:53:01.971 --> 00:53:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I have a guy who likes me jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

1311
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I get my voice shit that I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1312
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:11.230
<v Speaker 1>And you know immediately and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well sometimes it's not a bad idea to </v>

1313
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:15.611
<v Speaker 1>have a writer just because you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple other guys that you can talk </v>

1314
00:53:15.611 --> 00:53:15.611
<v Speaker 1>about your set with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1315
00:53:15.611 --> 00:53:16.910
<v Speaker 1>because if you're just looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

1316
00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:19.610
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different perspective.</v>

1317
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even they don't write the jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they talk about the jokes that </v>

1318
00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.460
<v Speaker 1>you've written and give their </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective and alone will probably help</v>

1319
00:53:26.461 --> 00:53:27.750
<v Speaker 1>you improve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1320
00:53:27.751 --> 00:53:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you're doing a live show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're hosting something,</v>

1321
00:53:31.621 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 1>whether it be an award show or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a couple of guys there,</v>

1322
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.520
<v Speaker 1>a spur of the moment thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you some,</v>

1323
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:38.820
<v Speaker 1>a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a good line.</v>

1324
00:53:38.821 --> 00:53:39.350
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1325
00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:41.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spur of the moment is very well,</v>

1326
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 1>especially a live show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a talk show or something like that.</v>

1327
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Very important to have writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you like doing talk shows?</v>

1328
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.010
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like it?</v>

1329
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to just like doing this.</v>

1330
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.390
<v Speaker 1>This is what I like because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>format.</v>

1331
00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:00.200
<v Speaker 1>When you do a talk show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all shut off field of view when </v>

1332
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:00.330
<v Speaker 1>they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say this,</v>

1333
00:54:00.331 --> 00:54:02.640
<v Speaker 1>you're going to say that and then a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time want to do it.</v>

1334
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:07.110
<v Speaker 1>A talk show host has the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joke on top of your job,</v>

1335
00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already got the retort.</v>

1336
00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

1337
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:15.860
<v Speaker 2>They just seems fake and forced while he</v>
<v Speaker 2>right back now.</v>

1338
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to sing and dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1339
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:23.720
<v Speaker 2>You have to be a variety show like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1340
00:54:23.721 --> 00:54:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1341
00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.670
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the new thing.</v>

1342
00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:28.220
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate a guy like Jimmy Fallon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who does it well.</v>

1343
00:54:28.221 --> 00:54:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I think he's great at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate it.</v>

1344
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

1345
00:54:31.711 --> 00:54:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a guest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to watch.</v>

1346
00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to sit there.</v>

1347
00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I've had friends that do them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go visit them while they do it.</v>

1348
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Like I watched Conan and the other day I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a buddy of mine who was singing the </v>

1349
00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:43.600
<v Speaker 2>song and cone and I went to watch and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1350
00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.850
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a dying format.</v>

1351
00:54:46.851 --> 00:54:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a format that's like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur.</v>

1352
00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is,</v>

1353
00:54:49.251 --> 00:54:52.910
<v Speaker 1>which is why you see this guy on cbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James,</v>

1354
00:54:52.911 --> 00:54:56.060
<v Speaker 1>whatever his name is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's singing karaoke in the car.</v>

1355
00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Guy James,</v>

1356
00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:00.290
<v Speaker 1>according as his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Corden.</v>

1357
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.480
<v Speaker 1>They sing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karaoke is mixing it up.</v>

1358
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:03.580
<v Speaker 1>He's doing different time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1359
00:55:03.581 --> 00:55:06.350
<v Speaker 1>and he's got two different office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a deli at this one.</v>

1360
00:55:06.351 --> 00:55:11.351
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to do different stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's become more like that than </v>

1361
00:55:11.351 --> 00:55:12.830
<v Speaker 1>just to sit down old fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1362
00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.750
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1363
00:55:14.751 --> 00:55:19.310
<v Speaker 1>and I know most actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever celebrities,</v>

1364
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:23.270
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a whole lot to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people like Deniro.</v>

1365
00:55:23.271 --> 00:55:26.210
<v Speaker 1>If it ain't on the page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just guy is stuck at hello.</v>

1366
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:28.850
<v Speaker 1>You say hello to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stopped for a fucking answer.</v>

1367
00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:30.080
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1368
00:55:30.081 --> 00:55:35.081
<v Speaker 1>because he's got to have it on the page </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he's a wonderful actor and he </v>

1369
00:55:35.081 --> 00:55:35.330
<v Speaker 1>could forgive you all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he.</v>

1370
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:37.700
<v Speaker 1>You think he's going to come in here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you like this?</v>

1371
00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1372
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:39.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1373
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Hell No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never spoke to him.</v>

1374
00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:44.830
<v Speaker 1>My friend Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz.</v>

1375
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.000
<v Speaker 1>You Know Joe Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a movie with him.</v>

1376
00:55:47.001 --> 00:55:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he enjoyed it.</v>

1377
00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.780
<v Speaker 1>He liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just an honor.</v>

1378
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:55.900
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're working with arguably the </v>

1379
00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:56.030
<v Speaker 1>greatest actor of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top five,</v>

1380
00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:59.330
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he's ever seen him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to do a talk show.</v>

1381
00:55:59.331 --> 00:56:02.000
<v Speaker 1>It's never boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at some clips.</v>

1382
00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an interesting guy.</v>

1383
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deniro is a very unusual guy.</v>

1384
00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I think he's done a lot of crappy stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know.</v>

1385
00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how much money do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need that I know you want to work and </v>

1386
00:56:15.801 --> 00:56:17.640
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do for a living and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>

1387
00:56:17.641 --> 00:56:19.040
<v Speaker 1>but you know.</v>

1388
00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done some shitty movies for sure,</v>

1389
00:56:21.051 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 1>like really shitty movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's probably.</v>

1390
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the recent one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did the temp.</v>

1391
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I watched the ad and I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole soul starts shaking like I was </v>

1392
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.040
<v Speaker 1>freezing to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

1393
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1394
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he owns the restaurant and she's got to </v>

1395
00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:39.320
<v Speaker 1>a hotel in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobo.</v>

1396
00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 1>He's got a million restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got these old tales at Tribeca </v>

1397
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:44.650
<v Speaker 1>film festival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at what point in time are you gonna?</v>

1398
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do with that money </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you die?</v>

1399
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.990
<v Speaker 1>He just enjoys doing shitty movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1400
00:56:48.991 --> 00:56:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy shitty movies.</v>

1401
00:56:50.411 --> 00:56:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I think he enjoys doing movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to say that there's a whole lot</v>

1402
00:56:54.881 --> 00:56:58.130
<v Speaker 1>of great roles for second city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 something years,</v>

1403
00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pachino seems to navigate them better.</v>

1404
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta.</v>

1405
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:07.810
<v Speaker 1>He does some shitty fucking movies too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think these guys,</v>

1406
00:57:07.811 --> 00:57:12.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get up in age and the roles they </v>

1407
00:57:12.811 --> 00:57:15.781
<v Speaker 1>don't get offered the best roles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then something comes along and it's not </v>

1408
00:57:15.781 --> 00:57:16.070
<v Speaker 1>that good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot of money and the guy,</v>

1409
00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:16.510
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

1410
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just do it.</v>

1411
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.110
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pachino,</v>

1412
00:57:20.111 --> 00:57:23.680
<v Speaker 1>he has so much leeway because he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

1413
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Same as as Deniro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was that one movie Deniro did </v>

1414
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:30.400
<v Speaker 1>recently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a fucking shit.</v>

1415
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:35.450
<v Speaker 1>The name of that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie with Bradley Cooper and </v>

1416
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:37.981
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big movie and Deniro played in </v>

1417
00:57:37.981 --> 00:57:37.981
<v Speaker 1>the hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1418
00:57:37.981 --> 00:57:40.390
<v Speaker 1>He was good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's still got it.</v>

1419
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:43.930
<v Speaker 1>He's still got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can still do it and seem like,</v>

1420
00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:48.540
<v Speaker 1>like a really dangerous fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still possible to see those,</v>

1421
00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.190
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

1422
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:51.590
<v Speaker 1>those roles don't exist that often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1423
00:57:51.591 --> 00:57:53.410
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you said that,</v>

1424
00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:56.600
<v Speaker 1>and as I think as we get older too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1425
00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:57.880
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1426
00:57:57.881 --> 00:57:58.780
<v Speaker 1>you change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1427
00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:03.810
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a guy that was just wonderful </v>

1428
00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:04.870
<v Speaker 1>leading man in his thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1429
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.140
<v Speaker 1>now he's a fucking bloated guy in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties,</v>

1430
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:08.710
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1431
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:10.620
<v Speaker 1>He can't be the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1432
00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Bloated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Val Kilmer,</v>

1433
00:58:13.631 --> 00:58:14.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of thing.</v>

1434
00:58:14.561 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I worked with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was he?</v>

1435
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.100
<v Speaker 1>He was nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but out there,</v>

1436
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 1>he's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a movie in Detroit with him.</v>

1437
00:58:20.801 --> 00:58:25.801
<v Speaker 1>He was way out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember how he </v>

1438
00:58:25.801 --> 00:58:27.630
<v Speaker 1>likes to mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he was on him that day because we </v>

1439
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:28.390
<v Speaker 1>shot a movie out there and he was way </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

1440
00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:29.440
<v Speaker 1>He was heavy then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1441
00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Now he did something in Africa with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and they said he got whacked </v>

1442
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:37.561
<v Speaker 1>out on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're running around the campfire </v>

1443
00:58:37.561 --> 00:58:37.561
<v Speaker 1>fucking lines in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1444
00:58:37.561 --> 00:58:38.920

<v Speaker 1>but he was in Detroit.</v>

1445
00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:43.210
<v Speaker 1>He was nice enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But while he was in that movie,</v>

1446
00:58:43.211 --> 00:58:44.890
<v Speaker 1>that ghost in the darkness,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They were working on a railroad.</v>

1449
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:56.760
<v Speaker 1>It was a fucking great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these two lions teamed up and </v>

1450
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:56.870
<v Speaker 1>started killing the railroad workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You older?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean those days.</v>

<v Speaker 1>know of.</v>

1460
00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got to be a first.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

1462
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:26.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the ghost in the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he played the top gun.</v>

1463
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1464
00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same era.</v>

1465
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1466
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that guy got too much pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost his fucking mind.</v>

1467
00:59:33.951 --> 00:59:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Decided to try to eat themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and it just didn't work out.</v>

1468
00:59:36.321 --> 00:59:41.321
<v Speaker 1>And then he stayed alive and had a loose</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back down and have him on this </v>

1469
00:59:41.321 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 1>love to.</v>

1470
00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you'd love to what I imagined </v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't.</v>

1471
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't he have booze everywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just say let's just do this.</v>

1472
00:59:47.931 --> 00:59:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start.</v>

1473
00:59:48.561 --> 00:59:50.060
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he did one of those,</v>

1474
00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 1>he did one of those autograph shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autograph autograph shows.</v>

1475
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:59.891
<v Speaker 1>They have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like chiller theatre and the Hollywood </v>

1476
00:59:59.891 --> 01:00:00.170
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you sell your autographs.</v>

1477
01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think he did one and he made like </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100.</v>

1478
01:00:04.151 --> 01:00:06.890
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made like 100 grand like he had the line</v>

1479
01:00:06.891 --> 01:00:08.060
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1480
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>so he just sat down and signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down and sign.</v>

1481
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:11.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've heard of these things.</v>

1482
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've been offered that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That never gets to me,</v>

1483
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1484
01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably gets deflected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1485
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just had one that had one in </v>

1486
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.170

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1487
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.620

<v Speaker 1>the other guy from chips,</v>

1488
01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they have the cash.</v>

1491
01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guys from my show have done it.</v>

1492
01:00:30.591 --> 01:00:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never done it.</v>

1493
01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>I personally feel it takes a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of your soul when they walk by you</v>

1494
01:00:37.161 --> 01:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1500
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I just also think that making people pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a signature is fucking crazy,</v>

1501
01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>but I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do get admitted.</v>

1502
01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:58.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a little annoying when you run into</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys to the airport and you got to</v>

1503
01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:03.001
<v Speaker 1>stack a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to sign 10 of them and </v>

1504
01:01:03.001 --> 01:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a fan of doing this.</v>

1505
01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Selling him or this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're wholesaling to another guy,</v>

1506
01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:13.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just up the ladder like maybe it </v>

1507
01:01:13.631 --> 01:01:13.631
<v Speaker 1>maybe he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright Rogan's going to be there.</v>

1508
01:01:13.631 --> 01:01:18.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a $10 from time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just sign one and this one guy was </v>

1509
01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:18.460
<v Speaker 1>giving me a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1510
01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not working for you.</v>

1511
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working with because he's like,</v>

1512
01:01:20.901 --> 01:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I took a train here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1513
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't ask you.</v>

1514
01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>The only thing is for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's easy to just sign the </v>

1515
01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:32.861
<v Speaker 1>phone station side of things and move </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1516
01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1517
01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could do it real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the whole idea behind it is weird.</v>

1518
01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>He's like getting you to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he's going to sell it.</v>

1519
01:01:39.531 --> 01:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Then they're going to put it on Ebay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1520
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:46.390
<v Speaker 1>they all have the same standard stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a microphone and want you to </v>

1521
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them have an MMA glove they want</v>

1522
01:01:46.621 --> 01:01:50.750
<v Speaker 1>or they want you to sign a MMA glove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to sign pictures,</v>

1523
01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures,</v>

1524
01:01:52.851 --> 01:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1525
01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.680
<v Speaker 1>you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have the.</v>

1526
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:57.350
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1527
01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>they get them and then they know where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a little glove,</v>

1528
01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>what your signature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be worth something.</v>

1529
01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I guess like five bucks maybe probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost you more in gas to get the picture.</v>

1530
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I ran into a fucking guy once that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake shit.</v>

1531
01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.980
<v Speaker 1>A guy emailed me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1532
01:02:12.981 --> 01:02:17.981
<v Speaker 1>is this your signature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was at a news radio script with </v>

1533
01:02:17.981 --> 01:02:18.410
<v Speaker 1>all the cast members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1534
01:02:18.411 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not my script.</v>

1535
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>All those scripts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those signatures are fake.</v>

1536
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>All Andy Dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I knew Andy Signature.</v>

1537
01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>He had a very distinct signature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Phil Hartman had a very clean,</v>

1538
01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>distinct signature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1539
01:02:29.341 --> 01:02:30.440
<v Speaker 1>these are all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I still have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did this poster from Cigar Aficionado</v>

1541
01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>magazine that was floating around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all sign them,</v>

1542
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:42.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to sign a lot of stuff at the </v>

1543
01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:42.650
<v Speaker 1>end of the read throughs for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sopranos.</v>

1544
01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>They would have a stack of stuff for </v>
<v Speaker 1>charity and whatever to sign and it's </v>

1545
01:02:46.951 --> 01:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>hanging in a restaurant in New York on </v>
<v Speaker 1>56th avenue.</v>

1546
01:02:50.671 --> 01:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not my signature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa is hanging up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that?</v>

1550
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Someone's going to fake the hanging up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a nice restaurant.</v>

<v Speaker 1>were the fat stone.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Then I got fat enough on mine.</v>

1554
01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Did you get fat enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you have to wear that thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1558
01:03:18.481 --> 01:03:23.481

<v Speaker 1>all these jokes like you have cows on </v>

<v Speaker 1>maybe they kiss the wrong guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking.</v>

1563
01:03:32.401 --> 01:03:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1569
01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:59.060
<v Speaker 1>and then one year I was going back and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was at a fitting for the fourth year,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So I'm assuming it was pretty </v>

1574
01:04:09.611 --> 01:04:10.800
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing at first I was prancing </v>

<v Speaker 1>came out because all of the sudden there</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like that acting that way became in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion.</v>

1589
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:55.910

1597
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I remember Michael Imperioli one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were up in Reno and there was one of </v>

<v Speaker 1>He got really pissed off.</v>

1605
01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.960
<v Speaker 1>This is just one of those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Goombas,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1616
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Even in New York,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I call them back yard movies,</v>

1624
01:06:20.261 --> 01:06:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to see him,</v>

1625
01:06:21.941 --> 01:06:23.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they're getting paid.</v>

1626
01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested because it's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

01:06:25.721 --> 01:06:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:33.070
<v Speaker 1>my uncle is like a [inaudible] sketch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>

1630
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:37.660
<v Speaker 1>But they write this and I say how people</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them the money.</v>

1631
01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:39.790
<v Speaker 1>How do you get the money to make these </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies?</v>

1632
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for awhile people were making </v>

1633
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:44.910
<v Speaker 1>them just because it's Pr Sopranos was </v>
<v Speaker 1>so pocket,</v>

1634
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:48.411
<v Speaker 1>but now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're going to beat Sopranos </v>

1635
01:06:48.411 --> 01:06:48.411
<v Speaker 1>Goodfellas,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1640
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:02.320
<v Speaker 1>one of my mission there was to be a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:03.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>great mob movies.</v>

1643
01:07:05.471 --> 01:07:08.440
<v Speaker 1>But right now it was after the Sopranos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1644
01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:12.910
<v Speaker 1>you don't see the Godfather Godfather to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that there was some,</v>

1645
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:16.030
<v Speaker 1>but you're gonna have to beat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they tried,</v>

1646
01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:20.130
<v Speaker 1>they tried to do some mobby stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ray Donovan's work,</v>

1647
01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:20.860

1648
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a good show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that's from an Irish perspective.</v>

01:10:09.801 --> 01:10:12.020
<v Speaker 1>If you know anybody like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those people exist.</v>

1725
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I take a 10.</v>

1726
01:10:13.461 --> 01:10:15.010
<v Speaker 1>They don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it fencing?</v>

1727
01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:20.011
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was a story that need to </v>

1728
01:10:20.011 --> 01:10:20.011
<v Speaker 1>be told.</v>

1729
01:10:20.011 --> 01:10:24.540
<v Speaker 1>This is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was such a fascinating show </v>

1730
01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.450
<v Speaker 1>because Gandolfini was a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his character.</v>

1731
01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:31.770
<v Speaker 1>You're rooted for a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a murder for a murderer who cheated on </v>

1732
01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:32.720
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stole rob,</v>

1733
01:10:32.721 --> 01:10:35.840
<v Speaker 1>shook people down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was your guy.</v>

1734
01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:37.550
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the first.</v>

1735
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I think I could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first like anti hero that people </v>

1736
01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.180
<v Speaker 1>were deformed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

1737
01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine that it was,</v>

1738
01:10:46.401 --> 01:10:47.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1739
01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:48.650
<v Speaker 1>your roof for the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1740
01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.910
<v Speaker 1>he was a real anti hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No murderer,</v>

1741
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:54.020
<v Speaker 1>a con man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all the above.</v>

1742
01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:59.670
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't just do it to people in the </v>

1743
01:10:59.670 --> 01:10:59.670
<v Speaker 1>mob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did it to people,</v>

1744
01:10:59.670 --> 01:10:59.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on the show.</v>

1745
01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:03.560
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't just within each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went outside,</v>

1746
01:11:03.561 --> 01:11:06.170
<v Speaker 1>they were robbing people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>busting up,</v>

1747
01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1748
01:11:07.421 --> 01:11:09.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses and doing all this stuff that</v>

1749
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:10.710
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1750
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:13.000
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1751
01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:17.610
<v Speaker 2>it was a very smart show and if it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they put it back on now,</v>

1752
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:20.670
<v Speaker 2>they would get higher ratings than some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their shows now.</v>

1753
01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet they would.</v>

1754
01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so good.</v>

1755
01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people forgot how good </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was and it also changed a lot.</v>

1756
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 2>If you go to the first episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first episode was essentially like a</v>

1757
01:11:29.011 --> 01:11:31.170
<v Speaker 2>slapstick comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember that?</v>

1758
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in the rain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brought out with the rain.</v>

1759
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Brocco a who was the woman that played </v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife,</v>

1760
01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:42.561
<v Speaker 2>ed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ed Falco had a fucking machine gun and </v>

1761
01:11:42.561 --> 01:11:46.320
<v Speaker 2>the doctor was trying to outside with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine gun.</v>

1762
01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.590
<v Speaker 2>It was way more slapsticky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>

1763
01:11:49.591 --> 01:11:50.380
<v Speaker 2>It was like a thing.</v>

1764
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shot the show aired in [inaudible] </v>

1765
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:56.020
<v Speaker 1>99,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1766
01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I think they shot that in [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>98,</v>

1767
01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.860
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

1768
01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:04.020
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken at 98,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

1769
01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.190
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 97.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even.</v>

1770
01:12:05.191 --> 01:12:10.191
<v Speaker 1>They'd go back and then it took six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months and then they started shooting </v>

1771
01:12:10.191 --> 01:12:11.520
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how how David Chase did it?</v>

1772
01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:16.610
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do it like a regular show </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you shoot it and then in three </v>

1773
01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:19.690
<v Speaker 1>weeks it's on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1774
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:24.910
<v Speaker 1>he put them all in the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were finished and locked and you </v>

1775

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

1776

<v Speaker 1>your whatever.</v>

1778
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:32.660
<v Speaker 1>It took nine months and then he edited </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah.</v>

1779
01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:34.130
<v Speaker 1>And then they aired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1780
01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.650
<v Speaker 1>it was done a completely different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also,</v>

1781
01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:38.940
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1783
01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>if they didn't like what you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he replaced you and you never </v>

1784
01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>even knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1785
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He replaced,</v>

1788
01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I had a scene with a guy and they called</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1789
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month or so later and said,</v>

1790
01:12:52.971 --> 01:12:57.971
<v Speaker 1>you've got to shoot the scene together </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a different actor for whatever </v>

1791
01:12:57.971 --> 01:13:01.161
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you know the guy didn't do a </v>

1792
01:13:01.161 --> 01:13:03.621
<v Speaker 1>good job or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked too young or too old or just </v>

1793
01:13:03.621 --> 01:13:04.440
<v Speaker 1>didn't fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the,</v>

1794
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:09.140
<v Speaker 1>he had the capacity to just shoot it </v>
<v Speaker 1>again if it,</v>

1795
01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:10.440
<v Speaker 1>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work.</v>

1796
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:15.470
<v Speaker 1>He rewrite the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shoot the scene again three months </v>

1797
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.470
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

1798
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:16.820
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting about those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows too,</v>

1799
01:13:16.821 --> 01:13:20.270
<v Speaker 2>is that they're so big and so popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you become that character.</v>

1800
01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Whoever that character is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become that guy.</v>

1848
01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:58.390

1855
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:11.880
<v Speaker 1>And the biggest show that Glenn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Gandolfini killed Imperioli,</v>

1856
01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 1>However the story ends.</v>

1863
01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 1>It's probably better if I would have got</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed early on,</v>

1864
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I would have felt really shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you.</v>

1868
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:40.270
<v Speaker 1>we didn't mention we started making </v>
<v Speaker 1>money towards the middle and the end,</v>

<v Speaker 1>making money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well those shows are hard to make money </v>

1871
01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.510
<v Speaker 1>like HBO is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't worry,</v>

1872
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:53.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hbo Pace and they pay now even better </v>

1877
01:15:57.671 --> 01:15:59.710

<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

1944
01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.350

1957

<v Speaker 1>I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some guys don't want no part of</v>

1958

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1962
01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Eating on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in eating,</v>

1963
01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:17.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you get sick of eating,</v>

1964
01:19:17.541 --> 01:19:20.240
<v Speaker 1>but that's the elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking,</v>

1965
01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show the movie and just keep bringing</v>

1966
01:19:24.081 --> 01:19:25.380
<v Speaker 1>stakes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring it out.</v>

1967
01:19:25.381 --> 01:19:30.381
<v Speaker 1>I'll just keep being not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because I have a glove because they </v>

1968
01:19:30.381 --> 01:19:31.900
<v Speaker 1>think it looks real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The by,</v>

1969
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you noticed I'm a little cookie so I </v>

1970
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:37.000
<v Speaker 1>noticed shit like that.</v>

1971
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:37.530
<v Speaker 1>It looked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't really know.</v>

1972
01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the worst is when you see </v>

1973
01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:44.610
<v Speaker 1>someone who's eating a half eaten steak </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the next quarter eaten steak because</v>

1974
01:19:44.611 --> 01:19:47.420
<v Speaker 1>you know what the record is eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you put steak back?</v>

1975
01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the worst thing?</v>

1976
01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't smoke and I've never smoked </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

1977
01:19:51.051 --> 01:19:51.920
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1978
01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.700
<v Speaker 1>you see people smoking on TV and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't smoke.</v>

1979
01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1980
01:19:57.230 --> 01:19:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know.</v>

1981
01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1982
01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.820
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the deal?</v>

1983
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:05.090
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't smoke cigarettes?</v>

1984
01:20:05.091 --> 01:20:06.980
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what would be the difference?</v>

1985
01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Is</v>

1986
01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:11.130
<v Speaker 2>a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you smoke?</v>

1987
01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a casual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1988
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:18.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like how comfortable are you with </v>

1989
01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:18.370
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1990
01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:18.370
<v Speaker 2>but you see people that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1991
01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:20.670
<v Speaker 2>like I've been asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I'll smoke a cigar,</v>

1992
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:25.671
<v Speaker 2>which I don't even do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I see cigar seems like so unusual </v>

1993
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.770
<v Speaker 2>that anybody could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1994
01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:28.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1995
01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.480
<v Speaker 2>it's a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see people,</v>

1996
01:20:29.481 --> 01:20:30.820
<v Speaker 2>you got the sketch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a smoker.</v>

1997
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:33.240
<v Speaker 2>No cigarette smokers do get crazy about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1998
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain things like here's the </v>

1999
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.270
<v Speaker 2>one that drives everybody the most nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a musician.</v>

2000
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:39.570
<v Speaker 2>When you see someone fake playing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guitar,</v>

2001
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:44.630
<v Speaker 2>like someone's really jamming out and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>know they're not really hitting any of </v>

2002
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:47.511
<v Speaker 2>the notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is he don't even show his </v>

2003
01:20:47.511 --> 01:20:47.511
<v Speaker 2>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck.</v>

2004
01:20:47.511 --> 01:20:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or guys trying to cook or something.</v>

2005
01:20:48.661 --> 01:20:50.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing's gotta.</v>

2006
01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:55.420
<v Speaker 2>You gotta do your homework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine to guitar one would </v>

2007
01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:58.491
<v Speaker 2>probably be like the worst because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many complicated movements </v>

2008
01:20:58.491 --> 01:20:59.640
<v Speaker 2>and if you're like a person who actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows how to play and you watch it,</v>

2009
01:20:59.641 --> 01:21:02.460
<v Speaker 2>you would know that it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fighting is that way too though.</v>

2010
01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Like you watched fight scenes in movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2011
01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:06.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a boxing scene,</v>

2012
01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:10.380
<v Speaker 2>you know like Mark Walberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a very good actor.</v>

2013
01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.140
<v Speaker 2>But that movie the fighter where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>played micky ward,</v>

2014
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:14.550
<v Speaker 2>like I'm watching him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2015
01:21:14.551 --> 01:21:19.551
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy that's not getting hit </v>

2016
01:21:19.551 --> 01:21:19.551
<v Speaker 2>like he's boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no one's hitting them back.</v>

2017
01:21:19.551 --> 01:21:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And when you think about like the rocky </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

2018
01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:24.810
<v Speaker 2>terrible with the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scenes are terrible.</v>

2019
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:26.340
<v Speaker 2>They're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the worst.</v>

2020
01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:30.780
<v Speaker 2>They're atrocious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one movie,</v>

2021
01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:32.880
<v Speaker 2>one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're great movies as far as like,</v>

2022
01:21:32.881 --> 01:21:37.881
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a little kid I saw rocky and </v>

2023
01:21:37.881 --> 01:21:37.881
<v Speaker 2>I drank a fucking raw egg and I ran </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the block.</v>

2024
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I never run in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2025
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:41.380
<v Speaker 2>unless I was playing baseball or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2026
01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I never ran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that movie made me go running.</v>

2027
01:21:43.891 --> 01:21:48.750
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to go running today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't,</v>

2028
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:51.740
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that they were bad movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you watch the boxing scene,</v>

2029
01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:53.540
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out.</v>

2030
01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the raging bull.</v>

2031
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.970
<v Speaker 2>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was good.</v>

2032
01:21:56.260 --> 01:22:01.260
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was Korea choreographed down to </v>

2033
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:01.260
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

2034
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he recreated essentially what happened </v>

2035
01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.630
<v Speaker 2>with sugar ray Robinson and Jake Lamata,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Deniro was a meticulous motherfucker</v>

2036
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:12.650
<v Speaker 2>in those days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean what it look kind of shape he </v>

2037
01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:13.050
<v Speaker 2>got in for that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looked like Lamanda.</v>

2038
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looked like those days are over </v>

2039
01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.940
<v Speaker 2>meticulous rover now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing spring break.</v>

2040
01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:26.720
<v Speaker 2>No shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2041
01:22:26.721 --> 01:22:28.410
<v Speaker 2>you don't do the best boxing movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

2042
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Day Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did that movie.</v>

2043
01:22:30.241 --> 01:22:35.241
<v Speaker 2>The boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He apparently lived like a boxer for a </v>

2044
01:22:35.241 --> 01:22:35.640
<v Speaker 2>whole year for that move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although he does that kind of stuff.</v>

2045
01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you watch him box though,</v>

2046
01:22:37.890 --> 01:22:40.640
<v Speaker 2>like he's boxing like a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not boxing.</v>

2047
01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.930
<v Speaker 2>It's called the box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2048
01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:48.050
<v Speaker 2>it's called the boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He plays an IRA guy that gets released </v>

2049
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:48.180
<v Speaker 2>from prison and goes back to boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2050
01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.440
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

2051
01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He uh,</v>

2052
01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:51.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my uh,</v>

2053
01:22:51.481 --> 01:22:56.040
<v Speaker 2>buddy of mine was in the Lincoln movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he stayed at Lincoln,</v>

2054
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln Fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any character?</v>

2055
01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.040
<v Speaker 2>And he was wiggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear somebody said that he cut his.</v>

2056
01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.140
<v Speaker 2>He</v>

2057
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.110
<v Speaker 1>sliced his thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2058
01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:12.610
<v Speaker 1>And somebody else let there be blood he </v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

2059
01:23:12.650 --> 01:23:16.300
<v Speaker 1>He got annoyed that I'm sure he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stays in character the whole time.</v>

2060
01:23:16.301 --> 01:23:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I guess he had a box for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2061
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:22.000
<v Speaker 1>to cut that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he is above and beyond.</v>

2062
01:23:22.001 --> 01:23:24.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy that loses him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him Christian Bale.</v>

2063
01:23:24.971 --> 01:23:28.460
<v Speaker 1>They lose themselves in the characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people play it,</v>

2064
01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.400
<v Speaker 1>myself included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2065
01:23:30.401 --> 01:23:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to play an English </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>

2066
01:23:31.871 --> 01:23:32.740
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2068
01:23:34.511 --> 01:23:36.760
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some guys,</v>

2069
01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:40.510
<v Speaker 1>and those are two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just completely disappeared.</v>

2070
01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Gary Oldman and the Gary Oldman,</v>
