1
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>No headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather not have that gene.</v>

2
00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Grazie no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I learned that,</v>

3
00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:14.110
<v Speaker 1>I learned that the hearing my own voice</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my head makes,</v>

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.830
<v Speaker 1>makes me focus on it and I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on the sound of my voice.</v>

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I want to focus on your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm focusing on,</v>

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like blowing out in my head and all</v>

7
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:24.040
<v Speaker 1>this shit's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's smart.</v>

8
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have headphones on or not have</v>

10
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>headphones on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't are we up?</v>

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're hearing the audio recording in</v>

12
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is we switched to a new</v>

13
00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>tri caster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were having problems with our old one</v>

14
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>to tri caster is the machine that allows</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie to switch cameras and put</v>

15
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>everything up on the Internet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully includes skype so we could get</v>

16
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:54.740
<v Speaker 1>some people from like getting signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no video showing.</v>

17
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to restart?</v>

18
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make sure that that's</v>

19
00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

20
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

21
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 1>we might have to restart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folks would try and live while we're</v>

22
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>going live with some new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I want it.</v>

23
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I want people on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it audio?</v>

24
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>But no video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I figured that out.</v>

25
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>

26
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>if you are just staring at a blank</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

27
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 1>would you have to shut this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Showed down to get the video back to it</v>

28
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>should work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all right,</v>

29
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 1>just do a double camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A two shot.</v>

30
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>So you're never going to be okay now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it live now?</v>

31
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Tech motherfucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would suck.</v>

32
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.300
<v Speaker 1>It would suck if like we did back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>half an hour.</v>

33
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>It turns out none of it got picked up or</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did a whole shore.</v>

34
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Camera's going on youtube right now for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

35
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:43.490
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't see us right now.</v>

36
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.220
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to fix that</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucking dollar.</v>

37
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were having problems with our old tri</v>

38
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>caster crashing a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a new tri caster,</v>

39
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.770
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that doesn't match up?</v>

40
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>What part is wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The control panel.</v>

41
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>It should be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>

42
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

43
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were we just talking about?</v>

44
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.550
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>headphones,</v>

45
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.600
<v Speaker 1>headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

46
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>listening to yourself and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>headphones.</v>

47
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.000
<v Speaker 1>What I think of is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me like I close out the outside</v>

48
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:17.810
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

49
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.640
<v Speaker 1>And I just lock in on the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

50
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>it's only psychological.</v>

51
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.720
<v Speaker 1>But if you will watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he puts up a video,</v>

52
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:26.000
<v Speaker 1>it'd be nice to hear it and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought your head and you have to put</v>

53
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.180
<v Speaker 1>the headphones on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like when that's on,</v>

54
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 1>it's just like I pay more attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not talking over people too.</v>

55
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Can't stand the sound of my voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hearing you,</v>

56
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

57
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:41.240
<v Speaker 1>But I can't stand the sound of it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear enough.</v>

58
00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't need it blasting in my ears as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked.</v>

59
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Then I focus on it and then I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good get depressed.</v>

60
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a good quality to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hate your own voice because voice,</v>

61
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.050
<v Speaker 1>he would listen to it all the time like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

62
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.040
<v Speaker 1>you know how hard it is to listen to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup.</v>

63
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 1>That's tyree hard for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's death.</v>

64
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>It kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

65
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>but I always</v>

66
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 2>hear your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to listen to your shit.</v>

67
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 2>You got to go back and edit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to edit your shit.</v>

68
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to listen to my self.</v>

69
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to put every,</v>

70
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I go up on stage behind me,</v>

71
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know that's not the right thing to</v>

72
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:13.841
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

73
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 2>you get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take a lot of time out of the</v>

74
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 2>development of a joke process if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just listened to the previous versions</v>

75
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause like I have this new bit that I'm</v>

76
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:24.800
<v Speaker 2>doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

77
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 2>and I have like three different versions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it and it's not right now.</v>

78
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 2>It's very shaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very shaky.</v>

79
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.580
<v Speaker 2>It goes one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes the other way.</v>

80
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it gets a big laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's just,</v>

81
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>it's just clunky and I've got to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out which one's the right formula.</v>

82
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 2>So the only way to do that really is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to how I did it.</v>

83
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then play it back and then write it</v>

84
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll listen to how I said it and I'll</v>

85
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 2>write it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll think about like what</v>

86
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be thinking if I was sitting</v>

87
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 2>there listening to this or if someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying this,</v>

88
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I anticipate what they're saying with</v>

89
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 2>the punchlines are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand.</v>

90
00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Because if you do that takes a lot out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

91
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to find a way to sneak it in.</v>

92
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 2>You've got to find a way to make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it really relates recordings or</v>

93
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 2>ever have an uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old bit that you like an old one from</v>

94
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 2>like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years ago that you'd think like,</v>

95
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have added that adding shit to</v>

96
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:15.574
<v Speaker 2>it today.</v>

97
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you kept going,</v>

98
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 2>that's like the argument like already</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a good point about that.</v>

99
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just keep adding to your bits and</v>

100
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 2>making them better and that's why you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to release a special,</v>

101
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 2>you could have used that same creativity</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come up with new bits instead of</v>

102
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 2>doing the same old bits for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have used that.</v>

103
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause there's some guys that think that</v>

104
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.620
<v Speaker 2>like if you got those old old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old bits there,</v>

105
00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Samurai swords,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

106
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 2>they'd just been hammering down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Polish type</v>

107
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this rhythm to them.</v>

108
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 2>You're like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember,</v>

109
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

110
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:52.121
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

111
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 2>did a special once and I rent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have like hardly any new</v>

112
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 2>material and so there's like 2009 inch</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

113
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 2>So I did some of my old old shit from</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 1,999 tiger bit.</v>

114
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

115
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.463
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was uh,</v>

116
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 2>some other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I didn't,</v>

117
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I retired that bit,</v>

118
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I retired that but bringing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can always bring that back,</v>

119
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 2>bring that back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's over.</v>

120
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember thinking,</v>

121
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are these old 10 year old bits.</v>

122
00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And I had for like literally 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I did my first recording.</v>

123
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I started in 88 and I recorded in like</v>
<v Speaker 2>99 so almost 11 years for actually</v>

124
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:30.700
<v Speaker 2>recording anything there are so tight</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had been,</v>

125
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 2>I'd never done them on anything so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could do them all the time.</v>

126
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

127
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the road or just they would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

128
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.353
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

129
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>You learn how that path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a fucking Ninja.</v>

130
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:45.090

131
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love your description of what you were</v>

132
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tying your shoes like you know how many</v>

133
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:53.560
<v Speaker 2>tire shoes you don't think this loops</v>
<v Speaker 2>going in here and this is going here and</v>

134
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>then I'm going to bring it here and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just like that you wouldn't even</v>

135
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 3>be able to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't even teach it to someone</v>

136
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 3>over the phone rings and it's teaching</v>
<v Speaker 3>me over the phone and be like,</v>

137
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 3>I got to do it a few times first and</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out what the hell I'm doing</v>

138
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 3>because I don't even know what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

139
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what I'm doing when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about shoes and I do it every day.</v>

140
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 3>My son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he learned to tie her shoes like</v>

141
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 3>maybe six months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

142
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 3>he never wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

143
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.510
<v Speaker 3>he wants to do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to decide where we eat every</v>

144
00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't want to tie his own shoe</v>

145
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 3>laces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

146
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:22.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we finally made him,</v>

147
00:06:22.931 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

148
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 3>and he was happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was struggling with it.</v>

149
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:30.551
<v Speaker 3>And I use that as an opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to show him how you can master anything.</v>

150
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Anything that you're having trouble</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

151
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Go look right now you're having trouble</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could do what he could do it,</v>

152
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he struggles.</v>

153
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 3>So one day you're going to do it like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daddy,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Look and I do it and go boom.</v>

156

<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to look at that crazy.</v>

157
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.910

163
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 3>So like the next day he's trying not to</v>
<v Speaker 3>look.</v>

164
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.284
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>could use that,</v>

168
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:14.230
<v Speaker 3>that whole story that he won't forget</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

169

<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that.</v>

170
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 3>Remember when you had trouble tying your</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoes and remember how good you can look</v>

<v Speaker 3>whether it's gymnastics or break dancing</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's the same exact thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body is magic.</v>

175
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 3>You just got to tell it a thousand times</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then if I only listens and it'll do</v>

176
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 3>it itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought about that today.</v>

177
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Not Today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like now look,</v>

178
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 3>if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had to learn today how to do like a</v>

179
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:42.940
<v Speaker 3>three 60 roundhouse kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

180

<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

183
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.090
<v Speaker 3>But when I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just like,</v>

184
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 3>it's just something I've done my whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

<v Speaker 3>your act over and over and over to the</v>

195
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 3>point where I wasn't listening to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes no more.</v>

196
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to the audience</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction.</v>

197
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 3>That was what was entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to sit through another hour of</v>

198
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 3>your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>

199

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

200
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.770
<v Speaker 3>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

201
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 3>being entertained by the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

202
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:39.200
<v Speaker 3>which jokes work and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's very,</v>

203
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

204
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 3>there's women out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd go out there and they had to drag</v>

205
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:48.200
<v Speaker 3>their husband out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to go out.</v>

206
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to stanch cause we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never take me out.</v>

207
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.900
<v Speaker 3>And she dragged him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He spent a lot of money there.</v>

208
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 3>They're buying money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're buying drinks,</v>

209
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 3>she</v>

210
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.520
<v Speaker 1>wants to make sure that they have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great time.</v>

211
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 1>So there's always like 10 of those wives</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dragged their husbands out and they</v>

212
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>just want a lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

213
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing at stuff that isn't the</v>

214
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 1>punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

216
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so many things that you would</v>

217
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 1>say that just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the way you set them and wasn't,</v>

218
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joke at all,</v>

219
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 1>but there'd be like four chicks for just</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh and they're like ready to laugh,</v>

220
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

221

<v Speaker 1>people that love standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely can get into like certain</v>

222
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:28.060
<v Speaker 1>rhythms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you can,</v>

223
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

225
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 1>like one kind of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you see a bunch of comedians</v>

226
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 1>and then the original stuff that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked you'd think sucks.</v>

227
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 1>funniest shit.</v>

229

<v Speaker 1>My whole life was all about music.</v>

230
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 1>But my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my two side things,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dave Chappelle or the real high level</v>

258
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 1>guys that are seeing things and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're commenting on things and they're</v>

259
00:10:57.571 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Speaker 1>pointing things out that maybe other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people didn't notice.</v>

260
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Then there's other people that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>bits because they know other people have</v>

261
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:09.531
<v Speaker 1>done bits on that subject successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not totally stealing,</v>

262
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.100
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really being creative.</v>

<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

270
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.440
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those shows were like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just trying to make it,</v>

271
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 1>cause it was the comedy boom man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you're talking about was like there</v>

272
00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 1>was a comedy tv boom that included</v>
<v Speaker 1>evening at the Improv.</v>

273
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:41.510
<v Speaker 1>MTV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half hour comedy hour spotlight,</v>

274
00:11:41.511 --> 00:11:46.511
<v Speaker 1>lot spotlight live on vh one some Friday</v>
<v Speaker 1>night thing they had on Fox that uh,</v>

275
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.670
<v Speaker 1>used to be at the laugh factory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still have a police show.</v>

276
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was so much comedy,</v>

277
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.260
<v Speaker 1>it was out of control,</v>

278
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.730
<v Speaker 3>but there was a lot of guys that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't belong in the business yet.</v>

279
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't say that it couldn't</v>

280
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:04.180
<v Speaker 3>eventually have broke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were basically like,</v>

281
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 3>did you ever notice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey like there's a lot of those fucking</v>

282
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 3>guys where they would like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey and there's a Goddamn wild kingdom</v>

283
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:15.700
<v Speaker 3>plan out my live in Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they had this like comedy rhythm</v>

284
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.890
<v Speaker 3>that they would do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't have shit to say.</v>

285
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 3>But it's still worth a lot of those guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing comedy to get a Sitcom.</v>

286
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.480
<v Speaker 3>They weren't tracking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't really want to do comedy.</v>

287
00:12:24.481 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

288
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought it'd be easier if they did</v>

289
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:29.120
<v Speaker 3>it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

290
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.090
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of actors that I talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>to about it.</v>

291
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:31.691
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Matt,</v>

292
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 3>for me it's real hard to get auditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes in for the longest time,</v>

293
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:37.690
<v Speaker 3>I'd sit around and watch you guys get</v>
<v Speaker 3>development deals and I'd be like,</v>

295
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.360
<v Speaker 3>These guys don't even act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized like,</v>

296
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 3>why am I complaining?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't I just do what they do?</v>

297

<v Speaker 3>How hard could it be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

298
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

<v Speaker 3>again and do that like three times.</v>

315
00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 3>He just wanted to make sure it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's really good to see him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

323
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.040
<v Speaker 3>blossom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

324
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on the Netflix specials that I see</v>

325
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:55.900
<v Speaker 3>on average three minutes at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of bad ones,</v>

326
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 3>they're just putting out comedy specials</v>
<v Speaker 3>left and right.</v>

327
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.270
<v Speaker 3>My random dudes you never heard of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of,</v>

328
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:05.890
<v Speaker 3>a of a lot of super vanilla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix,</v>

329
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 3>comedy specials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vanilla,</v>

330
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 3>like they're not going beep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beep.</v>

331
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.710

332
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 3>And there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people need to fill more shows.</v>

333
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.020
<v Speaker 3>I think they're just filming one show</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

334
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think if you can afford each</v>

335
00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:22.600
<v Speaker 3>should do for Ricky Gervais is his new</v>

<v Speaker 3>has never really paid attention to him.</v>

337
00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Like Ricky Gervais'.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you do like cartoons or something</v>

338
00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His new special on Netflix.</v>

349
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like that one as much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like it as much as I liked his</v>

350
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.120
<v Speaker 3>other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He spent the first 20 minutes on</v>

00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Jacksonville cause that's where he</v>

450
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.480
<v Speaker 3>once one of your friends claims them as</v>
<v Speaker 3>their favorite and now they can't be</v>

<v Speaker 3>Even if I didn't know the Mexican,</v>

487

523
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 3>way funnier than white people based on</v>

<v Speaker 2>It backfired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys will try and go,</v>

581
00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.460
<v Speaker 2>no Clinton on this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not trying to fuck kids so that,</v>

582
00:24:20.461 --> 00:24:21.940
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a thing about it,</v>

583
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.970
<v Speaker 2>like Roseanne Barr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were saying that Roseanne Barr was,</v>

584
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking about some conspiracy</v>

585
00:24:30.231 --> 00:24:33.570
<v Speaker 2>theories that have been disproven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what some thing,</v>

586
00:24:33.571 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 2>cause she was talking about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>break it up,</v>

587
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:36.380
<v Speaker 2>child sex rings.</v>

588
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:41.950
<v Speaker 2>But he really did spend a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on that and having people</v>

589
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:47.030
<v Speaker 2>go out and try to break up the sex rings</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sex trafficking.</v>

590
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Like this is not something that is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theory.</v>

591
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:52.490
<v Speaker 2>This is something that he's discussed</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>

592
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Speaker 2>It's also not a conspiracy that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex trafficking.</v>

593
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.670
<v Speaker 2>So as much as you want to discount</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

594
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.490
<v Speaker 2>here's a problem that I have with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are on the left right now.</v>

595
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.560
<v Speaker 2>They didn't do not looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

596
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.110
<v Speaker 2>throwing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at what they want to look at.</v>

597
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.960
<v Speaker 2>He's bad for the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always lying.</v>

598
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.850
<v Speaker 2>He cheats on his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does this,</v>

599
00:25:10.851 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 2>he does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say all these things that he does</v>

600
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:14.570
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when something comes up,</v>

601
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:16.370
<v Speaker 2>like Roseanne says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

602
00:25:16.371 --> 00:25:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's going after sex trafficking</v>

603
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.050
<v Speaker 2>and then it turns out all these other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

604
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 2>So that's conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bullshit online.</v>

605
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it.</v>

606
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.790
<v Speaker 2>He's put effort into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you gotta give the Guy Credit</v>

607
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.250
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't give them credit</v>
<v Speaker 2>for things that he does at are</v>

608
00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:33.230
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's going to listen to you when</v>

609
00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 2>you're criticizing them either because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

610
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:38.300
<v Speaker 2>all you're trying to do is when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not trying to look at the thing for what</v>

611
00:25:38.301 --> 00:25:39.320
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

612
00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 2>He's this guy and he's not perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

613
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.960
<v Speaker 2>but he did make note on many times about</v>
<v Speaker 2>at wanting to break up stuff,</v>

614
00:25:47.501 --> 00:25:49.890
<v Speaker 2>just sex trafficking rings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that you're,</v>

615
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your kid is 20,000 times more likely to</v>

616
00:25:53.631 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 2>get kidnapped them to get shot or to</v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

617
00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

618
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 2>At 20,000 it's conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably really like 70,000,</v>

619
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:06.641
<v Speaker 2>because if you go by the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>800,000 to a million kids go missing</v>

620
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.510
<v Speaker 2>every year in the United States.</v>

621
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.220
<v Speaker 2>And I looked that up though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't,</v>

622
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I'd never found a source for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that before and I looked that</v>

623
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:15.110
<v Speaker 2>up and I couldn't find that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't nearly as,</v>

624
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I read it online so it could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cause a problem with these things,</v>

625
00:26:18.891 --> 00:26:20.450
<v Speaker 2>like when we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you say it,</v>

626
00:26:20.451 --> 00:26:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm like right now 2 million people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to listen to this or whatever.</v>

627
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:27.731
<v Speaker 2>The fucking knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's a 100,100 if it's 102</v>

628
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.060
<v Speaker 2>hundred kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more than school.</v>

629
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.460
<v Speaker 2>One of y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To my point,</v>

630
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.500
<v Speaker 2>it's more than school shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what would you rather have your,</v>

631
00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:35.610
<v Speaker 2>you know what's worse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's worse.</v>

632
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Get having your Kubrick shot at any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

633
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to the National Center for</v>

634
00:26:39.801 --> 00:26:42.380
<v Speaker 2>missing exploited children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>citing US Department of Justice report,</v>

635
00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:43.830
<v Speaker 2>nearly 800,000 children</v>

636
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 3>are reported missing each year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's more than 2000 a day.</v>

637
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.780
<v Speaker 3>The end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See Mec says 203,000 children are</v>

638
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 3>kidnapped each year by family members.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

639
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:57.930
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a little bit of six thousand six</v>

640
00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:58.330
<v Speaker 3>hundred thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

641
00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:02.130
<v Speaker 3>that'd be 600,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's worse has always having your</v>

642
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:03.340
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause uh,</v>

643
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.600
<v Speaker 3>cause the conspiracy theory is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this giant international child</v>

644
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 3>sex trafficking network going on that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>being covered up.</v>

645
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.160
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at a Jimmy Salvo in the</v>

646
00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:21.670
<v Speaker 3>UK that brought a lot of light to what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going saddle savile.</v>

647
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a terrifying story.</v>

648
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.390
<v Speaker 3>The story with him is Jimmy Savile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dead now.</v>

649
00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:29.700
<v Speaker 3>He died in his eighties at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2011.</v>

650
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.210
<v Speaker 3>He was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

651
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 3>a super famous like Dick Clark kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

652
00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:38.580
<v Speaker 3>He was a d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the host of a pop top of the</v>

653
00:27:38.581 --> 00:27:40.260
<v Speaker 3>pops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

654
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 3>it's like if your band got on that show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be mega.</v>

655
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.680
<v Speaker 3>He was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was friends with the royal family,</v>

656
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:49.020
<v Speaker 3>with the prime minister's Margaret</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thatcher,</v>

657
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.880
<v Speaker 3>Tony Blair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a picture of him.</v>

658
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.390
<v Speaker 3>He looks disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull up Jimmy savile.</v>

659
00:27:53.391 --> 00:27:55.260
<v Speaker 3>This guy looks like a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this guy.</v>

660
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 3>Look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just super fucked by that guy.</v>

661
00:27:58.171 --> 00:28:01.800
<v Speaker 3>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was 12 super,</v>

662
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.920
<v Speaker 3>super famous and you know what he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>

663
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.400
<v Speaker 3>He would raise money for hospitals and</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically psychiatric hospitals and</v>

664
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.340
<v Speaker 3>he would bring the queen of England and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got all this power to raise millions</v>

665
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.310
<v Speaker 3>for these hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these mental institutions.</v>

666
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:22.770
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he prayed on it for kids,</v>

667
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 3>so he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he would do is he would,</v>

668
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 3>he would do so much for these hospitals</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he would put himself on the board</v>

669
00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:30.540
<v Speaker 3>and give himself a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in a position and he would hang</v>

670
00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:32.310
<v Speaker 3>out at these hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all,</v>

671
00:28:32.311 --> 00:28:35.880
<v Speaker 3>there's at least five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's at least 500 people that have</v>

672
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:38.940
<v Speaker 3>come forward to say they've been were</v>
<v Speaker 3>raped by him.</v>

673
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.790
<v Speaker 3>When that ran a 500 people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least it's in the thousands so that</v>

674
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.250
<v Speaker 3>he's holding up on his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that say to me?</v>

675
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would fix it.</v>

676
00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.490
<v Speaker 3>He worked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he worked for the BBC,</v>

677
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.700
<v Speaker 3>super famous super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would,</v>

678
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.170
<v Speaker 3>he had Christmas dinner with Margaret</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thatcher Multiple Times.</v>

679
00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.290
<v Speaker 3>What does that red hat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got the,</v>

680
00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:01.200
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a maggot hat right above</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

681
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

682
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:09.540
<v Speaker 3>There's a crazy guy who it turns out he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a child rapist.</v>

683
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

684
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.050
<v Speaker 3>that's the same thing with Sandusky and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the covering Husky guy it up.</v>

685
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.750
<v Speaker 3>The question is becoming this old dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

686
00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Because people knew they're complicit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they then trump the mystery.</v>

687
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.240
<v Speaker 3>The mystery is how is he so tight with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the prime ministers,</v>

688
00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:30.120
<v Speaker 3>the royal family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these politicians,</v>

689
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.390
<v Speaker 3>all this shit comes out when he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause every time there would be an</v>

690
00:29:33.391 --> 00:29:36.240
<v Speaker 3>allegation while he was alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would just sit them down and go,</v>

691
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:38.580
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ruin your life.</v>

692
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.920
<v Speaker 3>You better drop this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>

693

736
00:31:41.081 --> 00:31:44.330
<v Speaker 1>effort for this kind of stuff like there</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why isn't there,</v>

739
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.880
<v Speaker 1>because that's not a big event where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing where all the deaths</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

769
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 2>this is something that people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about,</v>

770
00:33:23.241 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Speaker 2>like very intelligent people that I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have talked about in terms of like,</v>

771
00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:29.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been stories about people that</v>

772
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:34.391
<v Speaker 2>have taken politicians to like islands</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit because that's where they keep</v>

773
00:33:34.401 --> 00:33:35.600
<v Speaker 2>like young girls.</v>

774
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:36.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I'm looking at you</v>

00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:38.690
<v Speaker 2>jammy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what,</v>

776
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.350
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone talked to me about this and</v>

777
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:44.870
<v Speaker 2>they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to understand that if you are</v>

778
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 2>in a group of incredibly wealthy people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have extreme,</v>

779
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.540
<v Speaker 2>a desire for extreme sexual scenarios,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whips and,</v>

782
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 2>So people come into these people's lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can facilitate these things and</v>

783
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 2>then they developed a sort of bond of</v>
<v Speaker 2>silence.</v>

784
00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 2>And this is how when this shit gets out</v>

<v Speaker 2>So you got to look at him like a</v>

808
00:35:15.471 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 2>prosecuting attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a defense lawyer.</v>

809
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.950
<v Speaker 2>He's already a shitbag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's already confirmed already ripping</v>

810
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.350
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the stop of killing?</v>

811
00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

812
00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

813
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.830
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point because if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>the type of person that could rate a</v>

814
00:35:26.831 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can't you do?</v>

815
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

816
00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:32.900
<v Speaker 2>In the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers could be wrong,</v>

817
00:35:32.901 --> 00:35:37.901
<v Speaker 2>but I heard that every three seconds a</v>
<v Speaker 2>child is reported missing in the UK,</v>

818
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.330
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 175,000 kids a year get reported</v>

819
00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:44.160
<v Speaker 2>missing in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UK,</v>

820
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a big businessman has got to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than that.</v>

821
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a Jochen's in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that every three seconds at</v>

822
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:54.330
<v Speaker 2>175,000 that seems low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every three minutes.</v>

823
00:35:54.331 --> 00:35:55.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>39 every three seconds.</v>

824
00:35:55.981 --> 00:35:56.814
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

825
00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Is Crazy.</v>

826
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Every three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every three minutes.</v>

827
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.930
<v Speaker 2>This is according to something I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>31 million seconds in a day.</v>

828
00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

829
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the numbers are probably a</v>

830
00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.930
<v Speaker 2>hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>175,000 isn't as big as 800,000 a year,</v>

831
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 2>but damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

832
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:22.761
<v Speaker 2>that should be pick up on all this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're doing for the Florida</v>

833
00:36:22.951 --> 00:36:26.460
<v Speaker 2>shooting and for the shootings and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>that David Hogg Guy Come on man.</v>

834
00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.370
<v Speaker 2>That that's what's scary is that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are buying all that stuff,</v>

835
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:34.490
<v Speaker 2>buying all what stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole gun control propaganda.</v>

836
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so obvious.</v>

837
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.030
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

838
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.150
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous thing to gun control.</v>

839
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Propagandas it's really simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

840
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like they've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to disarm the population and</v>

841
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by Ann's trying to disarm it,</v>

842
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.960
<v Speaker 2>they used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used to say,</v>

843
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.120
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just want some restrictions and some</v>

844
00:36:57.121 --> 00:36:58.860
<v Speaker 2>background checks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're just saying it.</v>

845
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are saying revoke the second</v>

846
00:37:02.491 --> 00:37:05.400
<v Speaker 2>amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're tearing the constitution.</v>

847
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.370
<v Speaker 2>They're tearing the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those four kids,</v>

848
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.940
<v Speaker 2>those four kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a concept.</v>

849
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.041
<v Speaker 2>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't,</v>

850
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:11.920
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

851
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:12.840
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's photoshop.</v>

852
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.740
<v Speaker 2>No it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

853
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Original image that that girl was</v>
<v Speaker 2>tearing.</v>

854
00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:19.280
<v Speaker 2>It was like a target target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

855
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Someone replaced that image with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>constant.</v>

856
00:37:21.351 --> 00:37:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're essentially doing the same</v>

857
00:37:23.581 --> 00:37:24.091
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

858
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>

859
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.863
<v Speaker 2>They look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

860
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 2>they're 17 they were at a school that</v>
<v Speaker 2>got shot up.</v>

861
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Their friends died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it from their point of view.</v>

862
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:35.190
<v Speaker 2>If I was 17 I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also they got cameras in their face</v>

863
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.970
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's paying attention to them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ever.</v>

864
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.030
<v Speaker 2>The New York Times is interviewing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Washington Post.</v>

865
00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's calling them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was them,</v>

866
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably be doing the same thing.</v>

867
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.640
<v Speaker 2>You would probably too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were in high school with those</v>

868
00:37:44.641 --> 00:37:48.090
<v Speaker 2>kids and all that shit went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't blame them by any stretch of the</v>

869
00:37:48.091 --> 00:37:49.920
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even blame people that are</v>

870
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:54.480
<v Speaker 2>trying to revoke the second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that infuriates me the most is</v>

871
00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:56.790
<v Speaker 2>that all people want to look at is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

872
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.450
<v Speaker 2>That's all they want to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to look at the mental health of</v>

873
00:38:00.451 --> 00:38:03.330
<v Speaker 2>individuals that are willing to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot up a group of kids.</v>

874
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck would someone do that?</v>

875
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Psychiatric medications are a big one</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you bring up people roll their</v>

876
00:38:09.871 --> 00:38:10.501
<v Speaker 2>eyes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

877
00:38:10.501 --> 00:38:14.850
<v Speaker 2>this again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are massive changes to the fucking</v>

878
00:38:14.851 --> 00:38:17.940
<v Speaker 2>chemical composition of your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you take these things,</v>

879
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.880
<v Speaker 2>what you're capable of doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what bothers you,</v>

880
00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:23.400
<v Speaker 2>what freaks you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you don't give a shit about.</v>

881
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.470
<v Speaker 2>When you got all these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>on an Ssri,</v>

882
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:29.130
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants and anti anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 2>medication and over and over and over</v>

883
00:38:29.131 --> 00:38:30.630
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they test these shooters,</v>

884
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 2>they all test positive for something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pharmaceutical companies do not want</v>

885
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.960
<v Speaker 2>fucking hear about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to talk about this.</v>

886
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Phil Hartman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend who got shot by his wife,</v>

887
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.570
<v Speaker 2>she was on Zoloft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got a settlement from zoloft.</v>

888
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:46.840
<v Speaker 2>The family got a settlement from zoloft</v>
<v Speaker 2>after she fucking shot him in the head</v>

889
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:48.460
<v Speaker 2>while he was sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

890
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.640
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just guns.</v>

891
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.880
<v Speaker 2>It is crazy that that fucked up kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>could get guns.</v>

892
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 2>It is crazy to just crazy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The FBI went to his house two years</v>

893
00:38:58.211 --> 00:39:00.480
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what can you do?</v>

894
00:39:00.481 --> 00:39:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you hear about the kid that they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped and China,</v>

895
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.250
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese immigrant kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sending back that his roommates</v>

896
00:39:06.251 --> 00:39:07.800
<v Speaker 2>in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're saying this fucking guy's</v>

897
00:39:07.801 --> 00:39:08.980
<v Speaker 2>stockpile and guns.</v>

898
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 2>The cops went to visit him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went and bought another gun and he's</v>

899
00:39:11.861 --> 00:39:14.770
<v Speaker 2>talking all kinds of crazy shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's nervous about him.</v>

900
00:39:14.771 --> 00:39:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Like he's a fucking shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wedded,</v>

901
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 2>ready to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop going to class.</v>

902
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's how they sent him back</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's on a student visa.</v>

903
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.270
<v Speaker 2>You can't not be in class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This kid was like gearing up.</v>

904
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.350
<v Speaker 2>He was gearing up and maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they caught it before it happened</v>

905
00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:32.290
<v Speaker 2>and maybe they wouldn't have like two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago when they interviewed this,</v>

906
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:35.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid from Parkland now decayed.</v>

907
00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:40.780
<v Speaker 2>The strangest thing about the parkland</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting is the interview one of the</v>

908
00:39:41.741 --> 00:39:45.130
<v Speaker 2>teachers did on ABC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this,</v>

909
00:39:45.131 --> 00:39:47.050
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't make any sense to me at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

910
00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:50.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

911
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I have the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could send it to you,</v>

912
00:39:51.891 --> 00:39:52.071
<v Speaker 2>Jen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

913
00:39:52.071 --> 00:39:53.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's less than a minute.</v>

914
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:54.850
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

915
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard the,</v>

916
00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 2>I heard shots.</v>

917
00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:01.270
<v Speaker 2>I opened up the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the kids ran in the hid behind their</v>

918
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:04.930
<v Speaker 2>desk and there I saw the shooter 20 feet</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from me,</v>

919
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.660
<v Speaker 2>but at first I thought he was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>policeman.</v>

920
00:40:07.661 --> 00:40:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the police doing here?</v>

921
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:14.470
<v Speaker 2>He had full body armor and mask on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>helmet on and was shooting.</v>

922
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:16.140
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the cost?</v>

923
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:19.300
<v Speaker 2>What are the cops doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the strangers,</v>

924
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video I've seen because possibly someone</v>

925
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:26.210
<v Speaker 2>shooting at the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what she said.</v>

926
00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.180
<v Speaker 2>She said she saw the shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>

927
00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:29.950
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long was she watching for?</v>

928
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're like looking out the window</v>

929
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:34.780
<v Speaker 2>and you see someone that's shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone or shooting a gun or even</v>

930
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:35.920
<v Speaker 2>holding a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

931
00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:38.230
<v Speaker 2>you have to realize that people in those</v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic situations,</v>

932
00:40:38.231 --> 00:40:39.970
<v Speaker 2>their memory is very fucked up.</v>

933
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.880
<v Speaker 2>It's very shaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain's flooded with adrenaline.</v>

934
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.190
<v Speaker 2>You may remember your openness</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggestion.</v>

935
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.490
<v Speaker 2>People can put things in your head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you all of a sudden think that that was</v>

936
00:40:48.491 --> 00:40:51.430
<v Speaker 2>a real memory that you saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been like scientific studies on</v>

937
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:55.250
<v Speaker 2>that and about suggestive memory and</v>
<v Speaker 2>about someone can literally it,</v>

938
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.190
<v Speaker 2>especially during periods of great</v>
<v Speaker 2>duress,</v>

939
00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:01.180
<v Speaker 2>they can introduce ideas into your head</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you will tell those ideas</v>

940
00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 2>hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>days later as your own and you don't</v>

941
00:41:06.011 --> 00:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>even realize that they put them in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

942
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.410
<v Speaker 2>It's real weird memory in traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations like guns,</v>

943
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 2>shootouts and shit like that is haywire</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're on,</v>

944
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.130
<v Speaker 2>you're working on that reptilian part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain.</v>

945
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:22.510
<v Speaker 2>You're down to the lowest level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my friend Steve Rinella got</v>

946
00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:25.990
<v Speaker 2>attacked by a grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in a fog neck island.</v>

947
00:41:25.991 --> 00:41:27.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heman.</v>

948
00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 2>These other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had killed an elk and they were</v>

949
00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 2>packing this elk out and they left the</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk by the tree while they were at their</v>

950
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>

951
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Then they went to go back and a baird</v>
<v Speaker 2>claim the elk and this bear rushed him</v>

952
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.550
<v Speaker 2>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one of the ways you described to me,</v>

953
00:41:40.551 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have an idea in your head</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like what?</v>

954
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Like an animal instinct is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>

955
00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this goes way deeper than that.</v>

956
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:49.611
<v Speaker 2>This goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

957
00:41:49.611 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 2>when you really think your life is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>danger,</v>

958
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 2>you really think it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even exist anymore.</v>

959
00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 2>You're moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea what you're doing.</v>

960
00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:00.320
<v Speaker 2>You're you're you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to piece together what happened</v>

961
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:02.870
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and you were barely there in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place.</v>

962
00:42:02.871 --> 00:42:05.030
<v Speaker 2>You're just gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gone.</v>

963
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:10.180
<v Speaker 2>You see somebody else like you have no</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking idea who you even are right</v>

964
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:12.230
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all these people that like I</v>

965
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:14.510
<v Speaker 2>would have run in the building kicked</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking guy's ass.</v>

966
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.630
<v Speaker 2>You barely even know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got this video.</v>

967
00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent you the video,</v>

968
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:25.820
<v Speaker 3>the video of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have to understand memory.</v>

969
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's listen to her and then let's see</v>

970
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:29.850
<v Speaker 3>if she sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

971
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.530
<v Speaker 3>let's hear what she says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually sent,</v>

972
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.340
<v Speaker 3>sent you that the actual clips at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

973
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:38.900
<v Speaker 3>This is not it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't I send,</v>

974
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.600
<v Speaker 3>I sent you one right on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not it though.</v>

975
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.460
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the lady.</v>

976
00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:46.560
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she's going to say let's just play</v>

977
00:42:46.561 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 3>it cause we don't hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not hearing it,</v>

978
00:42:47.991 --> 00:42:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

979
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Dick Writing Love Letters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the fire alarm went off,</v>

980
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.520
<v Speaker 3>as students filed into the hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she heard gun fire.</v>

981
00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.590
<v Speaker 3>The killing had begun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

982
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:03.590
<v Speaker 4>I was about two feet away from my door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden I heard gunshots in the</v>

983
00:43:03.591 --> 00:43:05.540
<v Speaker 4>stairwell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is about 20 feet away from my</v>

984
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:08.630
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then kids were screaming and then</v>

985
00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 4>running back towards me and towards the</v>
<v Speaker 4>end of the hallway.</v>

986
00:43:11.601 --> 00:43:15.740
<v Speaker 4>So I just went in this very strange</v>
<v Speaker 4>autopilot mode where I pivoted on my</v>

987
00:43:15.741 --> 00:43:18.610
<v Speaker 4>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I unlocked my door and the kids just</v>

988
00:43:18.611 --> 00:43:20.360
<v Speaker 4>start pouring in my room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many kids were in</v>

989
00:43:20.361 --> 00:43:22.490
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was pulling them and getting them</v>

990
00:43:22.491 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 4>in and shouting at them to get in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>

991
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.520
<v Speaker 4>And then I suddenly saw the shooter</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 20 feet from me standing at the</v>

992
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:31.070
<v Speaker 4>end of the hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actively shooting down the hallway,</v>

993
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.400
<v Speaker 4>just a barrage of bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm staring at him thinking,</v>

994
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:38.750
<v Speaker 4>why is the police here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is strange cause he's in full metal</v>

995
00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:43.040
<v Speaker 4>garb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Helmet facemask a bulletproof armor</v>

996
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:46.670
<v Speaker 4>shooting this rifle that I've never seen</v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

997
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

998
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.410
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a someone who saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

999
00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good.</v>

1000
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's another video of a girl</v>

1001
00:43:57.381 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 3>saying yeah we heard shots and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>running through the hallway and then I</v>

1002
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:03.620
<v Speaker 3>run into Nicholas crews and I looked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and I told him,</v>

1003
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it weird that everyone thought</v>

1004
00:44:05.541 --> 00:44:08.600
<v Speaker 3>this was going to be you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he just stood there and then we</v>

1005
00:44:08.601 --> 00:44:11.250
<v Speaker 3>ran off cause we heard more shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1006
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 3>That's th th it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1007
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.470
<v Speaker 3>And that stops those details get taken</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1008
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Those videos get taken to dive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Video's not taking down.</v>

1009
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.820
<v Speaker 3>They've been taking them down when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>find him,</v>

1010
00:44:22.821 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 3>they take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this people actively taken down</v>

1011
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.880
<v Speaker 3>witness testimony that doesn't go with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the official narrative man.</v>

1012
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:34.510
<v Speaker 3>So you think that this is like a flag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone shot up the school food all</v>

1013
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:35.520
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1014
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.530
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they focus on it.</v>

1015
00:44:37.531 --> 00:44:38.520
<v Speaker 3>They got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got bad.</v>

1016
00:44:38.521 --> 00:44:39.900
<v Speaker 3>This Nicholas crews guy and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1017
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:42.570
<v Speaker 3>we got a perfect guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they come in,</v>

1018
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.750
<v Speaker 3>they have a professional team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they drag a nicholas crews,</v>

1019
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 3>they do what they gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They throw him in there,</v>

1020
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.670
<v Speaker 3>arrest him and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got him and then everyone buys it.</v>

1021
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going on in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion.</v>

1022
00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:55.710
<v Speaker 3>But this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a crazy opinion,</v>

1023
00:44:55.711 --> 00:44:58.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you weren't there on the other</v>

1024
00:44:58.111 --> 00:45:02.250
<v Speaker 3>side of the country I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But every time there's any sort of a</v>

1025
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.710
<v Speaker 3>mass event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some horrible event,</v>

1026
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:06.960
<v Speaker 3>there's always conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1027
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Speaker 3>because most these star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like to have a,</v>

1028
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.090
<v Speaker 3>what was going on right before this was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the release of the Pfizer Document and</v>

1029
00:45:15.091 --> 00:45:15.924
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1030
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:18.500
<v Speaker 3>and the doctor was bearing that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

1031
00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 3>the document was a document that trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>released and got zero zero air play from</v>

1032
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:28.470
<v Speaker 3>mainstream media.</v>

1033
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:32.520
<v Speaker 3>And it was a document that that showed</v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

1034
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:40.130
<v Speaker 3>a lot of really important people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>government from all the agencies were</v>

1035
00:45:40.261 --> 00:45:43.440
<v Speaker 3>all colluding together to take down</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

1036
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.530
<v Speaker 3>And there's text messages and emails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going back and forth.</v>

1037
00:45:46.531 --> 00:45:48.930
<v Speaker 3>So they all work together with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood,</v>

1038
00:45:48.931 --> 00:45:52.010
<v Speaker 3>with using Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this so five's,</v>

1039
00:45:52.011 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Speaker 3>the document was about to get dropped</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everyone was saying,</v>

1040
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:55.630
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're they,</v>

1041
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.130
<v Speaker 3>they're backed into a corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to pull something off.</v>

1042
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it comes.</v>

1043
00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:02.580
<v Speaker 3>They're going to pull out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be up shooting or</v>

1044
00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait for it.</v>

1045
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:05.670
<v Speaker 3>Here it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then boom.</v>

1046
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.500
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why conspiracy theorist are</v>

1047
00:46:08.501 --> 00:46:09.420
<v Speaker 3>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1048
00:46:09.421 --> 00:46:11.310
<v Speaker 3>And look at all the mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at,</v>

1049
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:13.800
<v Speaker 3>look at all the testimony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense that they're</v>

1050
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:15.950
<v Speaker 3>ignoring like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing,</v>

1051
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:20.820
<v Speaker 3>the thing that gets me is there's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many fuck ups in that shooting as a</v>

1052
00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 3>false flag.</v>

1053
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.790
<v Speaker 3>We're like all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these witness test,</v>

1054
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 3>the witness testimony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1055
00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.370
<v Speaker 3>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they did it on purpose to keep</v>

1056
00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:33.200
<v Speaker 3>all the conspiracy theorists busy</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's so much shit.</v>

1057
00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:37.980
<v Speaker 3>It's so cheap to keep everyone away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense to keep</v>

1058
00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:39.790
<v Speaker 3>everybody away from the Fi's document</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary.</v>

1059
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.730
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also possible that people that were</v>

1060
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:43.890
<v Speaker 3>at that shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their memories all fucked up because</v>

1061
00:46:43.891 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 3>there were so many shooting people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real thing,</v>

1062
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.520
<v Speaker 3>like that's 100% she sounded like she</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know what she was talking about</v>

1063
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:53.310
<v Speaker 3>then since then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't when the shooting was</v>

1064
00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:56.460
<v Speaker 3>going down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to see people when you see</v>

1065
00:46:56.461 --> 00:46:58.560
<v Speaker 3>people like right when they've seen some</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1066
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:00.150
<v Speaker 3>their brains scrambled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1067
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:02.730
<v Speaker 3>That's something that have to take into</v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>

1068
00:47:02.731 --> 00:47:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Especially some nice lady probably never</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw anybody get shot in their lives.</v>

1069
00:47:06.061 --> 00:47:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Probably never saw much violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:47:07.531 --> 00:47:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>

1071
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two,</v>

1072
00:47:09.871 --> 00:47:10.900
<v Speaker 3>there's two sides of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1073
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.790
<v Speaker 3>there's people that believe the official</v>
<v Speaker 3>story and then there's people that see</v>

1074
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:15.331
<v Speaker 3>it as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1075
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:19.570
<v Speaker 3>this was the false flag to distract from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Pfizer document lists.</v>

1076
00:47:19.571 --> 00:47:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that false flags don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>

1077
00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:25.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean you and I was discussed on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast in great detail is important.</v>

1078
00:47:25.771 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 3>False flag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is operation northwoods.</v>

1079
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're willing to do that,</v>

1080
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 3>they're willing to do</v>

1081
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.430
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is also the problem when we say</v>

1082
00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:38.431
<v Speaker 2>they operation northwoods was 1962.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is if that's how they did</v>

1083
00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:40.630
<v Speaker 2>business back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what they did.</v>

1084
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean operation northwoods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were planning on attacking</v>

1085
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Guantanamo Bay with the Cuban going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>arm Cuban friendlies,</v>

1086
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.530
<v Speaker 2>have them attack Guantanamo Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can sacrifice American lives.</v>

1087
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.590
<v Speaker 2>They were going to blow up a drone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jetliner blame it on the Cubans.</v>

1088
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.340
<v Speaker 2>All this was to get us enthusiastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>about going to war with Cuba.</v>

1089
00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.350
<v Speaker 2>They were going to sacrifice American</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

1090
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:02.310
<v Speaker 2>This is 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going to lie and fake shit.</v>

1091
00:48:02.311 --> 00:48:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was normal empires for all</v>

1092
00:48:05.141 --> 00:48:07.360
<v Speaker 2>countries is just a normal false flags</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

1093
00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.790
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been going on since the dawn of</v>

1094
00:48:09.791 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>False flags.</v>

1095
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.750
<v Speaker 2>That's old school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

1096
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:15.610
<v Speaker 2>and this is for the rational person</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's like,</v>

1097
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:17.650
<v Speaker 2>this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to wonder,</v>

1098
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:19.630
<v Speaker 2>is that evolved?</v>

1099
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything evolves.</v>

1100
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:21.960
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1101
00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we use technology evolves,</v>

1102
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:28.030
<v Speaker 2>the way we use literature evolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we use TV evolve,</v>

1103
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:32.140
<v Speaker 2>everything evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that evil corruption in government</v>

1104
00:48:32.141 --> 00:48:35.500
<v Speaker 2>evolved to or does it just somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another get snuffed out because of the</v>

1105
00:48:35.501 --> 00:48:37.000
<v Speaker 2>light?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't buy that.</v>

1106
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:38.171
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that.</v>

1107
00:48:38.171 --> 00:48:41.590
<v Speaker 2>If you look at all the different things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've shown that there's collusion</v>

1108
00:48:41.591 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just look at the fact that someone like</v>

1109
00:48:43.811 --> 00:48:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton can run for president</v>
<v Speaker 2>while she was making hundreds of</v>

1110
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.660
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars giving speeches to</v>
<v Speaker 2>banks,</v>

1111
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.150
<v Speaker 2>like when she was in that debate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders and Bernie Sanders was</v>

1112
00:48:52.151 --> 00:48:54.760
<v Speaker 2>like released his transcripts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell us what you said.</v>

1113
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Tell us what you said to those Nice Bank</v>
<v Speaker 2>are people that give you a half a</v>

1114
00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.870
<v Speaker 2>million dollars or whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave you.</v>

1115
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Like that's insane to think that some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1116
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:04.630
<v Speaker 2>listen dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is so fucking entertaining.</v>

1117
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:07.750
<v Speaker 2>We're going to give her $250,000 for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

1118
00:49:07.751 --> 00:49:09.400
<v Speaker 2>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know we make money with money.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all about money.</v>

1121
00:49:14.591 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 2>We know the value of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the banking business.</v>

1122
00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 2>This lady talking is worth a quarter</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollars.</v>

1123
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.280
<v Speaker 2>It's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to go up there.</v>

1124
00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 2>She's going to knock your socks off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's amazing.</v>

1125

<v Speaker 2>She's hilarious.</v>

1126
00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:34.660
<v Speaker 2>She's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her speech is super well and she stands</v>

1127
00:49:34.661 --> 00:49:37.810
<v Speaker 2>up there on the podium and just knocks</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fucking Dick into the dirt.</v>

1128
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Was this Hillary Clinton gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>humiliating $7,000 less than snookie for</v>

1129
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 2>speech at rutgers as her story grows</v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

1130
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she got,</v>

1131
00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:52.900
<v Speaker 2>she got a price slash to $25,000 I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of thrown under the bus.</v>

1132
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Her standard fee was $200,000 per</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

1133
00:49:56.170 --> 00:50:01.170
<v Speaker 2>but some folks suggested it may be her</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken record that set the recent slash</v>

1134
00:50:02.141 --> 00:50:06.010
<v Speaker 2>price of 25,000 she made so much money</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the Clinton Foundation.</v>

1135
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:08.470
<v Speaker 2>She's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1136
00:50:08.471 --> 00:50:12.220
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it for a thousand did I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking 100 million from that Haiti</v>

1137
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.590
<v Speaker 2>earthquake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you getting the but those people,</v>

1138
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.720
<v Speaker 2>people like her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things in the back of</v>

1139
00:50:16.721 --> 00:50:18.730
<v Speaker 2>their head is always the potential</v>
<v Speaker 2>litigation.</v>

1140
00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I think they're always want to stockpile</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal funds cause someone could always</v>

1141
00:50:22.481 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 2>come after them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you stop and think about the Clinton</v>

1142
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Foundation and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1143
00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:28.040

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1145
00:50:29.121 --> 00:50:30.850
<v Speaker 3>75 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1146
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:34.610

<v Speaker 3>their influence,</v>

1152
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.210
<v Speaker 3>if someone is in a position that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>could do that for a company and that</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

1158
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to pay $1,000 for a Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton Bro job other than for the</v>

1159
00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:13.370
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she didn't get a lot of money</v>

1160
00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:14.510
<v Speaker 3>for blow job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think so?</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'll do do a bit cocky for getting</v>

1164
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:27.230
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel this feels like a disrespectful</v>

1165
00:51:27.231 --> 00:51:29.110
<v Speaker 3>term we're taking with Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1166
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:30.770
<v Speaker 3>As a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget about it.</v>

1167
00:51:30.771 --> 00:51:32.600
<v Speaker 3>As a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as a politician,</v>

1168
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:35.240
<v Speaker 3>no one should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should just be impossible.</v>

1169
00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.490
<v Speaker 3>There's enough spirasi theory that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1170
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.220
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton's father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wrote him,</v>

1171
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:42.630
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming he's,</v>

1172
00:51:42.631 --> 00:51:47.631
<v Speaker 3>he's not alive anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a huge Jewish mob boss who is</v>

1173
00:51:48.381 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 3>responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 3>opium going into Chicago.</v>

1174
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes sense to me.</v>

1175
00:51:55.830 --> 00:52:00.440
<v Speaker 3>It look what we know for a fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>some politicians have run drugs before</v>

1176
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.630
<v Speaker 3>the bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the biggest one.</v>

1177
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:05.450
<v Speaker 3>The fucking Kennedy's open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open,</v>

1178
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:06.830
<v Speaker 3>flat out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1179
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:09.290
<v Speaker 3>it was moonshine at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But guess what?</v>

1180
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.620
<v Speaker 3>That's drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's as much of a drug worse than</v>

1181
00:52:12.621 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 3>wheat.</v>

1182
00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:14.390
<v Speaker 3>It's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way Worse.</v>

1183
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:17.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean that this how the Kennedy family</v>
<v Speaker 3>made their money.</v>

1184
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:21.470
<v Speaker 3>We needed a president to run marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How cool would that have Tommy Chong for</v>

1185
00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:22.910
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy Carter was like,</v>

1186
00:52:22.911 --> 00:52:25.640
<v Speaker 3>he was just doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just stuck to marijuana drug.</v>

1187
00:52:25.641 --> 00:52:27.320
<v Speaker 3>John for President Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got,</v>

1188
00:52:27.321 --> 00:52:31.430
<v Speaker 3>he's got diversity on his side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheech could be the running main cheech</v>

1189
00:52:31.431 --> 00:52:33.710
<v Speaker 3>and Chong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2020 guys get on it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>government was willing to do over over</v>

1192

<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1228
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.980
<v Speaker 3>People just naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to the government,</v>

1229
00:53:43.981 --> 00:53:46.920
<v Speaker 3>they know how corrupt they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know that they're willing to kill</v>

1230
00:53:46.921 --> 00:53:49.230
<v Speaker 3>their own people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know that the politicians aren't</v>

<v Speaker 3>waking up going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to make everyone's lives</v>

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:06.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm open to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it changes and the seagulls.</v>

1265
00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:11.430
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the way we are being programmed</v>

1266
00:55:11.431 --> 00:55:13.830
<v Speaker 3>in doctrinated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's genius.</v>

1267
00:55:13.831 --> 00:55:18.600
<v Speaker 3>It's working so God damn well because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>works on really smart people.</v>

1268
00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:21.090
<v Speaker 3>There's intelligent people all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

1269
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're invested in the system.</v>

1270
00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's invested in this</v>

1271
00:55:24.061 --> 00:55:26.910
<v Speaker 3>indoctrination that the school system</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1272
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>school really is designed to get your,</v>

1273
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:34.830
<v Speaker 3>take the kids from the family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the kids believe their teachers</v>

1274
00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:38.770
<v Speaker 3>more than their own parents and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it that the state takes your kid.</v>

1275
00:55:38.771 --> 00:55:40.440
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're raising their kids.</v>

1276
00:55:40.441 --> 00:55:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1277
00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.990
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1278
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.560
<v Speaker 3>I think most of what's going on in</v>
<v Speaker 3>schools is not that.</v>

1279
00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:50.340
<v Speaker 3>I think most of it is people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>just totally apathetic about teaching</v>

1280
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck.</v>

1281
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Most of these people that are teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it as a job.</v>

1282
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.170
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of terrible fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>teachers out there and they don't get</v>

1283
00:55:58.171 --> 00:55:59.004
<v Speaker 3>paid anything.</v>

1284
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.710
<v Speaker 3>And it's 30 conspiracy taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not taught.</v>

1285
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.540
<v Speaker 3>And told how to teach and what to show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like,</v>

1286
00:56:04.541 --> 00:56:06.870
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just give us your own versions of</v>

1287
00:56:06.871 --> 00:56:09.540
<v Speaker 3>English together with educators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get together to try to figure out a</v>

1288
00:56:09.541 --> 00:56:13.020
<v Speaker 3>way to get people to learn these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's uninspired.</v>

1289
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.850
<v Speaker 3>That's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than anything.</v>

1290
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 3>There's no money to a conspiracy theory</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the Rockefeller,</v>

1291
00:56:18.391 --> 00:56:23.391
<v Speaker 3>John Rockefeller and Carnegie designed</v>
<v Speaker 3>the school system to slaves and to</v>

1292
00:56:24.281 --> 00:56:26.680
<v Speaker 3>separate the family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the conspirators career?</v>

1293
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:29.410
<v Speaker 3>The conspiracy theories they designed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create workers,</v>

1294
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that are slaves to the system.</v>

1295
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:35.050
<v Speaker 3>The conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they openly said,</v>

1296
00:56:35.051 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't need any more philosophers are</v>

1297
00:56:39.101 --> 00:56:40.900
<v Speaker 3>geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got an offer that we,</v>

1298
00:56:40.901 --> 00:56:42.790
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got that and we got science right</v>

1299
00:56:42.791 --> 00:56:43.940
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got jenny sites.</v>

1300
00:56:43.941 --> 00:56:46.630
<v Speaker 3>You need come to us like w when was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>

1301
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:49.180
<v Speaker 3>what was the last science?</v>

1302
00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Great scientific discovery like in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last 40 years that wasn't government</v>

1303
00:56:53.591 --> 00:56:54.570
<v Speaker 3>funded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

1304
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:57.910
<v Speaker 3>there's no what their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's funding these studies.</v>

1305
00:56:57.911 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that they're government</v>
<v Speaker 3>funded?</v>

1306
00:56:59.321 --> 00:57:01.780
<v Speaker 3>Like some new shit they come out with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1307
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:02.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1308
00:57:02.711 --> 00:57:03.271
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1309
00:57:03.271 --> 00:57:04.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one can name anything.</v>

1310
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1311
00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:08.770
<v Speaker 3>we'd have to go over some of the styles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure a lot of them are not</v>

1312
00:57:08.771 --> 00:57:13.150
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming that most scientists are</v>

1313
00:57:13.151 --> 00:57:16.390
<v Speaker 3>getting paychecks from the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just assuming that I'm just,</v>

1314
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming that most scientific datas</v>

1315
00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.850
<v Speaker 3>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's coming from a bunch of scientists</v>

1316
00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:26.140
<v Speaker 3>who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are getting grants and they can't say</v>

1317
00:57:26.141 --> 00:57:27.460
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got it.</v>

1318
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.440
<v Speaker 3>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1319
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:32.280
<v Speaker 3>I sent you that one email that one guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>was telling me that there,</v>

1320
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he worked for a team of scientists and</v>

1321
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 3>they're working for pesticide company</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're told to the go,</v>

1322
00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:41.140
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do some studies here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want it to look like this and let's</v>

1323
00:57:41.141 --> 00:57:41.860
<v Speaker 3>keep doing it.</v>

1324
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Keep doing the studies until when we</v>
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>

1325
00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.280
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the worst they can do.</v>

1326
00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 3>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

1327
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:50.980
<v Speaker 3>They keep doing study until they get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>results they want and then they don't</v>

1328
00:57:50.981 --> 00:57:53.260
<v Speaker 3>publish the bad studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only published the good studies and</v>

1329
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:57.280
<v Speaker 3>this is what you have done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's basically in a</v>

1330
00:57:57.281 --> 00:57:59.110
<v Speaker 3>nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like three kinds of science.</v>

1331
00:57:59.111 --> 00:58:01.110
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the sign like pseudoscience.</v>

1332
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's pretend science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for sure it's not real.</v>

1333
00:58:04.031 --> 00:58:06.670
<v Speaker 3>It's false science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pseudo science and then there's the</v>

1334
00:58:06.671 --> 00:58:11.110
<v Speaker 3>scientific facts like for sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] it's a scientific fact that</v>

1335
00:58:11.111 --> 00:58:12.970
<v Speaker 3>I can get on the Internet with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone.</v>

1336
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:15.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to read a study about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

1337
00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:15.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

1338
00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:17.380
<v Speaker 3>I actually can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it.</v>

1339
00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:20.120
<v Speaker 3>My friends know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a scientific fact and other</v>

1340
00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:24.610
<v Speaker 3>scientific is my car will take me to</v>
<v Speaker 3>point a to point B to point c over and</v>

1341
00:58:24.611 --> 00:58:26.440
<v Speaker 3>over and it may break down every now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

1342
00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:27.570
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's us.</v>

1343
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.640
<v Speaker 3>The science of my car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that science,</v>

1344
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:34.030
<v Speaker 3>scientific facts and then there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>science that you,</v>

1345
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.040
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to take the scientist's word</v>

1346
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:39.790
<v Speaker 3>for it because there's no way that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can verify that if you have to take,</v>

1347
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.580
<v Speaker 3>do you have to have faith in science?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a religion.</v>

1348
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.260
<v Speaker 3>But scientism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on a second.</v>

1349
00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.660
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what particular kind of,</v>

1350
00:58:46.661 --> 00:58:49.060
<v Speaker 3>any kind of science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a medical science,</v>

1351
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.740
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>

1352
00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:55.030
<v Speaker 3>you have a choice to believe in science</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't verify yourself.</v>

1353
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.280
<v Speaker 3>You could believe it you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you'll have to believe it.</v>

1354
00:58:57.281 --> 00:58:59.620
<v Speaker 3>You could say experts in the field</v>
<v Speaker 3>verify it.</v>

1355
00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.840
<v Speaker 3>All the people that understood all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bop with all the,</v>

1356
00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.850
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the science that we know that though</v>

1357
00:59:03.851 --> 00:59:05.050
<v Speaker 3>had been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been corrupted.</v>

1358
00:59:05.051 --> 00:59:06.280
<v Speaker 3>Just the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1359
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 3>sugar science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1360
00:59:07.481 --> 00:59:09.760
<v Speaker 3>tobacco science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana science,</v>

1361
00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:13.960
<v Speaker 3>vaccine signs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know for sure all just those four</v>

1362
00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.750
<v Speaker 3>that there's been a lot of corruption</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's hard to trust.</v>

1363
00:59:16.751 --> 00:59:19.390
<v Speaker 3>So when someone comes out and especially</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government and NGOs,</v>

1364
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our scientists,</v>

1365
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 3>scientists say that it's safe</v>

1366
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:23.690
<v Speaker 1>and effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be like,</v>

1367
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:25.370
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

1368
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to just take your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>word for it.</v>

1369
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:28.970
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are criminals.</v>

1370
00:59:28.971 --> 00:59:31.010
<v Speaker 1>You're John Gotti and you guys are</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1371
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.840
<v Speaker 1>you guys are saying that this is safe</v>
<v Speaker 1>and effective.</v>

1372
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1373
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it is,</v>

1374
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:39.710
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know cause they can't prove it</v>

1375
00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:42.380
<v Speaker 1>for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes drugs that get past as being</v>

1376
00:59:42.381 --> 00:59:46.040
<v Speaker 1>safe and they turn out to not be exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with these studies.</v>

1377
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like when we were talking about</v>

1378
00:59:48.141 --> 00:59:51.590
<v Speaker 1>earlier with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to discuss the idea that</v>

1379
00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:54.380
<v Speaker 1>psychotropic drugs have played a part in</v>
<v Speaker 1>school shootings.</v>

1380
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 1>The salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very recent thing with human beings,</v>

1381
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.620
<v Speaker 1>the reason spike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're talking about the recent</v>

1382
01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 1>spike in shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even wet by people they know we're mass</v>

1383
01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:03.980
<v Speaker 1>shooters.</v>

1384
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Those people are almost all on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>pills,</v>

1385
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.320
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these pills are very recently big.</v>

1386
01:00:08.321 --> 01:00:09.740
<v Speaker 1>So when you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1387
01:00:09.741 --> 01:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>so when you're talking about just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of human beings involved in mass</v>

1388
01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:16.280
<v Speaker 1>killings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really recent.</v>

1389
01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Craze is ramping up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going crazy.</v>

1390
01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what also is ramping up</v>

1391
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.040
<v Speaker 1>people taking pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1392
01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>These things are somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they?</v>

1393
01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:26.210
<v Speaker 1>They might not be the cause of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% it might be society,</v>

1394
01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>it might be suppression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be terrible childhood rearing.</v>

1395
01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:35.360
<v Speaker 1>It might be childhood abuse in might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of like mental health issues</v>

1396
01:00:35.361 --> 01:00:38.330
<v Speaker 1>that are inherited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of crazy diseases that people</v>

1397
01:00:38.331 --> 01:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>inherit mental diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the vaccine pamphlets.</v>

1398
01:00:41.151 --> 01:00:46.151
<v Speaker 1>There's I think that HPV vaccine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like girls are taking it at 10 11 and 12</v>

1399
01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the shit that it says in the past,</v>

1400
01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>but there's not just one to one site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Possible side effect is suicidal</v>

1401
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>thoughts wanting to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called an one,</v>

1402
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>it's called impending doom.</v>

1403
01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:59.910
<v Speaker 5>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take your pills last night.</v>

1404
01:00:59.911 --> 01:01:01.710
<v Speaker 5>That documentary on Netflix that's been</v>
<v Speaker 5>going around.</v>

1405
01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:03.000
<v Speaker 5>How is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty good.</v>

1406
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:04.500
<v Speaker 5>There's not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot.</v>

1407
01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.200
<v Speaker 5>A lot of the adderall one isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>

1408
01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.110
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1409
01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:09.030
<v Speaker 5>So there's not a lot of information we</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't already know.</v>

1410
01:01:09.031 --> 01:01:11.670
<v Speaker 5>I feel like they just kind of compile it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and make it look really good.</v>

1411
01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.320
<v Speaker 5>But one interesting thing that you'd</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1412
01:01:13.321 --> 01:01:15.030
<v Speaker 5>he just brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A doctor says in it,</v>

1413
01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:20.250
<v Speaker 5>there's no side effects to pills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just unintended benefits or non</v>

1414
01:01:20.251 --> 01:01:22.380
<v Speaker 5>benefits that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all affects.</v>

1415
01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:25.050
<v Speaker 5>There's no like side effect of like</v>
<v Speaker 5>diarrhea for instance.</v>

1416
01:01:25.051 --> 01:01:27.900
<v Speaker 5>It's an effect of the pill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just wasn't what you wanted.</v>

1417
01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't call it the side effect.</v>

1418
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>An effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1419
01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So if he takes something and on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people it gives suicidal thoughts.</v>

1420
01:01:36.281 --> 01:01:38.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not a side effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an effect of taking that to</v>

1421
01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1422
01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>there's girls wanting to kill themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>for taking the HPV.</v>

1423
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>That's his dad for taking acne</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

1424
01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Accutane is a big that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1425
01:01:49.691 --> 01:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>do you know Andrew Santino?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious comedian.</v>

1426
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Funny Mother Fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took acutane when he was saying high</v>

1427
01:01:55.241 --> 01:01:56.200
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he said?</v>

1428
01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Said it was like the best thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever happened to him because his face</v>

1429
01:02:00.461 --> 01:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>totally cleared up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the worst thing that ever happened</v>

1430
01:02:02.531 --> 01:02:04.750
<v Speaker 1>to him in terms of like how it made them</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like,</v>

1431
01:02:04.751 --> 01:02:07.210
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me feel a lot of people get it</v>

1432
01:02:07.211 --> 01:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>and they get suicidal thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1433
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>

1434
01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:11.410
<v Speaker 1>So you got to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1435
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.610
<v Speaker 1>even if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether,</v>

1436
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>whether whether kids really are shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>up schools or it's a false flag in there</v>

1437
01:02:18.461 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>setting up the kids to</v>

1438
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.390
<v Speaker 2>do it with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other side.</v>

1439
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the,</v>

1440
01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:28.530
<v Speaker 2>the truth is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a gigantic problem with these</v>

1441
01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:31.310
<v Speaker 2>pills that are making people crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one really,</v>

1442
01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 2>this is not a big push to stop it or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1443
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 2>They're being protected there being</v>
<v Speaker 2>retired.</v>

1444
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.460
<v Speaker 2>There's a giant business in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's billions of dollars.</v>

1445
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also a lot of people that</v>

1446
01:02:40.411 --> 01:02:42.870
<v Speaker 2>liked those pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that loves</v>

1447
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:44.760
<v Speaker 2>xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is,</v>

1448
01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.230
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of those things where we</v>

1449
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:47.670
<v Speaker 2>always want to look at the bad side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1450
01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:50.670
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people love crack to crack</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1451
01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.190
<v Speaker 2>You could get thrown in jail for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1452
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:54.720
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1453
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:59.400
<v Speaker 2>But I mean people that are functional</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just how you like weed.</v>

1454
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I like weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people like Xanax.</v>

1455
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you can't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not my opinion.</v>

1456
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:05.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1457
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 2>that's not how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I am saying is like we need to be</v>

1458
01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:13.040
<v Speaker 2>honest about the consequences of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things and that this is somehow or</v>

1459
01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:16.410
<v Speaker 2>another left out of the equation when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's a major part of the equation.</v>

1460
01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:20.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's the only reason why</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are shooting up schools or any of</v>

1461
01:03:20.281 --> 01:03:23.010
<v Speaker 2>this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it absolutely must be</v>

1462
01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:26.940
<v Speaker 2>playing a factor and for whatever reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't want to consider that</v>

1463
01:03:26.941 --> 01:03:29.280
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think some of it is because</v>

1464
01:03:29.281 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people out there who</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked those pills.</v>

1465
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.320
<v Speaker 2>They liked the way they feel on</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants.</v>

1466
01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:36.540
<v Speaker 2>They liked the way they feel on anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety medication.</v>

1467
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:38.520
<v Speaker 2>They like take an ambien before they go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bed.</v>

1468
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.550
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like what it gives them.</v>

1469
01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I know people who can't sleep without</v>
<v Speaker 2>ambient,</v>

1470
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 2>they can't sleep without it.</v>

1471
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:49.710
<v Speaker 2>If you tried telling them that Ambien</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucks up your heart rate or does this to</v>

1472
01:03:49.711 --> 01:03:51.240
<v Speaker 2>that or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make up some things.</v>

1473
01:03:51.241 --> 01:03:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it fucks up your heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just saying that if you started</v>

1474
01:03:53.701 --> 01:03:56.670
<v Speaker 2>saying that to people they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would just immediately tune out</v>

1475
01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:58.530
<v Speaker 2>whatever dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sleeping like a baby.</v>

1476
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a great false flag is if they</v>

1477
01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:03.630
<v Speaker 2>set up another shooter and just said he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was totally stoned,</v>

1478
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way they could reversely because of</v>

1479
01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:10.350
<v Speaker 2>course nobody would buy the legalization</v>
<v Speaker 2>of weed of course to choke.</v>

1480
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1481
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:12.023
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1482
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:14.970
<v Speaker 2>what would I started smoking then</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed my mind.</v>

1483
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.530
<v Speaker 2>They have the power in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ted,</v>

1484
01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:19.590
<v Speaker 2>to turn it into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all of a sudden these guys are</v>

1485
01:04:19.591 --> 01:04:23.310
<v Speaker 2>getting really high in Colorado and in</v>

<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't work today.</v>

<v Speaker 2>now I understand rap music.</v>

1491
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these rappers are so aggressive,</v>

1492
01:04:36.151 --> 01:04:37.470
<v Speaker 2>but they're also high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1493
01:04:37.471 --> 01:04:41.310
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the God damn tobacco tobacco mixed</v>

1494
01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.650
<v Speaker 2>in with weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a different thing.</v>

1495
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little too potent.</v>

1496
01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's a little too woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're like,</v>

1497
01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:50.520
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we talking about?</v>

1498
01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I like it every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then I like to,</v>

1499
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.461
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what gives you a different kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of head buzz?</v>

1501
01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tobacco things,</v>

1502
01:04:57.281 --> 01:05:01.210

<v Speaker 2>he got me under dip when he was not a</v>

1503

<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done it since then,</v>

1504
01:05:02.491 --> 01:05:03.780
<v Speaker 2>but when we were in the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did it.</v>

1505
01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I swallowed some of it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one thing I liked about it,</v>

1506
01:05:06.901 --> 01:05:07.351
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1507
01:05:07.351 --> 01:05:09.090
<v Speaker 2>now I get why you guys do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1508
01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.030
<v Speaker 2>it hypes you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets you kind of like elevated,</v>

1509
01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:14.310
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you ever smoke a cigar?</v>

1510
01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a version of a cigarette.</v>

1511
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Like you're getting your time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some serious fucking nicotine.</v>

1512
01:05:22.121 --> 01:05:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Your system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you smoke a fat Stokey,</v>

1513
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:29.350
<v Speaker 2>you've got a big old fucking Hoyle de</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monterrey double corona and you're put</v>

1514
01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 2>out castle style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time you get to the end of that</v>

1515
01:05:31.571 --> 01:05:33.160
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your highest fuck dude.</v>

1516
01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.640
<v Speaker 2>You're not high like you can't talk or</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can't walk or you can't</v>

1517
01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:39.670
<v Speaker 2>function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're definitely feeling that</v>

1518
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:41.240
<v Speaker 2>tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're feel it's,</v>

1519
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:46.250
<v Speaker 2>it's doing something to your system and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say it actually has a cognitive</v>

1520
01:05:46.301 --> 01:05:51.301
<v Speaker 2>enhancing function that's similar to</v>
<v Speaker 2>nootropics and coffee as well that are</v>

1521
01:05:51.561 --> 01:05:51.910
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

1522
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 2>It actually can make you perform better</v>
<v Speaker 2>on tests if you smoked cigarettes or if</v>

1523
01:05:56.621 --> 01:06:00.400
<v Speaker 2>you smoke a cigar and writers always say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like I know a lot of people who</v>

1524
01:06:00.401 --> 01:06:02.500
<v Speaker 2>write like writers for sitcoms and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1525
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Those guys always smoked cigarettes when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they write and they say they can't write</v>

1526
01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:08.620
<v Speaker 2>without smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven King said that it's like their</v>

1527
01:06:08.621 --> 01:06:09.660
<v Speaker 2>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1528
01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.980
<v Speaker 2>well it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does have something going on men,</v>

1529
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:14.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's instead of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1530
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.950
<v Speaker 2>it's to me it's more like amped than it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is creative.</v>

1531
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.880
<v Speaker 2>We'd is super creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weed makes me think of thoughts while I</v>

1532
01:06:21.881 --> 01:06:24.040
<v Speaker 2>write them down on my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even claim that.</v>

1533
01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.350
<v Speaker 2>That's not even my thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's weeds thought.</v>

1534
01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:30.100
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would have never just leave me by</v>

1535
01:06:30.101 --> 01:06:32.980
<v Speaker 2>myself with no drugs in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a notebook.</v>

1536
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.510
<v Speaker 2>I would've never come up with that idea.</v>

1537
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:35.560
<v Speaker 2>But the weeds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1538
01:06:35.561 --> 01:06:38.230
<v Speaker 2>listen to this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1540
01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:45.160

1541
01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:47.650

1542
01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:48.540
<v Speaker 2>they write and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It could.</v>

1565
01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:02.280
<v Speaker 2>One hit of MDM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>MDM and Dma,</v>

1566
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I that always confuses me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>molly and said it's a lot easier.</v>

1567
01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:10.570
<v Speaker 2>One hit can change your taste in music</v>
<v Speaker 2>for ever,</v>

1568
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:13.810
<v Speaker 2>for ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it because before he ever did</v>

1569
01:08:13.811 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time I did it was 1997</v>

1570
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:21.070
<v Speaker 3>and before that I was a dj at this point</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I couldn't stand techno.</v>

1571
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:26.950
<v Speaker 3>I hated techno music so much and I was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dj and anytime a girl went on stage and</v>

1572
01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:28.040
<v Speaker 3>she was a technocrat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1573
01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:32.060
<v Speaker 3>this is because I played drums for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you listen to techno or house,</v>

1574
01:08:32.061 --> 01:08:36.050
<v Speaker 3>it's like that's the most basic dump</v>
<v Speaker 3>chute.</v>

1575
01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Every song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every fucking drum beat to Sam.</v>

1576
01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:43.910
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't accept it as a musician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most musicians feel that way about</v>

1577
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:45.410
<v Speaker 3>tech now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1578
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:49.160
<v Speaker 3>I went to a birthday party at the key</v>
<v Speaker 3>club in Hollywood and I walk in and</v>

1579
01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:53.900
<v Speaker 3>upstairs is techno and downstairs in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bottom club is hip hop and it was</v>

1580
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:55.580
<v Speaker 3>a birthday party and everyone was</v>
<v Speaker 3>downstairs.</v>

1581
01:08:55.581 --> 01:08:58.340
<v Speaker 3>And me and my buddy rick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we walk in and we're standing at the</v>

1582
01:08:58.341 --> 01:09:01.940
<v Speaker 3>edge of the techno floyd and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all these dudes just like dancing</v>

1583
01:09:01.941 --> 01:09:05.330
<v Speaker 3>by themselves or just like mental cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1584
01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.490
<v Speaker 3>And I was just standing there looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>him going,</v>

1585
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:10.640
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

1586
01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went downstairs or playing hip hop</v>

1587
01:09:13.431 --> 01:09:15.350
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I want to hear it at clubs.</v>

1588
01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:18.080
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear hip hop at a club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to dance with a girl,</v>

1589
01:09:18.081 --> 01:09:19.760

<v Speaker 3>passing around some molly.</v>

1591
01:09:23.661 --> 01:09:26.210
<v Speaker 3>And so say we want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll never forget that that first</v>

<v Speaker 3>Me and my buddy both took it and it hit</v>

1595
01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 3>us that that first hit just hits you</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking pile of bricks.</v>

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.250
<v Speaker 3>From that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't just like that night.</v>

1604
01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:57.280
<v Speaker 3>It changed my musical taste right in one</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit and I had a friend at the club,</v>

1605
01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.700
<v Speaker 3>it was a total rnb duty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hate a techno,</v>

1606
01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.670
<v Speaker 3>and he would talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I play tech and I got one day,</v>

1607
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.300
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do some modeling and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be all into technical.</v>

1608
01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That will never happen.</v>

1609
01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand this music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He starts dating the raver check like</v>

1610
01:10:12.651 --> 01:10:14.930
<v Speaker 3>six months later at the club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some raver chick,</v>

1611
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.900
<v Speaker 3>he ends up at a ray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ends up dropping some molly,</v>

1612
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:21.620
<v Speaker 3>he starts coming in and bringing all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these new tech note cds and he's all</v>

1613
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:24.770
<v Speaker 3>into full blown in the transit tech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1614
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:26.410
<v Speaker 3>just one hint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the real,</v>

1615
01:10:26.411 --> 01:10:26.480
<v Speaker 3>real</v>

1616
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.800
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal,</v>

1617
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.000
<v Speaker 2>so when you get it from someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what the fuck you're</v>

1618
01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:31.840
<v Speaker 2>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem with molly.</v>

1619
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.190
<v Speaker 2>This is a real problem with Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the dosage.</v>

1620
01:10:34.191 --> 01:10:35.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the dosage is</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be.</v>

1621
01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can overdose on alcohol and</v>

1622
01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:40.910
<v Speaker 2>alcohol's everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody knows what the dose of</v>

1623
01:10:40.911 --> 01:10:43.550
<v Speaker 2>alcohol is was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to a bar and you get a shot of</v>

1624
01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Jack Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what that is?</v>

1625
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:47.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not like sometimes you get a shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Dac,</v>

1626
01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Jen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack Daniels in his Jack Daniels.</v>

1627
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you get it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's super fucking moonshine is 10 times</v>

1628
01:10:53.991 --> 01:10:56.960
<v Speaker 2>stronger and you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with heroin.</v>

1629
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with a lot of things,</v>

1630
01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:02.180
<v Speaker 2>the real problem with Mtma seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's illegal.</v>

1631
01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.240
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem and what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding is that there's great benefits</v>

1632
01:11:07.371 --> 01:11:08.540
<v Speaker 2>if it's used correctly.</v>

1633
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:10.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything can be abused,</v>

1634
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:13.320
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean we should make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal and what they want to do.</v>

1635
01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:16.860
<v Speaker 2>I think their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their timeline is somewhere around 2021</v>

1636
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.190
<v Speaker 2>making it legal for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for therapy.</v>

1637
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:23.190
<v Speaker 2>It's going to change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to change everything.</v>

1638
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:26.640
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna change the way people feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the past is going to change the</v>

1639
01:11:26.641 --> 01:11:29.820
<v Speaker 2>way people interact with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to know just by people's</v>

1640
01:11:29.821 --> 01:11:31.480
<v Speaker 2>behavior whether or not they've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>done it right.</v>

1641
01:11:31.481 --> 01:11:34.140
<v Speaker 2>You know where it comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where MTMA comes from?</v>

1642
01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The act of ingredient that takes you a,</v>

1643
01:11:38.581 --> 01:11:40.740
<v Speaker 2>that just plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1644
01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Where's that plan at the of Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy wars over Thailand or</v>

1645
01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Cambodia in Cambodia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the bark,</v>

1646
01:11:50.161 --> 01:11:53.100
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about the like the root of a</v>

1647
01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:54.480
<v Speaker 2>tree trunk or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1648
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.760
<v Speaker 2>So it has something to do with a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James pulling it up,</v>

1649
01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:58.890
<v Speaker 2>but it becomes very dangerous for those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1650
01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all that the trafficking becomes</v>

1651
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:01.860
<v Speaker 2>crazies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:05.340
<v Speaker 2>They fuck up for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for us being chopped down of just,</v>

1653
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:07.710
<v Speaker 2>just for the people being murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1654
01:12:07.711 --> 01:12:09.790
<v Speaker 2>it's heavy duty stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sassafras.</v>

1655
01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:11.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1656
01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I googled it and just look at images and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's popping up.</v>

1657
01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was a place Mtma Cambodia</v>
<v Speaker 2>trees.</v>

1658
01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sassafras.</v>

1659
01:12:20.281 --> 01:12:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that is Sassafras and SEF.</v>

1660
01:12:22.531 --> 01:12:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Rolly Sassafras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1661
01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:27.090
<v Speaker 2>I guess it Sassafras Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whatever,</v>

1662
01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:30.570
<v Speaker 2>whatever that plan is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take the see if that just google</v>

<v Speaker 2>cause I'm pretty sure vice to this.</v>

1665
01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:38.760
<v Speaker 2>But could you go with that please?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a vice had a special on that.</v>

1666
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.210
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what would happen if he just</v>
<v Speaker 2>ate it raw.</v>

1667
01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you do that?</v>

1668
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:47.610
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1669
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a special,</v>

1670
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:51.303
<v Speaker 2>what does it say?</v>

1671
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:55.080
<v Speaker 2>The truth about ecstasy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:12:55.081 --> 01:12:58.930
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of a vice episode</v>

1673
01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.910
<v Speaker 2>where they grow this stuff anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1674
01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:06.640
<v Speaker 2>this should be something that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed by criminals were in ski</v>

1675
01:13:06.641 --> 01:13:09.760
<v Speaker 2>masks like you've seen in this video</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be something distributed by</v>

1676
01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:12.790
<v Speaker 2>stores and they should be doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you wanted it,</v>

1677
01:13:12.791 --> 01:13:15.420
<v Speaker 2>you could have a rave where you even</v>
<v Speaker 2>have medical centers in the rave.</v>

1678
01:13:15.421 --> 01:13:20.421
<v Speaker 2>We keep people from overdosing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>transitionary period from people going</v>

1679
01:13:20.651 --> 01:13:24.040
<v Speaker 2>from drugs being totally illegal to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

1680
01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:25.840
<v Speaker 2>having massive benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're,</v>

1681
01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.070
<v Speaker 2>you go to a club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1682
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.650
<v Speaker 2>And everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1683
01:13:28.690 --> 01:13:29.620
<v Speaker 2>c'mon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing shots,</v>

1684
01:13:29.621 --> 01:13:31.570
<v Speaker 2>were doing shots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole fucking bars getting wasted</v>

1685
01:13:31.571 --> 01:13:33.190
<v Speaker 2>and drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's fine with that.</v>

1686
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:36.490
<v Speaker 2>But you're not fine with a club where</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody does a small amount of</v>

1687
01:13:36.491 --> 01:13:37.470
<v Speaker 2>ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1688
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.890
<v Speaker 2>why can't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1689
01:13:38.891 --> 01:13:39.701
<v Speaker 2>that's drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1690
01:13:39.701 --> 01:13:40.660
<v Speaker 2>the other one's drugs too.</v>

1691
01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.990
<v Speaker 2>He just used to those drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once we get past that hurdle,</v>

1692
01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.930
<v Speaker 2>and it might take a whole generation</v>
<v Speaker 2>before people get used to places where</v>

1693
01:13:46.931 --> 01:13:48.790
<v Speaker 2>you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one drug gets you violent,</v>

1694
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:51.910
<v Speaker 2>one drug makes you want to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So listen,</v>

1695
01:13:51.911 --> 01:13:53.860
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to stop that drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my point.</v>

1696
01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:56.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really useful drug.</v>

1697
01:13:56.410 --> 01:13:58.750
<v Speaker 2>People going to find out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing experience.</v>

1698
01:13:58.751 --> 01:14:01.450
<v Speaker 2>They're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the best way to handle that?</v>

1699
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Best way to handle is make it safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it legal,</v>

1700
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:07.930
<v Speaker 2>make it regulated so they know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually is in each one of these fucking</v>

1701
01:14:07.931 --> 01:14:10.150
<v Speaker 2>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting it from some pimp or</v>

1702

<v Speaker 2>some asshole or some fucking crazy dude</v>
<v Speaker 2>is stuffed in a balloon.</v>

1703
01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Put it up his ass hole and made it</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the border with it.</v>

1704
01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.100
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where the fuck you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting this stuff.</v>

1705
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:22.240
<v Speaker 2>All sorts of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amphetamines and all sorts of crazy</v>

1706
01:14:22.241 --> 01:14:23.860
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people die from it because they</v>

1707
01:14:23.861 --> 01:14:25.810
<v Speaker 2>don't know what the fuck is in there.</v>

1717
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:51.250
<v Speaker 2>trunk of the exceptionally rare plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1718
01:14:51.251 --> 01:14:54.190
<v Speaker 2>they're really rare trees to wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that?</v>

1719
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:56.650
<v Speaker 2>How many of these fucking trees or like</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the rain forest and we</v>

1720
01:14:56.651 --> 01:14:58.030
<v Speaker 2>don't know about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1721
01:14:58.330 --> 01:14:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>

1722
01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:01.510
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be some shit where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't tapped into it yet.</v>

1723
01:15:01.511 --> 01:15:04.920
<v Speaker 2>They're finding all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical drugs that they can</v>

1724
01:15:04.921 --> 01:15:06.380
<v Speaker 2>cocked out of stuff.</v>

1725
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.140
<v Speaker 2>The transplants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they buy Amazon.</v>

1726
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find all the</v>

1727
01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:16.320
<v Speaker 2>insects are evolving so fast and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon that they only have names for I</v>

1728
01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:21.331
<v Speaker 2>think 90% 10% of the insects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90% they have no names.</v>

1729
01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:22.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1730
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have all sorts of bugs and the</v>

1731
01:15:24.071 --> 01:15:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Amazon for sure that they have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>identified,</v>

1732
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:27.970
<v Speaker 2>they know that for a fact and they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve.</v>

1733
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:31.910
<v Speaker 2>They're rare thing where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like some primitive life forms</v>

1734
01:15:31.911 --> 01:15:33.700
<v Speaker 2>that you could find that didn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1735
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Like they found this crayfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in India or Europe,</v>

1736
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crayfish that produces by cloning.</v>

1737
01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.210
<v Speaker 2>They don't have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So female,</v>

1738
01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:47.400
<v Speaker 2>they're all female and one crayfish just</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a bunch of other babies.</v>

1739
01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:50.740
<v Speaker 2>It just makes babies just need sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1740
01:15:50.741 --> 01:15:53.500
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously there's no genetic</v>

1741
01:15:53.501 --> 01:15:54.820
<v Speaker 2>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1742
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Cause they obviously would need a male</v>
<v Speaker 2>DNA.</v>

1743
01:15:57.890 --> 01:15:59.590
<v Speaker 2>It makes it the female DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

1744
01:15:59.591 --> 01:16:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Mute and crayfish clones itself and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking over Europe.</v>

1745
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:07.620
<v Speaker 2>So this crayfish doesn't fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just reproduce like one crayfish</v>

1746
01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:10.960
<v Speaker 2>could just reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really bananas.</v>

1747
01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:13.900
<v Speaker 2>So this is a new thing that didn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 years ago.</v>

1748
01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:17.710
<v Speaker 2>This is something that they're very sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a,</v>

1749
01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:21.100
<v Speaker 2>a living organism up until recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the good thing.</v>

1750
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Crayfish are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are starving to death.</v>

1751
01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Now they've got some mother fuckers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is just throw some</v>

1752
01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:28.210
<v Speaker 2>stuff in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to count on them.</v>

1753
01:16:28.211 --> 01:16:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's the same stuff that made the</v>

1754
01:16:30.611 --> 01:16:32.860
<v Speaker 2>frogs gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be,</v>

1755
01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.550
<v Speaker 2>could be bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's linked.</v>

1756
01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>

1757
01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be pesticides,</v>

1758
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.513
<v Speaker 2>it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1759
01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.560
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another thing about the amount</v>

1760
01:16:41.561 --> 01:16:44.860
<v Speaker 2>of people that flush pills down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>toilet and how much that shit goes to</v>

1761
01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:46.790
<v Speaker 2>water treatment plants and into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1762
01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.080
<v Speaker 2>aqueducts and reservoirs and shit.</v>

1763
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of pills that get flushed</v>

1764
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:56.140
<v Speaker 2>down our toilets and some of them make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it into rivers and shit.</v>

1765
01:16:56.141 --> 01:16:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Some of them making it to the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's supposed to be</v>

1766
01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:01.150
<v Speaker 2>particularly bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about this until a</v>

1767
01:17:01.151 --> 01:17:03.850
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine who was a surfer told me</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a yoga teacher,</v>

1768
01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:07.210
<v Speaker 2>was a surfer and said nobody told him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he got real sick cause he went into</v>

1769
01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:10.910
<v Speaker 2>the ocean right after the rain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't go to the ocean after the rain</v>

1770
01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.210
<v Speaker 2>because when it rains in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that bullshit,</v>

1771
01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:19.360
<v Speaker 2>all the chemicals and toxins and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaners and oil and gasoline and</v>

1772
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 2>plastic washes into the water like right</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the shore.</v>

1773
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:26.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's where it's all just swashing</v>
<v Speaker 2>around in there with the waves and you</v>

1774
01:17:26.871 --> 01:17:30.860
<v Speaker 2>get in there and you get sick as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're basically getting poisoned.</v>

1775
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Is there some kind of filtration system</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they just let all the water just</v>

1776
01:17:36.021 --> 01:17:38.240
<v Speaker 2>run right and right is right from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>streets,</v>

1777
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:41.950
<v Speaker 2>from the runoff just from the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

1778
01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:45.170
<v Speaker 2>where does the toilet water go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that water goes through a sewage</v>

1779
01:17:45.171 --> 01:17:48.740
<v Speaker 2>system that goes through a sanitation</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1780
01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.140
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes those break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>

1781
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:54.650
<v Speaker 2>at the Charles River in Boston once and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

1782
01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:57.380
<v Speaker 2>it was like right across the street from</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I lived and I'd hang out there all</v>

1783
01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:00.920
<v Speaker 2>the time when I was a kid and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing there on the shore and I saw</v>

1784
01:18:00.921 --> 01:18:04.940
<v Speaker 2>these bubbles and like these chunks of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things floating up to the water.</v>

1785
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.590
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>

1786
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:10.250
<v Speaker 2>And then I saw condom bloke come up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

1787
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.450
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a sewer pipe death,</v>

1788
01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:17.600
<v Speaker 2>flushing condoms and like shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>condom water.</v>

1789
01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:21.740
<v Speaker 2>It's coming right through the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground into this river where all these</v>

1790
01:18:21.741 --> 01:18:23.930
<v Speaker 2>fish lift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fish are probably living off a</v>

1791
01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:27.320
<v Speaker 2>human shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the water like after the s the</v>

1792
01:18:27.321 --> 01:18:29.630
<v Speaker 2>sewage water runs through the filtration</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1793
01:18:29.690 --> 01:18:31.700
<v Speaker 2>What does that water perfect and where</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it go?</v>

1794
01:18:31.701 --> 01:18:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Fiji puddles that does it go into 99 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>99 for eight ounces.</v>

1795
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Based on what I saw online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like Fiji water is the best</v>

1796
01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:43.310
<v Speaker 2>water out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they took,</v>

1797
01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:48.170
<v Speaker 2>they tested a lot of bottled water and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of bottled water has a lot of</v>

1798
01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.760
<v Speaker 2>bullshit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

1799
01:18:49.761 --> 01:18:52.220
<v Speaker 2>After 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston's Charles River just became</v>

1800
01:18:52.221 --> 01:18:56.060
<v Speaker 2>swimmable again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took $500 million in nearly two decades</v>

1801
01:18:56.061 --> 01:18:58.100
<v Speaker 2>of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's how the city did it.</v>

1802
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:59.000
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1803
01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:02.450
<v Speaker 2>That was the river that's connected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>over that river.</v>

1804
01:19:02.451 --> 01:19:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Went all the way down near my house.</v>

1805
01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Why would you say the polluted people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are gross?</v>

1806
01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:08.481
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1807
01:19:08.481 --> 01:19:11.540
<v Speaker 2>when and people started building shit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 18 hundreds it didn't give a fuck</v>

1808
01:19:11.541 --> 01:19:14.350
<v Speaker 2>about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took that sewer pipe and just lay</v>

1809
01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.300
<v Speaker 2>it right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop it right into the fucking ocean.</v>

1810
01:19:17.301 --> 01:19:19.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna take a shit right in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

1811
01:19:19.011 --> 01:19:22.490
<v Speaker 2>It's going to go shooting down at pipe</v>
<v Speaker 2>and drop right in a fish's head.</v>

1812
01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't give a fuck when they were</v>

1813
01:19:24.261 --> 01:19:26.600
<v Speaker 2>building things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have all their industrial</v>

1814
01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:28.400
<v Speaker 2>runoff just go right into rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They taught,</v>

1815
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:31.940
<v Speaker 2>they polluted thousands of rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who the fuck knows how many fish</v>

1816
01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:34.160
<v Speaker 2>died?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because people in the early days of the</v>

1817
01:19:34.161 --> 01:19:36.200
<v Speaker 2>industrial revolution were fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>assholes.</v>

1818
01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.030
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have any consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>

1819
01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:41.870
<v Speaker 2>they didn't think about the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>of completely destroying the</v>

1820
01:19:41.871 --> 01:19:44.630
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that didn't exist before the age of</v>

1821
01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:47.510
<v Speaker 2>the industrial machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time it existed before that was</v>

1822
01:19:47.511 --> 01:19:51.920
<v Speaker 2>in dead bodies would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would pollute rivers systems after war.</v>

1823
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when people would throw bodies into</v>

1824
01:19:55.941 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 2>rivers like that would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1825
01:19:57.681 --> 01:20:00.590
<v Speaker 2>that would fuck up people's wells that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would fuck up.</v>

1826
01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:01.221
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1827
01:20:01.221 --> 01:20:02.840
<v Speaker 2>any drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What people got real sick.</v>

1828
01:20:02.841 --> 01:20:04.210
<v Speaker 2>How did king's Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Once you google it,</v>

1835

<v Speaker 1>She would just find Jamie,</v>

1844
01:20:45.031 --> 01:20:47.610

<v Speaker 1>A thunder mug.</v>

1845
01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

1846
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

1847
01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure.</v>

1848
01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1849
01:20:54.001 --> 01:20:57.240
<v Speaker 1>This is a for the 16 hundreds that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he shit into.</v>

1850
01:20:57.810 --> 01:21:00.870
<v Speaker 1>That's why I say is this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespearian chamber pot,</v>

1851
01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:05.900
<v Speaker 1>not the bards own thunder Mug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is a typical chamber pot and</v>

1852
01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.500
<v Speaker 1>that's what they would call them chamber</v>
<v Speaker 1>pots.</v>

1853
01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:12.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's a potty shit in like literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit in a pot that looks sturdy.</v>

1854
01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.880
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really like a toilet bowl.</v>

1855
01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:17.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like a toilet bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't have water in it.</v>

1856
01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they've left water in it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it easier to clean up next to it?</v>

1857
01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Probably smarter to have water in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you plop in the water?</v>

1858
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you get a couple of slaves and</v>

1859
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:27.410
<v Speaker 1>pull it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dumping your good luck.</v>

1860
01:21:27.411 --> 01:21:31.230
<v Speaker 1>If you ever have to take a shit on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane and you see how little water there</v>

1861
01:21:31.231 --> 01:21:33.810
<v Speaker 1>is and that little thing that you drop</v>
<v Speaker 1>in logs into,</v>

1862
01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:35.850
<v Speaker 1>and then when you flush it never gets it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1863
01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:37.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to think,</v>

1864
01:21:37.801 --> 01:21:39.990

<v Speaker 1>shitting in the streets.</v>

1879

01:22:48.361 --> 01:22:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to speak out of turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure it was just the best city</v>

1891
01:22:51.331 --> 01:22:53.670
<v Speaker 1>for homeless people for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They let people do whatever the fuck</v>

01:22:53.671 --> 01:22:55.620
<v Speaker 1>they want and that city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so nice.</v>

1893
01:22:55.830 --> 01:23:00.000
<v Speaker 1>It's so open minded and they feel so</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty because they made $1 billion from</v>

1894
01:23:00.001 --> 01:23:02.370
<v Speaker 1>like brazzers.com or some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1895
01:23:02.371 --> 01:23:04.440
<v Speaker 1>they take the bait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that tech money,</v>

1896
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's different kind of</v>

1897
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.340
<v Speaker 2>money there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so liberal in comparison to like</v>

1898
01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street banker type dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those dudes are like cut throat,</v>

1899
01:23:13.591 --> 01:23:16.090
<v Speaker 2>right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like private jet.</v>

1900
01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you Minko big watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go cow,</v>

1901
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:23.500
<v Speaker 2>cow doing coke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the money on the other side,</v>

1902
01:23:23.501 --> 01:23:25.000
<v Speaker 2>like the tech money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all like,</v>

1903
01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:26.890
<v Speaker 2>well diversity is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1904
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 2>and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to be represented in tech and</v>

1905
01:23:30.041 --> 01:23:32.920
<v Speaker 2>this is their space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the space for them to,</v>

1906
01:23:33.010 --> 01:23:35.230
<v Speaker 2>we need to let them know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to encourage that.</v>

1907
01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so left way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're like these homeless people,</v>

1908
01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.350
<v Speaker 2>they also be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because they don't have an address</v>

1909
01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:43.990
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean this city is not equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1910
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:47.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to help them and offer aid</v>

1911
01:23:47.770 --> 01:23:51.580
<v Speaker 2>crackheads just taking diarrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>splatter shifts against walls.</v>

1912
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I think they just let these people get</v>
<v Speaker 2>away with,</v>

1913
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:58.000
<v Speaker 2>they were fucking mentally ill people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just let them wander around</v>

1914
01:23:58.001 --> 01:23:59.770
<v Speaker 2>through their streets cause they really</v>
<v Speaker 2>cared.</v>

1915
01:23:59.770 --> 01:24:01.480
<v Speaker 2>You know what they would do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

1916
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:04.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really put some money into taking care</v>

1917
01:24:04.481 --> 01:24:06.430
<v Speaker 2>of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just letting them wander around the</v>

1918
01:24:06.431 --> 01:24:07.540
<v Speaker 2>streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitting all over the place.</v>

1919
01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Have a place where you can get them</v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes from the salvation army or</v>

1920
01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:12.220
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a place where you'd give him</v>

1921
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:15.250
<v Speaker 2>regular showers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have something that's like appealing</v>

1922
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:18.340
<v Speaker 2>they can go to all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you keep them from just shitting on</v>

1923
01:24:18.341 --> 01:24:20.680
<v Speaker 2>the streets in front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's crazy.</v>

1924
01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Billy Corgan had a residency in San</v>
<v Speaker 2>Francisco of up maybe eight years ago</v>

1925
01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.130
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all about him just writing songs</v>

1926
01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:33.610
<v Speaker 2>on the spot and then going on stage that</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and doing brand new songs.</v>

1927
01:24:33.611 --> 01:24:38.611

<v Speaker 2>And he had this one song that he wrote</v>

1928
01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:40.760
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just hanging out in the park in San</v>

1929
01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Francisco and just wrote about the bums</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how disgusting it all was and called</v>

1930

1931
01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Excellent song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of his greatest songs.</v>

1932
01:24:49.121 --> 01:24:51.490
<v Speaker 2>It's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the bums.</v>

1933
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:55.060
<v Speaker 2>There's so many men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to run into him all the time.</v>

1934
01:24:55.061 --> 01:24:58.120
<v Speaker 2>When we did gigs in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd go out to eat and you'd have to do</v>

1935
01:24:58.121 --> 01:25:02.470
<v Speaker 2>like this bomb obstacle course on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to the restaurant.</v>

01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:12.340
<v Speaker 2>but isn't that better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's better than the opposite.</v>

1943
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:13.120
<v Speaker 2>It's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1944
01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good to live in a place</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this tolerance as possible.</v>

1945
01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:20.641
<v Speaker 2>Even if the super lefties get annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want the opposite to see they</v>

1946
01:25:20.831 --> 01:25:24.880
<v Speaker 2>might fuck up because there's the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of mentality that goes on with</v>

1947
01:25:24.881 --> 01:25:28.480
<v Speaker 2>people on the far left and people on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>far right and that mentality is my way's</v>

1948
01:25:28.481 --> 01:25:29.110
<v Speaker 2>the right way.</v>

1949
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're wrong.</v>

1950
01:25:30.131 --> 01:25:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make you change.</v>

1951
01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make you do what and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>

1952
01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:37.870
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't work on anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always feel like it's safer and</v>

1953
01:25:37.871 --> 01:25:42.871
<v Speaker 2>better when that's happening towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kindness and compassion and income</v>

1954
01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:47.020
<v Speaker 2>equality and all these things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see like even though it gets very</v>

1955
01:25:47.021 --> 01:25:50.890
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that at least it has like a good</v>

1956
01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:53.530
<v Speaker 2>heart to it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even if it's misguided,</v>

1957
01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.470
<v Speaker 2>some of it's missing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some is misguided or even if they're</v>

1958
01:25:56.471 --> 01:25:58.690
<v Speaker 2>pretending did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always that.</v>

1959
01:25:58.930 --> 01:25:59.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1960
01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:02.380
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to pretend you pretend</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the left,</v>

1961
01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was some money.</v>

1962
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could steal all sorts of tax money.</v>

1963
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:08.084
<v Speaker 3>Just pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1964
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:10.460
<v Speaker 1>you're helping people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely a lot of that going</v>

1965
01:26:10.461 --> 01:26:11.780
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1966
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:13.370

<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

2016
01:28:08.271 --> 01:28:10.430
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like usually you tell Dana</v>

2017
01:28:10.431 --> 01:28:11.061
<v Speaker 3>described it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:28:11.061 --> 01:28:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Usually you tear your lcl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>MCL usually cause I've,</v>

2019
01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:18.410
<v Speaker 3>I've done my mcl before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It repairs on its own so thick according</v>

2020
01:28:18.411 --> 01:28:20.750
<v Speaker 3>to what the doctors tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit,</v>

2021
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:23.510

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2022
01:28:23.511 --> 01:28:26.330
<v Speaker 3>but you need to tell your meniscus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You probably need surgery for that or</v>

2023
01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:28.820
<v Speaker 3>you tear your acl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you for sure need surgery for that.</v>

2028
01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.620
<v Speaker 3>the only time we need surgery is if it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking blown the fuck out.</v>

2029
01:28:39.621 --> 01:28:44.260

<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2032
01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:49.770

<v Speaker 3>He didn't give a fuck.</v>

2033
01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:51.690
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't let him fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted a fight.</v>

2036
01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.110
<v Speaker 1>This is what Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dana was saying.</v>

2037
01:28:59.111 --> 01:29:02.250

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2040

<v Speaker 1>It's doomed.</v>

2045
01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Dana White said he would never put that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight on again.</v>

2046
01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

01:29:44.851 --> 01:29:45.511
<v Speaker 1>Someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2057
01:29:45.511 --> 01:29:46.800
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just did an interview and he,</v>

2058
01:29:47.010 --> 01:29:49.980
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a hinton like oil.</v>

2059
01:29:49.981 --> 01:29:54.270
<v Speaker 1>He said it and sell it in such a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Tony is going to get stripped of</v>

2060
01:29:54.271 --> 01:29:55.104
<v Speaker 1>his belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2061
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:56.610
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

2062
01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone is the champ,</v>

2063
01:29:59.110 --> 01:30:01.350
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get injured and they can't</v>

2064
01:30:01.351 --> 01:30:03.330
<v Speaker 1>defend their title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they have an interim title.</v>

2065
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the interim guy gets injured and</v>

2066
01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:09.630
<v Speaker 1>can't defend the interim title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they strip the end?</v>

2067
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Is that ever happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Whittaker,</v>

2068
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.890
<v Speaker 1>he loses interim lightweight title when</v>
<v Speaker 1>number grumet often hallway square off.</v>

2069
01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:20.310
<v Speaker 1>So I guess they're taking the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do that.</v>

2070
01:30:20.370 --> 01:30:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't do that to Robert Whitaker.</v>

2071
01:30:21.781 --> 01:30:23.400
<v Speaker 1>He was the interim interim champion.</v>

2072
01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Should they have an interim interim?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2073
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I dunno man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2074
01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:32.790
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like they let the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whitaker take 11 months off to recover.</v>

2075
01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Why would they do the exact same thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the exact same situation.</v>

2076
01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Robert Whitaker was fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the interim,</v>

2077
01:30:40.890 --> 01:30:43.230
<v Speaker 1>or he had the interim title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going to fight,</v>

2078
01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was either,</v>

2079
01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he got injured.</v>

2080
01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:52.680
<v Speaker 1>They didn't strip him right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they strip Antonio.</v>

2081
01:30:52.890 --> 01:30:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like it's punishment for him</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting injured a week out?</v>

2082
01:30:57.211 --> 01:30:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Like they're pissed and like fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripped them?</v>

2083
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2084
01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2085
01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:03.590
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that so.</v>

2086
01:31:03.630 --> 01:31:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he got heat.</v>

2087
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Did Tony wanted to fight more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody?</v>

2088
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:12.000
<v Speaker 1>We've got to buy what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if he happens four weeks ago and</v>

2089
01:31:12.001 --> 01:31:15.120
<v Speaker 1>it's an injury and training and he tears</v>
<v Speaker 1>it from the bone,</v>

2090
01:31:15.630 --> 01:31:18.240
<v Speaker 1>is that they just rescheduled the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2091
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's still for the interim title.</v>

2092
01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Why is it like a week out the interim is</v>
<v Speaker 1>canceled?</v>

2093
01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because they have to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big fight with Max Holloway versus could</v>

2094
01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:33.060
<v Speaker 1>be before the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like that cost that cost Tony</v>

2095
01:31:33.061 --> 01:31:35.550
<v Speaker 1>a lot of money because he has the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interim belt.</v>

2096
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:37.890
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2097
01:31:37.891 --> 01:31:41.190
<v Speaker 1>this was going to be by far is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest pay day ever for him.</v>

2098
01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was making some good money.</v>

2099
01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because of the belt.</v>

2100
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Because if you strip him his next fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have that belt anymore to,</v>

2101
01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.940
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get money,</v>

2102
01:31:51.330 --> 01:31:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he'll get significantly less</v>

2103
01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:55.620
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say what if you don't have a belt?</v>

2104
01:31:55.621 --> 01:31:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let if what if Max or could be wins,</v>

2105
01:31:58.111 --> 01:31:59.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them I assume is going to win</v>

2106
01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:03.940
<v Speaker 1>whoever wanted is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Tony gets healthy and then</v>

2107
01:32:03.941 --> 01:32:06.670
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have tony fight one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys for the title.</v>

2108
01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Like he would get less than he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have for this fight if he doesn't have</v>

2109
01:32:10.991 --> 01:32:12.670
<v Speaker 1>the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2110
01:32:12.671 --> 01:32:16.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of the contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a bet with you are going to</v>

2111
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:20.410
<v Speaker 1>negotiate for a fight and you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>belt,</v>

2112
01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:23.140
<v Speaker 1>you have way more power than if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a belt.</v>

2113
01:32:23.190 --> 01:32:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by stripping them of the belt,</v>

2114
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:27.340
<v Speaker 1>his next fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he heals up and comes back,</v>

2115
01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:30.000
<v Speaker 1>he's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to cost them.</v>

2116
01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's not fair because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Winokur didn't get stripped of</v>

2117
01:32:34.421 --> 01:32:37.060
<v Speaker 1>his interim belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should Max Holloway and Khabib,</v>

2118
01:32:37.061 --> 01:32:37.894
<v Speaker 1>she'd just fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

2119
01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:39.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a main event fight.</v>

2120
01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be for a belt because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna Fuck Tony.</v>

2121
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would it fuck Tony if he still gets</v>

2122
01:32:45.551 --> 01:32:48.160
<v Speaker 1>the interim title?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he kept the interim title,</v>

2123
01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:51.640
<v Speaker 1>then it wouldn't fuck exactly for his</v>
<v Speaker 1>next fight when he negotiates for his</v>

2124
01:32:51.641 --> 01:32:55.550
<v Speaker 1>next fight hung and he would be interim</v>
<v Speaker 1>title holder versus world title holder.</v>

2125
01:32:56.050 --> 01:32:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Why does Max Maxon and could be and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight for a bell?</v>

2126
01:32:59.201 --> 01:33:02.950
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be for a belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The UFC holds all the cards.</v>

2127
01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:05.410
<v Speaker 1>They can make up the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do whatever they want when it</v>

2128
01:33:05.411 --> 01:33:07.000
<v Speaker 1>comes to the rankings and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2129
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:09.490
<v Speaker 1>They can't do it or whatever they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to rules.</v>

2130
01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:12.790
<v Speaker 1>So with their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their position,</v>

2131
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:13.810
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2132
01:33:13.810 --> 01:33:15.760
<v Speaker 1>this is going to cost us shitload of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2133
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.740
<v Speaker 1>How do we recover?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recoup that money?</v>

2134
01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:19.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we a,</v>

2135
01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:20.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get Holloway to fight.</v>

2136
01:33:20.530 --> 01:33:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's almost as big.</v>

2137
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:23.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant fight to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2138
01:33:23.111 --> 01:33:26.760
<v Speaker 1>now we're back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're back in business and the</v>

2139
01:33:26.761 --> 01:33:29.830
<v Speaker 1>stripping him thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the policy is on that.</v>

2140
01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's a public policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if it's just,</v>

2141
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.990
<v Speaker 1>they just make the call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they could do whatever they want</v>

2142
01:33:34.991 --> 01:33:35.824
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

2143
01:33:35.970 --> 01:33:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2144
01:33:37.321 --> 01:33:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they would never give up</v>
<v Speaker 1>that power if they did have it,</v>

2145
01:33:41.891 --> 01:33:44.650
<v Speaker 1>like to some organizing body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why would they write cause</v>

2146
01:33:44.651 --> 01:33:46.510
<v Speaker 1>organizing bodies could even get</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupted.</v>

2147
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:51.910
<v Speaker 1>But I think you have to be very careful</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you make like interim titles that</v>

2148
01:33:51.911 --> 01:33:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't make too many of them and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have them around too often.</v>

2149
01:33:55.090 --> 01:33:55.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2150
01:33:55.811 --> 01:33:57.700
<v Speaker 1>once you have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get them resolved pretty</v>

2151
01:33:57.701 --> 01:33:58.750
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're,</v>

2152
01:33:58.751 --> 01:34:00.490
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a way to build up excitement</v>

2153
01:34:00.491 --> 01:34:03.280
<v Speaker 1>about the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2154
01:34:03.281 --> 01:34:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think they would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripped him if you got injured four</v>

2155
01:34:05.981 --> 01:34:08.170
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who knows?</v>

2156
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:10.720
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might just be,</v>

2157
01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:13.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have a new policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they just stripping people,</v>

2158
01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:16.810
<v Speaker 1>but then conner hasn't fought in 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

2159
01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:18.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not stripped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2160
01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.200
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not stripped yet.</v>

2161
01:34:20.970 --> 01:34:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Hasn't fought more than 500 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA.</v>

2162
01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Last time he fought it was Eddie Alvarez</v>
<v Speaker 1>does his last time in May fight.</v>

2163
01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.020
<v Speaker 1>That was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2164
01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:31.990
<v Speaker 1>as a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2165
01:34:31.991 --> 01:34:33.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't been stripped.</v>

2166
01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:36.310
<v Speaker 1>So imagine being a lightweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sitting around waiting.</v>

2167
01:34:36.610 --> 01:34:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on boxing TV,</v>

2168
01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:41.350
<v Speaker 1>having a boxing match and floyd</v>
<v Speaker 1>mayweather,</v>

2169
01:34:41.351 --> 01:34:42.790
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he gets stripped of his title,</v>

2170
01:34:42.791 --> 01:34:45.370
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't defend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes 100 million bucks.</v>

2171
01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:46.420
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you fight fighting again,</v>

2172
01:34:46.421 --> 01:34:47.830
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who fucking knows?</v>

2173
01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:51.910
<v Speaker 1>It would be say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a lot clear as what to do in</v>

2174
01:34:51.911 --> 01:34:55.060
<v Speaker 1>this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If connor would have just fought like a</v>

2175
01:34:55.061 --> 01:34:57.710
<v Speaker 1>regular lightweight champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be this,</v>

2176
01:34:58.090 --> 01:34:59.720
<v Speaker 1>this interim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2177
01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.940
<v Speaker 1>confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good for conor though.</v>

2178
01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.920
<v Speaker 1>All of it just makes it bigger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>

2179
01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:06.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave and changed the rules for him.</v>

2180
01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:07.220
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2181
01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that for him.</v>

2182
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Like it just makes him bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't fun 500 days.</v>

2183
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Who fucking cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just rolling around a bathtub full</v>

2184
01:35:15.471 --> 01:35:18.740
<v Speaker 1>of hundred dollar bills every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just dive in there and swimming.</v>

2185
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:23.420
<v Speaker 1>He can do whatever the fuck he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that documentary on Netflix.</v>

2186
01:35:23.421 --> 01:35:24.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

2187
01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:25.330
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2188
01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew he was going to be a champion</v>

2189
01:35:27.831 --> 01:35:30.180
<v Speaker 1>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts when he,</v>

2190
01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:32.190
<v Speaker 1>he has just one tattoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one down,</v>

2191
01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:34.100
<v Speaker 1>one down his back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2192
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.550
<v Speaker 1>None of the neck tattoos or anything and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he already knew.</v>

2193
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:40.250
<v Speaker 1>He knew he just had dynamite in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

2194
01:35:40.251 --> 01:35:42.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing people on the local local</v>

2195
01:35:42.591 --> 01:35:44.030
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing them.</v>

2196
01:35:44.130 --> 01:35:45.710
<v Speaker 1>You know one shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

2197
01:35:46.210 --> 01:35:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him fight in 2013 I think</v>

2198
01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:54.150
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around there and his first</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance at DFC,</v>

2199
01:35:54.230 --> 01:35:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have known if I didn't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>this documentary.</v>

2200
01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:59.780
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to keep track of everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wasn't Sweden.</v>

2201
01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a Swedish show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like last minute replacement.</v>

2202
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:07.241
<v Speaker 1>They brought him in and he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was his name?</v>

2203
01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Black Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

2204
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good guy.</v>

2205
01:36:12.741 --> 01:36:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Real good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he lit him up and that was like damn</v>

2206
01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:18.500
<v Speaker 1>after that one fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's,</v>

2207
01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.350
<v Speaker 1>there's footage of of him and Dana and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dana was already,</v>

2208
01:36:21.351 --> 01:36:22.071
<v Speaker 1>he already knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2209
01:36:22.071 --> 01:36:24.110
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the hype was real.</v>

2210
01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite fights with him or the two</v>

2211
01:36:27.831 --> 01:36:30.230
<v Speaker 1>fights with Nate Diaz though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

2212
01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Because those are the fights where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't put someone away,</v>

2213
01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.380
<v Speaker 1>just crack them and put them away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So had to see him fight.</v>

2214
01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:39.680
<v Speaker 1>He had a fight and it's a totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>different game.</v>

2215
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Like if you see what he did to Eddie</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alvarez,</v>

2216
01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.450
<v Speaker 1>that was a totally different kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight because he's stung.</v>

2217
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Eddie early had him hurt and he was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he owned them and then he fucked him up</v>

2218
01:36:48.381 --> 01:36:50.420
<v Speaker 1>and stopped him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a beating.</v>

2219
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:52.760
<v Speaker 1>What round was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a second single was a</v>

2220
01:36:52.761 --> 01:36:55.220
<v Speaker 1>second and he barely made it out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2221
01:36:55.221 --> 01:36:55.940
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2222
01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.640
<v Speaker 1>barely made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he got fucked up from the get go.</v>

2223
01:36:59.030 --> 01:37:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Connor just had us number is way faster</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight quicker and like covering</v>

2224
01:37:02.841 --> 01:37:06.080
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just like laser beams at night.</v>

2225
01:37:06.081 --> 01:37:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think Eddie fought right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Eddie was a little bit too</v>

2226
01:37:08.511 --> 01:37:11.330
<v Speaker 1>caught up in the moment is the big hype</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fight getting to fight conor</v>

2227
01:37:11.331 --> 01:37:15.050
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor and he just got fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of had his hands behind his back</v>

2228
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.120
<v Speaker 1>and standing right in front of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicken neck and I'm,</v>

2229
01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:21.080
<v Speaker 1>and then pop them in the face like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was ugly so that you know,</v>

2230
01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.500
<v Speaker 1>like what year was that?</v>

2231
01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:29.230
<v Speaker 1>That was 500 of those 500 days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the kind of fight is a great</v>

2232
01:37:30.321 --> 01:37:33.230
<v Speaker 1>fight for conor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all hammer.</v>

2233
01:37:33.710 --> 01:37:36.920
<v Speaker 1>When he fought nate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to be the nail through a lot of</v>

2234
01:37:36.921 --> 01:37:37.700
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2235
01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:40.610
<v Speaker 1>The whole fucking second round of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first fight.</v>

2236
01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:42.950
<v Speaker 1>When nate got them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the second round submission,</v>

2237
01:37:42.951 --> 01:37:43.784
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

2238
01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno when he submitted him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nate's submit them in the second</v>

2239
01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:48.471
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you looking at?</v>

2240
01:37:48.471 --> 01:37:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Me Funny when you've got something these</v>
<v Speaker 1>full pull up more than I do with my</v>

2241
01:37:52.311 --> 01:37:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what connor said.</v>

2242
01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 1>These pull out more than I do with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>deck and like how we got to specify with</v>

2243
01:37:58.531 --> 01:38:00.840
<v Speaker 1>his dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must have the only pulled out four</v>

2244
01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:03.680
<v Speaker 1>times Max.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not that great.</v>

2245
01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:06.360
<v Speaker 1>The fights with nate were fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2246
01:38:06.361 --> 01:38:08.730
<v Speaker 1>he had to dig deep and he lost the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2247
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:11.780
<v Speaker 1>He got beat up and got taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got his back taken.</v>

2248
01:38:11.781 --> 01:38:13.110
<v Speaker 1>He got choked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tapped.</v>

2249
01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean he fucking lost that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second fight he drops nate.</v>

2250
01:38:17.911 --> 01:38:20.700
<v Speaker 1>But he can't put nate away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate gets back up,</v>

2251
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.950
<v Speaker 1>they're going after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's fucking times where he's got to</v>

2252
01:38:22.951 --> 01:38:25.590
<v Speaker 1>stand and walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got walkway cause he's too tired.</v>

2253
01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:27.020
<v Speaker 1>He can't engage right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

2254
01:38:27.050 --> 01:38:29.340
<v Speaker 1>So you've walked away a couple of times</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those exchanges.</v>

2255
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Those were dig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig fights.</v>

2256
01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.720
<v Speaker 1>What's this buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Round two.</v>

2257
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:38:34.891 --> 01:38:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're submission real Nigga choke four</v>

2259
01:38:37.261 --> 01:38:38.760
<v Speaker 1>minutes and 12 seconds it around too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2260
01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.250
<v Speaker 1>He beat him down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warm down and then stopped him.</v>

2261
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:46.290
<v Speaker 1>That's and the fight that conard one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could that have gone either?</v>

2262
01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2263
01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:50.430
<v Speaker 1>It was arguments that's very close fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a really close fight.</v>

2264
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I think under the new rules connor</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably would have won because um,</v>

2265
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2266
01:38:56.490 --> 01:38:59.610
<v Speaker 1>I think even just one knocked down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good enough for a 10,</v>

2267
01:38:59.611 --> 01:39:00.180
<v Speaker 1>eight round.</v>

2268
01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:01.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2269
01:39:01.411 --> 01:39:02.760
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a five minute round,</v>

2270
01:39:02.761 --> 01:39:04.440
<v Speaker 1>like one knocked down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2271
01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how the other exchanges</v>

2272
01:39:06.331 --> 01:39:08.190
<v Speaker 1>were going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These changes were all the same and then</v>

2273
01:39:08.191 --> 01:39:10.260
<v Speaker 1>you cracked him once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He definitely won.</v>

2274
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.950
<v Speaker 1>But did you win ten eight ten eight is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat down I think,</v>

2275
01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:15.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even I think that should be wrong.</v>

2276
01:39:15.781 --> 01:39:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it should be that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she'd be like a hundred points</v>

2277
01:39:18.930 --> 01:39:23.250
<v Speaker 1>and I think they should have like scores</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like one through 10 in striking,</v>

2278
01:39:23.251 --> 01:39:27.060
<v Speaker 1>one through 10 in wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one through 10 or nonapplicable.</v>

2279
01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:28.980
<v Speaker 1>If there's no wrestling at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just attend.</v>

2280
01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:30.390
<v Speaker 1>But you got to look at it this way</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2281
01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:31.170
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2282
01:39:31.170 --> 01:39:36.170
<v Speaker 1>if you could have a fight and in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>round it's super close and really</v>

2283
01:39:36.691 --> 01:39:40.410
<v Speaker 1>nothing happened and just super close</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one really connected anything.</v>

2284
01:39:40.410 --> 01:39:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And that happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a ten nine round.</v>

2285
01:39:43.321 --> 01:39:44.154
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2286
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2287
01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:50.490
<v Speaker 1>and then you compare that to another</v>
<v Speaker 1>round where a guy got dropped but it was</v>

2288
01:39:50.491 --> 01:39:53.190
<v Speaker 1>kind of a flash knockdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pops back up and then they,</v>

2289
01:39:53.191 --> 01:39:54.960
<v Speaker 1>then it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even for the rest of the round,</v>

2290
01:39:55.110 --> 01:39:56.790
<v Speaker 1>that can't be a ten nine too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2291
01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.260
<v Speaker 1>So either you got to make more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 10 rounds or nine nine rounds,</v>

2292
01:40:01.770 --> 01:40:03.000
<v Speaker 1>and then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2293
01:40:03.001 --> 01:40:06.720
<v Speaker 1>knock down doesn't necessarily mean ten</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight cause then at ten nine is going to</v>

2294
01:40:06.721 --> 01:40:09.960
<v Speaker 1>mean one dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly one any lamb and some good</v>

2295
01:40:09.961 --> 01:40:13.350
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a ten nine it's all how you lay</v>

2296
01:40:13.351 --> 01:40:14.430
<v Speaker 1>it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to give,</v>

2297
01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you know dude who where the round could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gone either way and you're going to</v>

2298
01:40:18.121 --> 01:40:22.320
<v Speaker 1>get someone at ten nine and it looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a dude getting knocked down.</v>

2299
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:23.820
<v Speaker 1>It should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be different.</v>

2300
01:40:23.821 --> 01:40:28.821
<v Speaker 1>So it all depends how add more draws or</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it so that if you knock a dude</v>

2301
01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.010
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an automatic ten eight round,</v>

2302
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to Dennis ten eight you</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked him down.</v>

2303
01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.890
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if he's beating your ass all over</v>

2304
01:40:37.891 --> 01:40:40.890
<v Speaker 1>the place and then you catch them with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like five seconds to go drop him and he</v>

2305
01:40:40.891 --> 01:40:43.230
<v Speaker 1>gets right back up and he cracks you</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a jab.</v>

2306
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you still get a tenant because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped him?</v>

2307
01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:49.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I would say that's a nine.</v>

2308
01:40:49.051 --> 01:40:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2309
01:40:51.330 --> 01:40:52.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine maybe.</v>

2310
01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it depends on how much she's</v>

2311
01:40:54.850 --> 01:40:58.600
<v Speaker 1>beating your ass before the guys beating</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ass down the whole round.</v>

2312
01:40:58.870 --> 01:41:03.580
<v Speaker 1>And then you clip him once and he drops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you weren't really beating him</v>

2313
01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:05.800
<v Speaker 1>down that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it just look like it cause he's</v>

2314
01:41:05.801 --> 01:41:06.730
<v Speaker 1>still cracked.</v>

2315
01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:08.500
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were really beating him down,</v>

2316
01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:12.190
<v Speaker 1>how was he able to to knock you down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens all the time.</v>

2317
01:41:12.191 --> 01:41:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Guys still have power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're running into</v>

2318
01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:17.230
<v Speaker 1>something that's a hard one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard one to school and knocked</v>

2319
01:41:17.231 --> 01:41:19.840
<v Speaker 1>down than a beat down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get out class,</v>

2320
01:41:19.841 --> 01:41:22.870
<v Speaker 1>the whole match or the whole round and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get knocked down once.</v>

2321
01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when the draw Drago Pete</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell fought?</v>

2322
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott Smith.</v>

2323
01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Scott Smith from rocky four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2324
01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not that.</v>

2325
01:41:32.771 --> 01:41:35.350
<v Speaker 1>That's your center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember who drago in the second</v>

2326
01:41:35.351 --> 01:41:36.590
<v Speaker 1>round against rocky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We met him.</v>

2327
01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Remember I talked to Matt Serra's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember Pete Sell Pizza.</v>

2328
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you're,</v>

2329
01:41:41.290 --> 01:41:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Pete dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2330
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.880
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2331
01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Scott Smith real bad with a left hook to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>

2332
01:41:46.841 --> 01:41:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Like Scott doubled over and winced and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pete moved in for the kill and Scott</v>

2333
01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:53.770
<v Speaker 1>just landed the perfect picture point.</v>

2334
01:41:53.890 --> 01:41:55.570
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was at like,</v>

2335
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:57.430
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was hurricane it faking it?</v>

2336
01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:59.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he dropped an agony after he knocked him</v>

2337
01:41:59.981 --> 01:42:00.790
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2338
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Pete Hook to hook them to the body hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>him real bad.</v>

2339
01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:07.180
<v Speaker 1>And when Pete moved in for the kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott Smith hit him with a per picture.</v>

2340
01:42:07.181 --> 01:42:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do remember,</v>

2341
01:42:08.171 --> 01:42:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I remember that just knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He falls back and then Scott Smith's</v>

2342
01:42:11.591 --> 01:42:13.270
<v Speaker 1>drops to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they stopped the fight and he's in</v>

2343
01:42:13.271 --> 01:42:15.760
<v Speaker 1>agony holding onto his side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

2344
01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.010
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that can't happen.</v>

2345
01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Like even if you're beating a guy down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is still moving if they still just</v>

2346
01:42:22.121 --> 01:42:25.750
<v Speaker 1>plant and just uncork one Pat Barry</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check Congo.</v>

2347
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Remember that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat Barry had check Congo on co we're</v>

2348
01:42:29.351 --> 01:42:32.830
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was wobbling all over the place.</v>

2349
01:42:32.831 --> 01:42:37.540
<v Speaker 1>It looked like the fight was over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pat moves in for the kill and boom,</v>

2350
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:42.340
<v Speaker 1>check Congo hits him with the hay maker</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he's running in flatlines Pat Barry</v>

2351
01:42:42.341 --> 01:42:46.120
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in his career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken happen.</v>

2352
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:48.820
<v Speaker 1>If you're not knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still moving.</v>

2353
01:42:48.850 --> 01:42:50.830
<v Speaker 1>You still could knock someone out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can happen,</v>

2354
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:52.810
<v Speaker 1>especially if they get careless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

2355
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:54.880
<v Speaker 1>He hits him with the left lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this boom.</v>

2356
01:42:54.881 --> 01:42:57.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean as a picture perfect left hook to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body,</v>

2357
01:42:57.611 --> 01:42:59.500
<v Speaker 1>but watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in agony.</v>

2358
01:42:59.530 --> 01:43:04.530
<v Speaker 1>If Pete moves in back home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is a crazy right hand.</v>

2359
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:08.740
<v Speaker 1>That's like round nine of a lange versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>Balboa.</v>

2360
01:43:09.170 --> 01:43:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I looked at him on the ground and agony</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

2361
01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Pizza couldn't even believe it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2362
01:43:15.881 --> 01:43:18.700
<v Speaker 1>you should always faint before you move</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2363
01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

2364
01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Even if you think you got a guy hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>checks.</v>

2365
01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fees like this.</v>

2366
01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:25.393
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2367
01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me something.</v>

2368
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Show me what you got going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the best guys,</v>

2369
01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:31.840
<v Speaker 1>they never just charged like Max</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holloway.</v>

2370
01:43:31.841 --> 01:43:33.350
<v Speaker 1>We fished off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aldo is.</v>

2371
01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:35.050
<v Speaker 1>It's constant pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant pressure,</v>

2372
01:43:35.051 --> 01:43:38.500
<v Speaker 1>but when he feels Aldo firing bags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll step back for a second.</v>

2373
01:43:38.650 --> 01:43:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Right back on your baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best painter,</v>

2374
01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.970
<v Speaker 1>that's always pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn good at it.</v>

2375
01:43:43.290 --> 01:43:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It seems like I just saw someone fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC or maybe Bella tour.</v>

2376
01:43:46.601 --> 01:43:49.860
<v Speaker 1>That was always just fainting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just one boy.</v>

2377
01:43:50.210 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy might get my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my vote</v>

2378
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:55.790
<v Speaker 2>for the best fainter because wonderboy</v>
<v Speaker 2>also has like,</v>

2379
01:43:55.791 --> 01:43:57.170
<v Speaker 2>it's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What style?</v>

2380
01:43:57.171 --> 01:44:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Faintings most effective wonderboy has</v>
<v Speaker 2>an extra advantage of having that right</v>

2381
01:44:01.701 --> 01:44:04.100
<v Speaker 2>leg forward or left leg forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whichever he chooses.</v>

2382
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Sideway stance with that long body of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

2383
01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.810
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird thing I've dealt with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that man and the old martial arts days</v>

2384
01:44:11.811 --> 01:44:14.030
<v Speaker 2>and taekwondo days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the hardest thing to deal with</v>

2385
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:17.600
<v Speaker 2>those long guys that can have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have a powerful front leg.</v>

2386
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:20.000
<v Speaker 2>He just keeps you away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the fuck he's doing,</v>

2387
01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:23.000
<v Speaker 2>so he faints and then Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he comes in with a left hand or he</v>

2388
01:44:23.001 --> 01:44:25.040
<v Speaker 2>faints and boom is a roundhouse kick in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your face.</v>

2389
01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I think he's the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he doesn't also,</v>

2390
01:44:27.471 --> 01:44:30.860
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't move like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else has like sort of a</v>

2391
01:44:30.861 --> 01:44:35.780
<v Speaker 2>modified taekwondo style or a Moy Thai</v>
<v Speaker 2>style rather,</v>

2392
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:37.700
<v Speaker 2>except for the taekwondo guys.</v>

2393
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:41.150
<v Speaker 2>There's a few guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even connor connor has more of a</v>

2394
01:44:41.151 --> 01:44:43.550
<v Speaker 2>karate style.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He could hang with his hands.</v>

2509
01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.510

<v Speaker 1>he was fucking him up.</v>

2511
01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:57.850
<v Speaker 1>He really was fumbling by little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was landing them like his little Thai</v>

2512
01:49:57.851 --> 01:50:02.020
<v Speaker 1>guy is though to take those shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the greatest back fights ever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And kickboxing history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

2514
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:07.870
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that this is how Rick</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rufus learned the power of who that</v>

2518
01:50:15.541 --> 01:50:19.600
<v Speaker 1>A touch jumping side posts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning wheel kick hit him in the head.</v>

2519
01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:21.820

<v Speaker 1>they sit them down in the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out on his feet.</v>

2521
01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Just keep playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one of the greatest matches that's</v>

2522
01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.250
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So historically significant in martial</v>

2523
01:50:30.251 --> 01:50:32.590
<v Speaker 1>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why this is where they learned.</v>

2524
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of those American</v>

2525
01:50:34.301 --> 01:50:35.620
<v Speaker 1>kickboxers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2526
01:50:35.650 --> 01:50:39.040
<v Speaker 1>this is was an eye opener.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like UFC one for kickboxing.</v>

2527
01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first,</v>

2528
01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:43.780
<v Speaker 1>the first time someone ever kicked me in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leg and they didn't even do it hard.</v>

2529
01:50:44.110 --> 01:50:46.960
<v Speaker 1>They did it to show me like how hard it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when you get kicked in the leg.</v>

2530
01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:49.780
<v Speaker 1>It was like a light bulb went off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

2531
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:51.430
<v Speaker 1>The first time I've ever heard of a leg</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick.</v>

2532
01:50:51.431 --> 01:50:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2533
01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:56.620
<v Speaker 1>working at the Strip club as a DJ and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the managers was all into karate.</v>

2534
01:50:56.621 --> 01:50:59.440
<v Speaker 1>He turned them into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always had done tournament karate</v>

2535
01:50:59.441 --> 01:51:00.580
<v Speaker 1>for 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2536
01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Look at this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's lightened him up with his leg</v>

2537
01:51:03.101 --> 01:51:03.821
<v Speaker 1>kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2538
01:51:03.821 --> 01:51:06.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took me in the back one day and he</v>

2539
01:51:06.491 --> 01:51:07.324
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2540
01:51:07.570 --> 01:51:08.680
<v Speaker 1>stand there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me kick you.</v>

2541
01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And he kicked me with his shin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2542
01:51:09.821 --> 01:51:12.010
<v Speaker 1>people are doing this now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that feel?</v>

2543
01:51:12.011 --> 01:51:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Does he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was experimenting on mine legs.</v>

2544
01:51:14.410 --> 01:51:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Does this hurt their lending with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>shin?</v>

2545
01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.010
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fuck that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their Shins.</v>

2547
01:51:20.531 --> 01:51:21.400
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2548
01:51:21.401 --> 01:51:25.270
<v Speaker 1>the crazy thing is when you feel it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from someone who's just like</v>

2549
01:51:25.271 --> 01:51:26.890
<v Speaker 1>tapping your leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much it hurts.</v>

2550
01:51:27.070 --> 01:51:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Now think of this dude whose name I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't pronounce again.</v>

2551
01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rick would try to throw his own kick,</v>

2552
01:51:34.090 --> 01:51:36.940
<v Speaker 1>but his low kicks were like foot kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2553
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a foot kicker.</v>

2554
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:42.370
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't like a Shin Kicker back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most karate guys,</v>

2555
01:51:42.371 --> 01:51:45.070
<v Speaker 1>we're in step kickers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would hit a guy with a roundhouse</v>

2556
01:51:45.071 --> 01:51:46.570
<v Speaker 1>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you had hit him in the body with</v>

2557
01:51:46.571 --> 01:51:48.100
<v Speaker 1>your instep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hit him in the head with your</v>

2558
01:51:48.110 --> 01:51:48.790
<v Speaker 1>instep.</v>

2559
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything I ever did up until I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started doing Moitai was with my insteps</v>

2560
01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:58.000
<v Speaker 1>or the heel like heel kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll kicks.</v>

2561
01:51:58.690 --> 01:52:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that was incredible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans didn't figure that out.</v>

2562
01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:07.000
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that killed him in the leg yet?</v>

<v Speaker 2>pushing off and low kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at his hands.</v>

2623
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:48.770
<v Speaker 2>See His hand placement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2624
01:54:48.771 --> 01:54:50.390
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2625
01:54:50.391 --> 01:54:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing off.</v>

2626
01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:53.360
<v Speaker 2>He's barely even tried to punch with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2627
01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:57.530
<v Speaker 2>He's basically just using his hands to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create space and distance and give Rick</v>

2628
01:54:57.530 --> 01:55:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Rick roof is something to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to block the punches in the kick</v>

2629
01:55:00.231 --> 01:55:02.690
<v Speaker 2>that rufus throws and then boom leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks.</v>

2630
01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:04.970
<v Speaker 2>He just leg kicks him to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2631
01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:07.340
<v Speaker 2>He's not punching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just leg kick.</v>

2632
01:55:07.341 --> 01:55:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Leg kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hands up,</v>

2633
01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:13.220
<v Speaker 2>hands up like that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as he stopped exchanging</v>

2634
01:55:13.221 --> 01:55:15.680
<v Speaker 2>punches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just started dominating the space and</v>

2635
01:55:15.681 --> 01:55:17.720
<v Speaker 2>then slamming those leg kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2636
01:55:17.721 --> 01:55:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fakes with the hand and across both</v>

2637
01:55:20.331 --> 01:55:22.160
<v Speaker 2>thighs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the most painful ones,</v>

2638
01:55:22.161 --> 01:55:23.990
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ones across both thighs.</v>

2639
01:55:24.090 --> 01:55:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

2640
01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Rob came in back when I was getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>coaching from him.</v>

2641
01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:32.690
<v Speaker 2>He tapped me across the front of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts with his shin.</v>

2642
01:55:32.691 --> 01:55:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Just dunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just tapped me.</v>

2643
01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:38.780
<v Speaker 2>My legs hurt all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy.</v>

2644
01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really that throw holy Shit.</v>

2645
01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Those ties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Chuck each other around.</v>

2646
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Two man</v>
<v Speaker 1>round posted a little clip.</v>

2647
01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

2648
01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Of a fight where they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't they just wrapped up their hands?</v>

2649
01:55:52.051 --> 01:55:54.170
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have gloves and the head</v>
<v Speaker 1>butts were legal.</v>

2650
01:55:54.171 --> 01:55:57.570
<v Speaker 1>It was kickboxing or you could throw</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces and you could have,</v>

2651
01:55:57.571 --> 01:56:00.510
<v Speaker 1>but did you see that clip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Dude,</v>

2652
01:56:00.511 --> 01:56:04.140
<v Speaker 1>it's evil guy headbutts his opponent</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up.</v>

2653
01:56:04.141 --> 01:56:07.110
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just spears his head right into a knocks</v>

2654
01:56:07.111 --> 01:56:09.390
<v Speaker 1>the guy down just from a headbutt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rufus.</v>

2655
01:56:09.391 --> 01:56:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Like he only stands that one way most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time too.</v>

2656
01:56:12.570 --> 01:56:16.770
<v Speaker 1>So that that front right leg is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to that left outside kick</v>

2657
01:56:16.771 --> 01:56:20.310
<v Speaker 1>cause they're both southpaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If rucc rick see now he's trying to</v>

2658
01:56:20.311 --> 01:56:23.460
<v Speaker 1>switch up and he's putting his left leg</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward cause he's in so much pain.</v>

2659
01:56:23.461 --> 01:56:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Like look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he walks back to his corner do he</v>

2660
01:56:25.471 --> 01:56:27.240
<v Speaker 1>could barely walk at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>third round.</v>

2661
01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was this in Thailand or was in the</v>

2662
01:56:29.911 --> 01:56:31.500
<v Speaker 1>states?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it was.</v>

2663
01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:33.520
<v Speaker 1>It looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says cores,</v>

2664
01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:36.750
<v Speaker 1>beer on the canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to think it's in America and plus</v>

2665
01:56:36.751 --> 01:56:39.270
<v Speaker 1>the way they're making them where he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing those pants.</v>

2666
01:56:39.650 --> 01:56:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I got to think it's America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those pants look so stupid in</v>

2667
01:56:43.231 --> 01:56:45.630
<v Speaker 1>comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also Rick Rufus was also wearing</v>

2668
01:56:45.631 --> 01:56:47.070
<v Speaker 1>pads on his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2669
01:56:47.071 --> 01:56:49.270
<v Speaker 1>How did he go down their leg?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kick another leg.</v>

2670
01:56:49.470 --> 01:56:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Can you rewind that Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the pads.</v>

2671
01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Look at the pads on his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2672
01:56:53.731 --> 01:56:54.421
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

2673
01:56:54.421 --> 01:56:57.180
<v Speaker 1>How does he go down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that was just the leg kick.</v>

2674
01:56:57.181 --> 01:57:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just low kick caught him in the spin and</v>

2675
01:57:00.301 --> 01:57:02.490
<v Speaker 1>just totally took his leg out and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing those,</v>

2676
01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:06.720
<v Speaker 1>those booties on the tops of his feet to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to protect the bones of his feet</v>

2677
01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:07.950
<v Speaker 1>cause he's a foot kicker.</v>

2678
01:57:08.210 --> 01:57:09.720
<v Speaker 1>See what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's extra weight.</v>

2679
01:57:10.110 --> 01:57:12.900
<v Speaker 1>You were an extra four ounces or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is on your feet.</v>

2680
01:57:12.930 --> 01:57:17.130
<v Speaker 1>It slows your kicks down and the Thai</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy just says taped up ankles and shorts</v>

2681
01:57:17.131 --> 01:57:18.510
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because it's</v>

2682
01:57:18.511 --> 01:57:23.070
<v Speaker 1>really is like kickboxing versus Moitai</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool and we chopped the leg gambling,</v>

2683
01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:23.933
<v Speaker 1>we chops late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2684
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:27.000
<v Speaker 1>look at this work roof is in so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger here.</v>

2685
01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:29.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's basically just totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>helpless.</v>

2686
01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:32.130
<v Speaker 1>And this tie guys going across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shins.</v>

2687
01:57:32.250 --> 01:57:34.390
<v Speaker 1>He's going across the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's blocking with his knee,</v>

2688
01:57:34.391 --> 01:57:36.570
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just kicking through him</v>

2689
01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:38.250
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

2690
01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

2691
01:57:39.481 --> 01:57:42.330
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just walking him down.</v>

2692
01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another one,</v>

2693
01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:48.570
<v Speaker 1>no terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be to have that guy walk you</v>

2694
01:57:48.571 --> 01:57:51.440
<v Speaker 1>down like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hands out like that.</v>

2695
01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:56.100
<v Speaker 1>They call the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is that jt will the referee is a</v>

2696
01:57:56.101 --> 01:57:59.970
<v Speaker 1>famous referee who got it was will and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all those karate.</v>

2697
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:01.950
<v Speaker 1>That's Dick Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Duke right there.</v>

2698
01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not jql.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a duke right there.</v>

2699
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling everybody that he didn't think</v>

2700
01:58:07.081 --> 01:58:09.330
<v Speaker 1>that it took a lot of skill to kick</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's legs.</v>

2701
01:58:11.570 --> 01:58:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick should've won the fight.</v>

2702
01:58:15.531 --> 01:58:18.120
<v Speaker 1>He had the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big historical stuff.</v>

2703
01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:22.520
<v Speaker 1>The way the cookie crumbles tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at the monitor down</v>

2704
01:58:22.521 --> 01:58:22.980
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>

2705
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:26.840
<v Speaker 1>and</v>
<v Speaker 1>became like the man,</v>

2706
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:28.620
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam there,</v>

2707
01:58:28.621 --> 01:58:30.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says buck on his knees to do the same</v>

2708
01:58:30.651 --> 01:58:33.050
<v Speaker 1>type of injury that Angela football</v>
<v Speaker 1>player's career.</v>

2709
01:58:33.610 --> 01:58:36.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it takes much town to kick</v>

2710
01:58:36.351 --> 01:58:38.440
<v Speaker 1>somebody in the legs as you thought.</v>

2711
01:58:38.450 --> 01:58:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Those jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's crazy now eric?</v>

2712
01:58:40.210 --> 01:58:43.710
<v Speaker 1>We're throwing in all deep and real</v>
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

2713
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:45.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>

2714
01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duke I think was only 19 at the time.</v>

2715
01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:48.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's changed.</v>

2716
01:58:48.701 --> 01:58:49.570
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's learned.</v>

2717
01:58:49.571 --> 01:58:52.990
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons why he's so good</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because he's open minded,</v>

2718
01:58:53.230 --> 01:58:55.450
<v Speaker 1>but he became a world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more Thai fighter himself,</v>

2719
01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.780
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like Jujitsu and leg locks.</v>

2720
01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like that,</v>

2721
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:03.310
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't take any town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just jumping on a guy's lag,</v>

2722
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:04.090
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>

2723
01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:05.890
<v Speaker 1>all martial arts techniques that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective,</v>

2724
01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:08.110
<v Speaker 1>there's still people that don't believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>in certain techniques.</v>

2725
01:59:08.170 --> 01:59:09.790
<v Speaker 1>And the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2726
01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:14.710
<v Speaker 1>another big moment for Maury tie in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of that martial art was,</v>

2727
01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:16.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Varland versus Marco.</v>

2728
01:59:16.991 --> 01:59:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Who else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when we saw was UFC seven.</v>

2729
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:23.860
<v Speaker 1>That's when we saw the damn cause before</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC seven,</v>

2730
01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:25.780
<v Speaker 1>everybody was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2731
01:59:25.781 --> 01:59:27.900
<v Speaker 1>you can't really do any kind of striking</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2732
01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:30.100
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn Jujitsu or you will</v>

2733
01:59:30.101 --> 01:59:31.270
<v Speaker 1>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be,</v>

2734
01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:33.880
<v Speaker 1>people were just losing faith in</v>
<v Speaker 1>striking all together,</v>

2735
01:59:33.881 --> 01:59:36.310
<v Speaker 1>like just work on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2736

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2737
01:59:38.150 --> 01:59:41.050
<v Speaker 1>it was almost like jabs didn't even work</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

2738
01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Like who throws a jab in mma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get taken down and get</v>

2739
01:59:44.021 --> 01:59:46.180
<v Speaker 1>choked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And UFC seven,</v>

2740
01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.040
<v Speaker 1>that's when we learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2741
01:59:48.190 --> 01:59:52.520
<v Speaker 1>leg leg kicks work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to 300 pounds.</v>

2742
01:59:52.521 --> 01:59:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changed everything.</v>

2743
01:59:53.621 --> 01:59:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portland's violence was huge.</v>

2744
01:59:55.661 --> 01:59:57.310
<v Speaker 1>The polar bear there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call them tech.</v>

2745
01:59:57.311 --> 01:59:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I was gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Marco who washes took his legs</v>

2746
02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:02.500
<v Speaker 1>and then marco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>

2747
02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:06.490
<v Speaker 1>he also beat revco par do that judo</v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

2748
02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>You remember he mounted them and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>tap.</v>

2749
02:00:09.250 --> 02:00:10.083
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

2750
02:00:10.150 --> 02:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Once you get them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he thought.</v>

2751
02:00:13.391 --> 02:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what he thought.</v>

2752
02:00:14.531 --> 02:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this marco.</v>

2753
02:00:16.031 --> 02:00:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Who else would get heel hooks on people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit?</v>

2754
02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Who's he fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get some in the heel hook right here</v>

2756
02:00:22.361 --> 02:00:25.510

<v Speaker 1>I think this is the first he'll hook in.</v>

2757
02:00:25.511 --> 02:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>The UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might've been if it wasn't him,</v>

2758
02:00:28.031 --> 02:00:28.864
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2763
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:35.770

2766
02:00:39.630 --> 02:00:41.860

<v Speaker 1>Ken probably had the first ever leg lock</v>

2767
02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:43.360

<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

2782
02:01:32.711 --> 02:01:36.430

<v Speaker 1>maybe after his UFC career.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2793
02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2794
02:01:59.450 --> 02:02:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Girls can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually it looks like he's got</v>

2795

<v Speaker 2>different colored shorts on or is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Monitor?</v>

2798
02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:12.290

<v Speaker 2>It a little bit,</v>

2799
02:02:12.291 --> 02:02:14.270
<v Speaker 2>but doesn't look like different colors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2800
02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:17.270
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just we're seeing his legs</v>

2801
02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:20.120
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably is going to the last minute.</v>

2802
02:02:20.130 --> 02:02:22.130
<v Speaker 2>It has a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last minute of the fight,</v>

2803
02:02:22.131 --> 02:02:23.360
<v Speaker 2>that's where he chops him down.</v>

2804
02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:24.980
<v Speaker 2>He just chopped him down there with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first one.</v>

2805
02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so much smaller than I look how</v>

2806
02:02:27.981 --> 02:02:30.410
<v Speaker 2>small Marco is in comparison to Marco's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit guy.</v>

2807
02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Paul violence doesn't have any idea</v>

2808
02:02:33.921 --> 02:02:34.830
<v Speaker 2>what to do here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

2809
02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:36.950
<v Speaker 2>he just keeps kicking back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2810
02:02:36.951 --> 02:02:39.060
<v Speaker 2>he just touched his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

2811
02:02:39.090 --> 02:02:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2812
02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:43.190
<v Speaker 2>chop them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your fucks now.</v>

2813
02:02:43.191 --> 02:02:46.160
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Marco just got on top of him a trop</v>

2814
02:02:46.161 --> 02:02:47.450
<v Speaker 2>to hammers on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2815
02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No gloves.</v>

2816
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old School.</v>

2817
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:54.020
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone started throwing a leg kicks</v>

2818
02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:56.240
<v Speaker 2>firmly believe we need to go back to no</v>
<v Speaker 2>gloves.</v>

2819
02:02:56.330 --> 02:02:59.720
<v Speaker 2>Firmly believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't emphasize it enough.</v>

2820
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:03.520
<v Speaker 2>I think people would get less hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd,</v>

2821
02:03:03.521 --> 02:03:06.830
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a more realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to have Rogan fighting</v>

2822
02:03:06.831 --> 02:03:09.500
<v Speaker 2>championships on an Indian reservation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it makes that.</v>

2823
02:03:09.501 --> 02:03:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm beating a dead horse.</v>

2824
02:03:11.090 --> 02:03:13.280
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm a broken record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it makes sense to</v>

2825
02:03:13.281 --> 02:03:15.320
<v Speaker 2>tape your wrists up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your wrists are very vulnerable.</v>

2826
02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:18.200
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be able to just make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cast out of them and slam him into</v>

2827
02:03:18.201 --> 02:03:20.450
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel the same way about your ankles.</v>

2828
02:03:20.690 --> 02:03:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if you could tape your wrist up</v>

2829
02:03:22.551 --> 02:03:25.280
<v Speaker 2>to the point where nobody or your ankle</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to a point where nobody could ever</v>

2830
02:03:25.281 --> 02:03:27.260
<v Speaker 2>get you in a foot lock cause your ankle</v>
<v Speaker 2>was protected.</v>

2831
02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:28.490
<v Speaker 2>That'd be ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2832
02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:31.400
<v Speaker 2>We'll essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get someone in a wrist lock,</v>

2833
02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:34.130
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're pulling against the wrist.</v>

2834
02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a valid technique?</v>

2835
02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A valid technique like a wrist lock like</v>

2836
02:03:37.971 --> 02:03:39.830
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard to do when someone's risks is</v>

2837
02:03:39.831 --> 02:03:42.950
<v Speaker 2>taped the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When your wrist is really Rocco right</v>

2838
02:03:42.951 --> 02:03:45.080
<v Speaker 2>across here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes all over your knuckles.</v>

2839
02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:47.840
<v Speaker 2>It goes all around new arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes all around your wrist and makes</v>

2840
02:03:47.841 --> 02:03:50.630
<v Speaker 2>it much more stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can really dig into things.</v>

2841
02:03:50.631 --> 02:03:53.180
<v Speaker 2>It feels way better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels way better to hit things</v>

2842
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:56.930
<v Speaker 2>because when you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like my hand is bigger than</v>

2843
02:03:56.931 --> 02:03:59.660
<v Speaker 2>my wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I hit things on either side,</v>

2844
02:03:59.661 --> 02:04:03.050
<v Speaker 2>it'll be like more wobbly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want it that you want that bitch</v>

2845
02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:04.850
<v Speaker 2>taped up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2846
02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if your hand is the exact same</v>

2847
02:04:07.371 --> 02:04:10.190
<v Speaker 2>size as your wrist man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2848
02:04:10.191 --> 02:04:14.060
<v Speaker 2>this is a joint that is a super</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulating look at this wrist and he</v>

2849
02:04:14.061 --> 02:04:17.030
<v Speaker 2>looked at all the stuff your risk does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your wrist is crazy.</v>

2850
02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:19.580
<v Speaker 2>It really think about joints is the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>joint like it.</v>

2851
02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Your knees don't do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess your shoulders are kind of</v>

2852
02:04:22.431 --> 02:04:24.110
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your wrists,</v>

2853
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:28.010
<v Speaker 2>when you're punching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have to develop some serious,</v>

2854
02:04:28.011 --> 02:04:32.270
<v Speaker 2>strengthen your forearms to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a really effective bare knuckle</v>

2855
02:04:32.271 --> 02:04:32.510
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2856
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean truly bare knuckle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no wraps in your hands.</v>

2857
02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:38.390
<v Speaker 2>No nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just truly knuckle you had.</v>

2858
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 2>You had also learned that you must punch</v>
<v Speaker 2>things with the top knuckles.</v>

2859
02:04:42.090 --> 02:04:44.070
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even then you could break them.</v>

2860
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.370
<v Speaker 2>But if you start hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the jaw are great there with</v>

2861
02:04:47.371 --> 02:04:49.470
<v Speaker 2>this crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking thing is just going to</v>

2862
02:04:49.471 --> 02:04:51.540
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit somebody in the forehead right here,</v>

2863
02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:53.160
<v Speaker 2>crack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to break.</v>

2864
02:04:53.490 --> 02:04:55.050
<v Speaker 2>You're going to break them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get elbows,</v>

2865
02:04:55.051 --> 02:04:56.820
<v Speaker 2>break them for sure you're gonna break</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2866
02:04:57.480 --> 02:04:59.700
<v Speaker 2>But with those gloves on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get away with that shit.</v>

2867
02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:01.320
<v Speaker 2>You can get away with that shit and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

2868
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:05.010
<v Speaker 2>you could pitty pat guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do that more and just not even</v>

2869
02:05:05.011 --> 02:05:08.250
<v Speaker 2>like tried to find like specific spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just start hitting them.</v>

2870
02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:11.190
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to make sure you're getting the</v>

2871
02:05:11.191 --> 02:05:12.000
<v Speaker 2>soft tissue.</v>

2872
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.400
<v Speaker 2>You've got to target soft tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to look for the job.</v>

2873
02:05:14.410 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Body appears to the public to be more</v>

2874
02:05:18.421 --> 02:05:19.260
<v Speaker 2>brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2875
02:05:19.290 --> 02:05:20.520

<v Speaker 2>Instagram's huge.</v>

2918
02:06:57.741 --> 02:07:01.140
<v Speaker 2>The loop when you watch a technique and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just watch it over and over</v>

2919
02:07:01.141 --> 02:07:02.020
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

02:07:02.021 --> 02:07:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes,</v>

2921
02:07:03.181 --> 02:07:06.270
<v Speaker 2>that accelerates the learning process so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

2922
02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:09.990
<v Speaker 2>I was watching a clip today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I washed it like 15 times in a row.</v>

2923
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:14.100

<v Speaker 2>He gets under you and spins and rolls</v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

2929
02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting to watch be people can</v>

2930
02:07:28.891 --> 02:07:30.630

<v Speaker 2>That's so strong.</v>

2931
02:07:31.230 --> 02:07:33.150
<v Speaker 2>But that's what his post was about.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he is excellent.</v>

2966
02:08:56.141 --> 02:08:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Even just a hamstring cause he looks to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me like his foot sideways and he'd</v>

2967
02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:00.130
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>

2968
02:09:00.130 --> 02:09:00.791
<v Speaker 2>He does it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2970
02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:06.370

<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like he's going against the</v>

2971
02:09:06.371 --> 02:09:09.100
<v Speaker 2>inside of the leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's even crazier.</v>

2972
02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:12.970
<v Speaker 2>The strain is like the abductor muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going like this way.</v>

2973
02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:16.330

<v Speaker 2>really good wrestler.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That right then that shit that he should</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>conditioning routines?</v>

<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:47.110
<v Speaker 2>He's a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the top guy.</v>

2988
02:09:47.290 --> 02:09:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw a Andra Galvao doing dead</v>

2989
02:09:50.570 --> 02:09:52.160
<v Speaker 2>lifts today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2990
02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:53.561
<v Speaker 2>garage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2991
02:09:53.561 --> 02:09:56.130
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it better to just let the deadline,</v>

2992
02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:57.580
<v Speaker 2>I was going to ask you that because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2993
02:09:57.670 --> 02:10:00.700
<v Speaker 2>When he dead lifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that best way to do it?</v>

2994
02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:01.571
<v Speaker 2>You tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2995
02:10:01.571 --> 02:10:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know shit either.</v>

2996
02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I would always think that the negatives</v>
<v Speaker 2>are important.</v>

2997
02:10:05.110 --> 02:10:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean the negatives for me are very</v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

2998
02:10:06.821 --> 02:10:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Like for Chin ups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go way slower going down.</v>

2999
02:10:10.571 --> 02:10:14.140
<v Speaker 2>It seems like every six months there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole new philosophy on I'm strength I</v>

3000
02:10:14.141 --> 02:10:15.760
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally the opposite of the last</v>

3001
02:10:15.761 --> 02:10:16.630
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>

3002
02:10:16.830 --> 02:10:19.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like now the big thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know with intermittent fasting it's</v>

3003
02:10:19.811 --> 02:10:20.381
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3004
02:10:20.381 --> 02:10:23.950
<v Speaker 2>there's all these diets and eat this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gluten that and all that and then now</v>

3005
02:10:23.951 --> 02:10:27.130
<v Speaker 2>the new diet is donated for 18 hours and</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3006
02:10:27.131 --> 02:10:29.080
<v Speaker 2>it's not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy,</v>

3007
02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:30.460
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit works.</v>

3008
02:10:30.461 --> 02:10:34.380
<v Speaker 2>You know what's great about that is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you have</v>

3009
02:10:34.510 --> 02:10:39.510
<v Speaker 3>a time every day where you can have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most fabulous meal ever.</v>

3010
02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Cause when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I eat,</v>

3011
02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:46.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm starving and salads taste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So good luck.</v>

3012
02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:49.750
<v Speaker 3>I want a big key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I of a double salad.</v>

3013
02:10:50.170 --> 02:10:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're not,</v>

3014
02:10:51.650 --> 02:10:54.020
<v Speaker 3>when you're not that hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it fee it now.</v>

3015
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Now I feel like if I'm not that hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to waste a meal because</v>

3016
02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.280
<v Speaker 3>it's so much better when you're starving</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're out of control.</v>

3017
02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:03.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat that way most of the time,</v>

3018
02:11:03.741 --> 02:11:07.340
<v Speaker 3>except on days when I know I have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>really brutal workout in the morning,</v>

3019
02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:10.070
<v Speaker 3>like a weight lift and work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll run fasted,</v>

3020
02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll do yoga fasted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I'm going to lift,</v>

3021
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:16.160
<v Speaker 3>I want to have something I need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need some fruit or some,</v>

3022
02:11:16.161 --> 02:11:19.730
<v Speaker 3>it's almost three right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't eaten at all and I'm fine.</v>

3023
02:11:19.731 --> 02:11:22.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3024
02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:23.150
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

3025
02:11:23.151 --> 02:11:25.550
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting diet.</v>

3026
02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:28.610
<v Speaker 3>I hope it isn't bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3027
02:11:28.611 --> 02:11:31.400
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely not bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was never a morning person either.</v>

3028
02:11:31.401 --> 02:11:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Like I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never really looked forward to</v>

3029
02:11:34.371 --> 02:11:37.730
<v Speaker 3>breakfast was always add and have I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>protein bar or something just cause I</v>

3030
02:11:37.731 --> 02:11:39.950
<v Speaker 3>had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you ever listen to my podcast?</v>

3031
02:11:39.951 --> 02:11:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I did with Dom D'agostino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a scientist from,</v>

3032
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.120
<v Speaker 3>I think he's University of Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3033
02:11:46.150 --> 02:11:48.620
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a key to genic specialist does a lot of</v>

3034
02:11:48.621 --> 02:11:52.850
<v Speaker 3>Quito research and research on fasting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the benefits of fasting and he goes</v>

3035
02:11:52.851 --> 02:11:55.520
<v Speaker 3>into the scientific benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the proven benefits of fasting.</v>

3036
02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very interesting stuff.</v>

3037
02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:57.770
<v Speaker 3>What did he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were,</v>

3038
02:11:57.770 --> 02:12:00.950
<v Speaker 3>what were the most I would really want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to direct you to that.</v>

3039
02:12:00.951 --> 02:12:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I want to fuck it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's for a preventative cancer.</v>

3040
02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:06.463
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3041
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Ketone bodies in the blood and crease</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive improvements.</v>

3042
02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:11.600
<v Speaker 3>I just think we eat too much.</v>

3043
02:12:12.070 --> 02:12:14.470
<v Speaker 3>We eat too much meat all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So easy to know.</v>

3044
02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:16.980
<v Speaker 3>I like watching TV and snacking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3045
02:12:17.110 --> 02:12:20.270
<v Speaker 3>watch a little netflix snacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all do.</v>

3046
02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:22.940
<v Speaker 3>But if I'm watching Netflix and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine o'clock at night,</v>

3047
02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I really shouldn't be eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it weird that like popcorn became</v>

3048
02:12:26.871 --> 02:12:30.230
<v Speaker 3>the official food watching movies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that weird?</v>

3049
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:33.530
<v Speaker 3>I know it's loud chewing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't hear dialogue and have no one</v>

3050
02:12:33.531 --> 02:12:34.364
<v Speaker 3>likes to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3051
02:12:34.570 --> 02:12:36.020
<v Speaker 3>let's go get some popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one,</v>

3052
02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:39.380
<v Speaker 3>no one ever looks for popcorn and less</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're at the movies.</v>

3053
02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:41.510
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it only time?</v>

3054
02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a Disneyland because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yay,</v>

3055
02:12:45.651 --> 02:12:48.170
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking and by that while I'm here too.</v>

3056
02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the circus movie,</v>

3057
02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:51.690
<v Speaker 3>circus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>circus,</v>

3058
02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:54.110
<v Speaker 3>popcorn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>circus got peanuts into the mix.</v>

3059
02:12:54.230 --> 02:12:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's something about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>popcorn that like it's like genetically</v>

3060
02:12:57.711 --> 02:13:00.530
<v Speaker 3>modified and it's like it helps with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3061
02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:03.050
<v Speaker 3>with the brainwashing just in the palm</v>
<v Speaker 3>court.</v>

3062
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably do up to microwave,</v>

3063
02:13:05.331 --> 02:13:06.164
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

3064
02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:08.870
<v Speaker 3>They might exact curls and it fucks with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your head Bro.</v>

3065
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Basically microwave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kill everything.</v>

3066
02:13:12.621 --> 02:13:13.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you might go into your food,</v>

3067
02:13:13.791 --> 02:13:16.250
<v Speaker 3>you basically just don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

3068
02:13:16.450 --> 02:13:17.260
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop,</v>

3069
02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:17.910
<v Speaker 3>pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not hung.</v>

3070
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Survived in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3071
02:13:19.630 --> 02:13:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it crazy that we haven't really</v>
<v Speaker 3>improved upon micro?</v>

3072
02:13:22.561 --> 02:13:26.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like they mastered that shit 40</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and it's still the same</v>

3073
02:13:26.361 --> 02:13:28.550
<v Speaker 3>goddamn micro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's really bad for you and</v>

3074
02:13:28.551 --> 02:13:30.620
<v Speaker 3>they're going to take out of microwave</v>
<v Speaker 3>popcorn.</v>

3075
02:13:30.621 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 3>When you get popcorn,</v>

3076
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:35.580
<v Speaker 1>there's fats in there that your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't know what the fuck to do</v>

3077
02:13:35.581 --> 02:13:37.200
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where those things could sit on a</v>

3078
02:13:37.201 --> 02:13:39.120
<v Speaker 1>shelf for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those little packets,</v>

3079
02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

3080
02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:44.340
<v Speaker 1>What is the toxic ingredient in</v>
<v Speaker 1>microwave popcorn that they're</v>

3081
02:13:44.341 --> 02:13:45.810
<v Speaker 1>eliminating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

3082
02:13:45.811 --> 02:13:46.541
<v Speaker 1>They decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3083
02:13:46.541 --> 02:13:48.630
<v Speaker 1>this shit kills you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to let you sell it for</v>

3084
02:13:48.631 --> 02:13:52.710
<v Speaker 1>two more years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't just make it illegal.</v>

3085
02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:55.020
<v Speaker 1>They made a moratorium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's trans fats.</v>

3086
02:13:55.021 --> 02:13:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it just might be a vegetable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oil Fats.</v>

3087
02:13:58.770 --> 02:14:01.110
<v Speaker 1>There's certain certain trans fats that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just,</v>

3088
02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:05.210
<v Speaker 1>your body's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is this non food?</v>

3089
02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:07.110
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making me.</v>

3090
02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about delicious protein</v>

3091
02:14:10.531 --> 02:14:13.320
<v Speaker 1>bars before the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gives you the most unbelievable</v>

3092
02:14:13.321 --> 02:14:15.660
<v Speaker 1>farts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I know I shouldn't be eating,</v>

3093
02:14:15.670 --> 02:14:18.390
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm eating something and I'm just</v>

3094
02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:22.110
<v Speaker 1>lighten the inside of my car on fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical here it is.</v>

3095
02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Chemicals used in aligning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>microwaveable popcorn bags including</v>

3096
02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:31.280
<v Speaker 1>look per fluoro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3097
02:14:31.890 --> 02:14:36.210
<v Speaker 1>acid or Pfo are part of a class of</v>
<v Speaker 1>compounds that may be linked to</v>

3098
02:14:36.211 --> 02:14:39.030
<v Speaker 1>infertility and humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to a recent study from Ucla</v>

3099
02:14:39.210 --> 02:14:41.700
<v Speaker 1>and animal testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chemicals caused liver cancer,</v>

3100
02:14:41.701 --> 02:14:45.030
<v Speaker 1>tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testicular cancer and pancreatic cancer.</v>

3101
02:14:45.450 --> 02:14:48.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that they banned trans fats.</v>

3102
02:14:48.751 --> 02:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I might have conflated the two stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that,</v>

3103
02:14:51.130 --> 02:14:54.570
<v Speaker 1>cause what is the ban of trans fats is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one where they're giving them like</v>

3104
02:14:54.571 --> 02:14:59.571
<v Speaker 1>all the like hostess cakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those bullshit cakes that sit on the</v>

3105
02:14:59.731 --> 02:15:02.370
<v Speaker 1>shelf forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ding dongs are my favorite.</v>

3106
02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

3107
02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:07.070
<v Speaker 1>those pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those pie cakes that you get from hosted</v>

3108
02:15:07.071 --> 02:15:10.800
<v Speaker 1>to like the lemon filling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are just trans fats to the gills.</v>

3109
02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Twinkie method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They last 20 years or whatever.</v>

3110
02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:19.170
<v Speaker 1>How long do they last?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twinkie like you and I were laying</v>

3111
02:15:19.171 --> 02:15:21.750
<v Speaker 1>around in fucking bored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoked a little weed,</v>

3112
02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:23.220
<v Speaker 1>watching some TV and up to God.</v>

3113
02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm so hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he got here,</v>

3114
02:15:24.571 --> 02:15:28.800
<v Speaker 1>man cabinet and you had like ring dings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twinkies and my grab a twinkie.</v>

3115
02:15:28.990 --> 02:15:32.820
<v Speaker 1>If I'm starving laying around watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival chillin,</v>

3116
02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I might eat a twinkie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are like the worst wedding cake.</v>

3117
02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:36.811
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3118
02:15:36.811 --> 02:15:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you know what I had last night at</v>
<v Speaker 1>strawberry shortcake,</v>

3119
02:15:39.210 --> 02:15:44.040
<v Speaker 1>US popcorn makers could face long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive road to lose trans fats.</v>

3120
02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I conflated it.</v>

3121
02:15:47.130 --> 02:15:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Microwave popcorn makers could face a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long and difficult task.</v>

3122
02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Ridding their snacks of trans fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>US Food and Drug Administration proposal</v>

3123
02:15:55.051 --> 02:15:59.520
<v Speaker 1>to ban the additive goes into effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you s is banning.</v>

3124
02:15:59.521 --> 02:16:02.880
<v Speaker 1>So the u s ban on Trans Fats is what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3125
02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:07.280
<v Speaker 1>what I got confused with us ban on trans</v>
<v Speaker 1>fats is like a,</v>

3126
02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:09.390
<v Speaker 1>they're given these people like two</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

3127
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy that they're there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to make it a big deal out</v>

3128
02:16:12.841 --> 02:16:13.140
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>

3129
02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:15.990
<v Speaker 1>They're going after the trans fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't go after like,</v>

3130
02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:17.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like real shit.</v>

3131
02:16:17.641 --> 02:16:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Like alcohol is like killing people all</v>
<v Speaker 1>day every day.</v>

3132
02:16:21.031 --> 02:16:21.631
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3133
02:16:21.631 --> 02:16:22.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

3134
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:25.260
<v Speaker 1>why don't you say this is going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>you if you keep eating it,</v>

3135
02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:28.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's awesome but you're going after</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans fats.</v>

3136
02:16:28.270 --> 02:16:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's like someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone in the popcorn industry just</v>

3137
02:16:31.031 --> 02:16:33.580
<v Speaker 1>pissed off and I illuminati Mammogram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where to go after him.</v>

3138
02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:35.140
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this like a smear campaign?</v>

3139
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Trans Fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger?</v>

3140
02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:39.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bad for you once they know</v>

3141
02:16:39.041 --> 02:16:41.200
<v Speaker 1>they're bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about just take him,</v>

3142
02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:44.590
<v Speaker 1>what about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one drug that everyone's getting</v>

3143
02:16:44.591 --> 02:16:46.550
<v Speaker 1>addicted to that's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a Carolyn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's morphine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3147
02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:53.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3148
02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Very popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very popular prescription.</v>

3149
02:16:57.190 --> 02:17:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Oxycontin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxycontin for sure.</v>

3150
02:17:00.310 --> 02:17:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck your life up 100% but he have</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious pain.</v>

3151
02:17:03.881 --> 02:17:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It also leaves yeates pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

3152
02:17:06.221 --> 02:17:08.460
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you just write it for a few and</v>

3153
02:17:08.461 --> 02:17:11.020
<v Speaker 1>they're going after trans fats here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3154
02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Let them have their popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Aa.</v>

3155
02:17:14.831 --> 02:17:17.140
<v Speaker 1>They're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making like news articles about</v>

3156
02:17:17.141 --> 02:17:18.790
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] after Trans Fat.</v>

3157
02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:21.400
<v Speaker 1>What about the 800 kids that go missing</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year?</v>

3158
02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:22.520
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you cold weld?</v>

3159
02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Different people go look for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3160
02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:26.380
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these are different people.</v>

3161
02:17:26.381 --> 02:17:30.340
<v Speaker 1>These are food scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the point is that this stuff</v>

3162
02:17:30.370 --> 02:17:32.530
<v Speaker 1>that there's other ways to make food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>

3163
02:17:32.531 --> 02:17:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what is the benefits of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trans Fats?</v>

3164
02:17:34.631 --> 02:17:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Does it make processing easier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3165
02:17:36.341 --> 02:17:39.190
<v Speaker 1>why do they use that as opposed to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>other healthy fats?</v>

3166
02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably has something to do with</v>

3167
02:17:42.131 --> 02:17:43.750
<v Speaker 1>shelf life maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3168
02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:45.790
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why it fucks you up too.</v>

3169
02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:47.950
<v Speaker 1>You got to think about what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>preservative is.</v>

3170
02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:49.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone was explaining,</v>

3171
02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>did you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3172
02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:52.780
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with wheat or what's with</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheat?</v>

3173
02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they were talking about roundup</v>

3174
02:17:56.231 --> 02:17:58.990
<v Speaker 1>and glyphosate and they were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about roundup,</v>

3175
02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:01.810
<v Speaker 1>this stuff that they spray on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants that they said,</v>

3176
02:18:01.811 --> 02:18:04.960
<v Speaker 1>well don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this only affects a bacteria.</v>

3177
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they said that,</v>

3178
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:07.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>

3179
02:18:07.211 --> 02:18:09.820
<v Speaker 1>they were creating it and this is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reasons why they allowed it to be</v>

3180
02:18:09.821 --> 02:18:11.320
<v Speaker 1>used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they are explaining in this</v>

3181
02:18:11.321 --> 02:18:12.430
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

3182
02:18:12.431 --> 02:18:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they were explaining was,</v>

3183
02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:17.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have bacteria in your body dummy.</v>

3184
02:18:17.350 --> 02:18:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you're taking this stuff into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

3185
02:18:19.151 --> 02:18:21.640
<v Speaker 1>They didn't say it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have bacteria in your body.</v>

3186
02:18:21.641 --> 02:18:24.070
<v Speaker 1>You're taking this stuff into your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>that only kills bacteria.</v>

3187
02:18:24.250 --> 02:18:28.570
<v Speaker 1>It's going to kill a part of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your body is partly bacteria.</v>

3188
02:18:28.690 --> 02:18:31.000
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more bacteria cells in your body</v>

3189
02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:32.320
<v Speaker 1>than there are human cells.</v>

3190
02:18:32.630 --> 02:18:36.850
<v Speaker 1>That's just a fact of being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a crazy thing that they don't</v>

3191
02:18:36.851 --> 02:18:40.930
<v Speaker 1>know that and they either know it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did it anyway or they didn't know</v>

3192
02:18:40.931 --> 02:18:43.300
<v Speaker 1>that in which the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you were saying earlier,</v>

3193
02:18:43.330 --> 02:18:46.540
<v Speaker 1>they should have no business telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>people what's the good science and the</v>

3194
02:18:46.541 --> 02:18:48.880
<v Speaker 1>bad science if they allow that to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

3195
02:18:48.881 --> 02:18:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another example of bad science.</v>

3196
02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's definitely example of maybe</v>

3197
02:18:53.351 --> 02:18:55.930
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know when they first came up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the stuff,</v>

3198
02:18:56.180 --> 02:19:00.430
<v Speaker 1>but as technology has advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they haven't eliminated it either way.</v>

3199
02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Whether they didn't know or they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>know and there was a diabolical plan,</v>

3200
02:19:04.450 --> 02:19:05.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

3201
02:19:05.561 --> 02:19:08.890
<v Speaker 1>it's that science is bogus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3202
02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:12.940
<v Speaker 1>but should you be allowed like we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet cokes,</v>

3203
02:19:12.941 --> 02:19:15.130
<v Speaker 1>terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should you be allowed to sell diet coke</v>

3204
02:19:15.970 --> 02:19:18.100
<v Speaker 1>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just most do most people know how</v>

3205
02:19:18.101 --> 02:19:20.800
<v Speaker 1>bad diet coke is for you or Diet Soda?</v>

3206
02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I should say the most people know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't.</v>

3207
02:19:24.010 --> 02:19:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

3208
02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Mostly Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a diet every now and again</v>

3209
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:30.410
<v Speaker 1>once a month or so I'll have a diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>coke.</v>

3210
02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I been pretty good at keeping sodas at</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life now.</v>

3211
02:19:33.870 --> 02:19:35.450
<v Speaker 1>We discovered a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pellegrino.</v>

3212
02:19:36.130 --> 02:19:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pellegrinos great.</v>

3213
02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just water.</v>

3214
02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to struggle with being at a</v>

3215
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:48.290
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and you're struggling with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I just drink water or can I get a</v>

3216
02:19:48.291 --> 02:19:49.790
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna have a coke and then I have to</v>

3217
02:19:49.791 --> 02:19:52.380
<v Speaker 1>coax and then I feel guilty all night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3218
02:19:52.580 --> 02:19:55.120
<v Speaker 1>that struggle went on my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

3219
02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I been drinking way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water.</v>

3220
02:19:56.660 --> 02:20:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Pellegrino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pellegrino that tie that in Perrier,</v>

3221
02:20:00.951 --> 02:20:03.950
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that satisfies me enough.</v>

3222
02:20:04.370 --> 02:20:07.010
<v Speaker 1>ZV is a good one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3223
02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:09.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of other like flavored</v>
<v Speaker 1>waters.</v>

3224
02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:10.850
<v Speaker 1>They're like more carbonated.</v>

3225
02:20:11.210 --> 02:20:12.800
<v Speaker 1>It's carbonated water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

3226
02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:15.710
<v Speaker 1>the Cla,</v>

3227
02:20:15.711 --> 02:20:16.940
<v Speaker 1>waters.</v>

02:20:16.941 --> 02:20:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Is that gonna is that gonna come out</v>

3230
02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:25.250

<v Speaker 1>The bubbles,</v>

3231
02:20:25.630 --> 02:20:26.930
<v Speaker 1>just as bad as soda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just not good for your,</v>

3234
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:35.420
<v Speaker 1>And carbonated water is bad for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth and mass amounts.</v>

3235
02:20:35.421 --> 02:20:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean like one or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not a bad thing.</v>

3236
02:20:37.340 --> 02:20:40.580
<v Speaker 1>So we'll just drink it about once it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets in your stomach that do the</v>

<v Speaker 1>bubbles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the bubbles like fuck you up.</v>

3238
02:20:43.311 --> 02:20:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Illuminati Bro.</v>

3239
02:20:44.841 --> 02:20:46.330
<v Speaker 1>They're all ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

3240
02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:50.750
<v Speaker 1>those ideas in those bubbles getting you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy into bonds.</v>

3241
02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:51.871
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

3242
02:20:51.871 --> 02:20:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Maybe maybe they find out that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble of your guns,</v>

3243
02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:57.110
<v Speaker 1>your system do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3244
02:20:57.111 --> 02:20:57.944
<v Speaker 1>bad for Ya.</v>

3245
02:20:58.140 --> 02:20:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3246
02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:00.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised.</v>

3247
02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I hope not shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely benign because I turned</v>

3248
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:05.960
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've heard about the shit out of it.</v>

3249
02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here along as it's playing carbonated</v>

3250
02:21:08.631 --> 02:21:10.790
<v Speaker 1>water with no added citric acid or</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>

3251
02:21:10.791 --> 02:21:13.310
<v Speaker 1>the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The process of carbonation is simple.</v>

3252
02:21:13.311 --> 02:21:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Addition of pasteurized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressurized carbon dioxide,</v>

3253
02:21:16.461 --> 02:21:19.580
<v Speaker 1>gas into plain water acids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugars and salt,</v>

3254
02:21:19.610 --> 02:21:22.790
<v Speaker 1>or not being added.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the addition of those ingredients</v>

3255
02:21:22.791 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 1>that ups your risk for tooth decay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no harm at all.</v>

3256
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:30.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's just carbonated water is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon dioxide gas or maybe that's an</v>

3257
02:21:30.651 --> 02:21:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3258
02:21:32.061 --> 02:21:33.710
<v Speaker 1>stop freaking me out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3259
02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Did you know the funguses fucking like</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms?</v>

3260
02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:39.560
<v Speaker 1>They breathe in oxygen and breathe out</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon dioxide like we do.</v>

3261
02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Does that make it make it good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an animal more than it is like</v>

3262
02:21:43.521 --> 02:21:44.354
<v Speaker 1>a plant.</v>

3263
02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:46.310
<v Speaker 1>They're closer to animals than they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>to plants.</v>

3264
02:21:46.990 --> 02:21:49.490
<v Speaker 1>A fungus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fungus or like an animal.</v>

3265
02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really because it doesn't move.</v>

3266
02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:54.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's closer to the animal wrangler</v>

3267
02:21:54.171 --> 02:21:56.530
<v Speaker 1>moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3268
02:21:56.920 --> 02:21:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that fungus.</v>

3269
02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:00.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst.</v>

3270
02:22:00.531 --> 02:22:05.360
<v Speaker 1>But like mushrooms are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some sort of other thing.</v>

3271
02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:08.840
<v Speaker 1>They're not a plant funguses and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different kind of thing,</v>

3272
02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:14.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from another fucking planet,</v>

3273
02:22:14.541 --> 02:22:15.374
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

3274
02:22:15.470 --> 02:22:18.050
<v Speaker 1>You think mushrooms aren't legal right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

3275
02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:21.830
<v Speaker 1>There's that recreational mushrooms are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ballot for 2000 coming California.</v>

3276
02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Any states already legalized my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they should.</v>

3277
02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:26.430
<v Speaker 1>They should do it the same way they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

3278
02:22:26.430 --> 02:22:27.850
<v Speaker 2>they're going to eventually do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mtma.</v>

3279
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms are great,</v>

3280
02:22:29.650 --> 02:22:32.880
<v Speaker 2>and remember the first time you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember the first time you and I</v>

3281
02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:34.530
<v Speaker 2>did mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were living at your old house.</v>

3282
02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:36.650
<v Speaker 2>We were chilling in the backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3283
02:22:36.770 --> 02:22:39.750
<v Speaker 2>and we to do the talking about life</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't that much.</v>

3284
02:22:39.751 --> 02:22:42.750
<v Speaker 2>It a small dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was enough to go whoa.</v>

3285
02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Like it just gave me a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

3286
02:22:44.610 --> 02:22:48.360
<v Speaker 2>It's just opened up my mind to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

3287
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:53.630
<v Speaker 2>I was relying on all the patterns that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had been explained to me about life to</v>

3288
02:22:54.991 --> 02:22:59.250
<v Speaker 2>be correct instead of like looking at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>with fresh eyes.</v>

3289
02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:01.890
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like at 30 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the first time I was able to look</v>

3290
02:23:01.891 --> 02:23:04.020
<v Speaker 2>at my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life with fresh eyes,</v>

3291
02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:05.520
<v Speaker 2>look at life itself and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3292
02:23:05.521 --> 02:23:09.300
<v Speaker 2>this is just this weird temporary</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience eating your comedy,</v>

3293
02:23:09.301 --> 02:23:10.110
<v Speaker 2>tear your comedy.</v>

3294
02:23:10.110 --> 02:23:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3295
02:23:11.580 --> 02:23:14.430
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the early Joe Rogan,</v>

3296
02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:16.980
<v Speaker 2>like your first CD somebody someday I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be dead.</v>

3297
02:23:16.981 --> 02:23:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be dead someday.</v>

3298
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:20.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be dead someday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From that comedy to the once you started</v>

3299
02:23:20.971 --> 02:23:23.730
<v Speaker 2>getting into psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big o difference.</v>

3300
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changes who you are cause well,</v>

3301
02:23:25.831 --> 02:23:30.120
<v Speaker 2>it also makes you super humble because</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if I don't appear humble,</v>

3302
02:23:30.470 --> 02:23:31.171
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

3303
02:23:31.171 --> 02:23:34.800
<v Speaker 2>when you get hit by that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the big dose,</v>

3304
02:23:34.830 --> 02:23:36.510
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt or whatever you do,</v>

3305
02:23:36.511 --> 02:23:39.500
<v Speaker 2>when you get hit by that dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize you are just a part.</v>

3306
02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:44.040
<v Speaker 2>You're not the big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a part of something that is</v>

3307
02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:47.730
<v Speaker 2>indescribably big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that you're important or</v>

3308
02:23:47.731 --> 02:23:49.770
<v Speaker 2>that you're the most significant thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>around you,</v>

3309
02:23:49.771 --> 02:23:52.440
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you gotta do your best to keep your</v>

3310
02:23:52.441 --> 02:23:56.880
<v Speaker 2>body alive and do your best to do your</v>
<v Speaker 2>part and whatever the fuck you do for a</v>

3311
02:23:56.881 --> 02:23:58.200
<v Speaker 2>living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do your best at that.</v>

3312
02:23:58.200 --> 02:24:01.470
<v Speaker 2>But you're just a part of something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's infinite.</v>

3313
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Did your experience with mushrooms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dmt,</v>

3314
02:24:07.290 --> 02:24:11.640
<v Speaker 2>did that make you think like there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotta be a creator to all this?</v>

3315
02:24:12.930 --> 02:24:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Not that there's a creator like a guy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lab.</v>

3316
02:24:15.630 --> 02:24:20.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like making a person inside of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking yes to not not a creator in a</v>

3317
02:24:20.671 --> 02:24:22.890
<v Speaker 2>sense of an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the idea of an</v>

3318
02:24:22.891 --> 02:24:25.830
<v Speaker 2>individual became more ridiculous than</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

3319
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:29.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like I understand that like what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are is almost like something filtered</v>

3320
02:24:29.551 --> 02:24:33.060
<v Speaker 2>through these predetermined like almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're a membrane,</v>

3321
02:24:33.061 --> 02:24:37.890
<v Speaker 2>like something from another dimension</v>
<v Speaker 2>expresses itself through this physical</v>

3322
02:24:37.891 --> 02:24:42.540
<v Speaker 2>membrane and then we're almost like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>barrier to what comes out on the other</v>

3323
02:24:42.541 --> 02:24:45.480
<v Speaker 2>side that this was the thought that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had when I was on mushrooms,</v>

3324
02:24:45.780 --> 02:24:50.780
<v Speaker 2>that what we are as as as a person is</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like the the carrier,</v>

3325
02:24:51.900 --> 02:24:56.900
<v Speaker 2>like a vehicle for whatever a soul is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that this thing uses this life to</v>

3326
02:24:57.481 --> 02:25:01.050
<v Speaker 2>pass that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing through onto another</v>

3327
02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:06.200
<v Speaker 2>experience that happens in the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>dimension that'll be so fucking alien</v>

3328
02:25:06.451 --> 02:25:10.200
<v Speaker 2>that you can't even imagine it today in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dimension and this dimension would</v>

3329
02:25:10.201 --> 02:25:14.460
<v Speaker 2>be alien to that dimension that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this never ending infinite process</v>

3330
02:25:14.461 --> 02:25:15.570
<v Speaker 2>of soul traveling.</v>

3331
02:25:15.570 --> 02:25:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I had this very bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thought about like if you,</v>

3332
02:25:19.410 --> 02:25:22.290
<v Speaker 2>like people will often say like if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to live your life over again,</v>

3333
02:25:22.470 --> 02:25:24.100
<v Speaker 2>you are born tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to do</v>

3334
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:25.270
<v Speaker 1>it all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you do it?</v>

3335
02:25:25.271 --> 02:25:26.104
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3336
02:25:26.650 --> 02:25:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to start over from scratch.</v>

3337
02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:32.710
<v Speaker 1>How can I be a baby again and rely on</v>
<v Speaker 1>those same fucking people again?</v>

3338
02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go back to first grade.</v>

3339
02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:38.770
<v Speaker 1>That was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when my parents broke up and Oh,</v>

3340
02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:40.240
<v Speaker 1>and people start freaking out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

3341
02:25:40.241 --> 02:25:41.920
<v Speaker 1>but you already did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already did it.</v>

3342
02:25:41.921 --> 02:25:44.080
<v Speaker 1>What'd you have to do it forever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you do it forever,</v>

3343
02:25:44.110 --> 02:25:46.960
<v Speaker 1>forever and ever and ever over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over and over and over again.</v>

3344
02:25:47.050 --> 02:25:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Could you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like reincarnation?</v>

3345
02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:52.000
<v Speaker 1>You might be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be just as possible.</v>

3346
02:25:52.001 --> 02:25:52.870
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what hit me?</v>

3347
02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Is this just as possible that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived this life and infinite number of</v>

3348
02:25:56.861 --> 02:25:59.680
<v Speaker 1>times and you can continue to live this</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and in front number of times.</v>

3349
02:25:59.710 --> 02:26:02.230
<v Speaker 1>And when you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe so you're saying there's a</v>

3350
02:26:02.231 --> 02:26:04.330
<v Speaker 1>possibility that we have some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul type thing,</v>

3351
02:26:04.331 --> 02:26:06.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some kind of sauce ability that you're</v>

3352
02:26:06.431 --> 02:26:08.320
<v Speaker 1>on a loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like those,</v>

3353
02:26:08.350 --> 02:26:10.750
<v Speaker 1>those youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are those a instagram videos,</v>

3354
02:26:10.751 --> 02:26:11.800
<v Speaker 1>a Cyborg hitting that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3355
02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:13.620
<v Speaker 1>that sweep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're on a lifeline.</v>

3356
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:16.980
<v Speaker 3>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there is a loop and it say either,</v>

3357
02:26:17.310 --> 02:26:22.200
<v Speaker 3>either it's involuntary or voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either you say either when you die,</v>

3358
02:26:22.201 --> 02:26:23.460
<v Speaker 3>you wake up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

3359
02:26:23.461 --> 02:26:25.530
<v Speaker 3>that was an awesome ride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it again.</v>

3360
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:29.220
<v Speaker 3>Or it just happens automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you did you get the choice either</v>

3361
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:30.031
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you do,</v>

3362
02:26:30.031 --> 02:26:32.610
<v Speaker 3>maybe you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some spiritual gurus say that,</v>

3363
02:26:32.611 --> 02:26:34.290
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people choose,</v>

3364
02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:38.490
<v Speaker 3>some souls choose to keep coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some stay in the infinite heavens</v>

3365
02:26:38.491 --> 02:26:41.280
<v Speaker 3>forever or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then come back some every now and</v>

3366
02:26:41.281 --> 02:26:42.540
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what's real.</v>

3367
02:26:42.541 --> 02:26:43.530
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3368
02:26:43.770 --> 02:26:45.450
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about there's some kind</v>

3369
02:26:45.451 --> 02:26:48.800
<v Speaker 3>of soul thing and there's either a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pro,</v>

3370
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:49.261
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3371
02:26:49.261 --> 02:26:54.020
<v Speaker 3>you're saying that this probably an</v>
<v Speaker 3>involuntary reincarnation of some sort.</v>

3372
02:26:54.090 --> 02:26:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3373
02:26:55.310 --> 02:26:56.840
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe possible.</v>

3374
02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe either if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you decide to come back for sure.</v>

3375
02:27:03.811 --> 02:27:06.270
<v Speaker 3>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would,</v>

3376
02:27:06.570 --> 02:27:07.170
<v Speaker 3>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3377
02:27:07.170 --> 02:27:09.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going back in to that earth realm</v>

3378
02:27:10.410 --> 02:27:15.410
<v Speaker 3>and you for sure don't want to know</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you came from that it would seem,</v>

3379
02:27:16.231 --> 02:27:19.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing that the beauty of life is</v>
<v Speaker 3>after you dying,</v>

3380
02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:20.850
<v Speaker 3>you realize what the hell.</v>

3381
02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:21.743
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

3382
02:27:21.930 --> 02:27:24.090
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to know.</v>

3383
02:27:24.091 --> 02:27:25.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like watching a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm,</v>

3384
02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:29.010
<v Speaker 3>the other day I watched a movie and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching the trailer and 30 seconds into</v>

3385
02:27:29.011 --> 02:27:32.940
<v Speaker 3>the trailers unsane the movie at 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds I stopped it because I didn't</v>

3386
02:27:32.941 --> 02:27:34.830
<v Speaker 3>want to watch the rest of the trailer</v>
<v Speaker 3>because now,</v>

3387
02:27:34.890 --> 02:27:36.180
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got enough.</v>

3388
02:27:36.210 --> 02:27:38.610
<v Speaker 3>I want to see this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to see more of the trial</v>

3389
02:27:38.730 --> 02:27:40.800
<v Speaker 3>because I wanted to go to the movie and</v>
<v Speaker 3>be full.</v>

3390
02:27:40.801 --> 02:27:44.520
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be confused,</v>

3391
02:27:44.580 --> 02:27:45.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to fit,</v>

3392
02:27:45.721 --> 02:27:47.220
<v Speaker 3>be able to figure something out from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>trailer.</v>

3393
02:27:47.490 --> 02:27:49.260
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and most people are like that.</v>

3394
02:27:49.261 --> 02:27:51.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you went to a movie and you</v>

3395
02:27:51.391 --> 02:27:54.480
<v Speaker 3>already saw your buddy didn't and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>told them how it ended,</v>

3396
02:27:54.481 --> 02:27:56.910
<v Speaker 3>he would sock you right in the chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you doing.</v>

3397
02:27:56.940 --> 02:27:58.560
<v Speaker 3>You just ruined the movie from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Faggot.</v>

3398
02:27:58.890 --> 02:27:59.850
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strong word.</v>

3399
02:27:59.851 --> 02:28:01.620
<v Speaker 3>But I mean that I don't mean that in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>homosexual.</v>

3400
02:28:01.621 --> 02:28:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to be funny and I</v>

3401
02:28:03.691 --> 02:28:06.120
<v Speaker 3>apologize to all gay people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I apologize.</v>

3402
02:28:06.121 --> 02:28:07.980
<v Speaker 3>I love gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love gay people.</v>

3403
02:28:08.470 --> 02:28:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was just me trying to express an</v>

3404
02:28:10.561 --> 02:28:12.030
<v Speaker 3>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a,</v>

3405
02:28:12.031 --> 02:28:14.550
<v Speaker 3>and no one's also at the same time going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go to a movie with the,</v>

3406
02:28:14.551 --> 02:28:16.860
<v Speaker 3>have you already signed say dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before it starts telling me the whole</v>

3407
02:28:16.861 --> 02:28:18.100
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Better</v>

3408
02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:20.410
<v Speaker 1>analogies that you never get a chance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the future.</v>

3409
02:28:20.650 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get a chance to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future</v>

3410
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:24.410
<v Speaker 3>once you're reborn again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This life when you come back,</v>

3411
02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:26.450
<v Speaker 3>do you want to have a memory of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>past and you don't,</v>

3412
02:28:26.451 --> 02:28:28.790
<v Speaker 3>you don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a part of the system.</v>

3413
02:28:29.010 --> 02:28:32.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it's either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's voluntary or involuntary,</v>

3414
02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:36.530
<v Speaker 3>it's best to not know where you came</v>
<v Speaker 3>from at first.</v>

3415
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:41.390
<v Speaker 3>It's best to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably what this is all about</v>

3416
02:28:41.391 --> 02:28:43.070
<v Speaker 3>is figuring it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause when we go to the movie,</v>

3417
02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:45.800
<v Speaker 3>part of it is it's all about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>journey.</v>

3418
02:28:45.801 --> 02:28:48.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the destination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People always use that as a,</v>

3419
02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:49.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an instagram.</v>

3420
02:28:49.161 --> 02:28:51.500
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the journey or thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the destination.</v>

3421
02:28:51.501 --> 02:28:54.500
<v Speaker 3>It's the journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the most popular saying</v>

3422
02:28:54.501 --> 02:28:57.110
<v Speaker 3>it's ever and it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to say it every now and then to</v>

3423
02:28:57.111 --> 02:28:58.640
<v Speaker 3>remind you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remind the rum.</v>

3424
02:28:58.740 --> 02:29:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Well My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing to remind you,</v>

3425
02:29:00.141 --> 02:29:01.490
<v Speaker 3>you don't even think about it as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>journey.</v>

3426
02:29:01.490 --> 02:29:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Just be in the moment except the moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and be in the moment.</v>

3427
02:29:04.731 --> 02:29:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Live in the moment thinking about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future plan for the future,</v>

3428
02:29:07.221 --> 02:29:08.930
<v Speaker 3>but exist in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3429
02:29:08.931 --> 02:29:10.940
<v Speaker 3>don't think of it as a journey or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>destination,</v>

3430
02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:13.940
<v Speaker 3>but the people that are the most fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the people that are trying to make it</v>

3431
02:29:14.370 --> 02:29:16.300
<v Speaker 3>one day I'm going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you make,</v>

3432
02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:17.930
<v Speaker 3>there's no making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never happens.</v>

3433
02:29:17.970 --> 02:29:18.950
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't change.</v>

3434
02:29:19.630 --> 02:29:21.980
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if you're an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fell for it.</v>

3435
02:29:21.981 --> 02:29:23.570
<v Speaker 3>Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>line and sinker.</v>

3436
02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The the wanting to be a rock star my</v>

3437
02:29:26.811 --> 02:29:28.670
<v Speaker 3>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got me good.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I wanted that man shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3439
02:29:30.651 --> 02:29:35.651
<v Speaker 3>I was going to have that mansion and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just filled with the shakes and that's</v>

3440
02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:39.380
<v Speaker 3>what I was after my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got me good.</v>

3441
02:29:39.381 --> 02:29:41.660
<v Speaker 3>When I saw kiss and I saw that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3442
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:43.400
<v Speaker 3>I want that.</v>

3443
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:44.241
<v Speaker 3>I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3444
02:29:44.241 --> 02:29:45.650
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I saw kiss meets the phantom of the</v>

3445
02:29:45.651 --> 02:29:48.230
<v Speaker 3>park,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1978 on NBC,</v>

3446
02:29:48.290 --> 02:29:53.290
<v Speaker 3>one of the worst movies of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just blew me the fuck.</v>

3447
02:29:53.350 --> 02:29:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a power outage.</v>

3448
02:29:56.680 --> 02:29:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I was watching it at home and the power</v>
<v Speaker 3>went out and I was devastated.</v>

3449
02:29:59.150 --> 02:30:03.350
<v Speaker 3>The weird thing about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Arrow's 1978 and if you followed</v>

3450
02:30:03.351 --> 02:30:04.450
<v Speaker 3>kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were older,</v>

3451
02:30:04.460 --> 02:30:07.610
<v Speaker 3>I was eight and if you followed kiss and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know from 73 on,</v>

3452
02:30:07.850 --> 02:30:12.850
<v Speaker 3>they already had their early cool years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then after kiss alive that a few</v>

3453
02:30:13.521 --> 02:30:17.180
<v Speaker 3>more awesome albums and then they got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point where I started doing disco</v>

3454
02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:21.320
<v Speaker 3>and that was 1978 that's when I got into</v>
<v Speaker 3>them when they started doing disco.</v>

3455
02:30:21.321 --> 02:30:23.330
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know what selling out was.</v>

3456
02:30:23.331 --> 02:30:25.430
<v Speaker 3>I just heard I was made for loving it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I loved it.</v>

3457
02:30:25.700 --> 02:30:26.930
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea.</v>

3458
02:30:27.260 --> 02:30:29.510
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3459
02:30:29.511 --> 02:30:30.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know where my fucking point</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

3460
02:30:30.951 --> 02:30:32.960
<v Speaker 3>What were we talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember either.</v>

3461
02:30:32.961 --> 02:30:36.050
<v Speaker 3>The point was you're never going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know what the future holds.</v>

3462
02:30:36.490 --> 02:30:39.470
<v Speaker 3>You just going to be living your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's how it is with everybody.</v>

3463
02:30:40.430 --> 02:30:41.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what the fuck your</v>
<v Speaker 3>point was.</v>

3464
02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Swallow the rockstar thing Roxanne to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rock star.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get your,</v>

3468
02:30:52.430 --> 02:30:53.660
<v Speaker 3>you get yourself too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3469
02:30:53.661 --> 02:30:54.820
<v Speaker 3>you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta think about what you're</v>

3470
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:55.740
<v Speaker 3>exposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look,</v>

3471
02:30:55.741 --> 02:30:56.840
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like music videos,</v>

3472
02:30:56.841 --> 02:30:58.760
<v Speaker 3>what they sell in music videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sell that.</v>

3473
02:30:58.761 --> 02:31:01.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're offering it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The book I got and a lot of those</v>

3474
02:31:01.971 --> 02:31:04.190
<v Speaker 3>rappers that are flashing on the cash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even their money.</v>

3475
02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:05.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not even there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their mansion.</v>

3476
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:10.990
<v Speaker 3>But it's pushing that you like pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you want to do whatever it takes,</v>

3477
02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:15.380
<v Speaker 3>whatever it takes to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so zeroed in on that,</v>

3478
02:31:15.381 --> 02:31:16.030
<v Speaker 3>you know me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3479
02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 3>Up until up until a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was zeroed in on it.</v>

3480
02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I began to realize,</v>

3481

<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got me real.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3483
02:31:25.111 --> 02:31:27.060
<v Speaker 3>I was obsessed with some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

3484
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:28.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an illusion.</v>

3485
02:31:28.410 --> 02:31:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Fame is an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obsessed with the destination instead of</v>

3486
02:31:31.651 --> 02:31:32.640
<v Speaker 3>the journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3487
02:31:32.940 --> 02:31:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed the journey,</v>

3488
02:31:34.261 --> 02:31:38.610
<v Speaker 3>but it was like you're obsessed with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all about conquering the music</v>

3489
02:31:38.611 --> 02:31:40.080
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all it was about.</v>

3490
02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:42.120
<v Speaker 3>And it's not about that anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

3491
02:31:42.121 --> 02:31:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God I sucked musically because if</v>

<v Speaker 3>back then,</v>

3494
02:31:50.701 --> 02:31:52.590

<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3495
02:31:52.590 --> 02:31:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Just I would have been to those parties</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the crazy mask and been doing.</v>

3496

<v Speaker 3>Thank God my music sucked because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have went along with all that shit</v>

3502
02:32:10.681 --> 02:32:14.580
<v Speaker 3>in my twenties I was so obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so obsessed with making it in the</v>

3503
02:32:14.581 --> 02:32:15.960
<v Speaker 3>music business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have did any of the home,</v>

3504
02:32:15.961 --> 02:32:20.070
<v Speaker 3>but you wouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gone part of the Jimmy Savile.</v>

3505
02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:23.460
<v Speaker 3>I would have been hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever was famous,</v>

3506
02:32:23.490 --> 02:32:25.700
<v Speaker 3>you know shares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3507
02:32:25.710 --> 02:32:28.770
<v Speaker 3>you know it's like retirement is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lesser example that people are always</v>

3508
02:32:28.771 --> 02:32:32.790
<v Speaker 3>looking to those golden years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day I'm going to retire and I with</v>

3509
02:32:32.791 --> 02:32:34.530
<v Speaker 3>our hands at the sunset like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3510
02:32:34.540 --> 02:32:38.370
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking about death then we</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do shit anymore.</v>

3511
02:32:38.470 --> 02:32:39.960

<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3512
02:32:39.961 --> 02:32:42.660
<v Speaker 3>The only time you should think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>retirement is if you have a job that you</v>

3513
02:32:42.661 --> 02:32:46.110
<v Speaker 3>can retire and they pay you still and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can go do whatever the fuck you</v>

3514
02:32:46.111 --> 02:32:47.430
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you should be thinking about</v>

3515
02:32:47.431 --> 02:32:49.740
<v Speaker 3>retiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But thinking about is this time where</v>

<v Speaker 3>destination is that they go far away at</v>

<v Speaker 3>beach?</v>

3532
02:33:32.730 --> 02:33:34.890
<v Speaker 3>The first thing you're going to do is</v>
<v Speaker 3>check to see if there's internet as the</v>

3533
02:33:34.891 --> 02:33:39.891

3537
02:33:51.150 --> 02:33:53.100
<v Speaker 3>deserted that you have your own deserted</v>
