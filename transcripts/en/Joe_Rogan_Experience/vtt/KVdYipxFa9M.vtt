1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
You know when you're ready.

2
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.780
<v 1>Yes.
Positive Energy.</v>

3
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.630
Yes.
You got it.

4
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.130
<v 2>We're live,
ladies and gentlemen,
we're live on a day where a,</v>

5
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:29.490
I saw a fucking mountain line on top of a telephone pole today.

6
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.250
Why not in real life?
Somebody said it to me on Twitter,

7
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.800
but it felt like I was there.
Have you fucking seen it?
Look at my,
on my Twitter,

8
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.630
Jamie,
there's a amount line.

9
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:44.631
It's stayed up on a telephone pole all day on Wednesday and then this morning it

10
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:48.780
came down but some s some screaming school kids,

11
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.530
friends of all school kids.

12
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.020
The idea that little kids could be so goddamn close to a murderous,

13
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.490
monstrous hundred 50 pound cat than it has to run up a pole.

14
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.720
And then the fact that it was up on that pole for an hour and a half and people

15
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:05.270
didn't have the good sense to a shooting.

16
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.150
Where was this ad isn't California?
Jesus?

17
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.460
What part of California?
Victorville.
Yeah.
You know,
that's like people live there.

18
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.490
Fuck that thing.
Oh my God,
look at its hanging out on top of a pole.

19
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:24.600
Like no big deal.

20
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.100
And I guess it's just going to climb down whether its claws imagined.

21
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.450
It's 150 pound animal that can climb trees with its claws.

22
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.070
Just runs up the top of that pole and sits up

23
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.900
<v 1>where it's totally chill.
Just hanging.</v>

24
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.020
There's no way for it to be electrocuted also cause there's no ground.

25
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:46.670
Is that why?
I don't know why that works.
Yeah.
I don't know how that works either.

26
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:49.860
It's like magic what?
Your foot's on the ground,
but yet that pulls on the ground.

27
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.490
It's always like don't touch the third rail.
Okay.
Well how's that work?

28
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.600
Is that just a,

29
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.210
was that just a rumor about the third rail on the railroad tracks?

30
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.760
I used to live on a railroad track pretty much as a kid.

31
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:02.540
We just played all day on railroad tracks,
put things in pennies,

32
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.410
got shot by the guys on the train.
They shot at you salt pellet guns.
Really?

33
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:07.621
Yeah.

34
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:10.290
Because you're not supposed to be on the train track and they like we would put

35
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:13.500
things on so they would just sit there and I think it was more just to scare you

36
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.250
but they would like shoot these like salt a bullets at you or something like

37
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:21.630
that.
A lot of people die by committing suicide of your train tracks.

38
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.230
Train tracks.
It's not,
that's not the third real.

39
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.910
The third rule is like subway stations.
It's not a train.

40
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.900
Train trucks are not electrical.
I mean the,
the uh,

41
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.950
the tracks just piece of metal.
Right.
The uh,

42
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.420
the real ones are the ones that are in subway somehow or another.
I don't know.

43
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.020
Like which ones are,
yeah,

44
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:40.230
cause that's actually electricity people have definitely died from that though.

45
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.270
They've definitely died from that I think.

46
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.880
Did you live by a train track growing up close enough?

47
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.720
I used to take the tea into Boston when I was a kid.

48
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.470
Like when I was in high school when we had a walk,
like,
like a mile or so.

49
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.060
It's sucked fucking hardcore in the winter though.
God Damn.

50
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.190
They're like,
when I think about winter today,
I think about the fact

51
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.520
<v 2>that,
uh,
people in Boston are just about to go through it.
Like right now,</v>

52
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:04.690
today's October 1st,

53
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.620
that means it's just going to start chilling out right now.

54
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.860
Now it's just going to start getting a little uncomfortable,
but not bad.

55
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.700
A little brisk,
not bad.
A little morning brisk get you a cup of coffee,

56
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.300
but there's a month where they're a month or two away from experiencing that

57
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.800
bone jarring cold that you only get in the northeast,
that wet,

58
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.930
wet ocean,
water cold.

59
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.010
Their world is different than our world,
man.

60
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.860
The world is different than our world.
When you go down there,

61
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.920
when you go to Boston,
you d do gigs up there in New Hampshire,

62
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.980
those are harder people.
They're just there.

63
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.940
They have to overcome way more shit.
Like the,
uh,

64
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.880
the stereotype of the California person,
like the slacker,

65
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.700
like you knew whatever dude,
it's new.
Big Deal Dude.

66
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.800
Like that's what people think of when they think of California.

67
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.570
It's cause we don't have to deal with that winter shit.
Yeah.
Well this one,

68
00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:58.000
or we might be dealing without Nina Super El Nino is what they're saying that

69
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:02.230
we're going to get.
I mean,
it has been humid as fuck out here lately.

70
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.950
I hope to write we need it.
Yeah,
I mean I think,
isn't that how it always works?

71
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:09.700
Unless things,
I say it always works,
but unless things turn into deserts,

72
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.920
because deserts didn't always used to be deserts.

73
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.960
Like I think even at the Sahara at one point in time was like lush and that was

74
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:20.540
a,
that's the whole take on,
uh,
the,
the,
the Sphinx,
like the,

75
00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:23.990
the guys who want to backdate the Sphinx,
they've done these,
uh,

76
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.140
the Da brought in these geologists,

77
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:31.141
specifically this guy named Doctor Robert Schoch from Boston University and he

78
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:34.990
thinks that the water erosion on the,
the,
the,

79
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:38.680
the container or the,
um,
uh,
the chamber,
the,

80
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.630
the temple,

81
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:44.080
this finks I think they're calling it and it's where they carve the sphinx out

82
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:45.140
of the ground.
The,

83
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.450
the whole temple area where the Sphinx is that there's these stones that are

84
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:53.020
carved,
that have all these water erosion marks all over them.

85
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.050
Like the deep fissures where water cuts through a crack and the and the rock and

86
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:00.250
does so for thousands of years.

87
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.420
So like this is like thousands of years of rainfall that's caused this water

88
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:04.931
erosion.

89
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:08.740
And the problem with that is the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley

90
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:13.480
was like 9,000 BC or 9,000 years ago,

91
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:15.400
I think it is.
So it's like 7,000 BC.

92
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:17.710
So that was like the last time there was rainfall there.

93
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.740
So it had been several thousand years before that of it raining on those rocks.

94
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:26.020
It create that kind of erosion before that place became a desert.

95
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.760
So that's the thing about California man,
it can easily become a desert.
Well,

96
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.240
there,
there was a,
uh,
it just sent your link.
Uh,
there was a cow,

97
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.200
a lake in California.
It's really popular.
I am in Westwood,
California.

98
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:42.580
Walter Lake the other day,
just overnight,
the whole lake drained out.

99
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.150
It emptied out there.
Was that,
that is true.
That's been proven.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a,

100
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:49.390
it's a saw that article and I thought,
well,
I don't know about this.
Is this real?

101
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:54.210
It was like one of those,
you know,
Bob's news reviews something?
Yeah.

102
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:57.880
It's got a website.
It was that Katie van actually went in there and re uh,
uh,

103
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.490
interviewed

104
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.420
<v 3>them and there thousands of fish.
They say,
I don't know if you saw the photos,</v>

105
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:06.950
it's just photos of tons of dead fish.
So what do they think happen?
Uh,

106
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.410
they pretty much just say we're out of water.

107
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.000
California lake disappears overnight.
Lee's behind thousands of fish.

108
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.850
Well that's like some Marky mark movie,
Apocalypse Shit.
Look at this.

109
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.510
There's a video right here.
Just that's fucked.
And this was like a,

110
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.940
I mean not,
this is not a small thing.
It's 170 acres.

111
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.570
A reservoir.
Wow.
170 acre reservoir,

112
00:06:30.571 --> 00:06:32.930
which is overnight.
Yeah.
And where'd the water go?

113
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:37.190
It just went in the hole I think.
Yeah.
Look,
I think it went down,

114
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.430
but how could it go down that low?
That quick?
I don't understand.

115
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.550
I think that's pretty much reservoir runs dry.
Wow.
There's nothing there.

116
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.510
Look at all those fish.
That's fucked.
God,
this is terrible way to die for them.

117
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.800
Yeah.
And I guess they could have a,
they said if they had a note,

118
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.730
like a two week notice,

119
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:59.480
they could have taken all the fish and saved them and moved them to another lake

120
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:03.530
or something like that.
But well,
did they drain this on purpose?
No,
they just,

121
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:07.090
it just pretty much emptied out.
It's like,

122
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.860
it's kind of confusing how they say it,
but they pretty much just say that.
No,
we,

123
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.760
they just,
we just,
it's just out of water.
We're in a drought,
you know?

124
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.000
That's just how fast it happens.
So it literally can happen like that overnight.

125
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:19.860
Yeah.
I don't understand that.
And why doesn't,
I don't understand that.

126
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.120
It doesn't make any sense to me,
but it's a shallow ass fucking lake though.

127
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.200
He believes that may have occurred when a clogged outlet valve was cleared.

128
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.120
<v 2>So literally the train was stuck.</v>

129
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.110
They opened up the drain and now here's your reservoir going through a creek.

130
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.750
That's what,
that's what's going on,
right?
Yeah.

131
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.080
There's a lot of lakes like that in California and they could easily run dry

132
00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:45.190
that lake Castaic.
That fucker is way smaller than it used to.

133
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.740
<v 3>You said you've been there,
that's a,
is there a place?</v>

134
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:50.480
It's the stay there that's I got,
cause I drove by it.
They recently

135
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.890
<v 2>people all the camp there.
There's parts where you're allowed to camp.</v>

136
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.740
Good fucking luck with that.
That's sketchy as fuck dude.

137
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.770
There's a lot of like there's places around lake a stick,

138
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.230
like a stag is real weird.
Like you get there and you're like,

139
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.820
are we in Guatemala?
Is this like a nomad?

140
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.640
Some sort of a food festival and Guatemala like this.

141
00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:10.780
These people there that are just,
they,
you know,

142
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:15.370
families that like live in apartments especially they fucking love parks map.

143
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.850
They get those parks and they just take over.
They bring their family,

144
00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:23.140
they lay out a giant blanket,
they start barbecue.
It's fucking great man.

145
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.320
It's really a,
it's actually a kind of a cool environment to,

146
00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:29.020
for kids cause all these different kids,
different families,

147
00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:33.070
they're all get together and there's music playing and people are cooking and

148
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.160
people from other countries they have more of,

149
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.680
for whatever reason they have more of this,
um,

150
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.810
this sort of inclination to have these gatherings and at least park gatherings,

151
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.220
it was pretty bad ass man.

152
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.120
<v 3>Sometimes it's,
it's bad as other times it's like,
it's nonsense.
It's just like,</v>

153
00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:54.830
hey,
it's four 40 people to all get together wasted in a park where there's kids,

154
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.693
you know?

155
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.950
<v 1>Yeah.
That can happen too.
Yeah.</v>

156
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.770
Especially if it's been a hard road getting over here in America.

157
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.290
You're fucking struggling.

158
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.800
You've got some sort of a shitty job doing construction work under the table for

159
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:08.634
cash.

160
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And now here you're at the party finally and you just getting lit screaming and

161
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:18.880
yelling,
dancing.
Did you see that concrete on the opposite side of droughts?
Uh,

162
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.800
the concrete that absorbs 880 gallons of water in a minute.

163
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.860
It's this concrete that they can now put on a roads and in parks.

164
00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:32.360
And so,
so like places like Houston or Texas that you know,
you know,

165
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.840
these flash floods,
uh,
this is actually just absorbs water.

166
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.740
This is insane.

167
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:41.670
And we're looking at a video now for folks listening to this where there's a

168
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:45.870
giant water truck and the water truck is pouring water onto this parking lot and

169
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:48.900
the water just disappearing.
This is crazy.

170
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.000
It's on tech insider.com.
Yeah.

171
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.230
And I guess this technology has been around for a while.
They've just got it.

172
00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.180
Oh Wow.
Good enough to actually use as concrete for cars,

173
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.440
how it works rather than you sand based concrete tarmac uses something called no

174
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:06.240
fines,
car concrete.

175
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.650
It's made of tiny pieces of crushed granite pack together while Burgess says the

176
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:11.940
mixture is extremely dry,

177
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:16.290
the pieces are packed loosely enough to allow water to pass through the system

178
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:19.230
can accommodate three designs,
full infiltration,

179
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:22.890
partial infiltration and full attenuation.
Wow.

180
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.870
That's fucking interesting man.
Wow,
that's smart.
Yeah.

181
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:31.360
Because like places like Houston,
like you said,
remember we were there,
um,

182
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.420
at this,
we used to work at this club there and we,
they would put us up in this,

183
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:40.710
uh,
who was the Allentown in what the fuck was the name?
Allen Town Parkway,
right?

184
00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:45.240
Yeah.
And it was this like really fucking sketchy,
sketchy hotel.

185
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:48.300
They would put you up in where people would like knock on your door and asked

186
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:52.990
for crack.
Like literally there was this dude,
he was walking down the,
um,

187
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.270
the upper,

188
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.180
it wasn't a hallway was outside because it was like a pal can eat before he got

189
00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:00.040
to the stairs cause it was a motel,
you know,
and uh,

190
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.940
the guys walking around the outside and he goes,
man,
who's a,

191
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:08.190
where's the head dude?
And I go,
I was like,
what?
He goes,
where's the head man?

192
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.340
And I'm like,
I dunno where Ed is that,
come on man.
You know where it is.

193
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:14.550
Where's that?
I'm like,
dude,
I don't fucking know where Ed is,

194
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.590
but it was just Jones in and he just looked at me and like,
this dude's a junkie.

195
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:22.040
He knows where the guy is.
Yeah.

196
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.560
I've been running into a lot of these junkies late,
like these meth heads.

197
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.450
They're just so out of it.
They don't,

198
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:30.990
they're not real people when they're on these drugs.
It's ridiculous.

199
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.390
You're pretty fucked up.
Yeah.
There was a,
a,

200
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:36.570
an article in one of the La magazines about,

201
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.820
I forget what it w which magazine,

202
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:43.770
but it was about how a lot of these poor communities in like south central La,

203
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.880
uh,
cocaine is like stupid expensive right now apparently.

204
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.140
But math is like way more common and so they're bringing meth in and because

205
00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:54.310
everybody already has like the,

206
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.290
<v 2>the people that we're bringing in weed before,</v>

207
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.000
they can't make any money off a weed.

208
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.560
So now they've switched it to math and all these people are fucked up on math

209
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.470
and these like really shitty areas and shitty communities.

210
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.200
Cutting coke with math I guess is a thing.

211
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:12.490
Also now that people are doing cause coke so expensive.
So it's like you're,

212
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.270
you're buying coke,
but in that next thing you know you're our method.
Oh yeah.

213
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:18.670
You figure doing coke and getting meth.
I mean,

214
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.450
anybody could think that somehow or another we wouldn't.

215
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.160
It at least be helping people actually get whatever they,

216
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.690
they think they're getting by making this stuff legal.

217
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.950
Like the idea that a grown adult tells another grown adult that can't do cocaine

218
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.780
to me is mind boggling.

219
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.320
The fact that we have all this other stuff that you can do and you just

220
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.490
arbitrarily no cocaine.
Do you think p cocaine will ever become illegal?

221
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.050
It should totally be illegal.
It should be legal.
Yeah.

222
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.170
I think less people would do it.
I really do.
I think more people would be aware.

223
00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.860
Look,
the alcohol's one of the most destructive to your body.

224
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.300
Destructive to society.

225
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.480
Destructive to your behavior and the kind of an eh kind of activities you engage

226
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:04.210
in drunk driving,
violent altercations,

227
00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:07.300
drunk being drunk can be horrible.

228
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:12.280
It can wind up terrible and it's completely pervasive.
It's everywhere.

229
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:17.260
It's so prevalent.
It's in,
you can get booze and family,
restaurants.

230
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:21.670
You go to a family restaurant and get fucked up.
You know?
I mean you can,

231
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:24.460
you could get fucked up to the point where you fall asleep drive and you kill a

232
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:29.080
bunch of people,
100% you could do that.
You could get the drug of choice,

233
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.100
the most destructive drug at every cvs,
every pharmacy,

234
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:37.330
every supermarket,
every supermarket you go to,
you can get fucked up.

235
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.170
You go down that liquor aisle and you just grab bottles thrown in your cart.

236
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.830
You could drink them in the car and you would never be able to drive home like

237
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.770
instantly.
You'd be fucked.
And it's legal.

238
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.850
The idea that cocaine's not legal is silly.
I wouldn't do it.

239
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.020
I try it.
I think I would definitely try it.
I would try it just be,

240
00:13:56.021 --> 00:14:01.021
if I knew it was absolute cocaine because like a Tom Sawyer from the punch line

241
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.400
in San Francisco from Cobbs,
remember Tom [inaudible],

242
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.490
he was always talking about rockstar cocaine.

243
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:09.910
Like I did rock star cocaine with Kennison and I'm like,
what's rockstar cocaine?

244
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.600
They,

245
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.110
he was talking about it like it was like someone talking about the days back

246
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:18.280
when Jesus was around.
It was like,
we would do it.
You'd be great.

247
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.780
And after it was over you just go to sleep.
And I was like,
what?
And he's like,

248
00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:24.900
yeah,
it would wear off.
It wouldn't give you a hangover.

249
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.910
You'd just see like he was talking about like this fantasy land cocaine sounded

250
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:34.330
like nondestructive.
Not Bad for you.
Like oh we get a lot done.

251
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.240
I want to know how rock started cooking.

252
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.250
Cause cocaine is just makes you look more awake.
I mean,

253
00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:42.450
so rock star cocaine just makes you even more awake or anything.

254
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.650
I think the idea is that the,
the,

255
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.430
the cocaine you're getting when you go to a regular place and you're partying,

256
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.760
uh,
is uh,

257
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:55.480
it's half speed or 20% speed or 5% speed or whatever the fuck it is.
It's,

258
00:14:55.710 --> 00:15:00.470
it's stomped on.
It's cut up.
But the rockstar cocaine is pure cocaine.

259
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.890
And when you get pure cocaine,
this idea is that it's a better experience.

260
00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.440
<v 3>Yeah.
And most of the cocaine,</v>

261
00:15:05.441 --> 00:15:09.160
you just immediately are shitting every 10 minutes every time you do it.

262
00:15:09.161 --> 00:15:12.460
Cause it's cut laxatives or will you smoke crack?

263
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.250
I found out I didn't smoke crack just the other day.

264
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.160
That's so funny you said that because I found out that what it was,

265
00:15:18.161 --> 00:15:21.610
somebody was talking about free freebasing cocaine,

266
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.690
which is where you cook it with Baking Soda and you get the pure,

267
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.310
what you're doing is you're extracting the purity of the cocaine.

268
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.800
You're extracting the cocaine.
That's what I did.
It's the same thing.
Yeah,

269
00:15:32.801 --> 00:15:36.970
that's what I said.
But I guess crack is a little bit more mixed with chemical,

270
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.090
some kind of hardening chemical or something like that.
I don't know.

271
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.780
<v 2>Pretty sure.
It's the same thing.
And here's,
here's the real deal.</v>

272
00:15:43.781 --> 00:15:48.340
According to Dr. Carl Hart and one of the guys that I've talked to on occasion

273
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.920
who,
um,
he's a,
he's a drug expert.

274
00:15:50.921 --> 00:15:53.620
He was only the bill O'Reilly show the other day.
Uh,

275
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.310
that's one of the reasons why I got in touch with him again.

276
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.820
I saw him on the bill O'Reilly show.
I'm like,
Dude,
how do you do that?

277
00:15:57.821 --> 00:15:59.690
It was on it for like,
he made me,

278
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:04.000
he said like 30 seconds where the shit and the entire time it was on maybe talk

279
00:16:04.001 --> 00:16:06.040
for like 15 seconds for someone interrupted them.

280
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.610
It's like one of those stupid shows which Jesus,
but anyway,

281
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.640
he was talking about how crazy it is that you get sentenced far more brutally if

282
00:16:15.881 --> 00:16:18.750
you get caught with crack.
And uh,
like what,

283
00:16:18.751 --> 00:16:22.090
what kind of jail time you're looking at weather versus getting caught with

284
00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:26.290
cocaine.
And he's like,
it's totally racist because it's the same drug,

285
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.390
it's exact same drug.
He's like there's,

286
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.860
there's no difference whatsoever between the two.
Like the,
the experience,

287
00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:36.190
the high,
like if you,
if you do one,
you do the other,
it's the same thing.

288
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.610
So the fact that one of them will get you like 10 year mandatory minimum and the

289
00:16:39.611 --> 00:16:42.450
other one you're out in like six months or whatever the fuck it,

290
00:16:42.451 --> 00:16:44.230
it would be if you're selling one of the other,

291
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.220
<v 3>I wonder why,
how many it's cause you prepared it or something,
you know,</v>

292
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.190
black people in jail,
it's because they want to

293
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.430
<v 2>black people in jail.
Wait,
it's just,</v>

294
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.540
it's just because they're selling it in these crime filled environments,

295
00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.051
you know,

296
00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:03.340
so it's whether or not it's racist or whether it's a response to the environment

297
00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:04.990
in which they're selling crack.

298
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:10.230
The idea is if you go to the country club and you're teeing off with,

299
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.190
you know,
Brad at 4:00 PM,
uh,

300
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.940
you guys are going to do a little bump before you're,

301
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.760
you're not the guy who is selling crack out of the backseat of his,

302
00:17:21.761 --> 00:17:25.060
uh,
hopped up Nissan and uh,
you know,

303
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.410
shooting at people and who knows what the fuck else he's doing kind of stupid

304
00:17:29.411 --> 00:17:32.380
shit.
This guy's involved and he's creating a nuisance for the neighborhood.

305
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:33.723
That's the idea,

306
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.270
<v 3>right?</v>

307
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.260
I just wondered like legally how that they can make it a difference if it was

308
00:17:38.261 --> 00:17:40.960
like,
oh,
well it weighs more or something.
You know what I mean?
Make

309
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.860
<v 2>their own rules.
Dude.</v>

310
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.240
Legal though the idea of what they can do and not do legally so fucked up

311
00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:50.700
because one of the ways that bust pot dealers is way,
not just the pot,

312
00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:53.790
but they way that the dirt and the pot that the pot is planted it,
right.

313
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.510
They way the whole thing,
they don't cut your trees down and say,
well,

314
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:00.180
let's see how much of the effective drug do we have here.

315
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:01.470
Because once you pull the buds out,

316
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.580
you're dealing with a fraction of the weight of the tree.
But these assholes,

317
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:09.030
they way the pebbles that are in the soil,
they weigh everything.

318
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:13.080
The water that you,
you know your water,
those plants,
they're in a pot,
the pots,

319
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:14.280
heavy,
tough shit for you.

320
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:17.040
It looks like you've got to fucking 50 pound pot plant and you're like,
what?

321
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.460
There's not even a pound of weed on that stupid plan,
but they'll,

322
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:24.030
they'll hit you for 50 and then they'll get you for like major possession,

323
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.540
major distribution to goddamn travesty.

324
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.950
The fact that this has been going on for so long too,

325
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.290
it's an to into our middle ages.
I mean,

326
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:37.470
you and I are both in our forties now and we're still living in this ridiculous

327
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:41.700
society that thinks it's okay to lock people in a cage because they decide they

328
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:46.050
want to do this.
I want to smoke this or I want to grow that.
I want to sell that.

329
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.460
You could sell tomatoes,
but don't sell weed.
Fuck you.

330
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.780
It's stupid.
We're grown adults.
You know,

331
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:57.540
the idea that we're going to go to the grave and the,

332
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:00.900
the world that we leave behind is going to be just as fucking stupid as it was

333
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:04.620
when we were in high school.
That's infuriating to me.
You know,

334
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:07.050
and I don't think that making cocaine,

335
00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:09.900
legal or bunch of people doing cocaine is going to help anything.

336
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.960
I certainly don't think that,
but if it does help,
one thing,

337
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:15.150
it'll help people recognize what coke really is.

338
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.020
Like if you see someone who's fucked up that's a drunk,
like you got a church,

339
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.080
like I've seen people at bars,
I'm like,
I am not fucking drinking.

340
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.110
Like I don't want to be that guy.
You know?
And like he,

341
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.180
I think that's a big part of how people learn is watching people around us fuck

342
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:33.210
up and when no one around you fuck up fucks up.

343
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.140
That's when you have this sort of really distorted perception of what's going on

344
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.110
and having,
you know,

345
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.240
no real understanding of what the effects of cocaine are on a one to one basis.

346
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.510
If you saw it,
if you saw someone that you know doing it or if you did it,

347
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.400
you would know like right now it's,
it's got too much myth behind it.
You know,

348
00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:57.330
it's part of the fucking Scarface thing.
You know,
like you're,
you're fucking,

349
00:19:57.331 --> 00:19:58.440
I don't give a shit bro.

350
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:05.150
I'm doing coke and it's not just that you're doing this speedy drug.

351
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.810
It's also that you're being a bad boy or a bad girl doing that coke.

352
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.570
<v 3>Well it is a lot of uh,</v>

353
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.670
undressing all the shit we grew up on and feared and you know,
we,

354
00:20:15.671 --> 00:20:18.550
we grew up thinking weed was the worst thing ever.
We,
you know,

355
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.570
same thing with you know,

356
00:20:19.571 --> 00:20:24.510
cocaine and it is now that we have the internet and everything we write to add

357
00:20:24.511 --> 00:20:26.890
our fingertips that we're learning like oh wait a second.

358
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.470
Cocaine is not even a schedule three drug or whatever it is scheduled to.

359
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.070
<v 2>Yeah.
Cause that was medical uses.
Right.
Here's a fun fact about cocaine.</v>

360
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.550
Coca Cola is made with cocaine.

361
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.800
Coca Cola was always made with cocaine back in the day and it had actual cocaine

362
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.640
in the coke.
Now part of flavor in Coca Cola

363
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.960
<v 1>comes from the cocoa leaves.
So they take coca leaves,</v>

364
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.550
they extract the cocaine and they use that cocaine from medical cocaine.

365
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:02.650
And then the rest,
like the flavoring,
some process goes into Coca Cola.

366
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.410
That's why coke rules and Pepsi drills

367
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.610
because it's got coconut.
That's hilarious.
They have coke in their name.

368
00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:16.180
Pepsi can't take,
they can't take,
you know,
coke.

369
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:20.950
Even though coke is like universal,
like you can't own coke.

370
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.970
Like if someone,
like if cocaine became legal and Coca Cola was like,

371
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:29.150
we're making our own cocaine,
coke cook like you couldn't study,

372
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.170
couldn't stop anybody else from calling a coke because it's coke.

373
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.760
Like it's an established name for it.
It's like if somebody tried to a patent,

374
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.760
the word pot,
you know,
we'd be like,
get the fuck outta here.

375
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:41.380
You can't pat and pot stupid.

376
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.780
I just found there was another thing that was really weird.

377
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.160
It was like mountain dew or another soda that was,
uh,

378
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.380
also had like a weird history secret.

379
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:53.080
Like if it was mountain dew or it was at mountain dew.

380
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.220
Mountain dew is like moonshine.
Yeah,
it was moonshine.

381
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:00.310
It was moonshine made to mix with moonshine.
Yeah.
Oh,

382
00:22:00.311 --> 00:22:02.320
it was designed to mix with my insurance.

383
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:06.430
It's a nickname mountain dew as his nickname and the
god,

384
00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:11.431
that makes sense and that's why PDC drinks it every day with two.

385
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.230
That makes it all drone.
Here's how fucked up I am.

386
00:22:14.231 --> 00:22:15.700
That makes me want a mountain dew.

387
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.940
It makes me want to mountain dew with some moonshine.
Oh,
all of a sudden.

388
00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:21.730
That's like what I want to drink right now.
Let's shit with real sugar.

389
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:22.810
It's not too bad.

390
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.420
It tastes a little bit different than why don't we have mountain dew here and

391
00:22:25.421 --> 00:22:26.670
having to throw it back when I need to get,

392
00:22:26.671 --> 00:22:29.650
now let's get mountain dew and so we have some moonshine already.
Right?

393
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.160
You get the 300 mountains.
We have some fake ass moonshine.
No,
no.

394
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:34.420
Hillbilly made our moonshine.

395
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.840
We have the moonshine dish featured on the history channel.
Those fucking dudes.

396
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.580
Yeah.
If they sell,
if they sell the same moonshine at Applebee's,

397
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:45.310
you know it's not the real moon shine.
It's like this absence that we got.

398
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:50.110
It's not even absence.
We got like grapes,
cider or something.
The Applebee's.

399
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.010
Yeah,
we had real absence once.
Remember that in Vancouver it was fucked up.

400
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.970
That was weird.
I described it as like a cousin to drunk.

401
00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:03.160
It wasn't quite like being drunk.
It was like being drunk cousin,
creepy drunk.

402
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.760
Very strange.
Like it didn't fuck me up.
I was,
it was,

403
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.600
it was uncomfortable because it was definitely different and I wasn't sure what

404
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:14.740
to expect,
but it wasn't bad.
I mean it's definitely a lot like drunk,

405
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:17.290
like I never drive on it.
You could definitely tell that you're,

406
00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:20.190
you're hindered physically.
Like Yolo,

407
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.930
you will a little like you would make bad decisions,
but it wasn't a,

408
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.790
it was just,
it was definitely different though.
Wonder if I'm right.

409
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.510
I'm wondering if you could talk to,
well,
like a Dr. Carl Hart type guy.

410
00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:34.420
He was like,
no,
it's all in your head.
It was basically just like being drunk.

411
00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:38.830
Just what a shitty flavor.
Yeah.
I wonder half of it might be just like your myth.

412
00:23:38.831 --> 00:23:40.420
They were,
but you think it is because I mean,

413
00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:43.360
back in the day they used to say used to trip from drinking absence,

414
00:23:43.361 --> 00:23:46.010
but nowadays you don't hear that anymore.
But maybe the not

415
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.550
<v 4>getting the good stuff.
Yeah.
Right.
Really good at what the fuck is wormwood,</v>

416
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:53.750
right.
That's what they use to make absence.
Right.

417
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.770
I don't know who I were.
Uninformed Paul this up Jay.
It's fine.

418
00:23:57.771 --> 00:24:00.740
I had to put it over sugar cubes or something to activate some.

419
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.740
There's something like that,
but the stuff that we had,
yeah,

420
00:24:03.741 --> 00:24:05.870
they did do it over sugar,
didn't they?
Yeah.

421
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.310
I forget how they did it and it tastes like licorice.
It was all long time ago.

422
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.780
Where was that?
Seattle.
No,

423
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:14.030
I believe that was Vancouver because it's legal up there.

424
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.150
That was the deal that it was up in Canada.

425
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.600
It's a confirmed that you're 21 years old.

426
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:26.030
Enter liquor.com.
Nice.

427
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:32.120
The five biggest absent myths.
Yeah.
So they're pouring it over this,
uh,

428
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.960
this sugar cube.
What's the myths?
And it's turning yellow.

429
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.080
Absinthe is hallucinating.
That's a myth.

430
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.760
Marketers love to capitalize on the products,
illicit reputation,

431
00:24:43.761 --> 00:24:48.680
but the fact is it's no more likely to make you see things than vodka.

432
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:52.850
Whiskey or Tequila absence was banned because it's hallucinogenic.

433
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.540
That's also another meth.
If absence isn't hallucinogenic,

434
00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:01.990
why was it banned in most European countries and in the u s and the early 20th

435
00:25:03.141 --> 00:25:07.430
century absence became a victim of its own popularity when the French wine

436
00:25:07.431 --> 00:25:12.320
industry and temperance movement targeted a common scape goat to promote their

437
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:16.520
respective agendas.
Those cots,
they did it.

438
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:20.960
Those fucks.
The wine industry went after an absence.

439
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.890
Oh my God,
you can't.
In reality,

440
00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:29.360
it stopped moving and your reality,
according to bruise,
whatever his name is,

441
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.190
it was a cheap adulterated versions of the drink.
Oh,

442
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.690
it was cheap adulterated version to the drink sold by unscrupulous
manufacturers.

443
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:43.340
Not Unlike Bathtub Gin during prohibition that caused the problems.

444
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:48.620
Okay.
So they just decided to capitalize on.
It's sort of the same way.

445
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:52.520
A partnership for drug free America.
Like if you,
um,
if you don't know,

446
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:54.110
I just do a bit about the dog.

447
00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:58.160
The lady with the talking dog as many comedians did,
but there was a stupid,

448
00:25:58.161 --> 00:26:01.610
it's commercial where the girl would come home from school and the dog would be

449
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:06.080
like,
Hey,
miss me.
Freund Oh,
you wish you wouldn't get high all the time.

450
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.060
It's the stupidest fucking commercial area.

451
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.980
But then you find out it's stupid as that commercial is that it was made by

452
00:26:12.981 --> 00:26:16.490
something called a partnership for a drug free America.
Well,

453
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:19.190
when you go into that,
that's where it gets hilarious.

454
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.910
A partnership for a drug free America was financed in part,

455
00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:27.470
at least by alcohol,
tobacco,
and pharmaceutical companies.

456
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.860
So I'm like alcohol companies talking shit about pot is like hookers doing

457
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:36.620
commercials against strippers.
I'm like,
that's literally what it's like.

458
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.070
This is just cutting out the competition.
That's all it was.

459
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.430
So we were watching these stupid fucking commercials going,
who is making these?

460
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:46.290
Like what is this?
What's the agenda?

461
00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.440
Will the agenda was to stifle competition,

462
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:54.890
which is mind boggling when you really find out that drug companies that make

463
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:59.340
trillions of dollars selling drugs.

464
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.990
If you combine the alcohol,

465
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:06.030
the pharmaceutical industry and the tobacco industry worldwide that has

466
00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:08.880
trillions of dollars,
trillions,

467
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:12.630
the amount of money is staggering and those fucks.

468
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:15.450
We're financing a partnership for a drug free America

469
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:22.440
and they let them fucking Latam.
It's hilarious.

470
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:26.850
It's like a group of murderers banning together to stop the UFC.
It's,

471
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.570
it's so stupid.
It's so fucking stupid.

472
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:36.500
Absence in the U S isn't real absence in the u s a few exceptions aside,

473
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:40.680
the quality and authenticity of the absent found in the u s market.

474
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:43.423
<v 0>Huh?</v>

475
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:48.220
<v 4>The quantity inauthenticity is very good.
He says,
hmm,</v>

476
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:49.263
what does that mean?

477
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:50.643
<v 0>Hmm?</v>

478
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.730
<v 4>We saying that it's good.
I don't get it.
In contrast,</v>

479
00:27:55.450 --> 00:28:00.100
the EU market remains heavily contaminated with offerings that amount to

480
00:28:00.101 --> 00:28:03.610
flavored vodka and green dye posing his absence.

481
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.370
Did they reverse it?
Yeah,
it seems like they fucked that.
Oh,
paragraph.

482
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.110
<v 1>Oh,
these are myths.
So He's,
it's saying that the u s Oh,
right.
Of course.
Right,</v>

483
00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:17.130
right,
right.
That's the myth.
Oh,
okay.
So the u s absence.
That's good.

484
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.600
I forgot that it was all myths.
Absences from the Czech Republic.
Not True.

485
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.060
Oh,
that's a myth too,
Huh?
I need sugar cube.

486
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.020
It shouldn't be classic method of serving absence involve slowly dripping water

487
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:32.520
over into the spirit,

488
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:37.790
often over a sugar cube held on by a special perforated spoon.

489
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.660
But in another tradition that magically appeared in the 19 hundreds,

490
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.760
Baroo says 1990.
Oh,
the 1990s.
Uh,
this,

491
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:52.680
the sugars first soaked with alcohol and lit with a match though impressive.

492
00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:57.030
The fire ritual is really designed to distract from the fact that a cheap,

493
00:28:57.031 --> 00:29:00.840
an artificial product will not Lucia,
what's that word?

494
00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:02.570
<v 0>Uh,</v>

495
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.440
<v 1>or turn cloudy with the addition of water.
Like it should,</v>

496
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.980
it's not necessary.
Okay.
Whatever.

497
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.660
But that should be illegal to,
of course it will.
It's kind of like,

498
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:17.350
I guess it is legal now,
but all of it should be legal.
Men were,

499
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.260
were fucking babies were babies over here.
It's ridiculous.
Yeah,

500
00:29:21.261 --> 00:29:24.920
it's interesting just going through what's going to be next,
you know,

501
00:29:24.921 --> 00:29:27.710
with the marijuana becoming legal more and more places.

502
00:29:27.711 --> 00:29:31.550
Like what's the next thing that,
that we've been pussies about?
Um,

503
00:29:31.551 --> 00:29:35.060
it's probably harder drugs.
It's probably things like coke.
I mean,

504
00:29:35.061 --> 00:29:37.940
I think they're going to make some sort of an argument for sure that Mtma should

505
00:29:37.941 --> 00:29:39.380
be legal.
All the

506
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.010
<v 4>had a main studies that they're doing.
They're,
they're saying</v>

507
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.190
<v 2>that they're going to,
you start using ketamine more and more for depression.</v>

508
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.520
Remember Neal Brennan was talking about that,
that he,

509
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.860
he does ketamine treatments for depression.
Wow.
Tranquilizer.

510
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.810
It's cat tranquilizer.
Yeah,
it's cat.
I was horse.
He might be right.

511
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.990
It's one of those,
pretty sure they use it on cats.

512
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:02.640
I think it's a veterinary tranquilizer.
I have done it.
It's crazy.
It's most,

513
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.650
well apparently be doing enough of it.

514
00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:09.430
You go into other dimensions and Shit like Brennan and saying when he was

515
00:30:09.431 --> 00:30:13.110
talking about,
he was saying he got an IV dose of it and um,

516
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.360
you are essentially like,
you completely dissolve.

517
00:30:16.361 --> 00:30:17.920
You trip your fucking balls off.

518
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:22.150
You go into some crazy alternative dimension and you're doing it in a doctor's

519
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:26.260
office.
Anesthesiologist is treating you for depression.

520
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.980
What these insane 45 minute ketamine trips and uh,
you know,
he leaves there.

521
00:30:30.981 --> 00:30:34.210
He's a little foggy.
Comes to the comic stories a little whacked out.

522
00:30:34.211 --> 00:30:38.200
But other than that,
he's like,
my mind is fine.
He goes and I feel really good.

523
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:39.250
I think it's really working.

524
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.690
So then I started seeing it popping up all over the place.
Excuse me,
sorry.

525
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.430
Where people are,
I'm talking about using it for depression,

526
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.420
that it's being approved for use for depression.

527
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:54.540
Apparently it's really effective psychedelic trips in particular in general,

528
00:30:55.241 --> 00:30:59.410
but ketamine in particular.
It's apparently like really effective for depression.

529
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.250
<v 3>What about,
what do you think about Pa Payoti ceremonies and have you,</v>

530
00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:03.750
have you ever done it?

531
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:08.060
<v 2>Pod?
No,
never done it.
Supposed to do it next month and you to totally do it.</v>

532
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.440
You know,
it's um,
it's,
it's some form of,
uh,

533
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:17.270
it's Mescalin essentially,
and it's from the San Pedro cactus.

534
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:20.990
I don't know how they extract it.
I don't know how that works.
But the,
uh,

535
00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.710
it's not a hallucinogen per se,
I believe.

536
00:31:24.711 --> 00:31:29.460
I believe it actually falls into like a stimulant category.
Hmm.

537
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:34.190
I want to say what is a barbiturate barbecue is like a downer.
Rent.
Yeah.

538
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.300
Yeah.
It's not that it's supposed to make you puke a lot.
It doesn't always.

539
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.180
I thought then you would go in,
cause I mean just watching movies,
you know,

540
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:42.890
but like natural born killers,
you know,

541
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.610
they went in that whole like thing with flying horses with,

542
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.300
if you're in a coyote you're likely to have a dream catcher on your wall.

543
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:55.200
You might have one of those,
a feather tattoos,
you know,

544
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:59.930
like goes down your arm like a band,
like some feathers.
It was a popular one.

545
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:03.110
Yeah.
Dudes.
Just really the native American culture.

546
00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.400
<v 3>Did they write announce why that guy died off of Anna,
Anna Anaconda,</v>

547
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:11.120
whatever WASC WASC,
which guy I,
there was a second,

548
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:14.320
a second death recently of a young kid who,
uh,

549
00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:19.390
died and they kept the body for I think four or five weeks before returning to

550
00:32:20.121 --> 00:32:21.830
the United States,
to the parents.

551
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:25.410
And they were going to test it out to find out why.
But you know,

552
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.270
it could have been he mixed it with something else,
like an antidepressant or he,

553
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.450
you know,

554
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.480
<v 2>it's probably a really dangerous,
because I think,</v>

555
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:38.630
I think some medications,
if you're taking something that a,
is an antidepressant,

556
00:32:38.631 --> 00:32:40.220
like you're not supposed

557
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.440
<v 4>to do IOWASCA certain ssrs.</v>

558
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.340
And I think also if you're taking anything where it gets really dangerous,

559
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:51.090
if you're taking anything that's an Emo Maoi and Mano a Dean,

560
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.900
how do say it monoline mean monoamine oxidase inhibitor,
um,

561
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:59.210
which is a very common in some forms of medication.

562
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:04.190
And it is the reason why you can take Iowasca and an oral form.

563
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.380
So normally when you like I WASC,
uh,
when you're,
when you're taking,

564
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.050
what you're doing is essentially,
it's like a slow release DMT trip,
right?

565
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.770
DMT is in so many different plants and hundreds,

566
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:19.610
thousands of even that your body produces something to break it down in your
gut.

567
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:23.000
So like if you were eating lettuce and the lettuce had DMT in it,

568
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:25.850
you just trip your fucking balls off,
right?
So your body's like,
well,

569
00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:28.700
this is ridiculous.
We can't just keep tripping every time we have a salad.

570
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.630
So your body produces something called Mano,

571
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:36.440
Amy and Oxidase and that Maoi is uh,

572
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:41.120
also I'm a part of the IOWASCA missed the mixture.

573
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:44.180
The,
uh,
the inhibitor is something called harming.

574
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:48.230
So what it is is it inhibits your body's natural production of this stuff that

575
00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:52.170
breaks down DMT.
So it allows it to get into your bloodstream and you have this,

576
00:33:52.171 --> 00:33:53.450
this wild,
crazy trip.

577
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:58.930
But apparently that same active ingredient in harming also exists in a bunch of

578
00:33:58.971 --> 00:34:00.260
prescription medications.

579
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:05.150
So if you're on that prescription medication and you go and you take this other

580
00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:06.110
stuff as well,

581
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.770
you get this overdose effect and it can be super dangerous for you.

582
00:34:09.771 --> 00:34:12.890
Apparently super dangerous to fuck with that stuff too.

583
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:18.200
Prescription ones and try to make like your own version of Iowasca like,

584
00:34:18.201 --> 00:34:22.910
uh,
by taking DMT with an Maoi.
Like you got to know what the fuck you're doing.

585
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.630
It can be real,
real dangerous.
It can be super skinny.

586
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.610
You're fucking with brain chemistry.

587
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.880
There's one thing if you're doing something that has like thousands of years of

588
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:35.220
history,
like if you do mushrooms who fucked dies from mushrooms,

589
00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.070
you'd have to do the wrong mushrooms.

590
00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:41.810
If you're getting mushrooms from a reputable source,
not like there is one,

591
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.310
but if,
if you know what you're doing and you get mushrooms,

592
00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:49.100
you grow them yourself.
Let's say it's just mushrooms,

593
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.260
like you know what to expect.
Like you're,

594
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:54.380
you can get really fucked up but you're going to live right.

595
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:59.590
But when you start fucking with like pharmaceutical drugs and pills and extracts

596
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:02.900
and who knows,
man,
who knows?
You could,

597
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.840
you could run into some shit and it's,
you know,
again,

598
00:35:05.841 --> 00:35:10.160
it's part of the problem with things being illegal is that we don't know exactly

599
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.130
how many people don't even know that when you eat weed,

600
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:17.630
your trip and your fucking balls off on this 11 hydroxy metabolite,
that's,

601
00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:19.420
you're not even getting like the THC I,

602
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.220
how many people know that very few people,
few people do.

603
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:25.760
It's why it's so much stronger when people freak out about how strong pot

604
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:29.630
cookies are.
It's not even weed.
It's not even the same drug as smoking it.

605
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.240
But the reason why we don't know is because it's illegal.

606
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.210
They should be teaching that in school and they teach you in school,

607
00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:39.950
like how many ounces of alcohol you could have for a hundred pounds of body

608
00:35:39.951 --> 00:35:41.340
weight in order to worry.
You know,

609
00:35:41.341 --> 00:35:43.860
like if you could drive like you going to have six ounces of beer and then you

610
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:46.860
could drive in me,
you know?
But if you get over that,

611
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:50.850
like now you start getting into the illegal area,
we,
everybody kind of knows,

612
00:35:50.851 --> 00:35:52.830
right?
Everybody kind of knows like two beers.

613
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.360
Like you're getting close to the line.

614
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.330
Have you had two beers in the span of a half an hour?

615
00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.610
You might be close to the illegal driving line.
Right?

616
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.350
But what does it with eating wheat,
what is it?
What does it with smoking weed,

617
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:07.650
we don't fucking know.
I mean,
everybody has their own tolerance for sure.

618
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:12.090
But we don't,
there's no like established number that everybody knows like,
oh,

619
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:16.080
if you eat this,
you know how many milligrams of you had 10 oh you're fine.

620
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.570
There's because of the fact that it's illegal.

621
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:22.290
There's all this guessing and you gotta.
It takes a long time to figure it out.

622
00:36:22.291 --> 00:36:24.930
You've got to talk to a bunch of different people and get answers.

623
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:28.970
Don't talk to Joey Diaz throwing off the curve or an idea.

624
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.250
Don't worry about a cop soccer.
Even though the one you're going to walk on ice,

625
00:36:32.251 --> 00:36:36.120
you might as well dance.
I saw him the other day on periscope just eating.

626
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.850
He's like,
all right,
here,
here,
here,
Lee,
take this and he's like,

627
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:41.180
they're eating just tons of edibles and then be like,
all right Julie,

628
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.540
you've never done acid.
Well,

629
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:47.140
open up your tongue here and they just dropped acid eight ish.

630
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.740
Yeah.
Joey goes so deep.

631
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:55.340
He's not even experiencing reality as we know it because reality is just very

632
00:36:55.651 --> 00:37:00.300
different to lead.
It's guys like,
oh,
I guess acid eating that much as normal.

633
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.350
He enjoys it.
He's turning him into a,
Jody is.
Yeah,
but listen man,

634
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:08.700
I think about if you're Li right,
there's nice kid,
very smart guy.

635
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.260
He's a sweetheart.

636
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.380
Funny on the show and this fucker as stumbled into a partnership with the

637
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:19.050
funniest man that's ever lived.
So he has this podcast,

638
00:37:19.051 --> 00:37:21.810
the funniest man that's ever lived.
What does the funniest man that's ever lived?

639
00:37:21.811 --> 00:37:24.570
Do he doses of them every day?

640
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.670
Joey Diaz doses that guy with like 500 milligram cheated choose.

641
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.630
He'll take the wrapper off of a fucking 200 milligram Chiba Chew,

642
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:37.530
put a 500 milligram in there,
wrap it back up and hand it to him.

643
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.120
Eat a dog the mile.
The mile doesn't line about the fucking number.
200 is normal.

644
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.320
The line about the number,

645
00:37:43.321 --> 00:37:48.321
they say 200 get the fuck outta here to Honda with your fucking faggy 200 I had

646
00:37:49.111 --> 00:37:53.120
like a 40 the other day or something like that.
I was fucked up out of book.

647
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.590
I can't believe that.

648
00:37:54.591 --> 00:37:58.980
You know that Lee thinks 200 is a normal number,
you know?
Yeah.

649
00:37:58.981 --> 00:38:01.710
Those guys go d yeah,
well you know what happens?

650
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:06.790
They start doing it on a regular basis and then you get used to that insane

651
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:12.120
experience.
You know,
Joe is used to that insane experience.

652
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.090
He's used to just be and just deep in the hole,

653
00:38:15.091 --> 00:38:18.250
like Alice in chains song down and

654
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:25.140
it's like he's doing it.
He's getting like a narcotic effect,
you know?

655
00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:29.640
I mean you got to think about like Joey's history,
you know,
Joey,
his whole life,

656
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
he's done some sort of drugs and now all he does is smoke weed,

657
00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.070
you know,
but his whole life,
he's done like horrible drugs,

658
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.090
the terrible,
terrible drugs and a lot of coke.

659
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.290
The coke was I probably the good one.
You know,
he did a lot of crazy shit.

660
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:49.480
And so for him,
like he,

661
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:54.481
I think he probably misses that complete total escape from reality that that you

662
00:38:56.141 --> 00:39:00.850
could get when you eat 500 milligrams achieved with shoes.
You're going,

663
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.210
you're going down man,
like world.

664
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:06.520
The world will become paper thin.

665
00:39:06.521 --> 00:39:11.140
Walls bulled crumble in front of you like they're made out of dust and you'll

666
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:14.970
just be just looking over the landscape that is the,

667
00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:20.140
the impending doom of your own body and society and the death of your wife and

668
00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:25.180
children and your friends and everyone dying.
You're going to see that.
That's,

669
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:29.980
you're going to see on those God Damn Pot Chiba chew 500 milligram death stars

670
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:34.840
hit to death stars the other day too to death stars too.

671
00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.510
I've never even heard of anybody eating two of those things.

672
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.050
Do you ever heard of the desktop?
Oh my God.
Is it,

673
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.230
there's some fucking thing that these guys in northern California May,

674
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.810
I think the same guys who make the gummy bears make the,
uh,

675
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:50.260
the death stars and they're supposed to be so bad.

676
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.580
Joey was run and trying to give one to Alex Jones last time we were in Austin

677
00:39:54.581 --> 00:39:57.610
together.
Where's Alex Jones?
I got to get them one of these desktops.
Joe Rogan.

678
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.670
I'm going to get one of these desktops.
I'm going to fuck him up.

679
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:05.910
<v 1>Last time he had like a loaf of bread gummy where he was cutting slices from may</v>

680
00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.950
slice you off on things

681
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.920
like you ready to fucking Deli with them.
Hey you got to try this.
No bridges.

682
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:18.640
I got this new pursued.
All this fucking guy knows on a make a good pursuit.

683
00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.700
Slice and paper thin meet,
laying it down.
That stuff's really good.

684
00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:27.950
You gave me a some truffle the other day from that company and then I pause

685
00:40:27.951 --> 00:40:30.900
right there and I actually know the people that from that company on bows.

686
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:35.260
They live in Burbank,
they make great stuff.
It's really quality.

687
00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:39.220
It's really quality and the stuff that they're making is all organic.

688
00:40:39.221 --> 00:40:41.080
They don't use corn syrup,
they don't like.

689
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.900
It's really used honey when they're making their baked goods.

690
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.180
So fucking where can he get that?
Cause like I

691
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:54.250
put this on the Internet and we're talking about things that me and me no
appeal.

692
00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:58.960
Legal federally,
federally.

693
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.390
What a creepy situation that is.

694
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.760
The federal government still like that's why these,

695
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.360
these guys that are running for president on the Republican side,

696
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:12.550
some of them are so fucking scary because if they really do say do what they say

697
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:15.460
they're going to do and get into office and then all of sudden go after these

698
00:41:15.461 --> 00:41:20.050
pot shops,
start rating them like you're looking at like some civil war shit.

699
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.180
They still doing it.
It's,
it's still happening.

700
00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:25.330
I don't know what hair braiding any shingle,
but they're talking about it.

701
00:41:25.331 --> 00:41:26.950
This Chris Christie guy especially,

702
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:31.930
no one thinks he can actually become president,
but if he did become president,

703
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.190
he,
one of things that he said he would do

704
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:39.140
<v 4>is immediately go into Colorado and Washington state and shut down all the pot</v>

705
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:42.860
sales.
See that black guy now he's the fee.
That's Ben Carson.

706
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.730
That's the religious.
He's fascinating,
man.
That guy's fascinating.

707
00:41:46.731 --> 00:41:49.790
I've been paying attention to him a lot lately.
He's really interesting.

708
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:55.300
Ben Carson is one of the best pediatric brain surgeons in the world like he has.

709
00:41:57.081 --> 00:42:02.081
He is saved conjoined twins when conjoined twins were linked together at the

710
00:42:02.661 --> 00:42:06.440
head.
Like this is the,
apparently these kids,

711
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:11.470
they were sharing a one artery that's a very important already that I think more

712
00:42:12.111 --> 00:42:16.790
than 20 different doctors or a bunch of different doctors at work,

713
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:19.850
20 hours,
um,
to,
uh,

714
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:23.120
to try to help these kids.
And they survived.

715
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:26.930
They separated their fucking brains.
They were conjoined twins,
meaning their,

716
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:30.860
their bodies are connected together at the head and he saved them.

717
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.330
Like he's a brilliant,
brilliant man when it comes to that.

718
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.830
But then when it comes to like evolution,
Big Bang theory,
yeah,

719
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.410
he believes the Big Bang Theory is a myth.
He doesn't believe in evolution.

720
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.220
Why is it always like that?
It's like,
you know,
you got your so smart in one area,

721
00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:50.100
but then you,
you completely miss judge everything and the other area,
like,

722
00:42:50.101 --> 00:42:53.540
it's like you're,
it's like it doesn't make sense at all.
Doesn't make sense.

723
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:57.050
It's um,
because you know,

724
00:42:57.051 --> 00:43:01.070
we all know people that are really good at one thing and they suck at other

725
00:43:01.071 --> 00:43:05.210
stuff.
And the more attention you put to this one thing,

726
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:10.430
oftentimes he neglect areas of your life.
Like how many like tortured geniuses.

727
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.640
That's a really common term that people love to use.
You know,

728
00:43:13.641 --> 00:43:15.080
always just tortured genius,

729
00:43:15.081 --> 00:43:18.470
like someone who's a genius in like their musical life.

730
00:43:18.471 --> 00:43:21.380
But in their personal life it's just constant chaos.

731
00:43:21.381 --> 00:43:24.490
They're an asshole and screaming people and throw things around.
Like what?

732
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.880
What is that?
What is that?
But ultimately you look at it,

733
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:34.630
if you separate yourself from society's idea of how you should behave or

734
00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:35.960
shouldn't behave,

735
00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:40.520
and society's idea of like what's aesthetically pleasing about some kinds of

736
00:43:40.521 --> 00:43:43.600
music and how difficult it is to do is just look at it like,
uh,

737
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.010
just outside of culture,
right?
Well you just,

738
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:50.000
you look at it like a mathematical problem.
You Go,
Whoa,
this is real simple.

739
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.710
This guy has resources,
right?

740
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.180
And he's dumped all the resources into this one thing like running.
He's like,

741
00:43:56.181 --> 00:43:59.780
he's,
he's the best runner of all time,
but his personal life is chaos.

742
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:05.060
It was family.
Fucking hates him.
His friends,
he's a backstabber like,

743
00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:07.070
like the Lance Armstrong situation.

744
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:10.670
You know guys like the baddest fucking biker of all time.

745
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:15.530
Meanwhile he's still in people.
The people that are saying that he did drugs,

746
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:18.290
he's like,
I'll fucking sue you.
I'm suing this person.
I'm suing that.

747
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.350
It's got all this chaos going on like that.

748
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:27.400
It was this overwhelming desire for victory sort of takes over pretty much every

749
00:44:29.241 --> 00:44:32.490
aspect of the rest of your life.
Like they say Michael Jordan,

750
00:44:32.491 --> 00:44:35.940
you can't even play pool with that guy.
If you beat him at pool,

751
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:40.380
he will fucking hate you.
He hates you because what does his thing,

752
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.260
well his thing is just winning is overwhelming.

753
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:46.350
Thing is winning and I don't know what he's like in real life but I haven't

754
00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:47.470
heard good things are very lucky.

755
00:44:47.471 --> 00:44:50.340
It doesn't tip of her and like weird shit like that.
You know?

756
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:54.600
Like cause it's not necessarily the nicest guy.
What could that be?

757
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:56.760
Well it could be like he's,
it didn't focus on that.

758
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.750
He focused everything on this one thing.
Everything on this one thing.

759
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.740
This is what's important I think.
I think you get a lot of that with people.

760
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.810
I think this Ben Carson Guy,
it's just,

761
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.860
he probably focused so much on that that he didn't,

762
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.920
didn't apply that objective reasoning and that intellect to examining the

763
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:21.300
various aspects of the mythology that is accepted as his reality.

764
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.900
I mean,
because Christianity at the end of the day with no proof,

765
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.190
everything is mythology,
everything with no proof with proof.

766
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.420
Then you examine the proof.

767
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.810
It's super simple and anybody that argues against that is just,

768
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:36.030
you're just biased.
You,
you have your own ideas.

769
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.210
If you have some proof that there was a god that does,

770
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:43.860
God had one son and he made the sun come down and get the fuck beat out of him

771
00:45:43.861 --> 00:45:47.220
and nailed to a board so that we could all have no sin.
Do you have,

772
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:49.620
can you show me some studies?
Can you give it,

773
00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.700
do you have a box of evidence that you can pull out and we can examine all the

774
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:58.140
different pieces that points to the undeniable conclusion that that's true.

775
00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:02.070
Because if you don't,
then it's a myth.
Then you're,
you're believing mythology.

776
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:04.290
It doesn't mean it's not real.
But if you,

777
00:46:04.291 --> 00:46:09.180
if you put all your fucking eggs in that basket and you don't have any proof at

778
00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:13.140
all,
well you're entering into this weird world where you don't pay attention to

779
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:16.080
shit.
You're entering into this weird world where you,

780
00:46:16.081 --> 00:46:19.920
you ignore certain aspects of things because you've decided what is and what

781
00:46:19.921 --> 00:46:22.950
isn't.
That's not thinking.
That's not thinking.

782
00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:26.820
That's like it's convenient cookie holder placement of ideas.

783
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:29.820
It's not thinking because if you're thinking you can't accept it,

784
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.580
if you're thinking you'd go,
wait,
what?
He came back from the dead.

785
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:35.460
Has anyone ever done that?
Three days came back from the dead.

786
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.110
I don't think you can do that.
And people,

787
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:42.210
I mean that's what people would do normally,
but you know,
like I went to,

788
00:46:42.211 --> 00:46:46.110
my kid had a function today and I went to this function and they're all,
uh,

789
00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.830
we're singing God bless America and there's like some something about heaven in

790
00:46:49.831 --> 00:46:53.610
their,
and their school prayer.
I'm like,
well,
okay,
are we teaching people?

791
00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:56.550
We're teaching kids things,
right?
What's heaven?
Where's this?

792
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:57.660
Is this a real thing?

793
00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.990
Or we just pretending to heaven's real so the kids feel good and they can get

794
00:47:00.991 --> 00:47:04.990
through a 12th grade.
What are we doing here?
What are we doing?
You know,

795
00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:09.991
W W we have to make shit up about stuff that we don't know and instead of just

796
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.560
accepting what we do know,

797
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.130
instead of just celebrating and accepting what we know about life,

798
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.280
we have to pretend that there's a heaven and you're going to go to heaven when

799
00:47:20.281 --> 00:47:23.350
you die.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Like you're,

800
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.900
you're teaching my kid nonsense.
Why don't you teach him some rumper?

801
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:30.610
Bumbles stills can shit once you make some shit up about you're making shit up

802
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:34.390
about heaven.
I'm not saying heaven doesn't exist,
but you're just making it up.

803
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.560
You're teaching a school in a class,
you're making them and then in heaven,

804
00:47:38.561 --> 00:47:41.650
God in Heaven,
God in Heaven,
where is heaven?
Who's God?

805
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:45.640
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You making up some shit.

806
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:50.200
You're making up some shit in a school like,
and you don't have to.
Okay,
look,

807
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:54.250
if the kid comes to you like,
um,
where is heaven on a map?
Can you,
uh,

808
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:58.300
can you take me to is,
do we have a Google earth?
Could we check on heaven?

809
00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:02.410
Can I see,
can I see the harp?
Oh Man.
You know,

810
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:07.040
heaven is his heavenly father.
That was the other thing.
Heavenly father,

811
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:10.810
our heavenly father.
Really,
this is what we're teaching in school.

812
00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.380
Heavenly fathers,
how can we start a check?
You know,

813
00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:18.430
moms are usually better at raising you.
Been Dad's dad's working all the time.

814
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:22.900
It is weird that that when you have a kid that you do nothing but lie to them.

815
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:27.220
Their,
their first 10 years of their life,
like about Santa Claus,
bunny rabbits,

816
00:48:27.221 --> 00:48:31.900
Jesus monsters.
Well,
the Jesus thing keeps going.
That's the weirdest part of it.

817
00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:34.360
And again,
it's just not saying that Jesus wasn't real.

818
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:36.500
Just saying like if you looked,

819
00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:40.840
if that story existed in any other form other than religion,
you'd be like,
why?

820
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:44.710
If you look at that for that story outside of religion,

821
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:47.120
if it wasn't something that you know you,

822
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:50.560
you made the sign of the cross every morning and went to school and prayed.

823
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:55.860
If you just read the story about a guy who was magic and could turn water into

824
00:48:57.131 --> 00:49:00.880
wine,
who could heal people?
What did he do at fish?

825
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.060
Did he fucking give people fish or some shit?
Make some fish.

826
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:08.710
The whole thing is so stupid.
You'd be like,
wait a minute.
Who told you this?
Well,

827
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.270
it's a long story.
So he,

828
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:15.100
it was actually spoken about for about a thousand years for anybody bothered to

829
00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:18.400
write it down.
You'd be like,
wait,
what?
Shut the fuck up.

830
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:22.240
They told it for a thousand years.
The Old Testament,

831
00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.750
they told the Old Testament for a thousand years they use,
it was,

832
00:49:25.751 --> 00:49:28.750
it was spoken for a thousand years.

833
00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.050
That's so long.
That's like,

834
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:36.370
just stop and think how fucking stupid that is.
That literally,

835
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:41.371
that would be like going back to like the Julius Caesar Days and Julius Caesar

836
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.600
like a thousand years ago was that the Romans were around a thousand years ago.

837
00:49:46.601 --> 00:49:49.870
Right?
No.
Before that it'd be like Genghis Khan.

838
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:55.320
It'd be like Genghis Khan's life and no one bothers to write it down until now.

839
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.920
I mean,
that's so stupid.

840
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:04.750
The idea behind that is so stupid that you could tell a story for a thousand

841
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:08.950
years and get it right when you write it down.
It is,
it is interesting.
Like,

842
00:50:08.951 --> 00:50:10.560
you know,
Pope,
uh,
you know,

843
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.050
he believes in the Big Bang theory and I evolutions real.

844
00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.620
So it seems like they kind of have to slowly start accepting everything,

845
00:50:17.621 --> 00:50:20.740
but when it comes down to it,
they still believe it.
You know what magic man,

846
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.310
you know Jesus flying it around with.
I tell you what,
man,

847
00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:28.910
it always weirds me out when they have that guy on TV.
It weirds me the fuck out.

848
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:33.530
It weirds me out.
I was watching Cole Bear.
It was so strange,
man.

849
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:36.650
It was cold bear and Gaf again,
who I love,

850
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:40.850
Jim Gaffigan and Maria Shriver and some other weird dude.

851
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:44.630
And uh,
they were sitting around talking about what it means to be a catholic.

852
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:48.680
I was like,
why not?
Like,
what are you talking about?

853
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:53.300
And they were talking about forgiveness and Catholicism is all about
forgiveness.

854
00:50:53.301 --> 00:50:57.440
And Maria Shriver is like being all proud to be a Catholic and they're showing

855
00:50:57.441 --> 00:51:00.410
the mass and like I'm like,
hit the brakes.

856
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.900
Aren't you grown adults like you guys are,

857
00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.220
you're in the nonsense so you're into nonsense.
Is that what this is?

858
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:09.470
Cause this is what you're showing nonsense.

859
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:13.760
You get this guy dressed like he's in a fucking Harry Potter movie and He's

860
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:18.410
standing in front of all these people with a chalice.
He's wearing a cult outfit.

861
00:51:18.411 --> 00:51:23.300
He literally is wearing a cult outfit from a thousand years ago and you're all

862
00:51:23.301 --> 00:51:26.720
sitting there listening to this nonsense,

863
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.890
total nonsense he sent even speaking in English and you're there,
you're like,

864
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:34.820
yes,
we're here.
We're here to whisk.
Witnessed the Holy Father.

865
00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:36.380
Like what the fuck are you talking?

866
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:40.460
You're there to witness a guy who works for an organization that owns a building

867
00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:44.420
that houses the largest gay bathhouse in Europe.

868
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.060
Yeah,
that's the Vatican owns.

869
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:52.420
I mean did the whole thing is so fucking ridiculous and that this guy is meeting

870
00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:57.470
with all these people all across America and they're all so happy to meet the

871
00:51:57.471 --> 00:51:59.480
pope.
This is so amazing.

872
00:51:59.481 --> 00:52:03.230
And he listens to people's stories and he decides whether or not people should

873
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:07.100
be able to get married if they're gay.
The whole,
it's hilarious.

874
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:12.740
He supported that Kim Davis Lady,
the lady went to the Vatican.
They,
they,

875
00:52:12.741 --> 00:52:17.300
they had uh,
a meeting with her.
She got an audience at the Vatican.

876
00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:22.220
Oh,
he told her that,
uh,

877
00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.190
he was saying that people shouldn't have to violate their beliefs.

878
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.270
So there's essentially he was supporting her who was supporting her decision not

879
00:52:29.271 --> 00:52:32.300
to marry gay people.
Yeah.
When I first heard it,

880
00:52:32.301 --> 00:52:36.500
I wonder if he just pulled her aside and like,
look man,
it's 2015 just let it go,

881
00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:39.770
going to make,
so I think probably like,
listen,
bitch,
keep that shit up.

882
00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:43.910
I don't want to marry any dude.
That's probably what it,
like.
I'll keep my money,

883
00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:45.320
look at all this money.
I want to see my gold.

884
00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.600
Take her to a fucking like smog chamber from the Hobbit.

885
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:52.880
Just gold everywhere.
It's tacked up the ceiling.

886
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.330
Have you seen the footage of him smell?

887
00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:01.130
Have you seen that footage of him sucking on toes?
The,
you know,

888
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.630
that's a thing he does.
That's the thing that he does.
He goes around in,

889
00:53:04.631 --> 00:53:08.630
sucks on guides,
toes come on.
So I swear to God,
I dare you.
Oh,
come on.

890
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.730
When you're talking about they should on the news.

891
00:53:10.731 --> 00:53:13.820
It's like pope visited in blessed all these people and it's just him like

892
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:18.050
kissing toes and like,
well I think he shows us humility by kissing your feet.

893
00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:21.770
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was very gross dudes.
Cause and dude's feet.
Yeah.

894
00:53:21.771 --> 00:53:25.760
He was getting the foot part.
Totally depends what part of the foot.
Like

895
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.870
<v 1>if you kiss like my Shin,
my instep,
instep,
I consider a weapon.</v>

896
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:35.090
It's like kissing and knuckle.
But if you suck on my little pinky toe,
right.

897
00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:38.130
I have a problem with that.
Yeah.
I just googled,

898
00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:41.370
pope kissed his feet and the first thing is humbling moment.

899
00:53:41.371 --> 00:53:46.120
Pope Francis Washes brome prisoners.
So it's just him washing a bunch of guys.
Mm.

900
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:51.900
He washes them.
Why can't they wash themselves?
What,

901
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:53.010
what is going on here?

902
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.440
Washing them for the Lord first I will start with the balls.

903
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.630
Then I washed the taint.

904
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:06.290
Pope Francis kisses and wash his feet of young offenders at room prison after.

905
00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.880
God dammit.
I remember.

906
00:54:08.881 --> 00:54:11.610
It's one of the things that Jesus did as he was growing up.

907
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:16.740
How convenient they wrote it.
Not Look.
Hold on.
It's right here.

908
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:21.810
It says right here.
Jesus said,
thou must suck if the toes,
man,

909
00:54:21.811 --> 00:54:25.350
he's getting in there.
It's like,
yes.
He's deep in there.

910
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:30.490
While it's an addendum.
Oh my hair.
He goes,
I was kissing the girl's feet.
Oh,

911
00:54:30.491 --> 00:54:32.490
he's washing the girl's feet.
Those are hot feet though.

912
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:38.100
She's got a cute little feet that's different.
So foot fetish they love.

913
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:41.820
Oh,
they must be whacking off crazy to this hope.
Help kids.

914
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.680
Pope pope play.
Um,
I got introduced to this a girl by,
um,

915
00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:51.670
uh,
Chris Ryan,
uh,
the author of,
um,

916
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.210
sex at dawn.
And uh,
he,
uh,

917
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:59.070
he's friends with this girl who she's like a dominatrix and humiliate tricks.

918
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:01.100
She humiliates dudes and a,

919
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:05.310
she sells her socks and she's got all these pictures on her Twitter of her like

920
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:09.120
dirty socks or their foot like up to you like one sock off,
one sock on.

921
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:13.710
She was like 300 bucks by my socks.
You pigs.
Yeah,
I know a couple of his curls.

922
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:19.030
Duncan do a marrow like that for a long time.
Munchies,
Stan Sher,

923
00:55:19.031 --> 00:55:21.270
stinky mouth or whatever her name was.
She just,

924
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:24.840
she came to my house to a party at one time for his birthday.

925
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.350
The fuck was her name and she mass.
Yeah,

926
00:55:28.351 --> 00:55:32.210
there was like some crazy name and she had her underwear and it was just like,

927
00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.690
and it's just like the old days
Brown.

928
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.821
Yeah.

929
00:55:38.821 --> 00:55:42.630
Well she would have deals where she would have to wear socks like many days in a

930
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:46.500
row.
So they would really stink and then she would sell them.
Duncan's girl did.

931
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:49.440
She would like to have deals.
Like I got to wear them for three days.

932
00:55:49.441 --> 00:55:51.790
Like she'd be like,
what?
Come with,
I'm going to walk my dog.

933
00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:53.820
I gotta get these socks.
Nice and stinky

934
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.440
walking around in socks.
You know what's here?

935
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:04.380
Here's something weird socks like cotton socks stink.
So fucking bad.

936
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:06.840
The worst though is like plastic.

937
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.720
You ever have like some sort of nylon material in the socks?

938
00:56:09.721 --> 00:56:12.540
I've had athletic socks that were so bad.

939
00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:16.080
Like I'd wear them for a couple hours and they would just fucking Rick where I'd

940
00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:19.470
have to throw my sneakers and the washing machine like what's that smell?

941
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:24.070
But with doesn't smell is wool.
When I go hunting we can

942
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.930
<v 4>wear the same socks.
I wear the same socks for like days in a row,
days in a row.</v>

943
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:33.850
They don't stink.
It's weird cause it's wool.
Somehow or another we'll wool.

944
00:56:33.851 --> 00:56:38.170
Here's another thing about wool,
Merino wool specialty I guess maybe all wall,

945
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:41.860
but when it gets wet you stay warm.

946
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:46.030
Whereas like if cotton gets wet,
you're fucked.
Like so when you hunt,

947
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.970
a lot of times it's cold as shit out,

948
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:54.120
but you're dressed heavily and your walking like up hills and you heat up and

949
00:56:54.371 --> 00:56:56.710
you start sweating.
Well if you weren't cotton,

950
00:56:56.711 --> 00:57:00.220
it's really fucking dangerous cause that's how people get hypothermia.

951
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:01.480
They start walking,

952
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:05.380
they walk up hills and then they sit down and they fucking freeze to death

953
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.031
because your,

954
00:57:06.031 --> 00:57:10.240
your whole body's like soaking wet from walking and then you sit and you're
like,

955
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:13.150
oh Jesus.
Like you get tired and you can't go on anymore.

956
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:15.370
Well you got wet clothes on,
man.
You,

957
00:57:15.371 --> 00:57:17.440
you got to make a fire to dry your clothes off.

958
00:57:17.441 --> 00:57:20.350
You gotta take your clothes off and dry them by the fire or you're not gonna

959
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:22.930
make it.
But if you have wool on,
it's crazy.

960
00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:27.130
You could be wet and you're still warm.
It's real weird.
It's a,

961
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:29.460
it's a non synthetic.
It's a,
a,

962
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:34.470
it's a biological hair and because it's wool was lamb's wool because it's

963
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:38.020
coming,
you know,
as lamb's hair,
it,
uh,
it,

964
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.530
it preserves heat better and it,
uh,
it,
it,

965
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:46.330
it's like the reaction that it has to moisture's completely different and like

966
00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:50.260
retains heat.
It's real weird.
You think it would make it stink here?
Yeah.

967
00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:53.440
You would think so.
We think it would smell got dead sheep or something.
Right.

968
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:57.400
She funk,
but it doesn't,
man,
it's like this.
The,

969
00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:01.780
like one of the best ways to prevent your body from really stinking when you go

970
00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:05.050
on these trips.
Cause like when we're in Montana and the first time when,

971
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:09.340
when I got that deer right there,
we were outside for five days,

972
00:58:09.341 --> 00:58:10.930
six days without a shower.

973
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:15.580
And I'm sure I didn't smoke great for sure.
You know,
especially my,
but

974
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:21.850
I was just shitting in a hole in the ground and uh,

975
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.230
taking toilet paper and they would like the toilet paper on fire to burn it off.

976
00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:27.880
That's,
that's what you would do.

977
00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:31.800
Something with my asshole must have just been a disaster.
Lucky.

978
00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:34.540
I don't have to look at it though.
But um,

979
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:40.240
after five days of,
uh,
you know,
being,
um,
in the,

980
00:58:40.241 --> 00:58:43.510
in the woods like that,
like I had the same clothes on for five days.

981
00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.920
And what was,
it wasn't that hard.
We weren't like,

982
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.890
I didn't have to pry them off my skin,
you know,

983
00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:49.600
that gets like your socks sometimes.

984
00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.320
The other day we have to like pry them away from the bottom of your skin.

985
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.770
It's like they stick in the pores and then they become hard like,
like,

986
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:01.300
like crunchy.
Where's the crunchy come from?
That was in your foot.

987
00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:06.490
It's toxic.
This is man.
It's toxins,
this foot toxins.

988
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.270
Someone was trying to tell me that they'd like to go to someplace.

989
00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:12.610
It might have been Joey.
They'd go to some place.
They put your foot and his bath.

990
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:16.750
Yeah.
It's the toxins come out and it's black.
It's black and the bottom and go,

991
00:59:16.751 --> 00:59:19.810
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
What fucking toxins are your,

992
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:22.070
what are you eating charcoal like good

993
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.770
<v 1>to fucking talk to you about.
I've always wanted to see if that's real.</v>

994
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:28.970
I don't know.
He always talks about that.
It's not real.
I think it's a trick.

995
00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:32.720
Someone told me about the trick to someone explained to me what the trick is.

996
00:59:32.721 --> 00:59:35.960
It's like some sort of a chemical that they put in the water and there's a

997
00:59:35.961 --> 00:59:40.380
chemical reaction to your skin and it makes us like black color and you,

998
00:59:40.381 --> 00:59:43.490
you start thinking,
oh my God,
the toxins are coming out.

999
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:46.970
Cara Santa Maria is pretty funny about that shit man.
You know,

1000
00:59:46.971 --> 00:59:50.360
cause she's so smart.
She's a scientist.
She was uh,
she goes,

1001
00:59:50.361 --> 00:59:52.850
it's one of the surefire ways to tell someone that's full of shit.

1002
00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:54.860
And they start talking about cleansing.

1003
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:58.760
They started talking about toxins and cleansing and she's like,
wait,
wait,
wait.

1004
00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:02.720
What?
What is going on here with your toxins?
Yeah,

1005
01:00:02.721 --> 01:00:05.910
the did the brown wire is probably your dirty feet.
Just wash.

1006
01:00:05.911 --> 01:00:08.420
You probably washed your feet for you.
You know,

1007
01:00:08.421 --> 01:00:12.170
I think if there's an actual black like a little or something.
Yeah,

1008
01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:16.010
there's like something that they put in the water and when your feet react to
it,

1009
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:20.510
it just makes us black liquid with,
it's not toxins.

1010
01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:24.170
You imagine if that's all it took.
You Soak your feet in,

1011
01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:28.460
the blackness comes out of you or you see like little demons fucking swirling

1012
01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:32.630
around the water.
The spirit still leaving your feet.
They fucking,

1013
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:36.290
they hide out in your feet.
That's why you feed her at the end of the day,

1014
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.350
it's coasts.
I did,

1015
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.580
I had a weird thing happened to me yesterday.

1016
01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:44.030
I don't know if I told you about my,
my vision.

1017
01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:47.960
I just started tripping out of nowhere.
Like my,
my,
yeah,
I did hear about that.

1018
01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:50.160
My eyes weren't,
uh,

1019
01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.210
like the light wasn't hitting my eyes right.

1020
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.640
Like my eyes weren't adjusting to light.
Right.

1021
01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.580
So if I looked at my arm and I wave my arm,

1022
01:00:58.581 --> 01:01:01.070
it looked like there was like a blue line around it at points,

1023
01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:05.960
like very neon trippy,
like laser kind of like if you see like,
uh,
uh,

1024
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:08.720
a film with a low exposure rate,
you know,

1025
01:01:08.721 --> 01:01:12.590
where you see like the weird trippy stuff.
And if I blinked my eyes,

1026
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:17.210
everything got really bright for a second and then it went dark,
like darker.

1027
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:21.680
So it's like I was seeing through a filter and somebody said they think it's an

1028
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:23.030
ocular Migraine,

1029
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:26.900
which is a migraine that you don't have a headache but your eyes from stressing

1030
01:01:26.901 --> 01:01:31.520
it,
looking at computers or lack of sleep,
uh,
that,
that happens.

1031
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.610
But I've had it happen twice in a month.
Right.
That makes sense.

1032
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.740
If it happens once,
it means you know,
your,

1033
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.300
your eyes are weak by whatever you're doing,
I think,
I think looking at monitors,

1034
01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:42.970
it's fucking terrible.
You know,

1035
01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.370
I did a podcast last week where I didn't bring the laptop and we do the fight

1036
01:01:46.371 --> 01:01:48.920
companion podcast.
My eyes felt better by the end of the day.

1037
01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.730
It was like at the end of that,
like I think staring at a screen like that,

1038
01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.960
I mean I,
my screen is too bright,

1039
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.900
but I think staring at a screen like that all the time,

1040
01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.480
I just think it's real bad for you.

1041
01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:02.330
I'm just totally unnatural to be staring in a light source like that six,

1042
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.760
you know,
a foot,
two feet from your face,

1043
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:08.180
especially a phone where you usually squinting.
It's not like a fixed screen.

1044
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:12.680
Phones are terrible.
It's great.
What they do is amazing.
I mean the,

1045
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.440
I would never give them back.
I would never say man,

1046
01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:20.100
brother grew book to fucking smoke signals.
You know,
I love phones,
but the

1047
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.800
<v 2>what they're doing,
he is not good.
It's just not good.</v>

1048
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:25.770
It's just not good to be staring at my eyes or it's significantly worse than

1049
01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:29.490
they were three or four years ago.
Yeah,
it goes fast.
Huh?
That's interesting.

1050
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:35.170
Yeah,
it's not good.
I bought a book,
um,
that's direct.
Um,

1051
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.090
Steve Maxwell recommended,
but I haven't gotten to it.
I think there's,

1052
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.780
the irony is not lost on me that it,
when I'm wearing reading glasses,

1053
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:46.110
reading a book about how to not read with glasses

1054
01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:51.030
or wearing reading glasses.

1055
01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:56.330
And when I'm reading a book about how to not use reading glasses while I'm

1056
01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:01.140
reading with glasses,
it's a book about not reading.
Yeah.

1057
01:03:01.141 --> 01:03:03.990
It's like throw away your glasses and see,
I think it's the name of the book.

1058
01:03:03.991 --> 01:03:06.960
I'm like,
it's hilarious.
I'm reading this book while I'm wearing glasses.

1059
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.910
That's him.
That book makes zero sense.
It,
I,
there's,
it's like,

1060
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.150
I think it's called the Bates method for,
um,
strengthening your eyes.

1061
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:23.210
The idea is that your eyes are like any other part of your body and you,

1062
01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.000
if you use them properly,
you can strengthen them.

1063
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:29.970
But if you don't use them properly,
you can weaken them.
You know,

1064
01:03:29.971 --> 01:03:34.050
like if you breathe in coal fumes all day,
you're gonna fuck up your lungs.

1065
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:38.970
So the idea is if you're staring at a computer screen all day,

1066
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.380
you're fucking up your eyes and there may be ways to sort of at least partially

1067
01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:47.760
mitigate the damage that you're doing to your eyes.
Play some quake.

1068
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:51.000
Yeah.
That's supposed to be good for your eyes,
right?
God dammit.

1069
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:56.230
Can't get me in there man.
I know.
I know.
What's wrong with me?
I,

1070
01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:00.120
that's one that's one that I can't go back to.
It's just too much.

1071
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:05.910
I liked it too much.
I just,
I'm a,
I'm doing too well without it.

1072
01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:10.110
That's really what your eyes,
your eyes more than that book.
Maybe.

1073
01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.650
I don't think it,
well,
I just think,
uh,
uh,

1074
01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.950
it will be one hour and then it'll be two hours and then it'll be four hours a

1075
01:04:16.951 --> 01:04:20.250
day.
And the next thing you know,
I'm not writing any new jokes.

1076
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.550
I'm not going to the Improv or the comedy store.

1077
01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:27.270
I'm not sitting in front of the computer or a pen and paper and getting shit

1078
01:04:27.271 --> 01:04:27.541
done.

1079
01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:32.370
No [inaudible] Jones and Jones and Niggle frag people to go fucking chain gun,

1080
01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:35.340
someone rail,
gun them.
And it's fun.

1081
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:38.760
If you twitch for three hours and then you got some comedy out of it.
Yeah,

1082
01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:41.430
you can make it a podcast.
What comedy would I get out of it?

1083
01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:45.240
Bullshit with people.
You might get a judge.
I don't know about all that.

1084
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:48.120
Have you ever bought I bought kiss somebody like touched eyeballs.

1085
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.720
It's cool how we'll do it again.
It's no it,
it's cool.
No,

1086
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:59.310
I have it was weird.
You're like touch to it to a girl.
I love it.
It's so,

1087
01:04:59.311 --> 01:05:02.430
it's weird touching something that somebody sees through.

1088
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.060
There was a story about a dude who died.
Um,
I don't know if it's true,

1089
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:08.070
so I should probably look it up.
Um,

1090
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:11.820
he got staph infection on his eyeball because during the wrestling match,

1091
01:05:11.821 --> 01:05:15.690
it's contact lens came out,
it fell on a mat,
took it,

1092
01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.260
put it back in his eye and a,
I got a staph infection as I want up dying.

1093
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.460
That could be one of those fucking leprechauns.

1094
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:26.180
<v 3>It makes sense.
I mean,
I,</v>

1095
01:05:26.181 --> 01:05:28.940
herpes is a real thing and that's actually pretty common.

1096
01:05:28.941 --> 01:05:32.550
And you get outbreaks on your eyes.
Is I herpes a real thing?
Yeah.
Really.

1097
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:37.740
I herpes,
I heard eyeballs.
You can get herpes and your eyeballs.
Yeah,

1098
01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:42.560
I heard police,
ocular herpes leads.
Ocular herpes.

1099
01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:46.590
<v 2>So like when you go to close your eyelids,
like as you blinking,</v>

1100
01:05:46.591 --> 01:05:51.570
it's going over that giant Zit pops your eyeballs.
Oh my God.

1101
01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.190
How old are you?

1102
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.150
How bold do you have to be to pop and eyeballs that can imagine if you popped it

1103
01:05:57.151 --> 01:05:59.880
and you felt that ooze.
Oh

1104
01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:05.970
yeah.
You probably can't pop and eye balls it cause it would.
If it gets infected.

1105
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:11.670
Fuck,
that's not good.
It don't Google image search.

1106
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:16.200
I herpes either just stop and think about some of the fucked up diseases that

1107
01:06:16.201 --> 01:06:20.940
people can get.
You don't even know about them until they happen.
And then you go,

1108
01:06:20.941 --> 01:06:25.680
wait,
what do I have?
I bought herpes surfers at one time.
I've ever seen that.

1109
01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:31.150
No,
that's real brown.
Yeah.
Oh God.
Look up.

1110
01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.610
What is surfers?
Overexposure to Sun.

1111
01:06:35.611 --> 01:06:39.390
It's called pterygium.
I can't say that right,
but oh wow.

1112
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.960
Cocular mucus extension.

1113
01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:46.500
I don't know what happens.
It just starts taking over your,

1114
01:06:46.501 --> 01:06:50.830
I think it's the where like I cancer.
Oh my God.
And a,

1115
01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:54.810
what do they do about it?
I think you're fucking,
did you guys lose your eye?

1116
01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:56.610
Oh my God.
Really?
I mean,

1117
01:06:56.611 --> 01:07:00.090
I don't think I can go look how much that one guy the it gets.
It's a woman.

1118
01:07:00.091 --> 01:07:04.860
The black one.
Oh God.
This is too horrible.
Oh my God.

1119
01:07:04.861 --> 01:07:08.430
Look at that.
Look how it's overcoming her vision.

1120
01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:14.010
Look at what's going on with this guy.
Same thing.
Surfer.
Now he's got it.

1121
01:07:14.011 --> 01:07:15.910
He's a victim of surf rage.
Oh,

1122
01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:22.350
that guy got his ass lit up.
Does he have it?
Kelly Slater has it.

1123
01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:28.310
Do you see it on Kelly Slater?
He's just coming up.
Wow.
This is crazy.
I know.

1124
01:07:28.311 --> 01:07:33.311
They get an ear thing to surfers get surfer ear where the inside of their ear.

1125
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:36.020
Um,
they develop like these nodes,

1126
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:41.150
like these big bony protrusions.
Scary Shit,
man.

1127
01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:43.080
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1128
01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.000
<v 3>Yeah.
I had her friend can't be that good.</v>

1129
01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:49.740
I had a sunburn in my eye once because I was sitting at a table after a rain

1130
01:07:49.741 --> 01:07:54.460
storm and the sun had reflected off the table into my eyes for two hours while

1131
01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.400
it's just sitting there drinking or whatever.

1132
01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.890
And the next like couple hours later,

1133
01:07:58.891 --> 01:08:02.430
I couldn't see out of my eyes for like two days.
Whoa.
It was just burned.

1134
01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:06.510
My eyes were burning.
You had no idea.
No idea.
It was going on so bright.

1135
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.490
<v 2>I'm not looking at the sun.
It'll be
again booze.</v>

1136
01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:17.360
Yeah,
that was,
you'd be like,
I need some sunglasses,

1137
01:08:17.361 --> 01:08:20.540
man.
Yeah,
this is bullshit,
man.

1138
01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:23.420
It sucked because I had to go out in public and like,

1139
01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:25.500
I remember I went to red lobster and I couldn't see.

1140
01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.560
My Dad had to like walk me through red lobster.
Oh my God.
Did you hear that?

1141
01:08:30.561 --> 01:08:34.160
Um,
uh,
ed Snowden joined Twitter.
Yeah.

1142
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:38.270
You got like a million followers and an hour.
He's at 1.1 9 billion.

1143
01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:42.530
Interesting.
And he did Neil degrasse Tyson's podcast.

1144
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.450
Neil degrasse Tyson is such a bad motherfucker.
He wrote this on Twitter.

1145
01:08:47.451 --> 01:08:52.451
You would ed stone after discussing everything from chemistry to Constitution on

1146
01:08:53.001 --> 01:08:57.140
Star Trek.
Star Talk.
You're a patriot.
To me.
Safe stay safe.

1147
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:03.740
Poor fucking guy who is following.
He's only following one.

1148
01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:07.490
One account.
Yeah,
the NSA.
Hilarious.

1149
01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:12.050
That is,
that is fucking hilarious.

1150
01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:19.060
That's how I comedy.
Oh,
poor bastard.
That's one of those things,
man,

1151
01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.410
like where's that going to be 2030 years from now?

1152
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.800
Cause like living in Russia,

1153
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:30.800
we're just speculating.
But I would imagine that's a,
this is,

1154
01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:33.710
well,
you know what though,
man,
if anybody would not,

1155
01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:37.220
I was gonna say it's probably terrifying you were living under this
dictatorship,

1156
01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.770
but if anybody would feel that it's not like that,

1157
01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.040
it's him because he knows what America is like.

1158
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.850
I mean they're trying to put that fucking guy in jail and why they tried to put

1159
01:09:46.851 --> 01:09:50.750
them in jail for exposing crime.
That's why they're trying to put them in jail.

1160
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:54.350
They're trying to put him in jail for the very thing that Obama used to have on

1161
01:09:54.351 --> 01:09:58.910
it's hope and change campaign website and his hope and change campaign website.

1162
01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:00.650
Before Obama became elected,

1163
01:10:00.651 --> 01:10:04.550
he had this whole thing about whistle blowers that they would support

1164
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:08.630
whistleblowers people that we're exposing crime and that they wouldn't punish

1165
01:10:08.631 --> 01:10:10.790
these people.
They would help them.
But meanwhile,

1166
01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:14.420
he's been the worst for whistle blowers.
It's,

1167
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:16.450
it was bullshit.
You know,

1168
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:20.570
he didn't really have the power that he claimed to have or would have when he

1169
01:10:20.571 --> 01:10:22.700
got in and then when he did get in,

1170
01:10:22.701 --> 01:10:25.040
he didn't do any of the things he said he would do when it comes to whistle

1171
01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:27.110
blowers,
nor did he support them publicly.

1172
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:31.820
He kept his fucking mouth shut or he spoke disparagingly about stolen.

1173
01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:35.930
Meanwhile,
if you ask the American people,
if he gave like a pole,

1174
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:38.390
like if everybody on Twitter,
how to vote,

1175
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:42.150
how many people are happy with what Ed Snowden did and how many people think

1176
01:10:42.151 --> 01:10:46.730
that what he did was dangerous in each be in jail.
I guarantee you most people,

1177
01:10:46.731 --> 01:10:49.840
especially people that know what the case was actually about,
they would,

1178
01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:50.753
they would support him.

1179
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:56.060
He went way out of his way to make sure that no one got in trouble or that no

1180
01:10:56.061 --> 01:10:57.560
one was doxed,

1181
01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:01.070
that their information wasn't released and that critical operations weren't

1182
01:11:01.071 --> 01:11:01.850
compromised.

1183
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:06.110
He went way out of his way and he brought that shit to a bunch of different

1184
01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:08.810
sources before he brought it to Glenn Greenwald.

1185
01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:11.560
There was a bunch of different people he brought it to that they didn't want to

1186
01:11:11.561 --> 01:11:14.550
have anything to do with it.
The whole thing is just so strange.

1187
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.470
<v 4>It's terrifying.
You think Obama might help him out before he gets out of,
uh,</v>

1188
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.361
help him out.

1189
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:24.150
Like maybe like not excommunicate him cause he's not in prison right now,

1190
01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:27.960
but he should totally do that back.
You should do that right now.

1191
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.370
He should do that right now.

1192
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:34.790
He should have a speech and he should tell the American public that what the NSA

1193
01:11:34.831 --> 01:11:39.630
did cross the line and that the average American person is not a criminal and we

1194
01:11:39.631 --> 01:11:43.410
shouldn't be treated as a criminal until proven differently.
It's not,

1195
01:11:43.411 --> 01:11:46.140
that's not how democracy works and that kind of pressure.

1196
01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.530
Here's the living your life under that kind of pressure is awful.

1197
01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.030
Nobody wants to live like that.

1198
01:11:51.031 --> 01:11:54.810
Worrying that people looking over your shoulder because it affects your freedom.

1199
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:56.990
It affects the way you think and behave.
You didn't,

1200
01:11:56.991 --> 01:12:01.991
you feel like you're being observed and watched and that that has a big impact

1201
01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:06.930
on how you behave and think if you're constantly,
like if you ever walk,

1202
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:08.430
worked in a place where your boss,

1203
01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:13.260
I'm like thought you were a untrustworthy or thought you were sneaky and
they're,

1204
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.640
you know,
or you know,

1205
01:12:14.641 --> 01:12:18.060
didn't like you in any way and they're always like checking in on your work and

1206
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:21.060
they're always following you around rally it makes working in that office a

1207
01:12:21.061 --> 01:12:21.960
fucking nightmare.

1208
01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.380
You're spending eight hours a day with some fucking guy who is constantly

1209
01:12:25.381 --> 01:12:26.580
looking at you sideways,

1210
01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:31.020
who imagine turn it to 24 hours a day and that's what the CIA or the NSA is

1211
01:12:31.021 --> 01:12:34.370
doing.
I mean,
they're,
they're your boss there.
Dick checking in on you.

1212
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:38.130
Let me look at your Google search.
What do you give a shit about torture?
Why?

1213
01:12:38.131 --> 01:12:39.300
Why are you in,
I mean,

1214
01:12:39.301 --> 01:12:42.660
what if you want to find out how they torture people like you're allowed to as

1215
01:12:42.661 --> 01:12:43.650
an adult.
Okay.

1216
01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.060
As a fucking grown adult and you say torture tactics of Isis.

1217
01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:50.730
Like I want to know what they do.
Let's see what they do.
Okay,

1218
01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:52.980
let's see what they do in China.
Let's see what they do.
Why,

1219
01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:55.380
why you looking at it?
Woo.
The fuck are you?

1220
01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:59.100
I'm looking at it because it's a possible search result.

1221
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:03.930
I want to ask a question.
I want to know why is that bad?
What's not bad?

1222
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.680
But if you start googling weird shit about Islam or isis or you know,

1223
01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:10.350
how do you convert?
What if I want to know how you convert?
How's that work?

1224
01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:13.440
What do I have?
What if I wander around?
What's the protocol?
How do I join one?

1225
01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:16.500
If I want to know am I going to get visited cause I want to have,

1226
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:20.640
if I'm not joining Isis Guy dammit.
But if I want to have some information,

1227
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.240
like maybe I'm wanting to be able to,
you know,
answer that question.

1228
01:13:24.241 --> 01:13:28.040
If someone says,
how do they join isis?
I researched that actually they,

1229
01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:31.230
this is what they do.
Well if you start looking at all that shit,

1230
01:13:31.231 --> 01:13:33.650
they will put you on a fucking list and the wolves,

1231
01:13:33.651 --> 01:13:36.900
they're putting you on that list for your own good.
Are they really?

1232
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:38.850
How about you just catch people?
They do crime.

1233
01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:42.870
How about you just prevent crime from happening and not by making everyone a

1234
01:13:42.871 --> 01:13:46.830
criminal.
When you start looking at everybody's fucking email,

1235
01:13:46.831 --> 01:13:48.900
you start recording everybody's phone calls.

1236
01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:52.470
You start taking everybody's text messages and putting them in a database.

1237
01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:57.930
Fuck you.
You know,
and we all agree with that.
Meanwhile,

1238
01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.770
this poor guy,
he's in Russia,
cut pussy thing.
He's getting over there.

1239
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:07.730
It's funny how Facebook does that legally,
right?
Hot ones,
right?
You know,

1240
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:12.460
hot rush.
How many accounts do you have?
A lot.
Uh,
connected to Facebook.

1241
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.890
<v 1>You know how like,
it's like log in with Facebook,
you know,</v>

1242
01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:18.460
if you forget how many times you do that.
And then there's a,

1243
01:14:18.461 --> 01:14:21.850
there's a setting somewhere in Facebook where you can see everything you've
done.

1244
01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.160
And like the other day I looked at it,
it was like,
Oh,

1245
01:14:24.161 --> 01:14:27.400
you listen to this song at three o'clock.
Then you ordered food from this place.

1246
01:14:27.401 --> 01:14:30.040
Then you took an Uber to this.
And then I was just like,
Holy Shit.

1247
01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:34.890
So you have so much information.
Yeah.
So can anybody else look at it?
No.
But,

1248
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.100
but Facebook has all that and I've,
and I've been doing it for years.

1249
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:41.110
You just forget when you log in with Facebook,

1250
01:14:41.111 --> 01:14:46.111
how much you actually use that use Facebook or you're telling Facebook what

1251
01:14:46.331 --> 01:14:49.690
you're doing,
but you forget that you're logged in to eat 24 with Facebook.

1252
01:14:49.691 --> 01:14:53.260
You're logged into Facebook.
I don't do that.

1253
01:14:53.261 --> 01:14:56.890
I don't use Facebook to log in to anything.
Yeah I do.
Because it's easy.

1254
01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.300
It's like in town we don't have to sign up to me like that's not good.

1255
01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:05.980
Especially a database like Facebook where they sell your shit because they sell

1256
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:07.090
your shit.
Like they're there.

1257
01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:10.990
They're all coming up with new and better ways to profit off of the list that

1258
01:15:10.991 --> 01:15:14.960
they can generate.
But when you're buying habits arm like you know how,

1259
01:15:14.961 --> 01:15:17.590
when is it that always weirds me out like you Google something because the other

1260
01:15:17.591 --> 01:15:21.460
day I was googling a specific type of binocular swore off ski.

1261
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:24.040
They're like very famous binoculars.
So I'm googling,

1262
01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:26.110
I'm looking at the different types of binoculars.

1263
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:31.470
Then I go to some website and there's a fucking Swarovski add in the Google ad

1264
01:15:31.481 --> 01:15:34.150
things.
Cause they know I've been looking like,
oh,
what about this?

1265
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:37.600
Why don't you buy that and now you think about it man.
And I was like,
wow,

1266
01:15:37.601 --> 01:15:38.860
that's Kinda fucked up.

1267
01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:44.040
It's kind of weird that they tailor the ads to you because I never saw hunting

1268
01:15:44.381 --> 01:15:48.760
binocular ads and some fucking buzzfeed website.

1269
01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:51.100
Like all of a sudden I see it like why am I seeing that there?

1270
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:54.730
Because it's tailored to my search results and,
and you know,

1271
01:15:54.731 --> 01:15:58.660
just saying all of Guardian right now,
we'll make all of garden play on Youtube.

1272
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:59.171
You know,

1273
01:15:59.171 --> 01:16:02.900
because they go through the audio of youtube videos and if there's certain

1274
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:05.890
advertising olive garden right now and it will make,

1275
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.310
there will be an all garden ad at the beginning of the podcast.
A lot of times.

1276
01:16:09.311 --> 01:16:14.260
Yeah.
If it's,
if it's a current site paid sponsor from Youtube,

1277
01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:18.460
does that mean that they do a transcript of the show?
They all,

1278
01:16:18.461 --> 01:16:22.060
everything is transcript now.
Any video you put out nowadays,

1279
01:16:22.061 --> 01:16:26.830
there's a transcript of imagine trying to transcribe one of our Sros.
Oh,

1280
01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:30.850
it's done.
Yeah.
But I mean,
imagine if you tried to look,
if you took parts of it.

1281
01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:34.660
That's like one of the problems that I have with uh,

1282
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:39.340
people taking a little snippets of the podcast and then having making whole

1283
01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:42.230
articles about a conversation that was said because you're,

1284
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:45.640
you're taking something that's completely out of context and all the humor and

1285
01:16:45.641 --> 01:16:50.320
irony and sarcasm Mollett shits completely missing.
You just get a sentence,

1286
01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:55.390
you know,
like me telling Milo yesterday,
your k is fuck dude,
like buzz.

1287
01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:59.330
What was it?
Buzzfeed news or was it raw story?
Story.
They make it,

1288
01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.230
you look at it and go,
what is he saying here?
Like why is he saying that to him?

1289
01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:07.231
Like it looks so much different when you see something like transcribed.

1290
01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:12.830
Like transcription is not necessarily a really good,

1291
01:17:13.190 --> 01:17:15.130
um,
it,
it's,

1292
01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:19.310
it's not the full capturing of a conversation.
It's just not,

1293
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:22.280
and try to pretend it is like when someone,

1294
01:17:22.450 --> 01:17:26.090
if someone like put something in quotes and says that,
you know,

1295
01:17:26.091 --> 01:17:29.420
Hillary Clinton said this,
okay,
can I see how she said it?

1296
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:31.430
Can I see who she was talking to?

1297
01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.850
Can you show me a video of what they were talking about before then?

1298
01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:38.540
Because then I'll only understand what she's really saying and that's how emojis

1299
01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:43.430
were born.
That's the purpose of right at the hand of the side.
Like,
oh,

1300
01:17:43.431 --> 01:17:46.610
she's been cunty cause that what the hand to the side

1301
01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:52.370
walk like an Egyptian.
I didn't know that.

1302
01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.100
I don't use emojis.
You don't?
Oh,

1303
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:58.580
I'm so deep in emojis and the new ones are about to come out.

1304
01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:03.590
Like we've got in the ways Taco Tacos on the way and I already have piles of

1305
01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:08.591
shit and the guns of gun emojis or sometimes people send me a text and I'm like,

1306
01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:11.450
I don't know what you're saying,
but I think you're going to shoot the shit.

1307
01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.560
Shoot Shit.
I overuse eggplant.
Eggplant.

1308
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:19.380
Why do you use that one for Coq au,
your deck eggplant.

1309
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:22.570
That's the international dick.
If your Dick looks like that with that,

1310
01:18:22.571 --> 01:18:26.690
that it's probably dying.
You probably have a horrible infection.

1311
01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:30.620
You need to go get your Dick drained at gs.
Eggplant Sushi,

1312
01:18:30.621 --> 01:18:33.740
squirt the three drops of water.

1313
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:40.640
That's uh,
that's one way to say a sentence.
Will a woman,
you know,

1314
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:44.750
it's a funny thing about the way we do language that we think of that as like

1315
01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:45.800
the only way to do language.

1316
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:48.680
But if you look at like hieroglyphs that's kind of what they did.

1317
01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:53.030
They just talk and Emojis,
I mean the Egyptians,

1318
01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:57.740
they drew all their shit like there were,
oh here we are pushing a rock.

1319
01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.980
Here we are with the boat.
You know,
this guy has a sword.

1320
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.650
Do they know if the hieroglyphs written by smart people or not?

1321
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:06.650
Has that ever come up?
Well,
they were the smartest people around.

1322
01:19:06.651 --> 01:19:10.940
Otherwise it'd be people that had hieroglyphs are making fun of hieroglyphs no

1323
01:19:10.941 --> 01:19:13.760
fire.
He smart.
Oh what does that mean?
And you know,

1324
01:19:13.761 --> 01:19:17.540
there was smart like that could have the hieroglyphs that are found could have

1325
01:19:17.541 --> 01:19:19.580
been written by the dumb kids or whatever.

1326
01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.140
They were just frightened in emojis to each other.

1327
01:19:21.141 --> 01:19:24.160
That's the only ones that got found or you know what I mean?
Well,

1328
01:19:24.161 --> 01:19:27.800
it used to be a thing called the library of Alexandria,
but it was burned,

1329
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.440
burned to the ground more than once,
I think.

1330
01:19:30.441 --> 01:19:33.310
I think the Muslims burned it down and I think about,

1331
01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.640
I think someone else burnt it down to,
I want to say,
I forget who it is,

1332
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:42.080
but they,
uh,
they lost all their records.
They lost all their,

1333
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:45.710
he said people used to go to Egypt from all over the world to learn.

1334
01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:50.180
They used to have psychedelic studies there.
They used trip balls.

1335
01:19:50.181 --> 01:19:55.040
They used to fucking learn about mathematics and construction techniques and we

1336
01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:57.860
don't know what the fuck they taught them.
We don't know what the fuck they knew.

1337
01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:00.080
We don't know anything.
We just see amazing,

1338
01:20:00.081 --> 01:20:04.910
amazing shit that they left behind and go,
fuck how the hell they do this.

1339
01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.030
We don't know.
We just guess just a bunch of guesswork

1340
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.670
<v 2>once the scientists that every now and then someone will put together a paper.</v>

1341
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:14.760
We've solved the riddle of how they made the pyramids.

1342
01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:18.960
It's quite simple actually.
No,
it's not.

1343
01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:23.100
Do you know it's not carved it out of a mountain.
It's not even a little simple.

1344
01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:26.460
It's crazy.
Those things are giant and they're perfect.

1345
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.760
The Great Pyramid is 2 million,
600,000 stones.

1346
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:34.500
They're cut so perfectly that you can't even like wedge a sheet of paper.

1347
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:37.320
You can get a razor blade in between the stones in most cases.

1348
01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.200
The ones that you see on the outside that are rough and horrible.

1349
01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:43.500
The reason why they're rough is because of the pyramid used to be covered in

1350
01:20:43.501 --> 01:20:48.090
smooth limestone.
It used to be this beautiful,
smooth,
flat surface,

1351
01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:51.660
but when they were building Cairo,
those fucking apes,

1352
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.660
like a thousand years later,
2000 years later,
whatever it was,

1353
01:20:55.170 --> 01:21:00.050
they stole all the limestone from the pyramids.
They chipped it,
chipped it away,

1354
01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.720
pulled it off,
and built their streets with it.
Fucking dummies.

1355
01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:09.820
It's so you imagine how fucking stupid they had to be to chip away at the

1356
01:21:09.901 --> 01:21:11.190
outside of the pyramid.

1357
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:14.970
Take the limestone off fucking morons.

1358
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:18.060
You think maybe the pyramids or it's just a mountain and they just carved the

1359
01:21:18.061 --> 01:21:20.710
pyramid out of the mountain.
I think you need to read.

1360
01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:24.780
I need to read books.
It makes sense.

1361
01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:28.380
That was a one of the explanations for what the Sphinx was.

1362
01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:33.630
The Sphinx was what they call a yard.
Dang,
what a yard.
Dang is.

1363
01:21:33.631 --> 01:21:35.160
When you say like you've ever seen,

1364
01:21:35.161 --> 01:21:37.800
like they always have these like mountains where the side of the mountain looks

1365
01:21:37.801 --> 01:21:38.730
like an Indian's head.

1366
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:43.050
The idea is you take something like that and then you start actually carving

1367
01:21:43.051 --> 01:21:45.420
away at it until it really looks like a sphinx.

1368
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:49.740
And the idea was that there was this rock that looked similar to that.

1369
01:21:49.741 --> 01:21:52.920
It's like some standout rock and then they did all this stuff to it.

1370
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.380
The problem with that is,
uh,
there's,

1371
01:21:55.381 --> 01:21:57.900
there's just a lot of evidence for how they built that thing.

1372
01:21:57.901 --> 01:21:59.220
They know how the carved it out,

1373
01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:02.970
the temple that the Sphinx is in that area that shows all the water erosion.

1374
01:22:02.971 --> 01:22:05.270
Like they know where the blocks are.
Like they take them from here,

1375
01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.300
they move them to their blocks are missing.
So they're,

1376
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.890
they're pretty sure that it's fucked.

1377
01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:13.950
That's another weird one because there's finks like they're reconstructing it

1378
01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:17.190
and when they're reconstructing it,
they're just building on the outside of it.

1379
01:22:17.191 --> 01:22:18.690
Like they're doing such a shitty job.

1380
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:21.380
Like if you ever seen like the reconstruction photos,

1381
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:24.680
this his help my case making like concrete.
They are,
they're,
they're,

1382
01:22:24.681 --> 01:22:29.610
they're making like they're doing their own art and they're covering over the

1383
01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:32.370
old shit.
Like I guess they have to,

1384
01:22:32.371 --> 01:22:35.340
to preserve it because I guess it's crumbling and falling apart.

1385
01:22:35.341 --> 01:22:38.280
So a lot of it is just to try to preserve it,

1386
01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:42.060
but like a JBC if he could pull up some pictures of the restoration of the

1387
01:22:42.061 --> 01:22:44.030
Sphinx because it's,
uh,

1388
01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:47.340
it's real controversial because when you look at it like you're not really

1389
01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:48.660
looking at the Sphinx anymore.

1390
01:22:48.661 --> 01:22:53.370
You're looking at a modern interpretation of covering the outside of the feet

1391
01:22:53.371 --> 01:22:57.180
and parts of the base.
It's not really the sphinx anymore.

1392
01:22:57.750 --> 01:23:02.430
Like watch the WWE,
they show the,
the feet like see that the upper right hand,

1393
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:06.190
the middle,
the middle.
Sorry.
We the middle.
You can see

1394
01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:11.080
<v 1>why.
Yeah,
yeah.
Go to go to view image and spread that out.</v>

1395
01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:14.770
It looks like they just got,
well,
we'll just patch it up.
Yeah.
$5.

1396
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:15.670
Who Look what they're doing.

1397
01:23:15.670 --> 01:23:19.180
They just have modern bricks and they're smoothing it all out.

1398
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:24.100
So I mean,
yeah,
I guess it looks good.

1399
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:26.680
Like,
in terms of,
you know,
it's,

1400
01:23:26.681 --> 01:23:29.560
it's smooth stones and everything,

1401
01:23:29.561 --> 01:23:32.440
but what they're doing is not the original Sphinx.

1402
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:36.340
If you're seeing those people make the sidewalks where it looks like if there's

1403
01:23:36.341 --> 01:23:38.230
a bunch of rocks,
but it's not,

1404
01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:42.280
it's just a optic or just an illusion where they'd take a,
I like this thing,

1405
01:23:42.281 --> 01:23:46.270
they put it down and make like a lines to make it look like rocks and then they

1406
01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:50.830
wash it a certain way.
No,
Jamie,
that's,
I'm sorry,
but Jamie's,
that's not real.

1407
01:23:50.831 --> 01:23:52.900
Right?
The nose thing.
That's not real.

1408
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:57.940
It looks like they're building a fake nose and his face was like,
what?
No,

1409
01:23:57.941 --> 01:24:02.410
so I'm sorry.
So say that again.
They have the,
the,
this,
this way to make uh,

1410
01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:06.040
like worried.
If they're making like a sidewalk,
they put down in this,

1411
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:07.090
all this concrete,

1412
01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:12.120
then they put like a pattern that looks like a cutout rocks over it and it kind

1413
01:24:12.191 --> 01:24:13.240
of like step on it.

1414
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:17.590
They take it off and then they wash like fake wash on it or something.

1415
01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:21.880
So then the final product looks like they have individual stones in the sidewalk

1416
01:24:21.881 --> 01:24:25.350
when really it's just an illusion.
It's kind of like what,

1417
01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:28.690
what it looks like they're doing to the Sphinx where they're almost making it

1418
01:24:28.691 --> 01:24:32.410
look like it's like they're putting new rocks in it where it's probably just

1419
01:24:32.411 --> 01:24:36.850
lines paint,
airbrush.
Yeah.
It's real weird ma'am.

1420
01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:42.250
It's real weird.
You know,
we have ideas about what,
what a,
what a thing is.

1421
01:24:42.730 --> 01:24:47.380
And other countries have different ideas like say like,
like uh,

1422
01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:51.550
we would look at that and we'd go,
okay,
that's not a restoration.

1423
01:24:51.551 --> 01:24:55.480
That shit on the outside is different.
But like in Japan,

1424
01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.740
like in Japan,

1425
01:24:56.741 --> 01:25:00.670
they have buildings like houses that exist that are a thousand years old.

1426
01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:04.930
And what they've done is restored everything.
Everything's restored,

1427
01:25:04.931 --> 01:25:07.630
all the floorboards are new or the walls or new,
everything's new.

1428
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:10.840
But the shape is the same.
So like we look at it and go,
hey,

1429
01:25:10.841 --> 01:25:15.310
that's not the same building.
And they go,
well to them it is cause the them,

1430
01:25:15.311 --> 01:25:19.000
it's the original location.
They've restored what it looks like.

1431
01:25:19.001 --> 01:25:21.910
And this is the original building to them.
But like in Europe,

1432
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:23.920
like if you go to a pub in London,

1433
01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:28.330
you'll go to a pub that's hundreds of years old and that fucking pub is the
same.

1434
01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:32.920
You walk down those stairs,
it's all worn out where the people's feet have been.

1435
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.020
You look at the walls,
you look at the,
the,

1436
01:25:35.021 --> 01:25:38.650
the fucking railings on the bar and it's all worn down.

1437
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:43.390
Look at that place.
Jesus Christ is great.
Fuck.

1438
01:25:43.391 --> 01:25:47.140
Where is that gets him absence.
That's in London.

1439
01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.000
London has some cool old craftsmanship,
man.
I'm gonna go there or been there.

1440
01:25:52.001 --> 01:25:56.440
So you never been to London?
I've only been on Canada and Japan.

1441
01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:01.630
That's right.
Yeah,
because London will be interesting if you go to,

1442
01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:04.520
cause you could do some stand up there.
Yeah,
there's a sweet,

1443
01:26:04.521 --> 01:26:08.930
I want to go to Sweden and London.
Do you do,
you would do standup at Sweden.
Yeah,

1444
01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.430
a lot of Sweden for some reason I just looking at numbers and stuff like that.

1445
01:26:13.450 --> 01:26:16.420
Sweden is like with number one almost.
It's the right behind uh,

1446
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:20.360
Canada and Australia.
Well they do speak English.

1447
01:26:20.361 --> 01:26:23.990
That's the cool thing about being American.
We're so fucking bad ass.

1448
01:26:23.991 --> 01:26:26.290
Other countries speak our language and what I'm saying?
Hmm.

1449
01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:30.710
Actually it's like European English thing,
but if you,
uh,

1450
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:33.680
if you go to almost all those countries,
they speak English.

1451
01:26:33.681 --> 01:26:38.210
Like I did stand up in Norway or in Sweden rather than I'll Stockholm.

1452
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.670
Stockholm.
Yeah.
Is there,

1453
01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:42.200
is there a certain countries that you have to know certain rules,

1454
01:26:42.201 --> 01:26:45.560
like whatever you do,
it did not talk about [inaudible] now.
Yeah,

1455
01:26:45.561 --> 01:26:48.350
I would imagine like in the Middle East especially,

1456
01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:52.040
you can't talk shit about the royal family.
Thailand's the same way.

1457
01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:54.560
If you talk shit about the king and Thailand,
they'll lock your ass up.

1458
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.800
Have you been falling?
What's going on with the black cabs versus Uber?

1459
01:26:57.830 --> 01:27:00.360
That's shits.
Interesting.
What's going on?
Uh,

1460
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:03.200
I guess from what I've understand is,
you know,

1461
01:27:03.230 --> 01:27:07.010
the guys that you still have the horses back in the days they used to be like,

1462
01:27:07.011 --> 01:27:11.720
you know,
drive around the course carriages and style and in the UK,

1463
01:27:11.721 --> 01:27:15.860
England,
yeah.
Okay.
And then they moved on through cabs and stuff like that.

1464
01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:19.790
And I guess Uber's trying to come over there.
And so like,
this is like a family,

1465
01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:20.624
you know,

1466
01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:25.690
my father used to ride horses and stuff and so they're like pretty much fighting

1467
01:27:25.911 --> 01:27:29.300
with the Uber drivers like,
and they're stopping traffic.
Like there's a,

1468
01:27:29.301 --> 01:27:31.490
I sent you something that recently,

1469
01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:36.140
like the black cabs are protesting or they're just bringing in central London to

1470
01:27:36.141 --> 01:27:40.910
a standstill,
uh,
just over this.
Uh,
wow.
This is crazy.

1471
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:42.680
So they just shut down the streets.
Yeah.

1472
01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:44.540
And Park their car and shut down the streets.

1473
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:47.620
And the black cab drivers are doing like that.
Kind of like the,
you know,

1474
01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:50.020
beating up the Uber drivers and like,

1475
01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.480
like old school gangs in New York type shit.

1476
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.950
But they were just a passed in Vegas.
What?
Yep.
Double.

1477
01:27:57.951 --> 01:28:02.390
I got double charged in an la though.
So that's twice as much as la,

1478
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:03.960
but it's still cheaper than a taxi.

1479
01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.710
You gotta be in a group too or something where,
or five,

1480
01:28:06.711 --> 01:28:09.380
six people or something like that?
Well,
I'd really like a cab.

1481
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:13.940
There's some weird rules about it.
Oh,
so they're trying to slowly box him out.

1482
01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.150
Thinking about it.
Last time I was in Vegas,
it'd be really hard to,

1483
01:28:17.151 --> 01:28:19.480
if there's a giant cab line and you're like,
ask her,

1484
01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.530
I'm going to use an Uber instead.
Yeah.

1485
01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.660
You just go off to the side of the street like,

1486
01:28:23.661 --> 01:28:26.690
and just stop in a caption to pick your right Uber's and a stop on the Strip and

1487
01:28:26.691 --> 01:28:30.650
pick you up.
Chaos.
You're right.
Yeah,
that'd be complete chaos.

1488
01:28:30.651 --> 01:28:34.730
All would be cars are stopping people getting mad beeping horns.

1489
01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:36.410
People are going to shoot people.
It's gonna be crazy.

1490
01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:39.140
They'd have to have Uber ports at the hotels or something like that.

1491
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:42.410
That's a crazy picture though.
That London picture.
Put that up again,
Jamie.

1492
01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.180
Look at that photo.
Look how many calves are are.

1493
01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:47.900
They've completely shut the street down.
The,
the folks who are at home,

1494
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:51.860
we're looking@thisondailymail.com.
So you always wonder,

1495
01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:56.610
you read something on the Daily Mail.
I kind of full of Shit,
but uh,
the,

1496
01:28:56.611 --> 01:28:57.890
the picture is incredible.

1497
01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:02.040
They just have all these hundreds and hundreds of cabs shut

1498
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.760
<v 2>down the streets and they're all just sitting around talking.
Well,
you know,</v>

1499
01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:07.680
I kind of see where they're coming from.

1500
01:29:07.970 --> 01:29:11.130
They don't want to get boxed out by some new a competitor,

1501
01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:14.850
but I kind of see where Uber's coming from too.

1502
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.960
I took a taxi the other day home from the comedy store on what's usually at $13

1503
01:29:18.961 --> 01:29:19.720
cap cabaret.

1504
01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:24.410
It costs me $38 30 notice an Uber Guy,

1505
01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:27.090
usually it's $13 on Uber usually.
Yes.

1506
01:29:27.130 --> 01:29:31.890
And it was $38 on it in a taxi.
13 bucks is super reasonable.
Yeah.

1507
01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.730
Get you all the way to Burbank from the comedy store.
Yup.
Yeah.

1508
01:29:35.731 --> 01:29:38.440
It's nice because if you think about it,
parking is usually 20 bucks.

1509
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:40.980
You pay a little extra,
you can,
don't have to drive,

1510
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:43.760
you don't have to get fucked up and you drive home.
And that,
uh,

1511
01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:48.450
that parking lot next door is always a nightmare.
Yeah.
The con the comics,
the uh,

1512
01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.500
not the sunset strip or other,
it's just,
it's so,
so crowded,

1513
01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:56.580
such a crazy place that they're,
when they're,
they've got lost,

1514
01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:00.510
get shut down still.
Right now it's open to instruction.
I think it's open now.

1515
01:30:00.630 --> 01:30:02.100
It was shut down forever.
Yeah.

1516
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:07.320
Like how many months was it shut down for two maybe while they built something

1517
01:30:07.321 --> 01:30:09.240
there.
It's amazing that you can build something.

1518
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:12.480
You could have so much juice that while you're building you can shut down the

1519
01:30:12.481 --> 01:30:16.050
whole street in La on sunset.

1520
01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:20.310
I mean what?
You have that much juice.
You could shut a street down.

1521
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.330
I'm building a house here,
which look,
you stop,
stop driving cars.

1522
01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:30.120
Okay.
For how long a couple months was.
If they,

1523
01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:33.810
if you said that like I want to build my house here,
but for whatever reason,

1524
01:30:33.811 --> 01:30:35.940
because they have more money than you,
they can do that.

1525
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.570
Like they're building some stupid ass fucking building that it's more important

1526
01:30:39.571 --> 01:30:42.630
they build a stupid ass fucking building than it is for you to drive on the

1527
01:30:42.631 --> 01:30:46.680
street that you pay taxes to maintain.
God Damn it,
I'm getting mad.

1528
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:49.470
Or when they,
they're like close down streets for like,

1529
01:30:49.471 --> 01:30:52.800
oh they're filming the Kardashians up ahead.
So they had closed down sunset.

1530
01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:56.460
That makes me fight for movies too.

1531
01:30:56.461 --> 01:31:00.090
They'll shut them down from movies like fuck you.
That's not how it works.
Like,

1532
01:31:00.091 --> 01:31:03.850
you don't eat,
you can't just sell the street.
You can't sell.

1533
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.540
How much money are you getting?
Where's that money going?

1534
01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.490
It's inconveniencing all the rest of us.

1535
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:12.500
And you're talking about a place that's already massively overpopulated.

1536
01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.970
Las extremely overpopulated.

1537
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.960
I have friends that work in downtown and uh,

1538
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:22.320
they go to downtown all the time and uh,
they'll tell you like,

1539
01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:25.830
it's a two hour drive.
It's a two and a half hour drive.
It's,

1540
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:30.120
it's 30 miles and it'll take you two and a half hours at two in the afternoon,

1541
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:34.560
three in the afternoon.
You might not get there until five.
Like fuck fat.

1542
01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:39.000
Like it's,
it's a,
it's a crazy place to live.
We've got a bill.
Where are we going?

1543
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:44.670
Where should we go if we bail or uh,
organisms.
But I'm back to thinking,

1544
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:49.670
uh,
Denver recreational pot becomes legal Thursday.
Woop,
woop,

1545
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:53.610
you back to thinking in Denver.
Here's why.
Like Denver over Oregon,

1546
01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:58.230
it doesn't fucking rain every day,
right?
But Hey,
look at that guy.

1547
01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:02.380
That's the guy who's been rained on every day since he was three.
He's tired.

1548
01:32:03.190 --> 01:32:07.840
His bones are.
He just looks worn out.
They look worn out.

1549
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:11.830
They get worn out.
Yeah.
I think,

1550
01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:15.890
I think Denver or even maybe,
I wish Hawaii was swallow.

1551
01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:20.170
Portland has some hot chicks.
There's hot girls in Portland.
It's weird.

1552
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:22.720
You wouldn't think they'd be up there this plenty.

1553
01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:27.080
Even though it's raining all the time.
I'll probably cry a lot.

1554
01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:31.920
You probably cry a lot too.
We'd all cry.
Which call each of the rope.

1555
01:32:31.921 --> 01:32:35.440
I don't know man.
I'm thinking to go back to Burma.

1556
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:38.470
The wind.

1557
01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:44.060
I could take the rein to see the new Tesla.
Yes.
What do you think?

1558
01:32:44.061 --> 01:32:48.080
Why did they have a fucking space door on it?
Why is it a lambo?
Doors?

1559
01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:52.460
Cause it's cool man.
Is that why or is it a functional thing?
I don't know.

1560
01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:57.140
I think it looks neat.
I Dunno.
See if it's um,

1561
01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.460
I just want to know why they are there doing that.

1562
01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:02.593
<v 0>That thing,</v>

1563
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:08.450
<v 2>door thing,
when they're opening the door sideways,
they're opening the doors.</v>

1564
01:33:08.451 --> 01:33:13.100
Like the Lamborghini Lamborghini doors.
Like why would you want that?

1565
01:33:13.130 --> 01:33:16.700
That doesn't make any sense to me.
It's pretty cool.
Look at him.

1566
01:33:16.701 --> 01:33:20.750
He's always got that weird look on his face like,
hmm,
all crime.
You know,

1567
01:33:20.751 --> 01:33:24.130
like he's doing something where with his lips like,
alright,

1568
01:33:24.710 --> 01:33:26.520
well I'm just going to get all of them all like share

1569
01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:33.180
something new BMW ones.
Those look cool.
I liked the look of the,

1570
01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:38.120
yeah,
the blue and the white or whatever.
It looks really neat.
It's a tron car.

1571
01:33:38.121 --> 01:33:41.670
Some guy in front of me this morning had one.
Those are expensive,
right?
Yeah,

1572
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.370
they're really expensive.
They're like 120,000 bucks.
She that's super expensive.

1573
01:33:46.371 --> 01:33:48.140
This fucking thing he's got is even more than that.

1574
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:53.830
This fucker's like 140 it's super expensive and it's still bid fast.

1575
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:58.220
It's supposed to go zero to 60 in like three seconds.

1576
01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.520
It's the battery on this one.
Probably get you around the block a couple times.

1577
01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:05.630
Shit's out on you and explode that.
I'm atheist.
I don't know man.

1578
01:34:05.690 --> 01:34:07.340
This is what I think about these things.

1579
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:09.590
I love the fact that someone's making them.

1580
01:34:09.650 --> 01:34:11.450
I love the fact that they're available.

1581
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:16.750
And if you live in a place like La and you have electrical power or you could

1582
01:34:17.001 --> 01:34:20.060
drive this everyday,
plug it in at night,
you'd be fine.

1583
01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:23.750
But I would always want to have a real car standing by.

1584
01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.900
I would always want to have a real car standing by in case the shit hit the fan.

1585
01:34:27.230 --> 01:34:30.860
He had to get out of town and you need something that works on just gasoline,

1586
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:35.660
you know,
because I just think if you need to drive a long distance,

1587
01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:39.980
like from New York to California,
you can't fucking do it in that thing.

1588
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:43.820
You can't do it.
It goes 250 miles and that's it.

1589
01:34:44.150 --> 01:34:46.880
And you got to fucking charge it.
And if you don't charge it,

1590
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:49.940
it's going to leave you somewhere.
But if you're just trying to get around town,

1591
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.150
oh it's great.
It's probably the way to go.
Like I should probably get one,

1592
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:56.840
I should probably get a Tesla for like a drive around town car.

1593
01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.153
It's kind of the pro

1594
01:34:58.330 --> 01:35:03.290
<v 1>get solar power and a Tesla is like the perfect setup for drive around town.</v>

1595
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:08.240
I sent you a send that link of six cars that are taking on Tesla,

1596
01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:13.310
know the Porsche mission e which looks pretty sweet.
Awesome.
Lower than a Tesla,

1597
01:35:13.330 --> 01:35:16.910
believe it or not.
I think what's cool is the thunder power.
Evie,

1598
01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:19.430
have you seen this?
This looks like a Batmobile.
Well,

1599
01:35:19.431 --> 01:35:22.970
the prettiest one was the Fisker Karma.
Do you remember the Fisker Karma?

1600
01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:24.860
The company went under,

1601
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:29.810
but they created this amazingly beautiful car that even had solar panel on the

1602
01:35:29.811 --> 01:35:31.520
roof that powered the radio.

1603
01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:38.510
But when they had that big storm and the Pacific North East a few years back,

1604
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:44.620
I left all the Fiskars on the dock and they all got washed away by the ocean and

1605
01:35:44.621 --> 01:35:45.530
exploded.

1606
01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:50.370
They got the water came out of the ocean and filled up the parking lot in the,

1607
01:35:50.371 --> 01:35:54.380
the water level raised up to where the batteries were and they all exploded.

1608
01:35:57.610 --> 01:36:00.500
They had like 16.
Whoa.
That's the one I'm talking about.

1609
01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:04.460
That's the hold up power eve.
Who made that?
Uh,

1610
01:36:04.461 --> 01:36:08.270
it is a Taiwan based maker.
Um,
you know what that looks like.

1611
01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:13.550
Like a Nissan Gtr fucked your view.
Your Boat Volkswagen bug.
Yeah,

1612
01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:17.240
that's what it looks like.
It goes 62 miles an hour in five seconds.

1613
01:36:17.650 --> 01:36:22.370
It's not good as it goes.
A top speed of 155 that can't be right.

1614
01:36:22.371 --> 01:36:26.660
62 miles an hour and five seconds.
It's so slow.
Yeah.
That's stupid.
Slow.

1615
01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:29.780
That can't be right.
It says,

1616
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:34.820
what does it say that since a reporter accelerate to 62 miles per hour in less

1617
01:36:34.821 --> 01:36:38.150
than five seconds?
Yeah,
that's slow as shit,
man.

1618
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.210
Like the the modern cars have today.
Like you,

1619
01:36:41.211 --> 01:36:44.120
you can get SUVs that do that easy.

1620
01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.780
Like that's what I think the a range rover does.

1621
01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:50.210
I think you'd do a range rover in five seconds.

1622
01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:53.780
Those a range rover turbocharged ones,
those are fast as shit,

1623
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:59.030
but like to make a dope look and really flashy in your face car like that.

1624
01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.280
I think the porch,
I think the Porsche mission e is Martin,

1625
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:06.590
so that looks like a Ford fusion or something to me.

1626
01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:11.030
I think it's because they own them.
Oh,
is that why look forward owns acid mark?

1627
01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.750
Oh yeah.
It's same front as there at Ford fusion or over there.

1628
01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:19.430
I'm pretty sure for it owns them.
It doesn't.
Ford owned Jaguar.
Yeah.

1629
01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:22.520
Do that.
I think somebody owns Jack who mercury.
No wait,

1630
01:37:22.630 --> 01:37:25.220
mercury is mercury real mercury is still thing.

1631
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:29.510
Mercury was the same.
Like it was like the Ford Taurus,

1632
01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:33.680
but they just changed the name.
It was so weird.
Who Owns Jaguar?

1633
01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:37.310
I'll tell you what Jaguars today are fucking slick.

1634
01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:42.920
Yeah.
Like have you uh,
you seen the new one,
the uh,

1635
01:37:42.921 --> 01:37:47.921
the new Jaguar coop and Jamie pull out a photo of the new Jaguar coop trying to

1636
01:37:48.801 --> 01:37:52.040
find,
continue decide why do they do that?

1637
01:37:54.650 --> 01:37:55.980
Yeah.
I'm trying to figure out what am I

1638
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.620
<v 2>do with my car?
Why don't you sell it?
That's what I need to sell it.</v>

1639
01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:03.840
Yeah.
That looks sweet.
That is a fucking dope car.

1640
01:38:04.230 --> 01:38:07.140
And is that one of those three 60 degree?
Um,
let's see.

1641
01:38:07.141 --> 01:38:09.750
Just go to a regular site instead of the,
the car site.

1642
01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:14.100
So you can get like some good images of it.
It's a nasty car.

1643
01:38:14.101 --> 01:38:18.630
There's super fast to the f type,

1644
01:38:18.631 --> 01:38:19.411
I think they call it.

1645
01:38:19.411 --> 01:38:23.910
It's like 560 horsepower or something ridiculous really fast.

1646
01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:28.940
Really loud like boisterous bomb dude that they nailed it.

1647
01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.490
Look at that.
Come on.
It's perfect.
Nailed it.

1648
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:37.290
I mean that is a fucking beautiful piece of automotive engineering and artwork.

1649
01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:41.880
That is,
they nailed that.
That is a futuristic looking car right there.

1650
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:46.740
It starts off at 63,000.
They're not that expensive for what they are.

1651
01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:50.310
I mean for 63,000 you're not going to get the stupid super powerful one,

1652
01:38:50.311 --> 01:38:54.360
but you still get that same beautiful shape.
I wonder what their,
um,

1653
01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:56.760
maintenance is like cause you know,

1654
01:38:56.761 --> 01:38:59.430
car and driver did this thing on the new corvette.

1655
01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:02.550
I was like all Gung Ho for the new corvette.
I'm like that car sick.

1656
01:39:02.551 --> 01:39:06.510
I think I might,
might be interested in driving one of those go America,

1657
01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:08.900
all that good shit.
But their uh,

1658
01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:13.530
their repair record at least for car and driver road and track car and driver

1659
01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:16.260
one of those years,
I don't know which one it was,
but uh,

1660
01:39:16.330 --> 01:39:19.830
their repair record was atrocious.
So like this thing's falling apart.

1661
01:39:19.831 --> 01:39:22.170
They had replaced the engine already.
It's 6,000 miles.

1662
01:39:22.171 --> 01:39:24.930
They were replacing entire engine.
Maybe we should just eliminate.

1663
01:39:24.931 --> 01:39:28.440
They had though.
I had that happen with my old car.
I mean everything went wrong.

1664
01:39:28.441 --> 01:39:33.420
Kelly dope.
That cockpit looks like the f Type Interior.
Go full screen on that,

1665
01:39:33.421 --> 01:39:37.410
Jamie.
Let me see that.
If you image look at that.
That is fucking,

1666
01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:42.150
that's a spaceship man.
God,
I just love what they're doing these days.

1667
01:39:42.151 --> 01:39:46.170
I just love the fact that everything continues to improve.

1668
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.590
Like whatever you buy,
whether you're,

1669
01:39:48.591 --> 01:39:53.130
you're buying toasters or whether you're buying televisions or,
or cars,

1670
01:39:53.490 --> 01:39:56.520
they just keep making shit better and better and better.

1671
01:39:56.850 --> 01:39:59.370
And now you can get like really good shit.

1672
01:39:59.550 --> 01:40:02.970
Fairly reasonably for fair,
fairly reasonable money.

1673
01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:06.210
Like I sought some review that we're doing about this new jeep that they have.

1674
01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:11.010
It's like a jeep,
but it's based on the Fiat platform.
It's like a tiny jeep,

1675
01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:15.300
30,000 bucks.
Really?
Yes.
And you're in it and you know,
you know,

1676
01:40:15.301 --> 01:40:19.830
the guy's like looking around,
it's like this is a nice car and it's $30,000.

1677
01:40:19.831 --> 01:40:24.270
It's like a small looking smush jeep.
It's,
but you,

1678
01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:27.000
you're in it and you know,
looking at like the car,
you like this,

1679
01:40:27.001 --> 01:40:30.960
you could get this for 30 grand.
I did is pretty nice.
You know,

1680
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:35.310
it's like you drive it,
it's respectable.
It's a decent vehicle.

1681
01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:38.610
Do you think Volkswagen is going to survive this?
They're fucked,
right?

1682
01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:40.860
They're fucked.
I better get your money now.
Okay.

1683
01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:45.360
Cause I'm trying to figure out what am I do with mine and I,

1684
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:48.430
Dean del Ray's also thinking about buying a Volkswagen and he was there,

1685
01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:51.900
he said the other day and they were like convertible.

1686
01:40:51.901 --> 01:40:54.100
It's almost like a motorcycle.
Every,
they were talking

1687
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:54.750
<v 1>about like how,</v>

1688
01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:58.330
and this is a rare one and it's just a $3,000 extra bonus for this car.

1689
01:40:58.331 --> 01:41:01.220
And I'm like,
wait,
aren't they about to get fucked?
Right?

1690
01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:03.660
Like they're doing all right.
I got to get out of it.

1691
01:41:03.710 --> 01:41:05.560
Give it to Jean swearing Soto.

1692
01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:10.610
He doesn't want him beetle was he want some gangster Gti.
Oh,

1693
01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:14.410
type or whatever.
Well those are,
uh,
those are fast little cars.

1694
01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:18.550
I used to have Corrado Volkswagon Corrado that was a front wheel drive car.

1695
01:41:18.551 --> 01:41:20.350
But those gtis are very fast.
Yeah.

1696
01:41:20.351 --> 01:41:25.210
The new ones are ridiculous because as the engineering gets better and the cars

1697
01:41:25.211 --> 01:41:28.330
get better,
like even a car that used to be kind of quick,

1698
01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:32.500
like back in the day when I had a Volkswagen,
they're fast now.

1699
01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:36.820
I'll give you compared like a Volkswagen.
When I had my Volkswagen,

1700
01:41:36.821 --> 01:41:39.760
which was 1993 I think I bought it.

1701
01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:45.480
The corvette from that day is probably slower than a GTI from today because

1702
01:41:47.411 --> 01:41:50.270
they're just better now.
Everything's better.
Breakings better handling.

1703
01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:54.610
It's better if it went around.
Uh,
um,
oh slalom.
I bet the GT.
I'd probably beat it.

1704
01:41:56.530 --> 01:41:59.110
Yeah,
it goes,
it's the one he's looking at.

1705
01:41:59.111 --> 01:42:01.690
It's talk team into that talk to you into your car.

1706
01:42:02.290 --> 01:42:05.440
I shouldn't be saying this on launch 292 horsepower.

1707
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:07.960
It's a nice car and it's probably super light.

1708
01:42:07.961 --> 01:42:11.530
Two to 92 that's pretty respectable for a light car.

1709
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:13.960
Those are fun man.
Little light,

1710
01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:18.040
fun car like that to drive how much those go for a 30 I think.

1711
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:21.680
Why don't you tell those dummies to hook you up?
Say,
listen,
I could just say,

1712
01:42:21.681 --> 01:42:25.210
listen,
I could just get on a podcast and talk mad shit about you all the time,

1713
01:42:25.211 --> 01:42:28.480
but I don't want to do that and say,
ah,
my friend Joe,

1714
01:42:28.481 --> 01:42:30.730
he just always wants to talk shit about Volkswagen.

1715
01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:35.590
I discourage a lot of the conversations.
But anyway,
that's beside the point.

1716
01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:38.720
I'm interested in those.
Gtis can we make something happen?

1717
01:42:38.770 --> 01:42:41.380
Golf are whatever it is.
Is that what it is?

1718
01:42:41.381 --> 01:42:45.430
A Golf r that's a slick little car.
Yeah,
that's gotta be fun.

1719
01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:47.770
I just didn't know whether to stay with Volkswagen or not.

1720
01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:50.680
And they're good engineering.
I mean it's German engineering they make,

1721
01:42:50.710 --> 01:42:54.100
they've always made great cars.
What they've done is horrible though.

1722
01:42:54.190 --> 01:42:58.750
I mean you would have to wonder like whether or not that's reflected in the rest

1723
01:42:58.751 --> 01:43:02.980
of what they're doing because that's what they did is terrible.

1724
01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:07.320
I mean they've,
they've lied a lot too,
right?
What time is in the Audis too,

1725
01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:11.380
I think.
Was it?
I don't think so.
I think I know what you're talking about.

1726
01:43:11.410 --> 01:43:16.410
I think Audi was talking about how many different cars it was because they were

1727
01:43:17.111 --> 01:43:19.930
a part of the thing.
But I don't believe it was their cars as well.

1728
01:43:20.410 --> 01:43:23.770
I'm pretty sure it had to do with diesels for the most part,

1729
01:43:23.771 --> 01:43:26.840
which is what Calvin has that fuck.
And I was always telling my,

1730
01:43:26.850 --> 01:43:31.270
this thing stinks.
How could this be good for the environment?
Does it smell?

1731
01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:33.640
Cause I have my spine,
his old one,
they fucking stink.

1732
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:35.350
And that was always telling him.
I was like,

1733
01:43:35.351 --> 01:43:38.440
how can this be good for the environment?
It is.
It's amazing.
It's really good.

1734
01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:43.670
It's amazing for the environment.
Yeah.
I mean,

1735
01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:47.020
and it's German engineering built in Mexico.
Now.

1736
01:43:47.230 --> 01:43:49.060
You know what I would get if I was you,
honestly,

1737
01:43:49.090 --> 01:43:52.100
if you don't want to spend too much money,
um,
I would get a Volkswagen,
not

1738
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:57.080
<v 4>Volkswagen.
I a Mustang get one of the new Mustang thin,
the new Mustang gts.</v>

1739
01:43:57.110 --> 01:44:00.530
That's another car that's like 30 [inaudible] and they're really fucking good.

1740
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.190
They're really good.
They did a review of one of them recently.
This,
uh,

1741
01:44:04.191 --> 01:44:06.980
this guy took it for a test drive and he's driving around and he's like,

1742
01:44:06.981 --> 01:44:11.540
this is a hell of a car for 35,000 bucks.
He's like,
it's fast.

1743
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:13.880
It handles good.
It looks great.

1744
01:44:14.150 --> 01:44:18.800
Like this is like the bargain of all American cars cause it's like this is the

1745
01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:22.670
best Mustang ever by far.

1746
01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:26.270
Like by far it's got fully independent suspension.
The,
the,

1747
01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:29.720
the form is beautiful.
The interior is really nice.

1748
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:33.560
Like you get in the interior like these fucking seats in the steering wheel.

1749
01:44:33.561 --> 01:44:37.270
Like it's a solid car and then you go,
it's only 30 gram like this,

1750
01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:41.990
you can get a Mustang gt,
I think it's 35 or $39,000.

1751
01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:47.320
And that thing has 420 horsepower fast as shit handles really good.

1752
01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:51.320
I mean it's a great car,
but you know,

1753
01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:55.910
having such a small fast pepe car the last three years,
it's,

1754
01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:59.300
there's a big difference between having like almost like a go cart and then

1755
01:44:59.301 --> 01:45:04.100
having like a,
um,
a big muscle car kind of.
Oh like a Mustang mean.
Yeah.
Right.

1756
01:45:04.110 --> 01:45:07.430
But there so fast,
you would notice a difference and you'd have,

1757
01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:12.080
you'd have more space inside of it.
Like date,
they handle so good.
These new ones,

1758
01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:14.210
like they don't feel like big,
you know,

1759
01:45:14.211 --> 01:45:18.470
like my Barracuda was a big lumbering fucking shitty to drive cars.

1760
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:22.750
They don't feel like that.
They feel like connected to the road.
Hmm.

1761
01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:26.180
Modern Shit man.
They're just so good at it.

1762
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:28.860
They're so good at figuring out suspension.

1763
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:34.030
The dynamics of having like each individual we'll respond to different bumps in

1764
01:45:34.761 --> 01:45:35.361
the roads.

1765
01:45:35.361 --> 01:45:40.361
Like they have these magnetic ride control suspensions they do in these GM cars

1766
01:45:40.371 --> 01:45:44.180
and they're all working on computers and shit and they know when certain wheels

1767
01:45:44.181 --> 01:45:47.960
are spinning and certain wheels are dry and they like to understand the terrain.

1768
01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:53.210
They have cars that can read the road and prepare for the bumps blocked off.

1769
01:45:53.211 --> 01:45:56.780
Fuck.
Like they see the road in front of me like,
oh,
bumps coming.

1770
01:45:56.810 --> 01:46:00.230
We'll just going to loosen this up and make this light and,
and tighten this up.

1771
01:46:00.231 --> 01:46:01.670
And it's incredible.

1772
01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:03.440
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1773
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:06.710
<v 4>There's something missing.
Like when you drive them,
they feel numb.
You know,</v>

1774
01:46:06.711 --> 01:46:10.700
like you're not,
you know,
you know,
experiencing the feel of the road,
but God,

1775
01:46:10.701 --> 01:46:12.560
they're capabilities are just amazing.

1776
01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:15.953
Meanwhile,

1777
01:46:16.050 --> 01:46:20.760
we're probably 10 years away from having most of the cars on the road automated.

1778
01:46:21.810 --> 01:46:24.270
Maybe 10 years away you're going to get in your car in the morning.

1779
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:26.040
Say if you had a regular job,

1780
01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:30.080
you would get in your car in the morning and you would press,
you know,
um,

1781
01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:34.980
office,
boom,
whatever it is,
and you just sit down,
sit down,

1782
01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.210
you read a newspaper,

1783
01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:40.290
you a look at your laptop and that asshole that's not automated,

1784
01:46:40.291 --> 01:46:41.380
he's going to be the problem.
You're like,

1785
01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:45.120
I drove to work days just fucking guy and an old Volkswagen.

1786
01:46:45.150 --> 01:46:48.000
Totally not automated,
just running red lights.

1787
01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:50.220
He hit this lady is automated.

1788
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:54.870
<v 1>Yeah.
I think that an Uber drones like uh,
you know,</v>

1789
01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:59.160
being picked up by a drone is going to be a another thing in the future.

1790
01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:03.240
The way more problematic because you're going to have to get something that's

1791
01:47:03.241 --> 01:47:05.130
big enough to fly people around in,

1792
01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:08.490
which means before Uber ever uses it,

1793
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:10.080
people are going to be flying around in them.

1794
01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.800
And if once people can fly around in them,
you know,

1795
01:47:13.801 --> 01:47:15.930
they're not going to trust other people to drive him around in it.

1796
01:47:16.410 --> 01:47:18.570
There'd have to be a way to,
you know what they'd have to do?

1797
01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:20.130
They'd have to have those things,

1798
01:47:20.131 --> 01:47:24.990
but have them completely magnetized on the outside so they could never collide

1799
01:47:24.991 --> 01:47:25.824
with each other.
Yeah.

1800
01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:29.640
So there's some something that keeps them from each other and then you would

1801
01:47:29.641 --> 01:47:30.720
have to have some,

1802
01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:36.410
some software that overrode the ability to direct directed into buildings

1803
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.920
because otherwise people would just fucking,
you fucking con,

1804
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:43.470
I'm coming to your work right now.
I'm on the 12th floor.

1805
01:47:43.471 --> 01:47:45.570
You now get to the lobby.
Fuck yeah.

1806
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:48.930
And they just fly through the building and killer.
I mean,

1807
01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:50.670
the people would do that,
you know,

1808
01:47:50.671 --> 01:47:55.020
there'd be people that they just decide fucking,
I'm going to take out the,
the,

1809
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:56.370
the u s open is playing,

1810
01:47:56.371 --> 01:47:59.990
I'm going to do the ninth hole and I'm going to fucking crash my car right into

1811
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:00.863
everybody.

1812
01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:05.880
People just can decide to go places where ordinarily fences were there until
now.

1813
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:10.200
Have you been tempted to buy a drone yet?
Like I was at Fry's the other day.

1814
01:48:10.201 --> 01:48:13.440
They had like a really nice drone,
but you know,
it's like 600 bucks,

1815
01:48:13.441 --> 01:48:17.640
but really nice one.
I know a guy who has one.
It was cool.

1816
01:48:17.670 --> 01:48:22.050
He brought it to a place where at in Alberta and we were all hanging out in this

1817
01:48:22.051 --> 01:48:27.030
field and he sent it up in the air and it's circled us.
It circled us all,
all.

1818
01:48:27.031 --> 01:48:29.040
We're all sitting around looking up and it's circled us.

1819
01:48:29.041 --> 01:48:32.280
And he showed us the video and I was like,
whoa,
this is nuts.

1820
01:48:32.281 --> 01:48:37.281
Like it's high speed HD video from a laptop a or from a,

1821
01:48:37.690 --> 01:48:42.090
um,
a cell phone rather.
Like you could,
you could attach like an iPhone to it.

1822
01:48:42.610 --> 01:48:46.180
But this is crazy.
Gopros.
Yeah,
it's crazy.
And they're,

1823
01:48:46.181 --> 01:48:49.410
they're doing it now where you could see it sets up with virtual reality.

1824
01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:53.610
So you put those VR goggles on and then you look through the eyes of the drone.

1825
01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:57.720
The drone flies over trees.
I've done that.
That's nuts.
It's weird.

1826
01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:00.750
They're big and weddings now,
like that's a huge thing.

1827
01:49:00.751 --> 01:49:04.790
Photographers from weddings and ag now have like big drone fly throughs at that

1828
01:49:04.791 --> 01:49:06.210
wedding and like that.

1829
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:13.050
What a strange world.
We live in Brighton.
I hereby her the Saudi Prince.

1830
01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.780
What happened?
You guys got away?
How do you get away?

1831
01:49:15.781 --> 01:49:18.430
The guy who was accused of rape and they got it.
They arrested him for bail.

1832
01:49:18.431 --> 01:49:21.480
You got a $300,000 bail and now he's gone.
Whoa.

1833
01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:24.360
He took off out of the country or city was probably moving.

1834
01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:27.660
They saw some cars come in on like Tuesday night,
Wednesday,

1835
01:49:27.661 --> 01:49:31.590
Monday night or something like that.
Oh Wow.

1836
01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:37.620
Back to Saudi Arabia,
Huh?
Wow.
Saudi royal drama.

1837
01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:42.290
The princess flow,
the 37 million dot.
So his bail was 37 million.
This house,

1838
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:45.210
that's how much it's,
oh,
but I heard he was renting.

1839
01:49:46.210 --> 01:49:47.440
I heard he was renting the house.

1840
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.830
<v 2>We were just talking about this [inaudible] we like couple of weeks ago when we</v>

1841
01:49:50.831 --> 01:49:54.310
were talking about these guys that come over and they have a shit ton of money

1842
01:49:54.311 --> 01:49:56.320
and they buy all this expensive real estate,

1843
01:49:56.321 --> 01:49:59.090
and then there was the people that were racing.
You saw that,
right,
Brian?
Right.

1844
01:49:59.450 --> 01:50:03.810
The racers.
Oh,
he only had $300,000 bail.
Yeah.
How the fuck did I,

1845
01:50:03.970 --> 01:50:06.840
they think that that might've been a fucking bullshit La county thing.

1846
01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:10.900
They're just taken 300,000 bucks to pay for something and then wow,

1847
01:50:10.930 --> 01:50:12.700
he's outta here.
Anyway,
neighbors see that,

1848
01:50:12.701 --> 01:50:15.850
believe the prince has already fled the country and a private jet leaving his

1849
01:50:15.851 --> 01:50:20.380
rented house behind.
One woman who would only give her name is,
as Isabelle said,

1850
01:50:20.381 --> 01:50:23.560
numerous cars were coming in and out of the property late Thursday and it looked

1851
01:50:23.561 --> 01:50:27.200
like the prince moving out.
Meanwhile,
another member,

1852
01:50:27.210 --> 01:50:30.070
imagine living next to a prince,
another neighbor,

1853
01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:33.040
Eric's skin,

1854
01:50:33.310 --> 01:50:35.260
Rumpelstiltskin added.

1855
01:50:35.290 --> 01:50:38.920
I am sure he has taken off on his private jet by now.

1856
01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:42.940
I don't think he even needs a passport to get out of here.

1857
01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:48.640
Quote beyond that.
Yeah,

1858
01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:51.460
those guys have money.
It's amazing.
The Gary,

1859
01:50:51.461 --> 01:50:56.461
this is what you can get away with in 2015 that you only pay a couple hundred

1860
01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:01.240
thousand dollars for bail even though they know you're worth trillions and how

1861
01:51:01.241 --> 01:51:05.680
much is that guy worth?
And he just bales and there's nothing negative about it.

1862
01:51:05.681 --> 01:51:08.530
He's 29 years old,
Huh?
Wow.

1863
01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:11.350
<v 3>It's amazing.
And his name is so confusing.
Hickey.</v>

1864
01:51:11.410 --> 01:51:14.020
No one's going to remember it so it can come back here in a couple of weeks.

1865
01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:15.680
Well,
he's a

1866
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:20.040
<v 2>prince dude.
He can't come back.
But unless somehow or another they forget,</v>

1867
01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:25.230
Saudi prince accused of sex crimes could face legal lasso in flight.

1868
01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:26.431
What?

1869
01:51:26.431 --> 01:51:31.260
Legal Lasso just doesn't come back to America when legal lasso,

1870
01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.770
hey,
don't go there.
They will arrest you.
Okay,

1871
01:51:32.771 --> 01:51:37.500
I'll stay here if they let Saudi Arabia gets bombed and that's not going to

1872
01:51:37.501 --> 01:51:38.580
happen.
There's so much.

1873
01:51:39.650 --> 01:51:42.980
<v 3>It's really interesting watching periscope over there because they just,</v>

1874
01:51:42.981 --> 01:51:45.890
you know,
they want to show off everything they have all the time and it's,

1875
01:51:45.891 --> 01:51:48.650
I'll just sit there.
Periscopes really changed me lately.

1876
01:51:48.710 --> 01:51:51.650
I'll just sit in bed and just go on the map and go,

1877
01:51:51.651 --> 01:51:56.150
let's see who's periscoping in Japan right now.
You know?
Or,
yeah,

1878
01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:58.820
and so let's go to Saudi Arabia.
Yeah,
just go to Saudi Arabia.

1879
01:51:58.821 --> 01:52:01.940
It's usually a guy just sitting there and like a backseat of a limo.

1880
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:06.290
You know this with like his,
his stuff on and just like,
Hey,

1881
01:52:06.291 --> 01:52:09.890
what's up brother?
And they go in between England knowing English.

1882
01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:12.230
Like I'll just call them and go,
Yo,
what's up man?
How you doing?

1883
01:52:12.231 --> 01:52:15.290
And he's going to talk to you.
Oh Hey.
Yeah.
It's so weird.

1884
01:52:15.291 --> 01:52:19.490
They go in between languages.
Oh Wow.
It's very interesting.
So you look,

1885
01:52:19.491 --> 01:52:22.400
send a little text message Joan.
Yeah,
I just troll people.

1886
01:52:22.401 --> 01:52:25.800
So like I'll start drawing.
I'm like,
where's your tiger?
You guys are rebuilding

1887
01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:30.530
when you want,
when you go to their page.
How many people are viewing it?

1888
01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:35.450
She's like 10 14 oh wow.
You know,
it's not many people.

1889
01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:38.930
You're so weird.
The things that you do,

1890
01:52:38.931 --> 01:52:42.560
it's really interesting watching people on periscope with the map feature.

1891
01:52:42.561 --> 01:52:45.980
It's really cool cause you could just go,
let's see what's going on.
I random town

1892
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:49.430
<v 1>in Mexico and it's just some little Mexican woman just sit and go,
you know,</v>

1893
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:52.490
it's weird making tacos and they can talk to us and shit.

1894
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:56.620
Getting the pope to clean her feet.
Yeah.

1895
01:52:56.630 --> 01:53:01.630
And there's a lot of weird motivational like speakers and yeah.

1896
01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:05.240
And a lot of scam artists guys from in Beverly Hills,
like,
yeah,

1897
01:53:05.241 --> 01:53:06.410
I created this company.

1898
01:53:06.411 --> 01:53:09.950
If anyone wants to meet here and talk about periscope and,
and he,
you know,

1899
01:53:09.951 --> 01:53:12.560
just random women showing up like,
Oh,
you're a millionaire.

1900
01:53:12.561 --> 01:53:16.730
I saw you on periscope.
Whoa.
It's creepy.
It is creepy.

1901
01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.360
Yeah.
I don't use it anymore.
I use it a couple times at the store and I was like,

1902
01:53:24.110 --> 01:53:27.280
I can't be fucking bothered.
And also I think there's just sheer,

1903
01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:31.610
I've got too much going on as it is.
It's stuff's already spread me thin,

1904
01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:36.200
whether it's Facebook or Twitter or Instagram's like,

1905
01:53:36.201 --> 01:53:39.680
it's enough.
I go long periods of time without using any of it.

1906
01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:43.250
Speaking of which will take an Instagram of you right now,
I'm thinking,

1907
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.941
I'm thinking,

1908
01:53:43.941 --> 01:53:47.450
my latest thing is Facebook thinking about get rid of getting rid of Facebook.

1909
01:53:47.451 --> 01:53:49.550
What?
I completely,
I mean I just,

1910
01:53:51.390 --> 01:53:51.910
<v 0>okay.</v>

1911
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:56.140
<v 1>Why would you say you get rid of Facebook?
Uh,
you know when they,</v>

1912
01:53:56.141 --> 01:53:57.520
when they do that shit where it's like,
oh,

1913
01:53:57.521 --> 01:54:00.820
six years ago today you did this and you're like,
oh my God,

1914
01:54:00.821 --> 01:54:04.690
I completely forgot I had that on their smarter part.
Didn't work.
Smile again.

1915
01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:09.480
Smile like you're happy.
Not like I can't,
I gotta get my teeth fixed.

1916
01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:11.980
What are you doing with your teeth?
Tooth is just,

1917
01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:15.590
I have a tooth that was supposed to be replaced 25 years.
Teachers again.

1918
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:17.383
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1919
01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.330
<v 1>I have a two that was supposed to be fixed like 25 years ago.</v>

1920
01:54:21.331 --> 01:54:23.910
It's just a temporary tooth and I haven't fixed it.

1921
01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:28.940
And now recently it's just like stained and it won't stop and wold stops.

1922
01:54:28.961 --> 01:54:33.300
Deigning now I think I wonder why it's coffee.
Yeah.
Weird.
It's supposed to be,

1923
01:54:33.301 --> 01:54:36.570
it's not supposed to be in my mouth though.
They were like,
oh,
you know,

1924
01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.310
you could wear this for like a couple of months,

1925
01:54:38.311 --> 01:54:39.870
but you should come in and probably replace.

1926
01:54:39.871 --> 01:54:43.880
This is just a temporary 20 years later guys,

1927
01:54:44.290 --> 01:54:47.850
um,
guys,
I hate the dentist.

1928
01:54:48.450 --> 01:54:51.270
Why did he do what did,
that's one of the most illogical fears.

1929
01:54:51.271 --> 01:54:55.080
The fears of the dentist.
I had a lot of trauma as a kid is in a dentist though,

1930
01:54:55.081 --> 01:54:58.440
so it wasn't a happy place for me.
What about that guy that was,
uh,

1931
01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:02.460
was he a dentist or a doctor in San Diego?
He raped eight different women.

1932
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:06.780
Eight and they gave him a year of house arrest.

1933
01:55:07.530 --> 01:55:10.860
He raped eight different women while they were unconscious.

1934
01:55:11.010 --> 01:55:13.110
Put them under and fuck them.

1935
01:55:13.650 --> 01:55:16.860
And this guy got a year of house arrest.
Why is that?

1936
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:21.330
Rape Culture a culture?
That's one of the times why I,

1937
01:55:21.331 --> 01:55:24.900
aside with the social justice warriors,
I was like,
well,
maybe it's right.

1938
01:55:25.050 --> 01:55:26.430
You know,
when you see things like that,

1939
01:55:26.431 --> 01:55:31.431
I mean obviously you're dealing with 350 million people in this country.

1940
01:55:31.981 --> 01:55:36.120
The number of human beings in this country is fucking staggering.
Okay.

1941
01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:39.570
And in that staggering number,
you're going to have cons.

1942
01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:43.020
There's absolutely going to be a certain amount of people that are just
horrible.

1943
01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:47.490
And this is one of them.
Molest did not fun.
No,
no,
no.
He fucked up.

1944
01:55:47.610 --> 01:55:51.870
He fucked them.
He penetrated them when they were unconscious.
I look at him,

1945
01:55:51.871 --> 01:55:55.590
he doesn't see my kid.
Very dangerous.
I mean I'm,
I'm not lying.
Right.

1946
01:55:55.850 --> 01:55:59.880
Didn't they say he had sex with them?
I'm pretty sure.

1947
01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:06.090
Well,
Cosby three new women came out today.
Three new ones.
Yeah.
Jesus.

1948
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:09.210
One victim was only eight years old.
Fuck this guy.

1949
01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:13.260
Jesus Christ.
Oh,
there's 12 victims.

1950
01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.500
Ah,
my God.

1951
01:56:21.090 --> 01:56:24.000
He suffers from kidney cancer.
Quickly pleaded guilty,

1952
01:56:24.001 --> 01:56:26.730
sparing his victims for testifying about his crimes.

1953
01:56:27.330 --> 01:56:30.060
I don't want to hear this man.
I want this guy to just be dead.

1954
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:32.880
Fuck yeah.

1955
01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:36.120
That's the idea that someone could do that to you while your unconscious just

1956
01:56:36.121 --> 01:56:36.954
fuck you.

1957
01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:43.500
Such one of the creepiest things.

1958
01:56:43.501 --> 01:56:45.420
Managing like standing over someone,

1959
01:56:45.421 --> 01:56:48.300
whether unconscious and just thinking about what you're gonna do to them and

1960
01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:53.610
looking them in the head.
Pull your dick out and rescue on their nose.

1961
01:56:53.611 --> 01:56:57.010
Taking pictures.
Yeah.
I had that once and it freaked me out.

1962
01:56:57.011 --> 01:56:59.670
I woke up in another room.
It was dark and like,
wait,
where am I?

1963
01:56:59.671 --> 01:57:03.860
And I totally forgot where I was counting backwards.
Did you really?
Yeah.

1964
01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:05.640
Like you thought you were unconscious?
No.
No.
Like,

1965
01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:08.670
like what do you mean where they make it count backwards and then you wake up

1966
01:57:08.671 --> 01:57:11.390
and you're in another room,
you're like,
wait,
what the fuck happened?
Where am I?

1967
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:14.580
So what is,
what is your fear about the dentist?
Like did you,

1968
01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.680
did you experience pain when you were a kid?
Yeah,

1969
01:57:16.681 --> 01:57:19.890
when I was young I was in a car accident and my teeth,

1970
01:57:19.891 --> 01:57:22.320
my two front teeth got knocked in half.

1971
01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:25.800
They cut in half in this car accident and I had to have a lot of different

1972
01:57:25.801 --> 01:57:26.950
surgeries and,

1973
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:32.000
and I mean I'm like six years old getting drills and shit in my mouth.

1974
01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:33.533
Uh,

1975
01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:37.680
and then I've had them knocked out before right after that and they put them in

1976
01:57:37.681 --> 01:57:41.070
again.
Just like the,
my growing up,
I had a lot of teeth problems,

1977
01:57:41.071 --> 01:57:46.020
just like surgical stuff and like two separate wisdom tooth compact tooth

1978
01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:50.790
implant into my skull.
It's crazy.
Teeth are kind of annoying.

1979
01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:53.310
You got to stop thinking about it.
You only get one pair of them.

1980
01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:56.850
They're not even anchored in.
And they would come out,
yeah,

1981
01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:59.970
punched a fallout and then they're gone forever.
Like what?

1982
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:04.800
Like I've seen a lot of people get their teeth knocked out.
Super common in MMA.

1983
01:58:04.801 --> 01:58:05.451
It happens all the time.

1984
01:58:05.451 --> 01:58:09.270
It happens in fights all the time while I'll be talking to the guys even post

1985
01:58:09.271 --> 01:58:11.130
fight and they're like,
my feet teeth are knocked out,

1986
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:12.930
my teeth are like really loose right now.

1987
01:58:12.931 --> 01:58:16.170
Like you see the blood and they have to go and get everything wired in.

1988
01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:19.830
It's real common.
So shitty design.
Yeah.

1989
01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:23.580
Well nowadays with implants and uh,
you know there's fake teeth.

1990
01:58:23.581 --> 01:58:25.170
Everyone has really nice teeth.

1991
01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:30.620
Stem cell dental implants grow new teeth right in your mouth that Jesus Christ

1992
01:58:31.561 --> 01:58:34.920
is from 2010 but I heard about recently,
it still sounds pretty cool,

1993
01:58:34.921 --> 01:58:39.060
especially as the stem cell stuff you've been talking about.
Dude,
I am a big fan.

1994
01:58:39.090 --> 01:58:42.070
I need a stem cell.
My knee,
you probably do,
I'm a big

1995
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:45.280
<v 4>fan of the stem cells.
I wouldn't say my,
excuse me,</v>

1996
01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:50.200
I wouldn't say that my shoulder is 100% after stem cell because I still kind of

1997
01:58:50.201 --> 01:58:53.140
feel it but I don't have any pain and I'm not,

1998
01:58:53.290 --> 01:58:56.200
I'm not doing anything heavy as far as like bench pressing.

1999
01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:00.360
But I'm doing a lot of crazy rowing like heavyweights,

2000
01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:04.240
like hundred pound dumbbells,
hundred 10 pound dumbbells.
No problem.

2001
01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:09.340
I'm doing chin ups.
No problem.
I'm doing hard sets of Chin ups.
You know,

2002
01:59:09.341 --> 01:59:13.780
like,
like we're,
we're,
I'm pulling to fatigue.
No problem.

2003
01:59:13.930 --> 01:59:14.741
I'm doing push.
I've,

2004
01:59:14.741 --> 01:59:18.190
I haven't done any bench press but I've been doing like a lot of sets of pushups

2005
01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:21.370
cause I don't want to tax the area too much cause it's only been two months.

2006
01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:25.630
I keep waiting for it to hurt the next day.
No problems,
no pain.

2007
01:59:25.930 --> 01:59:28.840
One fucking injection of stem cells.
Wow.

2008
01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.320
And it seems like every day like the east to like click and crunch a lot

2009
01:59:32.710 --> 01:59:35.620
everyday the clicking crunching gets lighter and lighter.

2010
01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:38.170
It's like it's less and less.
It's only been eight weeks.

2011
01:59:38.410 --> 01:59:42.910
It'd be eight weeks on Friday.
That's great.
It's nuts.
It's nuts man.

2012
01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:43.773
It's weird.

2013
01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:46.780
Can you just go get another one or do you have to wait a certain amount of time

2014
01:59:46.781 --> 01:59:50.500
before that's debatable?
You know,
it depends on who you're talking to.

2015
01:59:50.501 --> 01:59:54.010
Like Dr. Gordon says,
I can do it all the time.
He's like,
go in again.
He's like,

2016
01:59:54.011 --> 01:59:55.870
it's just healing you.
He's like,
they're just,

2017
01:59:55.900 --> 02:00:00.550
what it is is just the stem cells will find the area of your body that's having

2018
02:00:00.551 --> 02:00:04.720
an issue and they go in and heal it.
But the,
the other doctors are more cautious.

2019
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.863
They were like,
you know,

2020
02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:10.750
but he's dealing with football players at brain injuries and soldier's brain

2021
02:00:10.751 --> 02:00:14.200
injuries and fighters have brain injuries.
So he's like,
what are you pussy?

2022
02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:15.640
You got something wrong.
Your shoulders shoot it up.

2023
02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:18.580
Do they know what happens if there's,
if they inject too much of a dick rose,

2024
02:00:18.610 --> 02:00:21.610
huge grows a second head and they fight to the death,

2025
02:00:21.611 --> 02:00:23.320
the first head and the second and fight to the death,

2026
02:00:23.530 --> 02:00:26.260
then you have to kill the dead head.
You have to get a chopped off.

2027
02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:31.810
But if you put stem cells and sperm and then it makes it put it in stem cells

2028
02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:34.000
protests different,

2029
02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:40.750
you probably wouldn't enjoy it.
My,
uh,
my friend who works at to hone ranch,

2030
02:00:40.770 --> 02:00:45.770
my friend Brian sent me a photograph when people get mad at people that hunt and

2031
02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:51.560
need to understand that one of the biggest things that kills animals like deer

2032
02:00:52.450 --> 02:00:54.940
and elk is they kill each other.

2033
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:58.570
This big giant elk got killed by another elk.

2034
02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:04.180
It stabbed him to death with its antlers.
Like the size of that fucker.
It's huge.

2035
02:01:04.620 --> 02:01:09.550
Huge.
It looks like it has a one,
two,
three,
four,

2036
02:01:09.551 --> 02:01:14.500
five,
six,
seven,
eight points on one side and seven points on another.

2037
02:01:14.710 --> 02:01:15.970
So it's an enormous,

2038
02:01:15.971 --> 02:01:20.971
enormous elk and another elk stabbed to death with its antlers and they found it

2039
02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:26.660
rotten with holes in its sides.
It's nuts.
Damn right now,

2040
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:31.390
10 killed up to 10 killed and shooter in Oregon College Right now,
today,

2041
02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:36.280
right now.
Fuck 20 injured Jesus.
Shoot her up and fired.

2042
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:41.150
You know what?
If they had guns on schools,
here's what's fucked up.

2043
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:45.710
That wouldn't happen if people allowed to have guns on campus.

2044
02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:50.000
If there were armed guards on campus,
if teachers were allowed to carry guns,

2045
02:01:50.001 --> 02:01:52.820
if students were allowed to carry guns,
if the gun enthusiasts,

2046
02:01:52.821 --> 02:01:55.730
like everybody's worried,
the gun enthusiasts would be shooting more people.

2047
02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:59.450
I don't think that's the problem.
I think if people want to shoot people,

2048
02:01:59.451 --> 02:02:04.250
they can get guns pretty easy like this guy,
but I think regular people,

2049
02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:05.900
if they had guns more often,

2050
02:02:05.901 --> 02:02:10.190
this is a very controversial stance because a lot of people think that more guns

2051
02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:11.450
is more problems,

2052
02:02:11.930 --> 02:02:14.840
but I think that a lot of reasons why these people that are horrible,

2053
02:02:14.841 --> 02:02:18.290
horrible people that go in to these things and shoot up schools is because they

2054
02:02:18.291 --> 02:02:21.530
know schools are not going to be armed to same reason why they don't want to go

2055
02:02:21.531 --> 02:02:25.490
and shoot up a military base unless they're trying to suicide.
You know?

2056
02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:30.080
You mean like security guards are like security guards as teachers.

2057
02:02:30.230 --> 02:02:33.470
I think teachers should be able to have guns and there's police and a lot of

2058
02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:37.910
community.
I had an a nibble.
There's police had a lot of colleges.

2059
02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:41.510
Some colleges,
but this was a community college,
so I would imagine they didn't.

2060
02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:46.400
Yeah,
I just,
and you know how,
how,
uh,
armed are they,
you know,

2061
02:02:46.401 --> 02:02:49.850
how,
uh,
how well prepared are they for something like this?
It's terrible,
man.

2062
02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:53.660
This fucking shit drives me nuts.
It just,
and again,

2063
02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:57.940
if you look at the numbers,
like everybody's like terrified.
And when things,

2064
02:02:57.950 --> 02:03:00.380
things like this happen,
people call for gun control.

2065
02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:04.070
And I totally understand that way of thinking.
I understand that you're saying,

2066
02:03:04.071 --> 02:03:07.340
hey,
the problem is the guns.
We have to take the guns away from all these people.

2067
02:03:07.610 --> 02:03:11.000
We definitely have to keep guns out of the hands of irresponsible people.

2068
02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:14.570
We definitely have to keep guns out of the hands of insane people.
Definitely.

2069
02:03:14.571 --> 02:03:15.560
That's 100%.

2070
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:19.670
But the idea that somehow or another crazy person doing something bad should

2071
02:03:19.671 --> 02:03:22.760
prevent a rational,
sane person from having a gun.

2072
02:03:23.090 --> 02:03:26.240
That doesn't make any sense to me.
It just doesn't make any sense.

2073
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:31.190
It's not logical thinking.
The problem isn't guns.
The problem is insane people.

2074
02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:34.250
And if they didn't have guns but they had bombs,

2075
02:03:34.251 --> 02:03:36.830
you don't think they'd be setting bombs off all over the school.

2076
02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:37.611
So what are we gonna do?

2077
02:03:37.611 --> 02:03:40.640
We're gonna get rid of explosives and then we're going to get rid of sharp

2078
02:03:40.641 --> 02:03:44.960
objects.
We're going to get rid of everything.
People are the problem people.

2079
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:49.550
Their access to weapons is certainly a problem when they're nuts.

2080
02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:51.740
But the real problem is that they're nuts.

2081
02:03:51.741 --> 02:03:54.950
The vast majority of people that I know that own guns,

2082
02:03:55.190 --> 02:03:59.330
and this is where it gets crazy,
this is the truth.
When I go to the gun range,

2083
02:03:59.650 --> 02:04:02.750
they are some of the nicest,
most polite fucking people.

2084
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:05.900
The people that I know from the world of hunting,
some of the nicest,

2085
02:04:05.901 --> 02:04:09.890
most polite people,
they're,
they're really friendly folks.
They,

2086
02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:11.690
they're not bad people.

2087
02:04:12.030 --> 02:04:17.030
Like this idea that you're going to keep some psychopath from guns by taking the

2088
02:04:17.541 --> 02:04:20.890
guns away from everybody.
Like that's not,
that's not smart thinking.

2089
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:23.180
We have to figure out why the fuck people want shoot people.

2090
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:26.060
We have to figure out what the hell makes someone want to go to a school and

2091
02:04:26.061 --> 02:04:28.640
start opening fire.
And killing a bunch of students.

2092
02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:31.720
That's what we have to figure out cause they are the problem.
It's not the,

2093
02:04:31.721 --> 02:04:34.400
the actual weapon that they're using.
It's not the problem.

2094
02:04:34.670 --> 02:04:37.440
It's the actions of the human being and their mind.

2095
02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:44.570
<v 1>It's fucked.
You know people are here until you get away my guns,</v>

2096
02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:49.400
but why are you taking away their guns?
They didn't shoot anybody like it's not,

2097
02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:50.810
it's they're not the problem.

2098
02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:54.190
The problem is the people that would be willing to do something like this snack.

2099
02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:59.150
Keeping the actual,
the actual objects away from people.

2100
02:04:59.330 --> 02:05:03.650
It's keeping figuring out what the fuck makes people want to use those objects.

2101
02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:09.600
You don't have a gun now and now?
Not Real one.
I have a lot of fake ones.

2102
02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:10.793
Oh that's good.

2103
02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:15.120
What do you do with them is to have your ass play cops and robbers.

2104
02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:17.640
I'm losing again.
Shit.
Don't rate me with his gun.

2105
02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:21.510
[inaudible] can't believe you're doing it again.
Pretty much.

2106
02:05:23.090 --> 02:05:27.760
Why do you fake guns?
I get real.
I need to get a real guy.

2107
02:05:27.810 --> 02:05:30.330
I mean I have no problem having a gun.
I just,

2108
02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:34.320
I only have fake guns because it was for a costume,
but,
oh,
okay.

2109
02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:38.250
It's not like I'm trying to really,
well,
you shot a real rifles with me.

2110
02:05:38.251 --> 02:05:41.400
We made a video.
It was fun.
I got to go next week.
If you want to go.
Yeah,

2111
02:05:41.401 --> 02:05:44.040
I'd love to go.
Okay.
Probably gonna wind up going Monday or Tuesday.

2112
02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:46.350
I'll let you know.
Cool.
It's fun.
It is fun.

2113
02:05:46.690 --> 02:05:48.540
As long as you have proper ear protection,

2114
02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:52.400
it's fun to make sure it goes fun to shoot those hard drives.
That was fun.
Yeah.

2115
02:05:52.450 --> 02:05:56.160
Cause it's a small target.
You got to really concentrate.
Yeah,
I might have it.

2116
02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:59.730
We should try to bring some other cool stuff to shoot.
So yeah,

2117
02:05:59.731 --> 02:06:04.020
they don't want us to though.
Creates a mess,
you know,
we didn't even ask.

2118
02:06:04.021 --> 02:06:06.870
We just brought him out there.
We're kind of sneaky about it.

2119
02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:10.560
Blew those hard drives to shit though.
It's kind of fun.

2120
02:06:12.110 --> 02:06:14.240
It's uh,
it's fun to shoot things.
Like,

2121
02:06:14.270 --> 02:06:17.240
people don't like to admit that for whatever reason.
But it's fun.

2122
02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:20.600
Interesting for guns are fun.
Interesting thing about the new iPhone,

2123
02:06:20.601 --> 02:06:24.240
I found out that they actually have water seals inside of it.
Like,

2124
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:27.470
did you see that video?
This woman put her phone in air for like a,

2125
02:06:27.471 --> 02:06:30.680
I think it was like an hour or something like that.
Underwater.
No problem.

2126
02:06:30.681 --> 02:06:34.580
Still worked and everything works.
The,
the,
the,
the power port works.

2127
02:06:34.581 --> 02:06:37.250
Everything works.
Yeah,
they tore it down.
They found there,

2128
02:06:37.251 --> 02:06:40.940
there's a rubber washers around to almost everything now that it didn't used to

2129
02:06:40.941 --> 02:06:41.211
be there.

2130
02:06:41.211 --> 02:06:44.450
And the reason why they're saying that is because apple has that new a trade in

2131
02:06:44.451 --> 02:06:47.300
program.
Every year we can upgrade to a new phone.

2132
02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:50.360
And so now there's going to be so many people returning their phones.

2133
02:06:50.361 --> 02:06:55.340
They don't want to have a bunch of ruin phones,
you know,
so it's up to them.

2134
02:06:55.730 --> 02:07:00.710
Oh thanks apple for,
I haven't gotten a new one yet.
Did you get new and yet,
uh,

2135
02:07:01.190 --> 02:07:02.810
it's,
it's back right now,
but yeah,

2136
02:07:02.811 --> 02:07:05.360
I'm on that program where you can get a new phone every year.

2137
02:07:05.361 --> 02:07:08.360
So backward already.
Yeah,
it was back ordered immediately.

2138
02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:11.780
So when you go to the apple store,
they're back ordered.
Yeah.
Sons of bitches.

2139
02:07:12.230 --> 02:07:15.740
13 million or something in the first couple of days.
Yeah.
People love them.

2140
02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:18.680
You know when Lewis was here from unbox therapy,

2141
02:07:18.681 --> 02:07:21.670
I'm telling you that that active galaxy that he left,

2142
02:07:21.671 --> 02:07:23.360
I think I liked that better than all of them.

2143
02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:26.750
The fact that it's waterproof has that shock resistant case.

2144
02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:31.680
Really a really tough screen.
I liked that one the best.
It makes sense.
Yeah.

2145
02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:33.890
Why does an apple macbook an apple sport,

2146
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:38.860
you know a make a phone like that.
Like a little bit smaller screen,

2147
02:07:38.861 --> 02:07:43.560
like super rugged.
Make it super waterproof.
Hard on the outside camp.

2148
02:07:43.561 --> 02:07:46.650
Rake it.
Make that make a man.
It's fun Bro.

2149
02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:52.990
I gotta get Outta here.
Sorry.
1215 I got shit.
I got to do anything else going on.

2150
02:07:53.290 --> 02:07:56.020
I'll be in Fresno tomorrow is Sam Aaa.
Oh,

2151
02:07:56.021 --> 02:08:00.700
that sounds like a day and night trip drive home son.
Yeah,
but we,

2152
02:08:00.701 --> 02:08:03.400
they just added a second show.
I'm going to be at the club one casino.

2153
02:08:03.401 --> 02:08:07.570
You can I go to tickets.
I just go to a desk.
squad.tv and click on tour dates.

2154
02:08:07.690 --> 02:08:09.460
Powerful.
See,
I'm Tripoli.
I ran into him last night.

2155
02:08:09.461 --> 02:08:12.130
He was telling me that he's a,
he's auditioning for the tonight show.

2156
02:08:12.131 --> 02:08:14.260
He's got something going on.
Oh,
really?
Yeah.

2157
02:08:14.261 --> 02:08:17.260
It would be awesome to see Sam do four minutes on the tonight show because you

2158
02:08:17.261 --> 02:08:21.100
do like four,
four and a half minutes.
But they're,
uh,
they're having comics on.

2159
02:08:21.490 --> 02:08:25.180
That's interesting.
Yeah.
That's in New York.
They asked me to do it.
What?

2160
02:08:25.181 --> 02:08:26.080
I don't think I can do it.

2161
02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:29.800
I don't think I could do a four and a half minutes set.
I wouldn't,

2162
02:08:29.801 --> 02:08:31.150
I wouldn't even know what to talk about.

2163
02:08:31.151 --> 02:08:35.890
Like I don't have that kind of an act one story.
Even then it would be like,

2164
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:39.730
God,
I would have to really know how to get out of the gate fast to do four and a

2165
02:08:39.731 --> 02:08:43.360
half minutes.
We have fun writing exercises if I was motivated,
but

2166
02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:48.880
a Fresno.
So desk squad.
Dot TV for that.
Yeah.

2167
02:08:50.260 --> 02:08:53.520
Every Wednesday.
Next Wednesday comedy store have a secret show.
Oh,

2168
02:08:53.521 --> 02:08:56.140
and next Wednesday to see it was a secret.
What you just told everybody.

2169
02:08:56.420 --> 02:08:57.460
Your secret guest.

2170
02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:00.170
<v 2>Oh,
secret gas shot.</v>

2171
02:09:02.110 --> 02:09:06.110
Six getting out.
All right,
folks,
that's it for this week.

2172
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:10.660
You got four podcasts.
Why are you complaining?
You fucks.
You got two,

2173
02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:15.660

Um,

Get Alonzo boat and we'll be here next week too.
Very excited.

2175
02:09:18.951 --> 02:09:22.800
I love Alonzo having done a podcast with me.
Yeah,
I can't believe it.
Uh,

2176
02:09:22.801 --> 02:09:26.750
and that's,
it's so a,
enjoy your weekend.

2177

Much love.
See you soon.
Bye.
Bye.
