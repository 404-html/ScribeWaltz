00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.750

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.821
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

17
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>I had a billboard above where he lived for 10 years as he struggled as he was</v>

18
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>fucking destitute,</v>

19
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>living in this little shitty area of Hollywood.</v>

20
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>13 x a year right next to the comedy store.</v>

21
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Right down the street from the comedy store is the cheapest housing near the</v>

22
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>comedy store.</v>

23
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It was cool.</v>

26
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I remember every time I'd visit you and be like,</v>

27
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.411
<v Speaker 1>safe here,</v>

28
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 1>can we walk through this thing?</v>

29
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.863
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

30
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.011
<v Speaker 1>You live with,</v>

31
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:38.821
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't dangerous,</v>

32
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:39.654
<v Speaker 1>but it was bad.</v>

33
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually the homeless people started moving in.</v>

34
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>You lived with some sketchy folk.</v>

36
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.191
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

37
00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>like a few people were like,</v>

38
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I didn't walk through your halls.</v>

39
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Like I would walk through the Ritz Carlton's pillow,</v>

40
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>like I was on a,</v>

41
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I'm a code red,</v>

42
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>but I was on code yellow or whatever the fuck the Tamarisk code is.</v>

43
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I had a little bit of,</v>

44
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.580
<v Speaker 1>we had this,</v>

45
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

46
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.621
<v Speaker 1>these horns.</v>

47
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:02.371
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like that.</v>

48
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>That bet Brady,</v>

49
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>that chain you have there with the beads.</v>

50
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

51
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>it was hanging up with this weird horn thing like on the railing in a corner and</v>

52
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.211
<v Speaker 1>I asked my friend there,</v>

53
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

54
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.361
<v Speaker 1>how long has it been there?</v>

55
00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It was before I moved in and were like,</v>

56
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>do you wanna move it?</v>

57
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>You fucking move it.</v>

58
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>It just looked like Voodoo Jewish and we were like,</v>

59
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's keeping the place up and that thing was there for 10 12 years and you</v>

60
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>haven't touched it and you had this great deal where this apartment,</v>

61
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>like they wanted to turn it into something else and they want to sell it's prime</v>

62
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:35.000
<v Speaker 1>real estate sunset and Luciana go Sansone loss you to get,</v>

63
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>if they put a dope apartment building up in there,</v>

64
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>people would just kind of want to do.</v>

65
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>But everyone above and the hill.</v>

66
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>The Richie's got mad though.</v>

67
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to block our view.</v>

68
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>They're rich and they blocked it forever.</v>

69
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.631
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>

70
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:46.381
<v Speaker 1>even if it was like,</v>

71

<v Speaker 1>all the new ones that be no blockage of view,</v>

73
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put a rooftop garden on there.</v>

74
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>So all you'll see is greenery and flowers say about that.</v>

75
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.563
<v Speaker 1>Still not.</v>

76
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>It's going to mess up traffic while you're building.</v>

77
00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.101
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

78
00:01:59.101 --> 00:01:59.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

79
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>it is gonna mess up traffic a little.</v>

80
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And then he got a deal with pink dye goes,</v>

81
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>how about we only enter through the pink dot parking lot?</v>

82
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.423
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

83
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.953
<v Speaker 1>still not.</v>

84
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

85
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>that takes years,</v>

86
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:09.001
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

87
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:09.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>So then he finally got the okay.</v>

89
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>People were moving out one by one.</v>

90
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>He was given deals to people and he gave you a deal.</v>

91
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.671
<v Speaker 1>Gave me a deal.</v>

92
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I got the deal.</v>

93
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I think I might have been the last one to get the deal.</v>

94
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And there's a billboard.</v>

95
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>This is not Ari's idea.</v>

96
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>He didn't ask for this.</v>

97
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>There's a billboard above his old fucking apartment and the billboard above your</v>

98
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>old fucking apartment.</v>

99
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>This is not happening with you.</v>

108
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>of my old apartment.</v>

109

<v Speaker 1>I mean if you go off the wall crazy and uh,</v>

121
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.440
<v Speaker 1>jump off a fucking building.</v>

122
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I had a billboard in my feet.</v>

123
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Did it?</v>

124
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.230
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty,</v>

126
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.591
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

127
00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:11.231
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten so much.</v>

128
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>People are so much more excited about this.</v>

129
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Then the show or the special,</v>

130
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

131
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>the show's awesome.</v>

132
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

135
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.550
<v Speaker 1>But there's something so nutty about the visual of that billboard above your old</v>

136
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>

137
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's right there is so god damn crazy.</v>

138
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>That's your fucking apartment.</v>

139
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.831
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

140
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Where my head is sticking out.</v>

141
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:31.181
<v Speaker 1>That's mine.</v>

142
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>That's my bedroom window.</v>

143
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>

144
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>This is like some real weird simulation shit</v>

145
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>that's so fucking weird.</v>

146
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

147
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't think in a movie.</v>

149
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:42.401
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

150
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>no fucking way.</v>

151
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I've never been happier for someone else.</v>

152
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Thanks that then watching this happen to you.</v>

153
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I've never been happier.</v>

154
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

155
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing to see,</v>

156
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:52.361
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

157
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

158
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking cool.</v>

159
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>It's wild.</v>

160
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just stuff that doesn't even seem like,</v>

161
00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.741
<v Speaker 1>like again,</v>

162
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>if that was in a movie and be like,</v>

163
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

164
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>they put a fucking billboard right next to the apartment and he'd be like,</v>

165
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.471
<v Speaker 1>no way man.</v>

166
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:05.771
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

167
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:06.604
<v Speaker 1>Make it down the street.</v>

168
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>That would still be something.</v>

169
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

170
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>and it would be like a conspiracy theory.</v>

171
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

172
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 1>he fucking course.</v>

173
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>He told them he wanted the billboard above his old apartment.</v>

174
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.751
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

175
00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>it's the comedy central bill,</v>

176
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>but they bought it like five years ago and they've been putting stuff up there.</v>

177
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.231
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

178
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>You lived there way before that.</v>

179
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.643
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

180
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Do it that,</v>

181
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.021
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

182
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:26.471
<v Speaker 1>it sucked.</v>

183
00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Also walking under it going like,</v>

184
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.684
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

185
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

186
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 1>show billboard.</v>

187
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I wished I could get one one day.</v>

188
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.293
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

189
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking crazy</v>

190
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.121
<v Speaker 2>be alive.</v>

191
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:36.954
<v Speaker 2>That must've been,</v>

192
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.640
<v Speaker 2>you have to give him to religion or die</v>

193
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.910
<v Speaker 2>easy and she shows you that people have always had that weird desire to have</v>

194
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:51.810
<v Speaker 2>everyone else think exactly the way they thought and it makes them feel more</v>

195
00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:52.350
<v Speaker 2>secure.</v>

196
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.183
<v Speaker 2>Christians,</v>

197
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.230
<v Speaker 2>more Christmas.</v>

198
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.990
<v Speaker 2>It's more Christians.</v>

199
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Jews actually never proselytized don't.</v>

200
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.631
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing,</v>

201
00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.020
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

202
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

203
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

204
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Because your religion,</v>

205
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.141
<v Speaker 2>it's silly.</v>

206
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Is anybody else's based in the same things?</v>

207
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

208
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 2>it was a question.</v>

209
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.990
<v Speaker 2>How come they figured out to like keep to themselves and you don't have to do</v>

210
00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:07.560
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

211
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.640
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason you should.</v>

212
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.661
<v Speaker 2>If you want to,</v>

213
00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:10.081
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

214
00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:11.190
<v Speaker 2>but we're not going to try to push it.</v>

215
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:11.401
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

216
00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:12.234
<v Speaker 2>do whatever you want.</v>

217
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.051
<v Speaker 2>But time of David,</v>

218
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:13.740
<v Speaker 2>they outlawed it.</v>

219
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.573
<v Speaker 2>Outlawed conversion.</v>

220
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

221
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.373
<v Speaker 2>It was too popular.</v>

222
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.401
<v Speaker 2>Too popular.</v>

223
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:18.360
<v Speaker 2>But he wanted to be a judge.</v>

224
00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:18.661
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

225
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:20.880
<v Speaker 2>because it was like they were the ruling party really.</v>

226
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

227
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.740
<v Speaker 2>So they outlawed it.</v>

228
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.510
<v Speaker 2>So they said no conversion during this time.</v>

229
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.600
<v Speaker 2>God for how long was your no,</v>

230
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.241
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

231
00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:27.701
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking,</v>

232
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:27.831
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

233
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

234
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.131
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to do that.</v>

235
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:30.050
<v Speaker 2>You have to ask a bunch of times.</v>

236
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm just hanging out.</v>

237
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't like these people to that.</v>

238
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Most of the whites.</v>

239
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.551
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be that.</v>

240
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Every,</v>

241
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.523
<v Speaker 2>you pretty much have to do that.</v>

242
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.460
<v Speaker 2>The Rabi I'll tell you like,</v>

243
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:38.821
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

244
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:39.301
<v Speaker 2>don't do this.</v>

245
00:05:39.301 --> 00:05:41.420
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do it really any big macs.</v>

246
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.181
<v Speaker 2>We can't just trust me.</v>

247
00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:45.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do those 20 big macs if you're had Judy can't eat big MACs,</v>

248
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.793
<v Speaker 2>religious Jew,</v>

249
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.180
<v Speaker 2>you know you're supposed to eat hamburger.</v>

250
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.751
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

251
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:49.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not pushing me.</v>

252
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 2>And it's cheese on there too.</v>

253
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

254
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.340
<v Speaker 2>so just that in general.</v>

255
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:55.500
<v Speaker 2>But you could have kosher beef burgers.</v>

256
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>You could have a kosher beef burger with soy cheese.</v>

257
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.611
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

258
00:05:58.611 --> 00:05:59.444
<v Speaker 2>the cheese.</v>

259
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 2>What does it,</v>

260
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 2>you can't combine milk and meat.</v>

261
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.294
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

262
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 2>What's that all about?</v>

263
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much a stupidity.</v>

264
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 2>It's just like all the religions.</v>

265
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.323
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

266
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.670
<v Speaker 2>it's based on a passage that says you shall not mix the meat of the mother or</v>

267
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 2>the milk of the milk of the mother with the meat of the calf.</v>

268
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

269
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Horn instead or anything else?</v>

271
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Some sex tech that just to be that it's,</v>

272
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 2>it's that actual mother and calf.</v>

273
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

274
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.041
<v Speaker 2>but that's the case.</v>

275
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you get the milk from the mother and then kill the mother and he heard</v>

276
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 2>some milk of the mother and the meat of the mother.</v>

277
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>

278
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.861
<v Speaker 2>I don't run it.</v>

279
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:31.101
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

280
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

281
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.460
<v Speaker 2>They just no meat and milk.</v>

282
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.431
<v Speaker 2>You have to wait.</v>

283
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 2>If you eat pizza,</v>

284
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 2>you have to wait 30 minutes for you meet.</v>

285
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 2>What are the odds though,</v>

286
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 2>if I have a fucking piece of meat that the nugs going to come from the same?</v>

287
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.661
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

288
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:42.021
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

289
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 2>They said that means they said that passage means don't mix it two at all.</v>

290
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.011
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

291
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:46.731
<v Speaker 2>Linen and cotton.</v>

292
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:47.564
<v Speaker 2>You can't mix.</v>

293
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

294
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.303
<v Speaker 2>but you can't.</v>

295
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.671
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

296
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 2>if you have a,</v>

297
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 2>if you have like a a woolen the linen,</v>

298
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

299
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 2>If you have a wool jacket,</v>

300
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 2>you can't have linen things tying in the buttons cause that's evil and you'll go</v>

301
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:01.200
<v Speaker 2>to hell for now.</v>

302
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 2>My favorite one.</v>

303
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 2>My favorite one that you told me to this day was that you were told that when</v>

304
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:07.250
<v Speaker 2>you masturbate for that,</v>

305
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 2>people don't really know.</v>

306
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Ari grew up extremely religious to the point where he lived.</v>

307
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 2>You lived on lives in Israel and your show for two years.</v>

308
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

309
00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the Torah all day long.</v>

310
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Nine p on the 10 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM I mean dad is,</v>

311
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 2>that's some pretty intense shit.</v>

312
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:27.760
<v Speaker 2>And they told you when you masturbated that you were impregnating a demon and</v>

313
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 2>let's just say you're on your back lying down.</v>

314
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 2>They didn't really do positions back then in our shower anyway,</v>

315
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:34.251
<v Speaker 2>but when you're doing it,</v>

316
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 2>some demon comes and like,</v>

317
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 2>she's like a round you fucking you as you're fucking your hand.</v>

318
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

319
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 2>And then you make like demon babies and they have some writer uses the phage.</v>

320
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 2>There was some like maybe Dean Koontz sh everything.</v>

321
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Coons use it in a movie or some deep know in a book.</v>

322
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>

323
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 2>some demon was like writing them and had anyway,</v>

324
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 2>but then you get her pregnant and she has babies every time you do that.</v>

325
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Every time you're 100% as babies.</v>

326
00:07:58.971 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Never going to be one on earth.</v>

327
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 2>They only live in this demon world and Delta formed and gross.</v>

328
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

329
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about this.</v>

330
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 2>And then when you get to go to heaven,</v>

331
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:07.574
<v Speaker 2>when you die,</v>

332
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 2>you have to meet those demons.</v>

333
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

334
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:10.581
<v Speaker 2>And they got,</v>

335
00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Why dad?</v>

336
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Why couldn't we born on the regular planet?</v>

337
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

338
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Why are we like this dad?</v>

339
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 2>So did you masturbate to,</v>

340
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:19.701
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

341
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 2>even knowing all this,</v>

342
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 2>and what did you think was,</v>

343
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:24.291
<v Speaker 2>was this going on?</v>

344
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Why you were living in this like really religious environment?</v>

345
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 2>You were asking me and you never saw him masturbating.</v>

346
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 2>You never stop.</v>

347
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

348
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:29.991
<v Speaker 2>I slowed down.</v>

349
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was evil for doing it.</v>

350
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

351
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

352
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 2>so you're doing this,</v>

353
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 2>you're there 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM did you think,</v>

354
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:37.820
<v Speaker 2>well that part's bullshit.</v>

355
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.200
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

356
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.700
<v Speaker 2>you're studying like this intense religious,</v>

357
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.121
<v Speaker 2>well there's,</v>

358
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:42.150
<v Speaker 2>I think there's two types of scents.</v>

359
00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:42.461
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>

360
00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:43.870
<v Speaker 2>This is how it is since 2000 since there,</v>

361
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:45.290
<v Speaker 2>since you plan out and say fuck it.</v>

362
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

363
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with that.</v>

364
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 2>And this types like gossip where it just happens.</v>

365
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.520
<v Speaker 2>You're not thinking about it like fuck,</v>

366
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have done that.</v>

367
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

368
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Talking about about somebody's masturbation is one that it just overcomes you,</v>

369
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's one,</v>

370
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.360
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's one that you do plan out cause you could just not do it this time.</v>

371
00:08:59.380 --> 00:08:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

372
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 2>you accidentally touched it.</v>

373
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Women I don't think have the same.</v>

374
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:02.841
<v Speaker 2>It's not theirs.</v>

375
00:09:02.841 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 2>They don't have that backup.</v>

376
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 2>You know women want to have sex,</v>

377
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 2>they get itchy.</v>

378
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.860
<v Speaker 2>They want do they want it to be touched?</v>

379
00:09:08.861 --> 00:09:10.020
<v Speaker 2>They want affection to get horny.</v>

380
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.530
<v Speaker 2>But we have like a backup of sperm where like your Dick is like,</v>

381
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

382
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>

383
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like you got to get rid of this shit.</v>

384
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

385
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 2>We can't even think you can sour milk from everywhere here.</v>

386
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Come on Jesus.</v>

387
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 2>What did you,</v>

388
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 2>when you beat off did you like fuck?</v>

389
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 2>What about those babies?</v>

390
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Did you believe that part?</v>

391
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 2>That part was more like fables is wasn't like the written Toro was like this is</v>

392
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

393
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 2>this is what like the extra curricular,</v>

394
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:38.130
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

395
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 2>So when would they bring that up?</v>

396
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 2>How'd you they barely brought that up.</v>

397
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Did they bring it up in class ever?</v>

398
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

399
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:44.051
<v Speaker 2>it would come up.</v>

400
00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:46.720
<v Speaker 2>We're in discussions with rabbis who studied all that stuff that the,</v>

401
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>

402
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 2>the Zahar Zahar when just like the mystical book,</v>

403
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 2>but you're not supposed to say that until you're married and 35,</v>

404
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

405
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Second Mystical Book and said you can't sell it until you're married and 35 at</v>

406
00:09:59.951 --> 00:10:00.784
<v Speaker 2>least set up about it.</v>

407
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 2>It's got all the stuff about ghosts and weird shit.</v>

408
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Ghosts does go Siemens crossing dude,</v>

409
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:08.611
<v Speaker 2>Judaism.</v>

410
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like fun.</v>

411
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.171
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like fun.</v>

412
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:10.501
<v Speaker 2>Literate.</v>

413
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to read it very much.</v>

414
00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I never read the translations.</v>

415
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.321
<v Speaker 2>I was just so hard.</v>

416
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should read it.</v>

417
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Can you get it online?</v>

418
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Can you babied by now?</v>

419
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 2>It's probably all written down somewhere actually,</v>

420
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.490
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it would be the exact language.</v>

421
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:21.710
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't get that from transaction.</v>

422
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:22.643
<v Speaker 2>You look at clothes.</v>

423
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

424
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.451
<v Speaker 2>There was this piece,</v>

425
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 2>there was this one piece and a in the Talmud,</v>

426
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 2>which is like a respect to like you're supposed to study apart.</v>

427
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.701
<v Speaker 2>And they said this,</v>

428
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:30.030
<v Speaker 2>rob,</v>

429
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.531
<v Speaker 2>this rabbi,</v>

430
00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:35.531
<v Speaker 2>I went to his students who were living in like a dormitory altogether because</v>

431
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 2>there was a snake or a dragon that was attacking them every night and killing</v>

432
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:41.634
<v Speaker 2>his students.</v>

433
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.490
<v Speaker 2>So he had his sleep and only the rabbi,</v>

434
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 2>it was one who gets to feed it.</v>

435
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:47.250
<v Speaker 2>So he had to sleep under one of their beds,</v>

436
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

437
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.830
<v Speaker 2>so that he could kill this dragon.</v>

438
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.893
<v Speaker 2>It was a dragon.</v>

439
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.320
<v Speaker 2>And I asked my rabbi about that.</v>

440
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:52.531
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

441
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this all about?</v>

442
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.233
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

443
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 2>it's my way.</v>

444
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.061
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

445
00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Does not seconds dragons.</v>

446
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:00.300
<v Speaker 2>This is all under this bed to suck your cock.</v>

447
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:01.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I killed the Dragon.</v>

448
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:01.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

449
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 2>He said there was a rash,</v>

450
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 2>there was a rash of jerk offs going on.</v>

451
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 2>And the only way that he did,</v>

452
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.970
<v Speaker 2>they can't really write that out in the Talmud.</v>

453
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.230
<v Speaker 2>So they had a metaphor.</v>

454
00:11:10.231 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 2>It was a rash of jerk offs.</v>

455
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:12.690
<v Speaker 2>And the only way I could stop it.</v>

456
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:14.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a rabbi hiding under the bed saying,</v>

457
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.713
<v Speaker 2>I call you.</v>

458
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.040
<v Speaker 2>You're masturbating.</v>

459
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

460
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:22.750
<v Speaker 2>So the dragon that was killing off the children was just them masturbating,</v>

461
00:11:22.751 --> 00:11:24.030
<v Speaker 2>desire to masturbate.</v>

462
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

463
00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Their spiritual selves.</v>

464
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

465
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:28.920
<v Speaker 2>That's Hilarious,</v>

466
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Mia.</v>

467
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.390
<v Speaker 2>But it's not written.</v>

468
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 2>That metaphor is not explained.</v>

469
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

470
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:37.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just assumed and you have to ask someone who understands the tax or Rashi,</v>

471
00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 2>but it looked quite stuff about it.</v>

472
00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:39.690
<v Speaker 2>If you can understand that.</v>

473
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.371
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy,</v>

474
00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:40.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

475
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.011
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

476
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:42.510
<v Speaker 2>how would that in the future,</v>

477
00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:44.130
<v Speaker 2>people would just think it's just craziness.</v>

478
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:45.370
<v Speaker 2>This was an oral tradition too,</v>

479
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.500
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't even written down.</v>

480
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Someone just had to tell you that story.</v>

481
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

482
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what they wrote down when they thought they were going to lose it all.</v>

483
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

484
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.733
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

485
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

486
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.660
<v Speaker 1>is a great fucking story,</v>

487
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I think to be making that up,</v>

488
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:57.454
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really not.</v>

489
00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

490
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.730
<v Speaker 1>We're so crazy.</v>

491
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Have you had your man period lately?</v>

492
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.200
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

493
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.500
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

494
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 1>And I have this theory that when we shit,</v>

495
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 1>then it's all bloody in there that it's possible that he does it.</v>

496
00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 1>At the same time like it's based on the moon.</v>

497
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.151
<v Speaker 1>How often do you guys,</v>

498
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 1>shit when you get the one year,</v>

499
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.330
<v Speaker 1>shit happens,</v>

500
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 1>happens every couple of months.</v>

501
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 1>It goes for like a week week.</v>

502
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Those are the hemorrhoid thing.</v>

503
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

504
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And then you wipe and you just like,</v>

505
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.951
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

506
00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm still wiping a lot of shit.</v>

507
00:12:26.961 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

508
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.381
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

509
00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 1>it's just soaking red blood.</v>

510
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:29.291
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

511
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:30.041
<v Speaker 1>There's no shame in it.</v>

512
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Die On your hand and go straight through the toilet paper.</v>

513
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.490
<v Speaker 1>You guys both need to go to a doctor together and find out what aliens are</v>

514
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:38.110
<v Speaker 1>raping you in the [inaudible] Shit study.</v>

515
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what you a fucking camera over your bed.</v>

516
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what really watched aliens come in the room and take you through the</v>

517
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:45.080
<v Speaker 1>walls in the middle of the night.</v>

518
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Return you later.</v>

519
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes when you stand up at your toilet seat.</v>

520
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Looks like Dexter,</v>

521
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:49.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

522
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.131
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

523
00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:51.690
<v Speaker 1>like the blood spots that you know from.</v>

524
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.380
<v Speaker 1>It didn't go in the water if you have too low and if you guys are both shit,</v>

525
00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 1>not that much blood.</v>

526
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

527
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.143
<v Speaker 1>I mean it pours.</v>

528
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.060
<v Speaker 1>It's the warmth.</v>

529
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like a warm faucet,</v>

530
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.510
<v Speaker 1>just take a beaker and turn it over real beaker and turn it over like about that</v>

531
00:13:05.511 --> 00:13:08.900
<v Speaker 1>amount of the shot for the shot girls.</v>

532
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Those like about that much water.</v>

533
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Not something to be proud of.</v>

534
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 1>You guys are both really sick.</v>

535
00:13:13.991 --> 00:13:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

536
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 1>You okay over there?</v>

537
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Are you and I in the same boat?</v>

538
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you this though.</v>

539
00:13:18.321 --> 00:13:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I did have a massive diarrhea problem last week.</v>

540
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.590
<v Speaker 1>It was really worst diarrhea problem a long time.</v>

541
00:13:24.591 --> 00:13:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I do not know multiple days or one diarrhea multiple days.</v>

542
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was a stomach cold.</v>

543
00:13:29.661 --> 00:13:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was something that I ate that didn't agree with me but it was</v>

544
00:13:32.931 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 1>like one day I had a headache and my my,</v>

545
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.531
<v Speaker 1>I was like wow,</v>

546
00:13:36.531 --> 00:13:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I feel so I think it's like a food poisoning issue cause I had an ha a headache</v>

547
00:13:40.281 --> 00:13:40.701
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

548
00:13:40.701 --> 00:13:41.061
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

549
00:13:41.061 --> 00:13:41.894
<v Speaker 1>I feel weak.</v>

550
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.950
<v Speaker 1>It was the Hannibal.</v>

551
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.701
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

552
00:13:43.701 --> 00:13:44.534
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>

553
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.433
<v Speaker 1>Definitely for that.</v>

554
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it was.</v>

555
00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

556
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.300
<v Speaker 1>no it was,</v>

557
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.480
<v Speaker 1>it was post ham but I hadn't eaten a ham for days.</v>

558
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.530
<v Speaker 1>But it definitely wasn't that.</v>

559
00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:55.160
<v Speaker 1>It was something that it had I think that day or before that day anyways,</v>

560
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.150
<v Speaker 1>diarrhea.</v>

561
00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness mean it was more than a week after I'd eaten the Ham.</v>

562
00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Now that I think about it.</v>

563
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Did you mix it with the regular dump and have like a no dude,</v>

564
00:14:04.521 --> 00:14:05.354
<v Speaker 1>it was just over the,</v>

565
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.180
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened or whatever was going on inside.</v>

566
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.370
<v Speaker 1>My stomach was converting everything.</v>

567
00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I ate into this liquid and I didn't even make sense.</v>

568
00:14:14.361 --> 00:14:15.860
<v Speaker 1>It was like defined physics.</v>

569
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:16.850
<v Speaker 1>How solidified was it?</v>

570
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.290
<v Speaker 1>It was water.</v>

571
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:23.210
<v Speaker 1>If you dropped it on a UN inclined table at a 40 degree in client,</v>

572
00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:24.500
<v Speaker 1>would it go straight off the table?</v>

573
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Take a minute to go ride like a fucking great wave straight through great brown</v>

574
00:14:29.931 --> 00:14:31.250
<v Speaker 1>wave of destruction.</v>

575
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.851
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

576
00:14:31.851 --> 00:14:32.601
<v Speaker 1>It would rumble.</v>

577
00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:34.400
<v Speaker 1>My stomach would rumble and then I would go,</v>

578
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 1>oh shit and I'd have to really bathroom.</v>

579
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.801
<v Speaker 1>Then I'd get to the,</v>

580
00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:39.350
<v Speaker 1>and I would hold it up in commercials like listen,</v>

581
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

582
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.750
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I was brave enough to fart.</v>

583
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.100
<v Speaker 1>There was no way.</v>

584
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.640
<v Speaker 1>There was no way cause I would get into that tub or get it all over the bowl</v>

585
00:14:46.641 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 1>rather and it would just hear whoosh,</v>

586
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

587
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 1>just water tub shooting out of my ass.</v>

588
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

589
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Complete water for like two days and then it became like very untrustworthy</v>

590
00:14:59.151 --> 00:14:59.984
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

591
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel solid swarth day.</v>

592
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

593
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.230
<v Speaker 1>And I got hemorrhoids.</v>

594
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:11.231
<v Speaker 1>I had to go get preparation h oh no I bought squeezing it and pushing it,</v>

595
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:12.860
<v Speaker 1>trying to get it to come out for so long,</v>

596
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 1>which is really bad.</v>

597
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Pushed air bubbles into your asshole.</v>

598
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.041
<v Speaker 1>Well I think,</v>

599
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:16.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

600
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 1>squeezing your ass like that,</v>

601
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 1>trying to poop is very bad for you.</v>

602
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to do that.</v>

603
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's apparently one of the things that causes hemorrhoids.</v>

604
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Log dumps.</v>

605
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.041
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

606
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:26.960
<v Speaker 1>but the preparation h is a mother fucker dude.</v>

607
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Cause one day of that cleared it right up really,</v>

608
00:15:29.101 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 1>really quickly to get the cooling like cool ranch.</v>

609
00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 1>When are the cool</v>

610
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.250
<v Speaker 1>for cool ranch sense?</v>

611
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Smell refreshing.</v>

612
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Find out people are like putting it on food.</v>

613
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.790
<v Speaker 1>You can't eat that sir.</v>

614
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:42.710
<v Speaker 1>It tastes just like it.</v>

615
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Preparation h measured preparation h was totally edible.</v>

616
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

617
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it does it,</v>

618
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.320
<v Speaker 1>it really works good at fixing any sort of a hemorrhoid situation.</v>

619
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:54.381
<v Speaker 1>He got down there,</v>

620
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:55.670
<v Speaker 1>they went away like within a day.</v>

621
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.890
<v Speaker 1>But man for fucking days,</v>

622
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.650
<v Speaker 1>four days of totally untrustworthy shits,</v>

623
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.980
<v Speaker 1>the pasty shit where it's like you could spread it on brick.</v>

624
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh I could spread it.</v>

625
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it was like leaves in there and shit cause I still eat healthy but it was</v>

626
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:10.310
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of liquid.</v>

627
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It was some sort of a stomach bug,</v>

628
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

629
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.331
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

630
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:18.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any idea where it came from food or whether it came from just</v>

631
00:16:18.651 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Speaker 1>catching a cold and you know,</v>

632
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:22.460
<v Speaker 1>that this cold manifested itself as a stomach bug,</v>

633
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it was,</v>

634
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:24.261
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

635
00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:26.780
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy for a few day and I felt real weak.</v>

636
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd go to pull my bow back and it was like kind of difficult to pull the</v>

637
00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 1>bow back.</v>

638
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're waiting from stumping.</v>

639
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

640
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I was weak.</v>

641
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I was weak.</v>

642
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Like I would like pick things out having,</v>

643
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:38.751
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

644
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:39.321
<v Speaker 1>I could feel it.</v>

645
00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:40.154
<v Speaker 1>Her friends.</v>

646
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

647
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.130
<v Speaker 1>definitely dehydrated but also just I wasn't eating right.</v>

648
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Like I was scared.</v>

649
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:44.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

650
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't getting hungry either.</v>

651
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was eating right in that I was to having like lettuce and salads and</v>

652
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:50.691
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that,</v>

653
00:16:50.691 --> 00:16:52.010
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't eating very much.</v>

654
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't eating like,</v>

655
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:53.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

656
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 1>like light meals during the day because my stomach was so untrustworthy.</v>

657
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:57.760
<v Speaker 1>When that happened with diarrhea,</v>

658
00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.640
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

659
00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 1>What's happening?</v>

660
00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.751
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man,</v>

661
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:02.210
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it was just digesting it just too much.</v>

662
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I would eat like a steak.</v>

663
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:06.560
<v Speaker 1>I would have steak and some salad and it would turn it a water.</v>

664
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Like how does steak and a salad become?</v>

665
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean my,</v>

666
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.480
<v Speaker 1>my body was liquefying it and they would come out just whoa,</v>

667
00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:15.550
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

668
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.110
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

669
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.270
<v Speaker 1>is it too much stomach acid that just breaking down and write everything and Mel</v>

670
00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:19.850
<v Speaker 1>session,</v>

671
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the process.</v>

672
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I should probably know that you should have shut shit on your hand a little bit</v>

673
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 1>and sort of smelled it right then and see if it was that well,</v>

674
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I took us some on it.</v>

675
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Enzymes on enzymes are all in a digestion on it.</v>

676
00:17:31.111 --> 00:17:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Pippy piles.</v>

677
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 1>That's how it got me out of it.</v>

678
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.413
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

679
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I just had to do the time.</v>

680
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I just had to let my body process.</v>

681
00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It sounds you just drink a lot of water put in the Reps.</v>

682
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

683
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:40.820
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

684
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely thinking that I was probably getting dehydrated from,</v>

685
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I was like so much water's coming out of my ass like I better make sure I just</v>

686
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.510
<v Speaker 1>drink a lot to go with it.</v>

687
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.321
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

688
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Does your hemorrhoid it happens is do you even feel that the hemorrhage,</v>

689
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:52.810
<v Speaker 1>cause I can still feel it.</v>

690
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's like,</v>

691
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 1>oh I still have,</v>

692
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 1>there's still some stuff I've got to wipe off really like,</v>

693
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.040
<v Speaker 1>oh it's just my mind.</v>

694
00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Just a little while.</v>

695
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.480
<v Speaker 1>My bleeds I go away cause like a giant tour.</v>

698
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:08.130
<v Speaker 1>It feels like what leads out.</v>

699
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.390
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even feel anything.</v>

700
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:10.050
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

701
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.560
<v Speaker 1>that's that wheel that exploded inside or isn't it in a way inside.</v>

702
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:14.091
<v Speaker 1>Don't even feel it.</v>

703
00:18:14.091 --> 00:18:14.924
<v Speaker 1>Mindset.</v>

704
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 1>They're a diet that you can take stops that from happening.</v>

705
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Probably stopped behind hemorrhoids.</v>

706
00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Finding foods.</v>

707
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Stop eating from Jack's</v>

708
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>lodge up inside your anal binding foods and stay away from them or eat a lot of</v>

709
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:30.181
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

710
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it is.</v>

711
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh well you should probably know it's one of those two.</v>

712
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 1>So rice was in that group.</v>

713
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Binding foods are definitely away from him or keep eat a lot of them.</v>

714
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't really go by the regimen,</v>

715
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.450
<v Speaker 1>but if you do do that it would help prevent hemorrhoids.</v>

716
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

717
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:46.950

723
00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:51.444
<v Speaker 1>Research?</v>

914
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.750
<v Speaker 1>showing these guys and you just didn't want them to fuck somebody else in the</v>

915
00:23:31.751 --> 00:23:35.110
<v Speaker 1>meantime and then while I'm waiting to side some other guy's life is ruined.</v>

916
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well I heard this is the Mesil suck it up and take my lumps also on the other</v>

918
00:23:39.611 --> 00:23:40.120
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

919
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I figured I could tell them I'm 90% sure it was like a cop out.</v>

920
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not like fully saying,</v>

921
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:44.201
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

922
00:23:44.201 --> 00:23:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I have it.</v>

923
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 1>We fucked.</v>

924
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I thought that,</v>

925
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

926
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.050
<v Speaker 1>from what I understood when I got tested was that you can only test herpes while</v>

927
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 1>the outbreaks happen.</v>

928
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Then the act actually spoon a little out of the outbursts that you can't really,</v>

929
00:23:56.271 --> 00:23:57.830
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to test for herpes.</v>

930
00:23:57.831 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of times you can get tested during like not an outbreak and be like,</v>

931
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:02.121
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

932
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:02.450
<v Speaker 1>And you wanted,</v>

933
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 1>which was positive for herpes?</v>

934
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

935
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it was an old tests.</v>

936
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that was like 15 years ago.</v>

937
00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:07.304
